Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This review is dedicated to my friend Gary who died of cancer.

He introduced me to this game and I have a big soft spot for its simple mechanics. Its easy to pick up and difficult to put down.

This game only came on Steam a year or so ago. We played the retail release. This new version adds Twitch support and is a lot more friendly to modern systems and resolutions. I've not clocked long on it mainly due to the bitter sweet memories. I like the units in this game. My only complaint with this has been that there could have been more nations to choose from. But that is minor. Its right up there with Age of Empires et al.

Goodnight Gary. I'll keep winning for you.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
One of the best game revivals.

RoN became very fast my favorite strategy games once it got released at 2003 and later with its expasion at 2004. I love it as it consists of gameplay of all eras. Starting with your slignshots and swords, and improving until you get missiles and stealth bombers.

It's story is quite good and reminds you of the glory days with some great battle. Multiplayer is one of its best elements. Playing with your friends co-op versus with AI or just an all out battle! Customise the teams as you want and also the battle's options like map size, technologies and winning methods.

Now let's talk about Extended Edition. <---Skip here if you just want to learn the differences.
The game graphics look quite similar but definitelly smoother. You can feel the overall gameplay and animations of the charaters being so smooth while moving and fighting.

Multiplayer is here once again with leaderboards! As gamespy is dying the game now has multiplayer once again and better than ever! I am hoping to see an ever bigger map though and more units instead of just 200/300. I bet it wouldn't be much of a problem nowadays with the new updated and powerful computers.

Twitch! Do you like streaming and showing off your gameplay? This will be very handy for you. Log in, hit the record button and show your fans all your strategy tactics on how you beat your opponent!

The only downside for me is that the game looks quite similar, yet some small very handy improvements will make it quite better.

Bigger maps, yes bigger than Big Huge. People using the editor can remake their countries and some of their battles with a proper big terrain.

More units! Setting the unit price to lower and having more units in battle will totally increase the fun of the game.

More players? With bigger maps, more players can be added as well. 12 or something like that.

Overall?
If you liked the original, you are gonna like this one as well.
If you haven't played the original, then if you like real time strategy games, you are gonna love it too!

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
These nations are extremely balanced:

-Russia has increased attrition within ALL borders.
-Egypt has EXPONENTIAL food/wonder bonuses
-Bantu have an AMAZING population perk.
-Chinese can create citizens INSTANTLY.

-Romans save 25% on a fort.

10/25%off Would play as Romans again.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
It's like Civilization and Age of Empires had a baby and Steam just now got around to sending out cigars, even though the kid's like 10 now.

Cool kid though, great game!

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This is my favorite game of all-time. This was one of the first games that I bought back in 2004 (Gold Edition) and still played it before the release of the Extended Edition. Every RTS lover should play this game. 

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
One of best strategy games ever.
+ Multiple Nations
+ Multiple army (foot, water, air, rockets!)
+ Great economic system
+ Ages (ancient, medieval, age of gunpowder, industrial (like WW1), modern (WW2), information (Don't worry no cosmonauts or futuristic ts just you can research very good things like immediately spawn soldiers and so)
+ Extended Edition
+ Graphic
It's like Age of Mythology (well at least authors are same) but very different. Here you can be in age of Enlightenment as Japan or Russian or Mongol (it's upt you)

- Can't defeat my brother, whatever I do

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise of Nations has been my go to" game for many years when I wanted a challenge
without a lot of story line investment. It's great to kill an hour or an afternoon

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is just as good as I remember it

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
So.  Back in 2003 I played this game.  My brother and I managed to hook up a dial up internet connection, and would spend quality time annoying each other or fighting alongside each other. (Often in the same match) and would build these massive empires and crush the opposition.

With the slow death of GFWL, and the modern computer making older games hard to play I lost track of this game.

Enter the modern age.  Some wonderful person decided to rip the GFWL garbage out and make it play nice with Steam.  Once again my urge to drop nukes on my brother took over.  Once again I watched in horror as my brother dropped nukes on his own cities just to wipe out my army.

10/10 would create the holocost again.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Realised I was losing. Nuked the world into armageddon rendering everyone a loser.

10/10 Would lose again

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
+ Border lines help to navigate differing territories, plan new settlements with a more informed approach, and investigate spheres of control; the restrictive aspect of this feature also serves to deter early rush tactics and general griefing
+ Zoom feature helps to navigate terrain and keep track of movement over large swathes of territory
+ The diplomacy options play out as more than a gimmicky feature, and are both simple on paper and functional in practice
+ Time restrictions during campaigns add to the challenge in a way that is rewarding if successful
+ Have seen some before and after stills, it's clear that the visuals and textures are noticeably improved; this should further appeal to veterans of the franchise
+ The re-release now supports Twitch integration; I don't use the feature myself, but this is still a significant boon for the streaming community
+ Features a satisfying variety of playable cultures, each with their own defining traits
+ The trategic overview map is a nice feature, and consists of a simple, turn-based Risk-style map; some notable features include: bonus cards you can apply, resource bonuses, diplomacy, and varying types of battles that hinge on several factors
+ Impressive array of options and game-modes available for multiplayer, many of them quite novel for an RTS game (although they're not quite as alien for other strategy sub-genres)
+ Attrition and supply features are a nice addition, and do well to keep one prepared and on their toes during offensive engagements
+ Excellent sense of balance in all aspects
+ Special units are presented well in the game and don't feel overpowered or cheap in their use

- The overworld strategy part of the game feels a bit watered down compared to other staples of the genre; it isn't necessarily bad, but it's also clear that this feature was never meant to be the bread-and-butter of the franchise
- The AI feels a bit underwhelming, and I had expected more of an improvement for the re-release

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Aww yeah, it's finally out on Steam, RoN was, and still is one of the best RTS games made.  Highly recommended for RTS fans, it still holds up very well, and has gotten some extra polish. :)

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I love this game because its perfect for sore losers.
losing? just build 15 nuke silos and make everyone lose

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Me and my mate thought it would be smart to build our docks around the back of our islnds, because the AI, like the Age of Empires II AI, wouldn't be smart enough to look back there.

They were swftly demolished.

9/10 Verdic: You must stop him

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
When I played RoN for the first time on around 2004/5 I was really impressed with the number of upgrades that this game offered to me. I was doing building of many types of units which have their own abilities and specialties. The number of research that I could do was mind boggling and are very effective while winning a game. This game , to me, redefined the genre RTS. So without any further delay let me review this game quickly....

Game Play :
As anyone can understand the game play is fairly complex due to number of different units , number of different resources and the number of different buildings with different research items. But RTS is all about complexity. You build up your game slowly and nicely (the way you see it fit the objective) and then in a single master stroke your complete your objective(s). Most of the missions are timed which means that you have to achieve victory within a stipulated amount of  real time (say 90 minutes). Usually I find this time to be more than enough but at time to time (specially with rising difficulties) you may find it a bit more challenging.

In SINGLE PLAYER Campaign you can play different scenarios (more in number in extended edition) or you can play the age old classical world domination. MP is also there and somewhat active in nature - but you must play good and I mean REAL GOOD to win MPs. The statistics from the game engine that comes out after the game is pretty impressive, you could even get a stats about your right and left clicks in the entire game as well....

Graphics:
Even if the game is from 2004 the graphics is stunningly detailed. If you zoom a bit you can see - the seas are having waves , the crops in the farms are swinging with the wind current and what not. From RTS perspective the details is very high (some people may not say its good but I actually liked it). The different models have their different behaviors.

Over all this detailed graphics adds a nice touch to the entire gaming experience.

Controls:

Controls are fairly easy to understand and its better to have the shortcut keys known to yourself - they will help you greatly in the MPs. mouse clicks are pretty consistent but in my slower GPU the scroll rate for the map was a bit jaggy.

For a comprehensive basic guide I recommend   this. .

Misc:

In other features - the game now have integrated Steamplay, Twitch,  Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards to increase the game experience even more. The Extended Edition also includes the Thrones and Patriots expansion , the HD models.
Overall the game gets a thumbs up from me.

Hope you will enjoy the game as I did.

//I killed them all anyways.

No regrets.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
One of the better RTS games out there.It comes with tons of nations(each one has some unique national powers and units) and many different gameplay mods so that anyone can enjoy it.
Only thing I dislike about this steam port is that the game was a bit rushed and its multiplayer suffered slightly from a few annoying bugs(most of them were eventually patched out but a few still remained...), rather than these few remaining bugs I fully recommend the game to everyone.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition

Hiroshima/10

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
A solid, enjoyable, and accessible RTS with equal playability for combat and econ/tech.

RON is a multifaceted real-time game with well-implemented resource gathering and tech dimensions, in addition to the industry-standard combat elements. It's customizable enough so that a newcomer or veteran who would rather not worry about tech, econ, or combat can disable those elements in the starting menus.

There are six economic resources in the game (three of which appear after appropriate research). Most combat units, buildings, tech, and upgrades cost one or two types of resources. They also tend to increase in cost the more of the same unit/building you have already built, which encourages players to diversify their buildings and units rather than just rebuild one type over and over.

Combat units usually adhere to a rock/paper/scissors balance mechanic, although at later ages there are a decent range of specialized units that accomplish unique functions in warfare. Controlling a battle group is relatively intuitive - command buttons on the console also show shortcuts for the more-familiar player, and extra modifiers such as facing, General craft powers, and terrain also allow modest benefits for the detail-oriented player.

Each nation has its own special powers, which lead to interesting matchups (although at higher levels of play, certain nation powers mandate a narrower choice of strategy than others).

Those already experienced with RTSes can expect to jump right in and get playing against the AI competitively, and then jump online to test their skills against humans. This game may be a steeper learning curve for newcomers to the RTS genre because of its breadth of econ, tech, and military.

Players who like modding their games will also find this game rewarding and versatile, including the ability to mod entire campaigns and to create new units in the game's .xml files.

An excellent balance of accessibility and complexity. My favorite RTS game.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This game is better than sex.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I love Rise of Nations, it's one of my all time favorite games.
I would recommend this to anyone, it really is an awesome game! Don't hesitate buying it!

UPDATE: After spending so many hours playing this Extended Edition, the only bug I've encountered was the lack of audio after alt-tabbing in the first day. But a patch was already released on the second day and I haven't had any issues with the game since.

This is a must own for any strategy fans out there. Especially if you like a bit of historic visual art which you can manipulate in real time. Steam Workshop is coming soon, too.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This will forever be one of my favorite RTS games of all time.  I've played Age of Empires, Starcraft, and Warcraft III, but out of those, this game is still better in my opinion.  There are so many ways to set yourself up, and so much micro-managing to constantly keep you focusing on your resources while also controlling your expansive army.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a real-time strategy game from SkyBox Labs and previously Big Huge Games, published by no other than Microsoft Studios. It's a perfected version of Rise of Nations and Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, all with new Steam features like achievements, cloud saving and more.

Like many Microsoft games remake, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition retain exactly the very same gameplay and features from the previous 2 games, everything combined into a single game. If only like Age of Empires 2: HD Edition, the population limit is increased, this game might worth more. At least we get to see the old Conquer the World campaign along with the Thrones and Patriots new campaign such as the Cold War. For you who haven't play Rise of Nations before, the gameplay of this game is very good, start with a single city, build a library, college, market and expand your city, then build more cities and expand your empire into a great nation. Victory can be achieved through conquest, science or in this game called tech race, building wonders and there are more win condition for custom play.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition graphics are, well, it's said that the water and textures has been improved, and there is a new anti-aliasing effect, but me personally didn't see that great differences from the previous Rise of Nations, or maybe it's just been far too long. The graphics are classic, but good, very good, I'm not saying it's bad, it's just kinda still old. The performances are good, no lags or any kind of problems.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition however, have many room for improvements, if Microsoft really care. Maybe a DLC? Bad idea for most but at least there is an addition, maybe new unique units, new unique unit models for each nation (seriously, Russian launching F-18 Hornet from their carrier?), new campaign maybe the Roman campaign or something, even maybe new nation? Expansion Packs?

Like many other too, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition has the Steam workshop support for community made custom content like maps, scenarios, even mods.

But overall, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a great game, very fun and with the new Steam features, even better. I recommend this.

Rating 9/10

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I THOUGHT WE AGREED NO NUKES

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
10/10 - Best $5 Spent In My Life this game is taking over my life, help me

This game was worth every. single. penny. I debated on if I should get it or not for a while, I watched some gameplay and talked to some people that owned the game since I've never actually played any RTS games. (well one, Nemesis of the Roman Empire, but that was way back then)

I've played Civilization V and probably some other Civilization when I was younger but I forgot which one it was. :P Anyways, this game is almost PERFECT for me. Almost because they could add some small features here and there, but it's not a big deal. The only bad thing that has yet to happen was my laptop shutting down mid-game, but I think it over heated haha.

What is this game like? If RIsk and Civilization were to become RTS games and have a potato, this would be that potato. If Windows 95 became a RTS I would eat that potato. Potatos are good for your health. Thank you based potato. Great game don't see why you shouldn't buy it. Multiplayer has ranked matches, even a lobby chat on the game browser. It's pretty active if you're a multiplayer type of person.

Thank you based Microsoft.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
A fun and challenging RTS with a very good price while on sale. It offers challenging play, gameplay that differs from other RTS, loads of civs to play, nukes, and amazing soundtrack (seriousky, I would buy this game just for the music, it's that good), multiplayer, streaming for all you streamers, a wide tech tree, a 'risk-like' world domination mode, campaigns, quick and useful tutorials, a huge amount of game setting customization, wonders, huge battles and many, many more features. Also it comes in a huge bundle pack so you can get other great games like AOE2 and AOE3 with it!

BOTTOM LINE:
Buy it f you enjoyed other RTS games like AOE2, preferably when on sale (because who doesn't like a great game for 5 bucks), get your friends to buy and nuke them to awesome music

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
The question on most of the minds of people who played this game:

Does it hold up?

Yes.

Unlike Age of Empires II which, in my opinion, sadly doesn't stand the test of time, Rise of Nations is every bit as fun and engaging as it was more than ten years ago. It's also still a bit of a mess in its late game moments, which I'll address a bit later.

First off, for any new players donning their commander cap for the first time, what is Rise of Nations? It's best described, I think, as a cross between Age of Empires and Civilization. It is a real-time strategy game, first and foremost - worker units are recruited and instructed to gather the expected resources in food, wood, gold, iron, and later oil. They'll also construct military barracks, universities for gaining knowledge (which you'll spend to research technologies and advance through the ages), castles and forts for locking down territory, and perhaps most importantly of all - cities.

You'll begin the match with one city. Structures like temples and forts will push your borders out a bit for you, but the only way to really expand your territory effectively is to build new cities. You can then recruit from your new city more villagers, which will proceed to build all the same farms, temples, lumber mills and schools you constructed at your first city - and eventually, you'll start the whole process over again. There's a great sense of satisfaction in watching each of your cities grow from a humble huddle of townhouses to its full sprawl of market, temple, barracks, school and more.

Cities, as I mentioned, expand your borders, which are important primarily due to unit attrition. You can move your workers and military units within your own territory unfettered... but set foot on enemy lands, and you'll notice a red glow pulsing at their feet and a health bar that will slowly begin to dwindle. Supply wagons can be built, and as long as your units are within its effective range, they can pass into enemy lands without fear of damage. Should your wagon(s) be destroyed by the enemy, your units will immediately begin taking damage over time. In this sytem of attrition and supply, Rise of Nations creates a very unique combat game that can force the retreat of a march larger force or encourage players to slug it out along borders where they can effectively fight without fear of attrition.

As stated above, you'll progress from the sticks and stones of the ancient world on through the crossbows and knights of the middle ages - the tanks and bombers of the World War II-era modern age, ending finally in the information age, where stealth bombers and ICBMs run amok. It's exciting and interesting to see what units will open up to you in each era, and every civilization has several unique units available to it throughout time that inject enough variety to encourance players to give them all a try.

As I also stated above, the end-game of Rise of Nations is definitely its greatest weakness. One would expect the introduction of fighter jets, bombers, nuclear warheads and rocket artillery to be pretty exciting, right? Well, it mostly ends up creating a huge mess of a battlefield where's it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on, who's killing who, or what's best effective against what. As nuclear warheads begin to drop and level cities, and certain technologies completely remove the wait time for recruitment (meaning you can keep clicking the Rocket Artillery" icon and it will keep building them click after click after click instantly)

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I played this game when I was very young, so I undoubtly am biased to the game due to nostalgia. The gameplay itself is still very challenging and complex, especially managing the resources and multi-tasking armies, like most other RTS games.

Rise of Nations won many awards and presents execellent gameplay strategy and tactics due to it's realistic resource/market system. There's not many things that bring me more satisfaction than managing to get my resources going really well, and building up huge armies to invade enemy lands. The game itself is very complex, and with higher difficulties vsing the computer, it becomes very hard to win. The online in this game isn't very great, so I'd suggest playing 2v2 with bots when playing this game. Although you might think you'd feel like a loner, you definetely won't when you're managing an entire country, negotiating with your ally and crushing the enemies.

The five main campaigns in this game is also superb. You could play as Napoleon, conquering europe by playing very fun and interesting scenarios, such as when you gain a few armies to invade a whole heavily guarded Egypt (10/10 historical). The graphics aren't that bad either, considering that I'm very picky on graphics. There are over 40~ countries to play as in Rise of Nations, each of them with their own set of unique powers and units.

Overall, this game still remains a great RTS, with challenging and rewarding gameplay. There's no better feeling than managing to take over two countries via a huge campaign of sieging while the AI on your team does nothing but take the brunt of the enemy's force.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise Of Nation is like an old friend who I might not see for half a year, but when we hang out, it's like nothing changed.

Oh hey RoN

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Let me tell you my story about this beautiful game. One day as I was browsing through the store of steam I was thinking to myself about life and the meaning of it when all of the sudden I saw this game. An unknown force took control of me as I clicked to purchase this game, and procceded to type my debit card information and part of my soul into the computer. Once the sacrifice had been completed I joyfully clicked the library button to download my new game, but I stared in tremendous horror as the download button was missing. I searched through the darkest points of the internet to find a cause to this nightmare to find that the game was to come out later this month. Throughout the month I've been preparing for the coming of this game, by sacrificing goats to the Microsoft gods, so when the game came out they would already be pleased with my actions. My parents took notice of this and sent me to therapy, saying I had a problem and that I needed Help" but I knew that they were blind to the greatness this game would bring. Finally the day came for me to finally download the game I awoke at 4 A.M. to download the masterpiece Microsoft presented

I played it when I was 13 years old, I still play it (i'm 25 now)
That's how good this game is. Its the highlight of RTS!

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
You're looking at a game which I've had the fortune to play since it was released in 2003, and which has never lost it's capacity to create superb gameplay. It is, naturally, better with friends - as most things are, except perhaps murder. Multiplayer on this game, especially with a tight group of close friends with whom you can have plenty of banter, just about beats every other RTS hands down. The thrill of armed combat across an enormous map (or Big Huge map as the game calls it) is gripping, and the delicate but simple mechanics of the Rise of Nations economy, and the associated feeling of a build up towards greater things" (the Modern Age

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This game is basically the child of Age of Empires and Civilization.
The nations are all very unqiue, and I particularly like how they don't have just standard skins in late game. If a faction historically died out before a certain age, they design the units to fit how the creators thought the faction's troops would have looked.
This game has everything I loved about the Age of Empires series, and throws in Air combat and missiles. What's not to love?

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Old but gold. One of my favorite strategy games of all times.

Pony Island
So I bought this game because I don't really have anything better to do. Sure, it is a kids' game, and sure, it is five dollars for what would normally be five dimes, but it's actually a really solid game. I mean, come on, you get to play as a pixelated pony! How cool is that! And the controls are really tight, too- the mouse-only take on jumping and blowing away butterflies is great if you're in the same boat as me and sacrificed your keyboard and soul to the glorious Lord Satan. A really enjoyable experience, definitely a ten out of tSOMEBODY HELP ME BEFO





















Pony Island
Pony Island is an interesting game.
Levels are a bit repetitive at first.
Eventually you get powerups.
After that, it gets more interesting.
Some of the levels get pretty tricky.
Early on, all you can do is jump.
Hovering is added a bit later.
Enemies come at you every few seconds.
Left mouse button to jump over obstacles.
Push enemies away with right mouse button.
Make it to the flagpole and you can advance.
Every so often you get a Puzzle Break"
It's kind of like a programming puzzle.
A butterfly is trying to get to its house.
Moving arrows around defines a route.
The butterfly follows the arrows.
Reach the house to advance.
Anybody can learn this game.
Please give it a try.
Play it right now.
E  verybody.

If you're reading this review; stop, scroll up, don't read any more reviews, don't watch the trailer or read about the game, just buy it and play it and don't stop playing until you finish the game. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.

Pony Island
The one game I uninstalled out of sympathy.

10/10

Pony Island
Ignore all of the hype and play this game because it looks intriguing. That's exactly what I did and I loved this game. The scares in it are never really enough to classify it as a 'horror' game, but damn it is creepy. The way that the game uses fourth wall breaks to spook you is excellent, and there's a certain scare late in to the game that completely blew me away.

Seriously, check this game out if it looks even a little interesting. Chances are you'll probably see the 'twist' (if you can call it that) coming a mile away, but that doesn't ruin the experience one bit.

Music is pretty good too

Pony Island
Come along you won't regret.
Going to Pony Island yet.
Take my hand it's a wild ride.
On this game which you should buy.

Pony Island
The best Christian game for kids 8 and under.

10/10 - will uninstall again.

Pony Island
This game is amazing! It has a retro feel and very challenging if your not so great at puzzles. This game I rate:

10/10 - Making you think it's a Cheerful game!
10/10 - Satanic Ritural
9/10  - Taking over your friends list and having a friend comment about your word choices!

Overall 10/10 would worship satan with ponies again!

i can't believe satan is a ing brony

Pony Island
***Warning*** Minor spoilers!

It has been a while since a game has had me 'wtf'ing' all over the place, but Pony Island brought it back to life. This game is genius.

Storyline: Basic breakdown is that you are trapped within some funky arcade machine that has gone vicious thanks to the devil himself deciding to be a programmer. Take the cover of the game.. Take what you expect the game to be and throw them out the window. Already as you begin, it's clear that something isn't right - Having to fix a broken and glicthy menu from the get go before you're able to commence the gameplay is a sign that the devil may not be as good of a programmer as he likes to think.

As the cursed player of this hellish demon-game, you get whisked around from a chaotic, glitchy, broken world to a cutesey, diabetes-inducing pastel nightmare, with random logic puzzles thrown in, to fix Satan's buggy code. As you guide your pony through the devil's glitchy game, you can catch brief glimpses of who your character used to be before they were killed and trapped in the game. The story is gritty, blurred and as twisty as the day is long. Basically, it's fantastic.

Gameplay: I feels as though I had to make an extra section *just* for gameplay because it's honestly that damn good. The ingenuity of the puzzles, the level designs and the text communication alone make it note worthy. Pony Island as a whole is magnificent and shows incredibly unique ideas put together insanely well. When something like this, running on such simple mechanics can set an atmosphere so well, it raises the bar for many other games to do the same.

Also! Passcodes to keep tucked away until needed; Baphomet and 2023

Graphics: The look of it makes it feel like a genuine ported arcade game. It's pixely, it's box-like, it's all kinds of good while been fairly simplistic.

Menus: Broken because of Satan.

Soundtrack: This goes from being an eerie and abrasive glitchy, retro, electronic style base for the tension and horror-ish atmosphere and then completely flips a coin to be colorful, cute and innocent with its uncomfortably cheerful electronic notes. The changes in this set the scene and is yet another thing that makes this game so unique, it's unlike anything you've heard before.

Final Conclusion: Get this. Seriously. It's rare that games can really spice things up with something new. With that been said, unique ideas are one thing, but it's the fact that they are brought together well that makes Pony Island stand above the rest. It keeps you thinking, provides great atmosphere, keeps you on your toes and has so much hidden content perfect for those willing to look for it.

Pony Island
> It is not a game about ponies

Well DUH, it's about unicorns. Should've just call it Unicorn Island or whatever.

Still a good game, though.


Pony Island
Pony Island is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible, just know the game is about a couple hours long to beat normally, there's hidden collectibles that unlock the true ending, the base gameplay is a Runner-type of game with a few twists, and it plays with the idea of game development.

Now slight spoilers ahead, but I'll try to avoid any major spoilers, just things you could figure out from the first 30 minutes of play.

The idea of a 'corrupted' video game is not an original idea at this point, but this may be the best it's been executed thus far. Pony Island has you playing a corrupted Runner-type game starring a Pony, and the game at various points wants you to stop to Insert Your Soul

Pony Island
This game is really quite a gem.

I picked it up on a whim at full price because it looked mildly interesting from the screenshots. However, what I discovered underneath the poorly-coded pony facade was something else. Something sinister.

The atmosphere that this game creates is definitley uneasy. The music is top notch and reminiscent of the games of old and the attention to detail really stands out.

The developer did a superb job making the machine feel like its own independent entity. I found myself staring blankly into the computer screen at times just watching, waiting for it to reach out to me.

Would sell soul for 3d graphics. 666/10

Don't read anything about Pony Island. Just buy Pony Island and have a fun evening.

Pony Island
TL;DR: 4/5 score. Neat story, interesting puzzles and elements. Great music. Got $5? Worth.

You start up the game and immediately are confused by the title screen. So you took action and begin playing the game. You play as a happy little pony, where you are galloping across the field and jump past the fences, in hopes to beat the game, only to find out that something is wrong with this game called 'Pony Island'.

It's hard to give a good review of this game without spoiling what it really is about. That being said, I would advise to go in blind (no playthroughs/walkthroughs), as you will find to be more satisfied of the game but I'll try my best to make it short and sweet while not including spoilers in here.

The game isn't really scary (except maybe for some that were really looking for a 'pony adventure' game) but the 'psychological horror genre fits, as it does makes you think. The game isn't very long, I would say that the average one would need to complete the game would be around 2 hours. However, it makes up for it by introducing neat new elements as you progress, like 4th wall breaking interactions, new puzzle elements, and more interesting secrets to discover.

All in all, I think this is one of those indie games that stands out and for the right reasons. Good story, interesting gameplay, good music (at least I personally think so), and cool game elements. The game doesn't cost very much, so I would say that it's very much worth for the price.

Pony Island
A unique experience. You don't play Pony Island, Pony Island plays you.

I don't want to say too much about it, but this game absolutely blew me away. Full of constant surprises, very atmospheric, and left me unsettled even after finishing it. It's only $5, and that's $5 well spent. Just buy it and play it. The experience is well worth the price.

4th wall breaking simulator

Pony Island
When the devil comes to gaming, it will not be under the banner of pentagrams, demons and blood. It will be in the guise... of a pony.

After repeatedly having to fix the arcade machine that houses PONY ISLAND's game-within-a-game by re-routing code and battling mysteriously uncooperative menus, you will be faced with a monochrome fence jumping simulator designed by the Devil himself to keep you in a Matrix-style state of placidity while he attempts to harvest your soul.

If that opening spiel seems simultaneously baffling, disturbing and blackly humorous then I have succeeded in communicating the beautiful madness of Pony Island's struggle to escape an almost perfect trap; as soon as you start to succeed at the game, your unholy adversary changes the rules by bombarding you with unkillable demons, reinventing his tedious jumping simulator as a full-fledged adventure game or unleashing his vicious lieutenants upon you, at least one of which is genuinely unnerving.

While it has a tendency to overplay a few of its puzzles, the astonishing imagination, wit and variety you'll encounter in Pony Island make it nothing short of an essential part of 2016's library.

Pony Island is a unique and eerie experience.

The game starts off with you trying to play Pony Island". The start button doesn't work

Pony Island
I won't get into too much details, because this game is more about exploring and finding things out for yourself than anything else. It is indeed a puzzle game in disguise, with some arcade/action parts.

Long story short:
* Saw it on Steam, thought Meh

Pony Island
Best $5 game I have played

666/10

Pony Island
I've just finished this, and I'm still questioning what's real and what's not - that's not meant to be a funny joke, it really messed with my head. Buy it!

Pony Island
I literally cannot write a good enough review for this game.
Words cannot fathom the enjoyment I received from it. I finished it in a little over 2 hours and have been waiting to go back and play. I really just wanted to create a positive recommendation for this for anyone who hasn't experienced it. Don't watch and game play videos, or read anything about it...it'll all just spoil the fun.

Just buy it, and play it.
I can't recommend this enough.

I wish the ending were a bit more enjoyable, but the game is great overall especially when NO I'M NOT GOING TO SPOIL IT FOR YOU. JUST GO PLAY IT! :-)

Pony Island
Has anyone seen my soul? I lost it somewhere and can't find it.

Not what I was expecting at all. And that's great feeling! Like you suddenly entered a good trap.

UPD: I'm still not sure if I really closed the game. I even uninstalled it, but still not sure.

Need for Speed: Shift
An excellent balancing act between arcade racing and simulated driving, with shudderingly fast cars. I'm addicted to it!

Need for Speed: Shift
daily reminder that matte black paint and bronze rims will make your car go faster no matter what

Need for Speed: Shift
Pros :
-Nice graphics
-Cars are detailed af
-Tons of car choice
-British guy in tutioral and later
-Tries to be a a real racing game but with finally a good handling and succeds
-Soundtrack


Cons :
-NFS never should have been a real racing game
-NPCs are 
- line
-If you alt tab or something puts the game down there, the whole game closes itself



This game is an actual lie, I have a brand new BMW and can't get a girlfriend -1/10

Need for Speed: Shift
A good balance between a racing sim and arcade. Need for Speed Shift is all about racing on a racetrack, and fighting through the pack to place in the Top 3. There is also drift mode, where you score the most combined points in three rounds to win. The driving physics are decent, not too bad, but not great either. There are a good selection of cars that you can own (although it sucks that you can only buy 1 unit of each car) and a range of real world tracks (Nurburgring, Spa, Silverstone, etc.). Those make a pretty good legal racing game.

The annoying thing is cheap AI in car battle mode, especially in Autopolis GP. They can just tackle a tight hairpin (turn 4) at 100+ km/h without understeering... Also, there are some unfair car battle matchups, when 1 car is a lot faster than the other (Audi R8 vs Aston Martin V8 Vantage for example) and no matter how good your driving is, you'll still lose in the slower car (unless you play dirty).

Overall, it is still a good racing game to play if you are looking for a mixture of simulation and arcadey style of racing.

Need for Speed: Shift
Awesome graphics and visuals, detailed 3D cockpits, a bunch of cars and amazing car and engine sounds.

Need for Speed: Shift
This isn't really necessarily a review, but more of a comment between Shift 1 and Shift 2.

I honestly prefer this other than Shift 2 probably because they don't try so hard to be a racing simulator. This game is a mixture of a racing arcade/simulator. Shift 2's racing and flow was just not up to par with this. The racing in this game it actually FEELS really good. The cars look beautiful. The cockpit even more beautiful. If you're not satisfied with a car or part you've just bought you can just SELL it and get every single cent you've put in that car. UNLIKE Shift 2. Oh yeah, that reminds me too, money in this game isn't hard to get. You can get a nice amount each race if you know what you're doing. They even give you cash for custom/free races that you setup yourself. And the fact that you can get a 100% refund for your fully customized car feels good. I don't have to worry about wasting my time putting blood and sweat into a car that I probably can't use 60% of the time due to tiers and specialized events. The engines, transmission, skidding etc all sound amazing in this game.

The customization is pretty in-depth giving you the option to go up a tier if you have all of your tiers vehicle enhancements. Which is AMAZING because you get to bring your favorite vehicle to more races. What saddens me is that the game doesn't have any night races or courses. Well, at least from what I've seen. This game also encourages ramming and playing clean. You get points which gives you bonus money and experience for playing either aggressive or clean. Yeah, pretty ing ironic mainly because in Shift 2 they try to act like the game also encourages ramming with their spectacular Shift 2 announcement trailer. (No really. I really loved Shift 2's trailer. It was amazing.) But really you couldn't do none of that ramming  in Shift 2 without crashing your  into a guard rail. I'm not a Shift 2 hater at all. I actually do like it and think Slightly Mad Studios did a good job with it. Especially with the head-cam which I wish this game had, but it's just that this game is better in many other aspects and ways than Shift 2. I also like the in-game trailers showing off each type of race event in this game. The music in this game is good  too.

The AI in this game aren't really that hard to handle. I haven't really tried max difficulty to know though. Also the replay camera in this game is INCREDIBLE. It really gets you into the spot when you see yourself in a TV like position racing across the screen. I think this game has the best replay camera for any racing game I've seen.....Well, maybe not better than Assetto Corsa's replay camera. I think it's because the sense of speed on camera is set perfectly to make you feel like you're actually watching someone race. But yeah, overall. The game is totally worth it. You won't regret it. Also, don't think I was talking down Shift 2. I just think this game is just superior to its sequel in many ways.

Need for Speed: Shift
Physics is very questionable.  The cars bounce like low riders for no particular reason.  The steering is also very twitchy.  I have gone through all the adjustments to try and fix this but it just can't be dialed in quite as good as Codemaster games.

You can say that the AI cheats.  Cheating is when you don't play by the rules for the purpose of winning.  That is what I noticed.  You have to follow a very specific driving line in order for you to make it through a corner.  The tighter and faster you go, obviously you would understeer and slam into the wall.  Well the AI does not do that.  The AI will also swerve left and right while making a tight turn to block you from passing.  Then there is the collision system.  The AI can slam into you and you are then taken off the road and it would take you quite a while to get back on the road.  You would have lost several seconds and would probably cost you the race.  Now if you decide to pit the AI cars, it won't have any effect on them.  They will not slow down.  In fact they would retain the same speed and jump back on track half a second later.  It is such bull crap.

I'm not really that bitter since the game only cost me what a nice sandwich would.

If you want realism, stick with Codemaster racing games.  This is a minimally decent attempt at simulation.  But the Need For Speed series should just stick to arcade style racing.

Need for Speed: Shift
Fun arcade racing game with tiny dabs of realism. I have no idea why it's marketed as a racing sim because it's really not. The physics are a little wonky and the bloodthirsty AI are liable to  the bed and turn any race into some Wacky Races t. I've played Namco racers more realistic than this.

Buy a god machine GT-R and win all the races to make Nakamura proud.

Need for Speed: Shift
A Need for Speed game set on circuits rather than streets.

Need for Speed: Shift is a somewhat okay racing game aimed mostly at the people who prefer sitting back with a controller just driving some fast cars around fast tracks with all assists turned on. I can imagine it does a pretty good job at that.

But if you jump into it expecting something more, you're in for a big disappointment. I wouldn't even go as far as calling it a mix of an arcade and a simulator because it's a pure arcade which stays true to the Need for Speed name. The game revolves around ramming into each other, the AI is bad and so are the physics, the controls are poor all the way from the menu to the game itself and the unnecessary blurry speed effects and the deep voice-over about how you're a totally cool driver now don't really save this title - only make it more cringeworthy.

Now I'm not trying to make it look as bad as possible. The game is all good as an arcade, is pretty nice to look at, there's a lot of cars to pick from and you can customise them to a certain degree. And obviously I would be stupid to expect realism from a Need for Speed title. I just don't think it deserves to be promoted as a simulation experience.

Need for Speed: Shift
I bought this, on sale, as i enjoy racing games though i didnt have any on PC. I Chose this one for a number of reasons. First of all, i used to play some sort of Need For Speed on PlayStation 2 and it was my favorite game. I also bought it for the system requirements. It runs flawlessly on my laptop (A10, 8GB) and im yet to test it on my media PC (A4, 4GB).

The game is fun; it makes you want to keep on playing. It's just one of them games you could play for hours. The graphics are great especially for a game this age. Of corse it's not the most recent Forsa but in my oppinion the graphics are perfectly fine. There is plenty to do in the story mode, i have yet to try multi-player.

One minor complaint: the controles on keyboard and mouse are just not that good. This is the case for ALL racing games, not just this one. I would reccomend picking up a controller if you dont already have one, it makes a huge difference!

Need for Speed: Shift
Need For Speed Shift is one of my favorite racing simulators.
Pretty Graphics
Many Cars
Good Driving
Fine-Tuning
Nice Soundtrack
Leveling

This game is amazing!

Need for Speed: Shift
By far, this is one of the most realistic racing games I have ever played.

Although the physics at drifting events are weird, this game overall presents itself in the best shape with a good amount of cars, awesome graphics, good sound quality and solid physics.

With a controller, this game is much more fun than playing it with the keyboard, and definitely gives you the feeling of actually driving the car! It's definitely an experience to be done.


Or tl;dr:
CRASH BANG BOOM WON THE RACE

Need for Speed: Shift
nice game.
nice griphics, LOTS of cars, lots of tracks, nice effects... I like this game

there are some annoying UI things, annoying intros" but that is minor.
I have some problems with drifting (at G25 wheel) which was easier on keyboard.

thing is

Need for Speed: Shift
I didn't think I'd like this since i'm such a fan of the street racing in the first 2 NFS games specifically 2, But this was incredibly fun, ran fine, looks great, plays great *with a controller since that's what i used*. 9/10 would bang

Need for Speed: Shift
For a 2009 title Shift holds up incredibly well. It both runs and looks fantastic on Windows 10. It offers up quite a lot of gameplay for the price, with a nice array of cars and tracks, all constructed to the highest level of detail possible at the time. Gameplay is fun and fast-paced, but don't believe the marketing. It is an arcade racer through and through, not a sim. Career mode progression also relies on an inferior and clunky arcade style unlock system, where you are forced to earn stars to unlock future events with some fairly ridiculous side objectives (spin-out 4 opponents) forced upon the player. Overall Shift is a really solid arcade racer, if you accept it as such, you'll have a good time, but if you expect this to be a sim, you will be sorely disappointed.

Here is my full in-depth review
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnR7ftTzHuU

Need for Speed: Shift
Easier to play than GRID but still a pretty difficult game. Probably the only NFS series that isn't arcade style racing and also one of the hardest NFS games there is. I have a lot of difficulty getting anywhere in this game but I'm not used to controls that arent arcade-like. THe customization of your car in this game is pretty good and it's deffinately a fun game to play.

Need for Speed: Shift
i misbought this game. installed it with the lowest expectation there ever was. and then when i played it (again,with the lowest expectation), i found this game is great. not perfect,but great. graphics are great. the cars are great. and i love the sounds in this game. loud. that's what i want in a racing game. i played it with a gamepad,which is a great way to play this game. so anyhoo,7/10.

Need for Speed: Shift
Summary.
A bad balance between realism and arcade.

The Good.
Great graphics.
Fun for the first few hours.


The Bad.

Menu with a controller is extremely clunky.
Because, unlike other NFS games, SHIFT doesn't bother to change menu buttons, like 7"

Need for Speed: Shift
Need For Speed is one of my favorite Need For Speeds. It has the customization that we all love. You may be able to only use body kits of 2 or 3, but the custom vinyls make up for it. You can buy custom performance packages for your car, and rims you probably have never even heard of! The tuning is amazing. You can turn your 425 HP 1969 Dodge Charger R/T into a 625 HP Charger that can drift with traction control on without the drift gamemode on. It has multiple controllers that this game supports. Everything from Logitech Wheels from a few years ago, to wheels from over 10 years ago. The graphics are amazing for the game, even though it was made in 2008 or 9. The sounds for the cars are not that bad for the year this game was made too ! Its not as bad as need for speed hot pursuit. I guess you can say this is the best need for speed that was made before criterion came in and decided to screw up everything with need for speed. Buy this game, and you wont regret it.

Need for Speed: Shift
Pretty nice game, tunning wasn't that nice but races are really great!

Need for Speed: Shift
not a fan miss the days of nfs underground


Need for Speed: Shift
Slightly Mad Studios ! Enought ?!

Need for Speed: Shift
I don't know why they call it shift, I can't figure out how to get a car with standard transmission.

Need for Speed: Shift
Different to any other NFS that I have ever played, more like Forza or GT.

Need for Speed: Shift
Awesome :3 very fun game

Need for Speed: Shift
Are you a forza fan who has sold lost lent or broken their xbox, look no further.
need for speed thift is the perfect alternative to the popular franchise forza motor sport considering the need for speed franchisehas become stale this was a more that welcome sight to our sore eyes need for speed shift adds alot of fun and interesting play mechanics to the game with simulated head movement as you drive makeing you feel evey turn bump and skip as you go this game is truly worth playing
i give this game a confident rating of 7.1

Need for Speed: Shift
Super addictive RPG style with awesome gameplay, physics and beautiful visuals ... 2nd installment is great as well :)

Need for Speed: Shift
This is a wonderful racing simulation for all ages. You can make it about as easy or hard as you want. well worth picking up.

Need for Speed: Shift
Shift is in my opinion the best racing simulation on the market. The original still looks good, and holds up well as an addition to Shift 2. I actually think I prefer Shift 1 to 2, but if you've played one you know the other. Both have very similar physics engines and feels. I love the integration of corner mastering too. The works upgrades make your favorite Tier 1 & 2 cars into powerhouses which lets you compete even an RX-8 well into the game - it's a well-balanced idea. Drift mode initially struck me as virtually impossible, but returning to the game a second time, it's actually quite a lot of fun (I recommend a Works'd RX-7 or, of course, the AE86). The game, in my opinion, has a greater depth than Forza, for example, and I'd even recommend Shift highly to someone with a 360/PS3.

Need for Speed: Shift
Great game, a lot more realistic than previous need for speed titles. Maybe thats why it didnt do as well with their fanbase?

Need for Speed: Shift
This game is great. The car handling, the visuals, the difficulty are spectacular. The opponents are not nearly as retrded as they tend to be in most racing games and actually provide a challenge. However, it has one major flaw. The NFS World tour (final tour) is unlocked midway through the game. With only 8 hours on the game I beat the tour, with half the events were still not done. But after the final tour is beat the temptation to grind the rest of the races is just not there. So I only got 9 hours out of this game. Still, it was very enjoyable. The unlocking system is flaud, but only a minor issue. If you're gonna get it - play all events first :)

Need for Speed: Shift
Best Need for speed game out there, excluding of course the good old days of Hot Pursuit 2, Carbon etc. Great combination of sim and arcade, buy this over SHIFT 2 if you have the choice!

Need for Speed: Shift
Great game! Realistic and fun to play! Much better than shift 2 in both graphics and gameplay!

Need for Speed: Shift
this is a pretty good game. the graphics are impressive and the game runs amazingly smooth even with my slower PC. the game also seems to be very responsive with the key board (which i have to resort to sence my steering set up is curently not functional at the moment.). the game has a fairly unique system for the Ai (at least at the time) and the enviroments, sounds, and so on really throw you into the racing expirience. the game does have a bit of issues like all the cars look like they are on ice in the 3rd peson view or chase cam and the Ai in the later teirs will end up hiting your car quite a bit. this game hasn't aged in the graphics or anything for that matter. this is just an amazingly uniqe game and i recomend you at least give it a go.

Need for Speed: Shift
it has cars and stuff.
it's pretty fun.
buy it I guess.

Need for Speed: Shift
My first racing game I have ever owned. I hugely recommend this. The handling is great, sounds are realistic and AI will give you hell sometimes. Solid 8/10.

Need for Speed: Shift
If you like having a huge dead spot in your steering, that you can't get rid of, this game is for you. Personally, I like a nice tight wheel. Like all of the rest of this series, this one is also next to impossible to control. Especially with a force feedback wheel. The only one in the series, that was half way decent, was the original. Every one since has had a lacklustre handling profile that takes any actual fun that might be had, and makes it a chore just to keep your vehicle going straight, or turning into corners, when you turn your wheel.

My suggestion is to save your money and buy something that IS NOT produced by EA Games. Remembering how responsive the original NFS was, this is a huge disappointment.

Need for Speed: Shift
Need For Speed: Shift is one of my favorite Need For Speeds. It has the customization that we all love. You may be able to only use body kits of 2 or 3, but the custom vinyls make up for it. You can buy custom performance packages for your car, and rims you probably have never even heard of! The tuning is amazing. You can turn your 425 HP 1969 Dodge Charger R/T into a 625 HP Charger that can drift with traction control on without the drift gamemode on, you can try to race in Bugatti Veyron or Zonda Pagani R, which are one of the best and expensive cars. The graphics are amazing for the game, even though it was made in 2008 or 9. The sounds for the cars are not that bad for the year this game was made too ! Its not as bad as need for speed hot pursuit. I guess you can say this is the best need for speed that was made before criterion came in and decided to screw up everything with Need for Speed. Buy this game, and you wont regret it.

Need for Speed: Shift
I honestly can't recommend this game. In the beginning I was enjoying it but the time exposes the weak gameplay and campaign.

Starting with the principal, I didn't like the gameplay, cars behave strangely and even by customizing options of difficulty and assistance I couldn't find a better way to get used to the drive mechanics and physics. The campaign started promising but became frustrating, there are a few extra goals that are impossible or don't make sense, and thus those who like to leave the game complete is frustrating, win races isn't enough, by the time I gave up and I just collect the stars needed to get to the last level and beat the game.

I positively highlight the licenses, there is a wide variety of vehicles and good circuits, although because of the gameplay and frustration with the campaign I could not fully enjoy this aspect.

I also emphasize that it's impossible to play on the keyboard, joystick or steering wheel is highly required.

6/10

Need for Speed: Shift
Better than GT 5.

Need for Speed: Shift
One of the only Need for Speed games that is still playable to date.

Need for Speed: Shift
This game blows my mind! Totally amazing and I have only just started playing it. Addicted.

Recommend it to anyone that wants a car racing simulator for PC, you can't go past this.

5 Stars!

Need for Speed: Shift
Better than GT 5.

Need for Speed: Shift
Pretty good if you want something realistic with nice cars, pretty bad if you want to wreck other cars or customize your own cars.

Need for Speed: Shift
Some of the worst physics I have ever experienced in a racing game. The series turned to garbage as soon as EA turned it over to new developers. There are much better racing games available for the same price or less.

Need for Speed: Shift
This is not your typical arcade racing NFS game, as it's about Circuit Racing.  It does not involve carnage across a city map, while being pursued by the Police, or jumping ten city blocks literally and making it without even a scratch.   With all the Driving Assists turned off, it is a real challenge to keep your car on the road.  This game is a brutal and solid racing car simulator. It will either make you throw your steering wheel in frustration, or you will never have this much fun again  once you get it right!  Most who play this game though, will probably be the former and not the latter  it's challenging.  NFS Shift is something special and is definitely worth having.

Need for Speed: Shift
I can recommend this game for anyone who enjoys:
* Amazingly  music!
* Headache inducing cutscenes that's unskippable! (Yes, they are loading screens, but they don't have to be so annoying, now do they?)
* Boring maps and gameplay!
* Griefing and cheating random gamers if you decide to go public!
Blown away by such aspects? Be my guest ;)

Need for Speed: Shift
This Game is freaking amazing, reminds me of forza motorsport of the xbox 360 & some gran turismo qualities.
This is NOT a TRUE racing sim YET"

Need for Speed: Shift
It is a lot of fun. Wish more people would play it!!!

Need for Speed: Shift
This is EA's attempt to copy grid basically.

Early Access Review

UPDATE:

Adding random generated dungeon did not saved this game.

The controls are still a pain in the , and most of the time, the maps are ridiculous. And since most of the time you will die for stupid reason, the absence of checkpoints makes the game even more frustrating then it was before.

This game is just a mess. I don't see how can somebody save it.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:

I wish I could Imagine a better game..

Imagine me is just one simple platformer. The concept looks nice I guess, but there aren't any interesting new gameplay elements. This makes the game flat.

The art style probably is the only good thing from this game. It's not new or mind-blowing, but looks neat at least.

Everything else is a huge mess: the controls are super weird, you never understand when you're gonna jump high or when you're gonna jump IN THE HEIGHT YOU WANT.
The levels are super easy. Really, no effort. Looks like a flash game from the early 2000s.

9 for this is a scam. I only have it 'cause I got a free steam key for it. And I beat all the levels in less than 20 minutes.
For now, don't bother spending on it even on a big sale. Wait to see if the game gets any better with the time.

Final Rating: 3/10

It has nothing to offer. Literally nothing. Except tons of achievement for just opening the game.

Imagine Me
Honestly, not much to see here. Run of the mill graphics, one weapon, 2 enemies. Random level generation, which in this case was a bad idea. PIts that lead to no where, locked doors leading to dead ends, and areas where suicide is the only way out.

Not worth it at full price. If you see it at 75% or 90% off however, its an easy game to 100%.

Its a shame too, as the dev seems cheery, responsive, and they do fix the bugs. Problem is, the game just isnt that good.

Imagine Me
From a somewhat decent little platformer, Imagine Me fell to a plain mediocre game.
Back one year ago, this game had pre-defined levels that were fun to play just to pass time. Now it has some badly designed generated levels. I often found myself playing the same level and it gets boring very easily.
I'd suggest the devs go back to the previous stage of the game and improve it.

Pros:+ The Challenge levels are pre-defined and were fun to play; it took me a short while to complete them all, but they weren't that bad;

Cons:- Generated repetitive levels, gets boring in a short while;
-Lacks initiative, there are only 2 types of enemies, 2 types of traps and 1 weapon;
-Boss levels are random aswell, many people complained that they had to play dozens of stages to finally reach a boss area;
-More soundtracks were welcome..

Conclusion:
I would recommend Imagine Me only if you really can't afford any other platformer out there. Even then, you would probably put it away soon. The gameplay lacks many features and I see no real reason to replay the game after you have finished it.

Personal rating: 30/100 - Awful

Imagine Me
It's probably the worst game I have ever played. I'm not talking about graphics and so on. The worst part is gameplay and levels' design. Challenges did not improve this game. They made it even worse.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

This isn't a game. It's a game engine test at best and the game engine is not good. The 'physics' are horrible making the very basic controls feel really off. The level design is absolutely generic with nothing that holds your attention. Same goes for the graphical presentation. This is what gives early access a bad name. Exactly this. Please do yourself a favour and avoid this 'game'.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I highly recommend avoiding this game. I got it for free from Alienware Arena and 100%-ed it in about 15 minutes or so. I spent another 5 minutes recording a video about why you shouldn't buy it. I'm actually a little annoyed that it will now show up forever in my game library. The ONLY reason I can see buying this game is at 95% off to get an easy 100% completed game. That's it.

Imagine Me
Imagine Me is agitated by its own existence. It cant decide where to commit, patching on modes of play like a bad worker trying to explain their way out of a botched job by showing you all the little, trivial tasks theyve completed instead. Right out of the gate Imagine Me tries its hand at procedurally generated level designs (it cant be that hard, right? Everyones doing it). But once the algorithms start rolling and the levels actually come into existence, its immediately clear Imagine Me hasnt the slightest clue what its doing.

Chunks of familiar levels become hastily adjoined to one another into an unplayable mess of broken hitboxes and impenetrable block mazes. Its chaos of the highest degree, silent caverns filled only with the cries of my broken soul as I beat myself against a metaphorical wall trying to beat a game which is quite literally impossible to complete. Somewhere along the development pipeline it must have been clear that something had gone horrible wrong, but rather than rework the disastrous level generator into something functional, Imagine Me instead decides to abandon it altogether and starts building levels by hand (it worked for Mario, didnt it?).

But much to my dismay Imagine Me hasnt much of a knack for level designs, random or otherwise. At numerous points it almost appears as if whoever actually designed these levels fell asleep and never completed them, or otherwise became so bored with their own creation that they decided enough was enough and shipped whatever they had in front of them at the time. And thus we are left with 30 or so astoundingly dull and simplistic levels which play very much like the afterthought they were.

I might feel worse about the depths of Imagine Mes failure if it didnt seem so apathetic toward aspiring to even moderate quality (or functionality). Everything feels empty and tedious, leading you in circles until either the game breaks or you stop playing. Imagine Me is sloppy and dysfunctional, but I couldnt say it seems to actually care.

You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Imagine Me
I really wanted to like this game, because the dev seems like such a great person, but the game itself isn't very good.

The game is constantly updating, which shows that the dev is working on making this a better game, but there are some bugs that make this not so much a great game. Controls feel generally bad, since there is a lot of random generation there are some poorly placed blocks (For example, a lock on a wall that leads to nowhere) Also, the campaign doesn't save, so when I Alt+Tabbed, the game crashed and I couldn't be bothered to start again from the beginning. Only 2 kinds of enemies and the boss is incredibly easy.

On the plus side, the game is an easy 100% if you're an achievement hunter.

Since the dev is working on the game a lot, I hope that I'll be able to switch this to a reccommended eventually, but for now I can't reccommend it.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I sincerely hope the creators of this game are at 10% completion, because that was really REALLY underwhelming. This is basically an easy-mode platformer with spikes and trampolines. That's basically it. I was excited to see portals and crates... but they didn't add any mechanic to the game worth mentioning. The boxes are pushable. Woohoo. I beat the entire game in about 10 minutes, and spent another 10 trying to figure out if there were any secrets or achievements hidden somehow, somewhere. Nope.

Be sure to read the memories, they add a story" to the game. [SPOILERS: You were a kid

Imagine Me
Imagine Me not having wasted my time.

This WAS good. Before the revamp, it was a fun little game with awesome devs. Now with it finally being released with a massive overhaul, it sadly stinks.
-Iffy controls
-Buggy hitboxes
-Random level generation (to the point that it is not completable)

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

This is not a good game.  Like many people, I got it in a bundle, so no real loss there, but if you are considering paying ten dollars for this, don't.  It's an amazing game for maybe a grade school student to make in their spare time, but has no business asking for money on Steam.  I really don't feel moved to rate games that often, only if I really enjoyed the game, or if it was so bad I feel the need to warn people, as if I'm being thoughtful or noble, but really, I just want help prevent games this bad from making money, so that people stop making games this bad.  Maybe it's hypocritical of me, being one of those people who buy bundles of crap just so my library looks swollen and engorged with gaming goodness, verily dripping fun, but two bucks for ten games at least gives me a fighting chance of finding something cool I never would have seen otherwise, whereas ten bucks for one game with a slew of negative reviews would be madness.  Madness, I say, and you are not mad are you?  I thought not.

Imagine Me
UPDATE:Wow. Decided to give this another try now that it's been released and somehow it got worse. The d-pad still doesn't work, which only exacerbates the problems with the new level design. The levels are extremely frustrating with lots of tight death traps to maneuver, and the imprecision of your movement makes this almost impossible. Try to do the same thing and you'll get a different outcome. It's almost like it's a response to the dearth of content in the original Early Access offering, by just stretching out the gameplay. I don't know how much content is there yet, but it's worse than what was there before.

It's also more about exploring than platforming skill, featuring large levels with items to pick up, but it doesn't really give you much incentive to do so. You can pick up keys to unlock boxes that don't hold anything or get in your way. Arrows can destroy some blocks, but usually you don't need to do that to progress. There's just no point to it, none of the platforming is fun, and I gave up after 20 minutes. I might give it another go later and try to blaze through it and update this review again or even rewrite it entirely, but wow, was not expecting to come away this underwhelmed at the full release. At least the price came down.

Original review:This is one Early Access game you should avoid, at least for the time being. The content in the game currently lasts all of 15 minutes, and none of it is any good. There are far better platformers out there with far fewer flaws.

First of all, one of my pet peeves surfaces in this game: it doesn't recognize the d-pad. For a platformer that specifically tells you to use a controller every time the game loads, this is borderline unforgivable. The platforming itself feels boring and uninspired, consisting of short levels with not much to do in them. Sometimes the jump decides it isn't going to jump today. The timing on getting a boosted jump from springs feels similarly capricious. The random level generator usually spits out unplayable garbage, and the actually developer-designed levels are so sparse as to barely be worth mentioning. The level select resets to the first level every time instead of automatically moving to the newly unlocked level, which is a minor annoyance.

In its current state, there is nothing that should compel you to spend $10 on this game. In fact, if you wait you'll actually get a better price, unlike most Early Access games which offer you a discount to encourage you to buy an incomplete product:
The price will be lower outside of Early Access. The game is currently priced higher. This is so no one buys the game without reading a little bit about it."

Don't spend money on this game right now

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I got this game through a bundle, otherwise I don't recommend spending money on it, yet.
What you see is what you get. Looks and feels like programmed in an 48h programming contest.
The music is nice, true... and a nice story.

But from the game mechanics perspective it's just a copy of a copy ... With a level design like this you can browse steam and will find lots of quality platformer much more worth the dime.
So far no fun :(

Imagine Me
The moment I started playing this game, I knew something was wrong. I went to look at the controls, and the screen came up behind the level I was on. THIS GAME IS CANCER. DO NOT BUY/PLAY.

Everything about this game screams 'baby's first programming attempt'. The game relies solely on randomly generated levels, which often contain impossible jumps and walled-off spikes, and offers little more gameplay than jumping (of which you can double-jump, but ONLY if you jump first - no fall-jumping) and shooting blocks to get to the end of a map. Enemies are little more than moving dangers - one hit of which will send you back to the beginning. Becareful of projectiles too, as hitting one (which kills you) will cause it to remain floating in the air, making some maps impossible to complete (as the stationary object will still kill you on touch).

I say this not out of spite - I know everybody has to start somewhere - but you can find better games for free on flash sites. Paying for this game would be a waste of any money. I can't remember how this came to be in my library - possibly by a Humble Bundle - but be assured that after this single sitting, I have no reason to ever come back to this poor excuse of a game.

EDIT 1: I finally made it to a level that was literally impossible to reach the end of. Luckily the developer foresaw this and gives you a 'regenerate' button on the menu. Known your generation system is that flaw to put a failsafe in is quite something. Oh, and I hope you like the first three bosses, because you'll be seeing them again.

EDIT 2: Having played two hours and 8 bosses worth of levels, the story (a scentence between levels) just loops, with no ending or purpose. They might as well be blank loading screens, as there is no payoff, no cohesive story, and NO END TO THE GAME. This is nothing but a worseless, waste of time. Yes there are challenge levels, they're nearly impossible to do.

This game is randomly generated. Infinitely long. Handles like . Campaign is too easy. Challenges are too hard. There are three enemy-types, which all might as well just be moving spikes. I have seen better games for free on Newgrounds, so do yourself a favour and give this a wide berth.

According to Steam, I have only played the game for 15 minutes. That sounds about right. During that 15 minutes I have played through the entirety of the game. I then quit, while scratching my head and asking myself What am I missing? There has to be something I'm overlooking here." After a little investigating it is clear that I did not miss anything

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

It's bad enough to come off as a lame way for someone to trick people into giving them money for something that is very broken. How hard it is to screw up basic platformer controls? I can't make games but I've managed to get righter controls from doing a tutorial for Game Maker that I never finished becuase I got lost from version differences.

I'll add some reasons why this is bad.

I've played a lot of platformers since the NES days. I love platformers. I'm not sure what this qualifies as. It seems extremely broken. Slightly touch the Right direction and you slide extremely fast to the right...right into a block...which kills you because there is a spike above it. Yes, above it. The hit boxes are so off. You die from spikes when you haven't even come into contact with them. You touch a block that has a spike above it, dead.

Something seems terribly wrong with the friction settings too. You completely stop moving when you come into contact with a wall. One might try to hide this problem by calling it a wall grab or something similar. A feature? LIsten, I know wall grabs from the many games that pull it off. This is not a wall grab.

Dev, if you used Game Maker for this, at least finish the tutorials on how to make a simple platformer.

I really hate to use such harsh judgements on a game, especially early access. But This game does not even seem to have the basic foundational mechanics working enough to be fun. That would seem to me to be much more important that getting a random level generator working, or spooky sound design, or story. Get the dang game working at least up to par with some oldschool Atari titles before passing it along to public.

I will gladly change my opinion of this game if the changes between now and completion are drastic enough in a good way. RIght now they would need to be extremely drastic at best.

I would never discourage one from getting into game dev and creating something fun to play. By all means make it fun. Have fun doing it. But when you get it released on Steam as Early Access for $9.99 in the currect state it is in it kind of feels like a slap in the face. I cannot recommend this unless I was trying to prank someone out of $10. (which I would never do)

P.S. It's really late and I haven't slept in ages. It's possible I'm over reacting and lacking in my ability to filter the harshness. But please put some effort into making this game actually playable and fun.

P.S.S. At least this game has a pretty title screen.

Imagine Me
The title screen and pleasant soundtrack were quite misleading. Incomplete looking graphics, controls that are barely functional, random dungeons that are completely illogical, unforgiving glitchy hit detection. This was all within 10 minutes. I don't know how this was considered finished.

Twelve minutes of playtime on this game and I've finished the ridiculously easy 'challenge' levels, played with the random dungeon feature which needs a lot of work, and created a 'memory' which isn't explained in the game but could be built into something interesting in the future.

As of right now, even for an early-access game, this isn't worth anyone's time.

- That's about it.

The baddies:
- This may not be correct, but the singleplayer had 9 levels, I think, and they're all too easy.
- In the store page, it says something about beat the levels any way you want". It's true but it's not right. At all.

Early Access Review

So I got this game for free from Alienware. The game in its current state is not worth 9.99 USD in 0.3 hours I completed all the challenge maps and got all the achievements. There are only 8 achievements and I got 2 within the first 30 sec of playing. There is random dungeon mode where as the name says, it will generate a random dungeon but really the game just feels lacking for it to hold your interest. It has potential to be a decent platformer and it is still early access but as it currently stands, the game is not worth the price. I'm only giving a thumbs down due to lack of content, really easy achievements, and the 9.99 price tag.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

This is probably the blandest platformer I have ever played. All levels fit on one screen, and objects are limited to blocks, spikes, springs, and occasionally a key. Gameplay does not vary at all between levels, and there aren't very many of them. The game also features a random level generator which spits out garbage that often is either impossible, or can be won by running to the right and jumping over one pit. The controls are bad, with it being difficult to guage the time you need to jump to bounce high off a spring, especially after they start sinking into the ground after you bounce on them a few times. The stats are completely broken, with the game awarding my the 50 deaths and 100 deaths achievements the first time I died, and the 1000 deaths achievement a few deaths, and less than a minute later. The game requires you to upload something to the workshop for one of the achievements, so expect the workshop to be flooded with garbage from people who just want the achievement.

I can't possibly recommend this unless you get it as part of a bundle, or it is less than $1, and you want easy achievements.

Imagine Me
So...I wanted to go through my Steam library to play games I had yet to play.
Well, I'm glad I went to this game first because I'm no longer going to play this game again.

I've made a few games for fun back in the days, self-taught. They were far better than this game. My games were simple, yet was fun. This game is boring.

There's not much of a reason to play this game. This game is too repetitive. The levels are randomized but practically all the same. There's no variety in this game really. Even my first platforming game I had ever made had more than two enemies and they had different qualities. The enemies here poses no threat. If you die, you restart the level. $2.99 is too much to ask. Bad Rats is a much better deal. I actually did have fun with that game. I would had actually spent money on Bad Rats, I would never spend money on this game. I got it for free from...somewhere. I have regrets of getting this for free, but I could sell the card I just got from this game. Yay!

Things I liked:
-I can make a little profit from that card (you won't get profit if you buy this game. According to Enhanced Steam extension, this game lowest price has been $2.24. Get it only if you can sell the cards for more than you've spent.)
-One boss somewhat made me startled I guess...
-The text after every level were somewhat interesting I suppose.

Things I disliked:
-Everything.
-There's a dedicated button for showing the controls which looks ugly because it goes behinds the platforms and such. You can't even see it. The controls however, are easy to learn, but not precise at all. I found my character still running even without pressing any buttons. Not too sure what the look button was for either...
-Two enemies, boring, no threat.
-Bosses were pretty boring too. Much more improved than the regular enemies, but these bosses can easily become regular enemies.
-The boxes...I'm not too sure why I can move them when I jump on them.
-Sometimes I can't double jump. I'm not entirely sure why I can't do it at certain moments but I'm not playing more to figure it out.
-Repetitive. All levels are basically the same just randomly arranged. (Have yet to see an impossible level.)
-Nothing really to look at.

Oh, I can provide another positive. I can cross this off my Steam Games in my Library I haven't Yet Played" list."

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Less than 30 minutes of gameplay for 10 dollars. Can't make your own dungeons, but can make your own memories for some reason.
If you have a 10-dollar bill that caught you touching yourself and you need to make sure he's never seen again, spend him on this.

-EDIT-
It updated and took away the ability to make your own memories. It also made the controls funky and added trading cards. I tried to get all 3 but nearly died after getting the 2nd one. So I decided  it.""

Imagine Me
The controls, the levels (randomly generated, which led me to get stuck on several occasions), the gameplay in general, is very crude.
The developers might have run out of funds, or their level, game and interface designer weren't really up to the task, or maybe there were time constraints that made them rush the shipping.
Either way, this game is clearly not finished. Art-wise, it is mostly pretty, but the arrow animations are still amateur, for example.
Interface navigation also has some poor choices: options menu is not accessible from in-game. Control mapping is not accessible from the 'esc' menu (maybe there is a shortcut, but one thing should not preclude the other).
At least, the game let me play it in a window with a resolution of my choosing. That, bafflingly, many games still refuse to do.

Imagine Me
Imagine Me playing a better game!

Imagine Me
Imagine Me is a side-scrolling randomly generated action platformer.

It features a campaign and challenge levels, as well as a workshop. The campaign is randomly generated but sadly, the level design is broken and offers too little variation, making it repetitive and boring. The challenge while interesting is somewhat easy and can be completed in less than one hour. In the end I'd say there are other platformers that surpass Imagine Me in every single aspect, making it not worth the money or time.

For anyone out there studying to be a game designer, this game is the perfect case study for the difference between 'randomly' and 'procedurally' generated content.

This uninspired platformer immediately thrusts the player into randomly generated levels that are not always completable and almost certainly not fun.

The protagonist controls stiffly and the hitboxes for hazards are inaccurate leading to very frustrating play.  Enemy design include: Fire Particle effect, spikes the shoot spikes and a black box.

Imagine Me
this is by far the worst game i have in my steam library. there's no challenge, no gameplay and the controls aren't tight enough. all you do is jump spikes and kill 2 different types of enemies. it's the kind of game you'd expect that someone would make while learning about how to make games, and then they'd just move on to a better project: not put it up on steam for actual money. i played through the game with this morbid curiosity that it would suddenly change or get better; it didn't.

Imagine Me
First it seems to be a good platformer, but it's not.
Annoying, frustrating, and have no point to continue.
Randomize thing: doesn't seems to work well.
The only good side that I can think of is the level editor with Workshop support

Just can't recommend. Not that bad, but not good either.


Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I got it in a random bundle, but it's definentely not worth the 10 dollar asking price at the moment.  I will re-review later if it changes.  Right now I wouldnt spend more than 5 dollars.

Imagine Me
Imagine Me would be considered plain even if it had came out back in the early 90s, and yet, its astonishing how such a simple game manages to do so many things wrong.
Every level looks the same, you just go from point A to point B, avoiding spikes and  enemies that barely move, by the end of each level you get a memory, that grants you further passage to the next one.
Developers like to show theyre still working on this game, but:
-The exit is always located either on the bottom right or bottom left corner.
-Every time you die you get the same dead screen, it gets really annoying.
-controls aren't tight.
- i wouldn't mind the art-style but there's a severe lack of animations.
- the game is too repetitive and has a very poor level design,  it would be more interesting if there were some  Non randomly generated levels.
- the hit boxes are bigger than the objects that are supposed to kill you, its an easy game and i could adjust to that, but it just shows how little work was put in this game.
- The Broken level generator more often than not leads to impossible levels, i've played for 10 min until i came across an impossible level. Levels don't even change when you die, the only option is to start the game all over again.
-the options menu is pretty lousy and cannot even be accessed while in game, instead you just get this really annoying            screen that appears every time you start a new game showing you the pre mapped controls and some instructions on how to play, there's even a special key just to open the instructions again. I dont get it, of all things that are missing, why do the developers want to force this on players, the game couldn't be simpler, children games are harder to understand than this, it serves no purpose.

If devs were ever involved in Imagine Me they would have fixed some of this problems by now, they seem to take into account everyone's bad feedback and yet no changes have been made. How difficult could it be to generate new levels every time you die just so it was at least possible to continue playing without having to start from the beginning every time you get stuck.

As is, Imagine Me is not even worth its current price. Its one of the worst games ive played and deserves every negative review it got. At Least most indie developers try something different and creative even if they happen to fail

Early Access Review

Probably the worst game i ever played. Don't buy it. 0$ are too expensive. Only get it in a bundle if you want to complete a game in under 10 minutes.

Imagine Me
If you are looking for an easy game for 100% achivements. Might be worth the time. I enjoyed Bad Rats 10x more then this game. If you buy it, you are garenteed to be dissapointed.

Imagine Me
Finicky controls and poor design lends to an unmemorable, mediocre platformer. 4.2/10.

Imagine Me
I'm a little confused, why would you use random level generation in a campaign mode.  A lot of the time, I think that random level generation is more of a lazy excuse to not put time and effort into level design than a way to have the game be Spontaneous and different every time".  In addition

Imagine Me
Oddly unpolished. Poor execution. Imagine Me feels like someone's project in a beginner's game design course. Perhaps there's a decent story in there somewhere but the level design, movement, and hit detection make it a mess. Sadly game design toolkits like GameMaker make far more polished games than this. For $3 it's not a major hit to the wallet but I can't see why anyone would buy this game outside of a bundle deal with something they do want.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Make sure you dont buy this game for $10. I completed this game 7/8 achievements (8th one seems bugged) in 10 mintutes.

What you should know about imagine me is it as nothing special about it. No special gameplay or mechanic to make it stand out. It's simply run and jump.

It has a random level generator for when you beat the game, but with all the much better platformers out there this isn't worth it. I personally got this game from  for the equivilent to $0.19 and im still upset. Yes this is Early Access, but I see no potential what so ever.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Not only it feels extremely unfinished, it also is extremely short. In 10 minutes - ten - I finished the game, did everything I could and obtained 10 achievements out of 11. How can this be worth 8.99 euro on the store as of writing? Luckily I got a free key for this during a giveaway.

Imagine Me
Got this game for free. I want my free back.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I got it by buying bundle and still i regret. Its like '90 dos games but without story or anything just go and finish level. 9$ IS TOO MUCH this game should worth like 99 cents or less. If you want another perfect game i fully recommend coz it can be done 100% in 15 minutes.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

My first impression is that this game is challenging, but fair. Controls are responsive and the dozen or so story levels I played through were laid out well, so any resulting deaths always felt like they were my own fault. Its a great feeling to accomplish a previously-failed task through practice and reliable game mechanics.

Game : 6.5/10
Graphic : 5.5/10

100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard

Imagine Me
+ Decent soundtrack, spooky bossfights.

- Repetitive, no change in gameplay, uninspired random generated levels.

Imagine Me
Worst POS I have ever seen on PC or Steam. Avoid at all cost.

Imagine Me
This is the most cancerous and frustrating game i've played so far, played like 5 min and i'm ready to commit suicide by bashing my head through the monitor. (hopefully that will work)

Don't bother buying this, it's not even worth the 3 euros that it cost.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Lol @ this game!
Gameplay sucks and is very bad! Game is buggy, no menu, no options to change command/binds. Control sucks. Nice way to waste 10$ ...

Game itself isn't funny at all. Don't waste your money but rather invest in Super Meat Boy" or "VVVVVV" which are real platformer."

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I got this game for free, but I couldn't imagine anyone ever spending money on it. It comes off as a crappy flash platformer, with a confusing level select screen. This game is bland, and terrible.

Outland
This is an excellent, well polished action platformer. Highly recommended.

 Beautiful graphics, mesmerizing backgrounds and sceneries
 Very good sound design and soundtracks
 Excellent animations
 Solid combat system
 Good level design
 Online co-op multiplayer!
 Runs surprisingly well on very low-end specs computers!
 Linux support! :)

 Keyboard bindings have to be set outside the game, but it works fine anyway.

Outland
What I've experienced (purely the single player) so far is a beautiful game, with interesting mechanics and engaging boss fights. I guess what I would sum it up as would be Old school platformers meet Metroid meet Ikaruga." It doesn't really bring anything new and innovative to the table mechanic wise

Outland
I don't like Steam's reviewing system. There are so many cases in which I don't wanna choose between recommending a game or not. Sometimes there are certain aspects of a game I like and others that I don't. How can I, the reviewer *always* have the right answer for you, the reader? Someone I don't even know personally? Someone I have no idea what they want and expect from a game? Sometimes I just wanna post my own analysis without a sentence" attached to it. Anyway

Outland
I played this game back when it first released on the xbox 360 and it was great back then. I bought this game *twice* if that doesn't show how much I recommend this game, nothing will.

Outland
An excellent PC port of a pretty decent Playstation Store game. Works fine at high resolutions at smooth 60+ fps.

Play with a controller for best experience.

Outland
Pros:
+great animations that bring the 2d platformer to life
+color mechanics that will amplify the challenge
+decent soundtrack
+artstyle is unique

Cons:
-combat feels clumsy, it makes the fluid running/jumping mechanics slow down
-checkpoints are bad in the sense that they won't refill your life, many times after a checkpoint I went to suicide just to replenish my health (there are health pickups but they either drop or don't)
-few environments (they just add snow effects to the same ruins or add a forest or some other boring replacement as a background)

Sidenote:
The game might have a huge difficulty spike at the end boss, they throw alot of things at you that you have to avoid.
There are coop missions that can only be done if you play with someone. Haven't had the chance to try it so can't comment on that.
Some people might have issues with the story, truthfully it's not the most elaborate.

Overall it's a great 2D platformer that will test your reflexes.

Outland
Introduction
Outland is a unique 2d platformer with some very unique gameplay elements. Outland brings a unique color switching mechanic throughout every part of the game. By switching between red and blue you can prevent damage, fight enemies more effectively, and open more pathways throughout the game world. I loved how the game constantly kept adding more elements to the levels. I didn't personally care for the story at all, but I found myself getting lost in the amazing backgrounds and soundtrack.

Pros
Art style
Gameplay
Difficulty
Great Port
Insanely fun
Level design



Cons
keyboard/mouse controls are not great
story

Conclusion
Outland is an amazing platformer with really cool and unique gameplay elements. From the gameplay to art style this platformer is an overlooked gem in this genre. This game is 100% worth a buy, even at full retail.

Outland
Outland is one of my favorite downloadable games from the last console generation, and I'm extremely happy that it was ported to PC. The only strange thing about the port is that achievements unlock after you close the game. Weird, but it's okay. (Edit: this has been addressed in patches)

Outland is something of a simple metroidvania with an Ikaruga color-changing mechanic. Players can change between light and dark after an early section of the game and use these forms to attack opposite aligned enemies, harmlessly absorb same-colored bullets and beams, and interact with the environment. There's a somewhat large world to explore and plenty of bosses to take down. The game features an arcade mode with leaderboards, and a coop mode that has a few specific levels. There is also some cooperative stuff in the game - some specific coop challenges and the main campaign allows coop (though due to the nature of the game, only the host progresses).

The player's main weapon is a sword, and combat is very quick and simple. There are some upgrades to the player's abilities, but no alternate weapons, armor, etc (the game doesn't really need them).

The game is absolutely gorgeous, especially at high resolutions and it's pretty to see in motion. The story is very much something of an origin/creation story for a different world, and it's kind of neat, but don't expect a ton of character development, spoken dialog, etc. If there's a reason to buy this game, it's delicious eye-candy and solid gameplay.

Outland
Outland, the action-platformer by Housemarque, originally came out on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 over three years ago. It was a good game then, it's still a good game today.

First off let's discuss the port. It's decent, but could be better. For whatever reason the vsync locks at 30 fps, which causes frame-rate judders. The alternative is to turn off in-game vsync and then force it on via your videocard's control panel. I tried this but somehow I still got screen-tearing. Maybe I just suck at computers. Also there's no option to turn off vibration if you're using a 360 pad. Never been a fan of force feedback, so needless to say I didn't like this. The image-quality is a bit too soft as well. It supports resolutions at and above 1920x1080 but I dunno, it feels like it could use some AA, that would make the art-direction really stand out.

Usually when people talk about this game they mention a shump called Ika...ikar...? Oh right. Kid Icarus. Yep that old Nintendo game about Greek Mythology and Eggplant Wizards. Seriously though, the world the hero explores is governed by light and dark(or blue bullets and red bullets). Early on you're given a sword and not long after that, the ability to switch between light & dark(blue & red). When you want to absorb bullets or lasers you should be the same color, when you want to attack enemies you have to be the opposite color. Your color can also affect objects such as floating platforms or spikes. Expect numerous situations to crop up where you have to switch between colors constantly to proceed. This isn't a puzzle game but you will have to think every now and then, at least for a moment.

Switching colors isn't always an option. For example, you might run into a red enemy while area is filled with red bullets. The trick here is to use one of your special attacks. These can include a power strike, a laser, and flashy explosion. Next up are the exploratory powers. Certain powers can be attained to make getting around easier. In typical fashion, previous areas can be explored to find more cash, life/energy upgrades, and concept art unlocks. Fair warning, this is the full extent of the exploration in this game.

Main reason I enjoy this game is it's just so fluid. Back when it came out in 2011 I started the demo thinking Well...whatever..I guess I gotta try it." I immediately fell in love with its smooth controls

Outland
Very solid Action platformer, great art style with nice soundtrack and great platforming. don't expect deep fighting mechanics or combos, for me i don't mind and i had a really great time beating it. higher difficulty levels and some collectibles also stretch the game's length, Recommended for sure.

Outland
This game is so friggin pretty. Now if you have read my other reviews I often like making comparisons to other games to start so this for most intents and purposes, is any open world 2D platformer mixed with the likes of the Bullet Hell Ikaruga. I want to avoid using the term Metroidvania because I don't like it as well as from what I see this game does not fully represent that.

The Ikaruga nod is for obvious reasons. However combining it with a platformer makes it a rather unique endeavor.

The art, the animation is gorgeous. In addition to this the combat and traversal feels smooth and agile. For me personally, it reminded me of Marvel's Black Panther. The combat has slides, lift attacks, aerial combo's that make combat albeit a bit (for want of a better word) 'simplistic' version of Devil May Cry.

You gain energy that can be used for special abilities which I will leave for you to discover yourself. But I will say their attacks represent a neutral color that affects enemies of either of the main colors.

The bullet hell aspect becomes something of an art piece if you just stared at the patterns, in true kaleidoscope fashion, however it becomes rather interesting when something that seems completely impassable can be overcome by switching color and jumping through the top and over the other color before switching back to fall through a laser of the opposite. Its makes for a very satisfying experience when a successfully navigated jumping puzzle is solved. At times, not only do you feel you've solved the correct path but you feel like you've bested it. And you can feel your skills grow and your knowledge of how the bullet hell aspect can used to your advantage.

I did have some problems, there are 5 bosses in total. The first three can be beaten rather easily with a couple attempts without much fuss but the last two demand EVERYTHING from your skill set.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=488687867

They are incredibly satisfying to conquer. But the only way (I feel) that you have a fighting chance is go to almost all the shrines, they are hidden and cost I forget what the currency is called but usually all the money you have upon finding them. I won't say what exact ability and what its used for but its absolutely required to have multiple uses of it to even have a realistic chance of defeating one or both of these two bosses. But despite that small frustration it does not take away from the fantastic experience. The art, animation, combat, traversal, mixed with a fantastic soundtrack makes me wish I had pulled this out of my backlog much sooner and that I could write this with 2 play-thoughs to tell you about.

Outland
This game is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite Metroidvania-inspiried platformer/hack n' slash game of all time. Don't let my limited amount of time spent with the PC version fool you; I spent a considerable amount of time with this game on gen. 7 consoles before I upgraded  everything to gen. 8.

Everything about this game, from the music, to the atmosphere, story, characters, platforming, action, and voice acting is completely polished. I love the art design and get lost in the world every single time I play. The game is not particularly difficult, but it is challenging in certain places and overcoming those challenges feels very rewarding. Combat is also very tight and has that extra little something that all the best hack n' slash games possess. I can't really define that something"

Outland
An ancient force has awoken from a 30,000 year slumber and you are all that stands in the way of absolute chaos. Well you would be if you play this game.

This game is like stepping into a dream. Gorgeous imagery, mystical magic and psychedelic bullet hells await all who dare step into outland. Using both the forces of light and dark you are tasked with ridding the land of evil where ever it lives and returning the world to the peace it once knew.

The combat and platforming in this title are executed amazingly, controls are almost perfect and the snappy reactions they give make this a pleasure to play. That topped off with cleaver metroidvania level design, a vast world to explore, a huge array of puzzles to best, bullet hells to beat and an army of enemies to overcome will lead to hours of excitement.

The visuals as mentioned are outstanding; the psychedelic lands you traverse really do submerge you into something akin to dream. The art style is unique and interesting, although all the characters and enemies are cast in an almost silhouette of light they have a life to them that is just hard to explain.

The music is a great accompaniment to your journey with deep orchestral tones with every boss battle to soft melodic songs like wind whistling through the trees. I found every part of this world thrilling and delightful. The story is as bare bones as it comes, you are a hero go forth and do hero stuff. Sure there is a big bad evil in the world corrupting and twisting everything to its whim, but you dont have to worry about that, just enjoy the ride.

This game is a masterpiece and will keep you busy for a while too, especially if you are going after every collectable. The soundtrack and artbook are great too; they really add to the experience and help you get a look into this amazing world that the game only scratches the surface of.  Head out and buy a copy today, youll be glad you did.

Have Fun ^_^


Outland
I've only put a couple hours into this game so far, but already I'm in love with it. Classic platform style gameplay with beautiful art, dynamic enemies, enough combat skills to keep it interesting, and the storytelling is pretty decent for a platformer. The ability to switch from light to dark mode really does it for me. It adds a dynamic to the game and keeps it interesting and fast paced enough to keep you going and going. Highly recommended to anyone who loves platformers of any kind.

Outland
I had a lot of fun playing co-op in it with a friend online. Maybe not the best Metroidvania platformer, but endless amounts of highs and lows to experience with a friend. Some bullet-hell difficulty in places, some fantastic boss fights, and pretty good music and stylistic choice. I'd say give it a go, and find someone else to play with.

Outland
A platform game with some heavy metroidvania influences, it takes a few cues from games like Giana Sisters with the dual gameplay of red vs. blue (youll see when you watch the video, promise), and even taking some cues from bullet hell shooters, surprisingly effectively used in this platformer.

This is first impression review, I'll update after I dig deeper into the game.

This game is awesome, it has badlands graphics with guacamelee control of realm. It's does feel like old school platfomer but  casual" where you respawn at previous checkpoint when you die. Beating the enemy when your hp is 1 also give you extra life point. First hour impression

Outland
First of all, im not really into a platforms genre game, but outland makes my girlfriend happy, she loves it, she playing it over and over again even when she always died a lot. so sometimes i playing it with her, and its kinda rewarding when i am passed the hard area with so many obstacles (its like playing skyforce or 1942, canon bullets everywhere)
For me outland is a decent platforms game, its a great game with stunning visual style, great powers and abilities, challenging puzzle and it has a boss battle too (and its huge).

I bought this game just for $2,  so im not asking anything from it, overall its a good game. 7/10.

Outland
Right CTRL is a key that is used in this game. If anybody... ANYBODY at this dev had played the game on keyboard they would've realized right away that the controls SUCK.

Well. Off of that little thing, let's get to why this game isn't very good.

Art- Don't get me wrong, the game does look quite nice. Sadly levels all blend together and nothing is very distinict or memorable. Pretty, yes. Functional? It's streamlined, but it needs to be far less-so.

Music/sound- The music is alright but pretty forgetable whereas the sound design is rather atmospheric and nice.

Gameplay- This is where we really start to run into issues. The description says fast paced? I would put it in the mild" category. It's repetitive. Simple. Slow. Nothing new or innovative. And all of the environments look EXACTLY the same so I never once cared where I was going or why I was going there. The next area will just be a slightly different but still boring as heck platforming section.

Granted- I didn't get the red powerup

Outland
It looks cool but plays kinda boring.

Outland
Outland is an absolutely beautiful game with crisp controls, challenging levels, and novel gameplay mechanics.

If you're a fan of Metroidvania games, this is a must-buy, especially for the price.

Outland
I think Outland is remarkable in it's mechanics and artwork. Typically, I detest playing side-scrollers, though I was 1st inaugriated into gaming in the eighties. I guess, seeing the progression that gaming has made, I just don't like going backwards in time on tech. But, Outland is one of those lovely exceptions. The fluidity of the character's movments, the quality of the sound & graphics, and the atmospheric effects of the game all draw you back for more. That said, skill-type games that require dexterity and speed are not my strong point, so I probably won't progress very far in the game. Since I bought it primarily for the artbook and music, I'm fine with that. And, after my first time looking through the artbook, I have to say I was not disappointed there. Getting the huge discount for the Christmas sale was just an added bonus that succeeded in moving the title from my wishlist to my library. I recommend this game to anyone, really... whether you are into side-scrollers, artwork, or great audio soundtracks.

Outland
I'm a huge fan of Metroidvania games, in fact it's only thanks to Metroid that i started playing videogames.
I got this game because after reading some reviews i thought i could give it a try, plus it was on sale (90%).
The game is not bad, it just doesn't feel like a Metroidvania due to the fact that there's no backtracking and you're guided throughout the whole game. The game also never got me interested in its story, it was just a boring walk 'n slash 2D time killer with some platform. The artstyle is not bad, but there's almost no variation between areas..as somebody already said, you could see a screenshot and not recognize which zone is which.

You may want to give it a try on a sale, i'd say a 50/75% is enough.

Have an awesome day!

Let's do a test:

- Do you like metroidvania games?
Yes? Next one.
No? Then leave.

- Have you played to Ori and the blind forest?
Yes? Next one.
No? Then don't buy this one and try it, it's better than this in everything.

- It's on sale? Then buy it right now.

Story is: good guy against evil mixed with some chaman ideas.
Music is good.
Gameplay is funny but not to complex. There's an achievement: kill 20 monsters with only 1 life... it's not hard because the monsters, it's hard because they always drop +1 life and you have to avoid to get it...

Definitely is a good game to have fun.

Games like this are the reason we need to support indie developers more often

Outland
The best $1 ever spent. Thus game is extreme fun while playing with friends. There were a few moments when we kept on falling from ledges and me n my friends couldn't stop laughing. I love this game. Highly recommended.

Outland
I know this game came out a couple of years ago because i own it on the PS3 it was a great game at the time as it is now .
I serious recommend this game for those who like adventure/platform games .
The gameplay is rader basic and simple which makes the game fun and enjoyable , and the story line there is not much to tell is one man trying to save all of creation against the gods .
But on my book this game it was as it still is 9/10.

Outland
Bad netcode makes online multiplayer unplayable

Outland
Outland is a great platformer that I can easily recommend to the fans of the genre.

It is an interesting mix of a Metroidvania gameplay and the attribute-changing mechanic from Ikaruga. The controls are fast and responsive, the art style is unique and has some breathtaking scenes, and the music fits well to the atmosphere. The game has this magical and eerie feeling to it and everything flows so well together that I had no doubts about completing all the coop challenges and even getting all the achievements which is quite rare for me.

However, there are a couple of things that could have easily elevated Outland from a very good game into a unforgettable title. As I mentioned above, the game has this great art style and there are some truly breathtaking moments when the player is shown the grand scale of the architecture and some of the enemies. More of these moments could have been appreciated!

There also could have been more areas without any enemies in order to vary up the gameplay a bit. I feel that the opportunity was there many times where the developers could have shown more of the story without the voice narration.

The coop challenges are quite fun, though their number is quite low. It is a shame because for that one hour, my coop partner and I had great fun completing them!

But overall then, this is a very positive recommendation and I am looking forward to the next game by Housemarque (and ported by Knockout Games).

Outland
The keyboard controls are absolutely abysmal, and it makes it really hard to want to play. I do not recommend.

Outland
its a pretty platformer. and thats it.
the combat is dull and forgetfull.
the music and ambience is ok, nothing more.
the platforming is sometimes clunsy, sometimes more of the same.

it feels void. it needs something that brings it apart from other platformers, and it just doesnt have it.

buy trine or trine 2, instead. much more interesting.

Outland
Got a few hours into it with a co-op partner and was enjoying the game, but then it deleted my save file.

Attempts to play a new game fail: error creating save file.

Another promising game farked up by inadequate QA.

Outland
Too many platform games on Steam are basically what I call 'Pixel s', games where the novelty is in the difficulty (looking at you,  Super Meat Boy). Outland manages to be tricky without being punishing, rewarding learning from your mistakes rather than killing you for trivial errors. The novelty is in the mechanics, learning new techniques and using the 'light/dark' system to get past enemies and traps. Story is nothing special, but the graphics are smooth and the controls are responsive, which is all you want from a platformer.

Outland
Outland is basically a 2D platformerr. It has a metrovania component, means sometimes you go back and forth to previos levels.  However the going back and forth is minimal and you have target indicator of where you should go next, which is good. The game itself is actually pretry linear unless you want to go baxk to some previos levels to get powerups. And you might want to as the levels are rally getting harder later.

I have yet to tey the coop missions, so not sure about that. But the single player experience is good. Levels are getting harder and harder. Near end levels are actually hard, although it is not insanely hard yhat you wanna throw your controller/keyboard across the room. But you are guaranteed that you will die quite a lot at near end levels.

Checkpoints are not many but they are mostly well placed

I played it with an XBOX360 wireless controller and it is great.

You'll get additinal abilities during the game that will unlock new areas.

Summary. It is a great 2d platformer game. It is from UbiSoft but you don't need UPlay for this game. It is a hidden gem.

Outland
While the story isn't very special, the gameplay is as good as a 2d platformer can get, smooth controls and simple attacks. And the difficulty is perfect, it gets harder as you play, it introduces you to new skills slowly but allows you to master all skills before the final level.

Definitely recommended for a couch weekend.

Outland
Yes, yes and yes.  Beautiful, fun to play and worth every penny :D  An underrated gem

Outland
Relaxing platformer. Great Theme.
A Tribal warrior that gains abilities has the game goes on. The soundtracks are great, especially the boss ones.
For those who enjoy, the achievements are actually average/hard" to get. I wish this had a difficulty setting

Outland
After having picked up the game some time ago, I finally took the time to play it and it took some serious self-control for me in order to close it and write this review. This game is not only very beautiful, it is lots of fun. For most of the enemy types, there are certain abilities or attack patterns that allow you to defeat them without loosing health. Finding these out alone is fun. Now, I will go back to playing - the second boss is waiting for me :D.

Enjoy the game, folks. I would definitely recommend it.

Outland
Huuge fun! I really like the art style. It's pretty clean and controls are solid. The puzzles are generally well-designed and there are very few moments when I feel cheated out of progress.

Outland
at first it controls like a pregnant yakk and it send you through a co-op difficulty like its trying to help dicaprio win an award but so far its great in co-op.

Outland
the only reason i don't recommend this game is for the controls
they just SUCK (https://steamcommunity.com/app/305050/discussions/0/613937306837760462/)

Outland
The good:
Background visuals are appealing.

The bad:
Animation is clunky
No real story
Controls are poor
Bullet hell parts, being the only challange, are not enjoyable


Basically it's a cheap bullet hell game platformer - a strange combination - with nice art but poor gameplay.

Outland
Very impressive visually, smooth gameplay, no crashes so far.
It's obviously been made to be played both on console and pc,. so the game should (imo) detect it's current platform and not show the console controls as they are making the tutorial more confusing,. but that's the only downside I've seen so far.

Update:
- Game crashes when you switch to windowed mode. T_T

Outland
A quick review about this game :

Beautiful artstyle and visual design, coupled with a nice atmosphere.
Engaging singleplayer and online co-op with smooth gameplay that should be enjoyable through and through.
The story is not too original or deep, but it's charming in a way.
Level design and difficulty are both solid.
Summary :
Nice little platformer with cool graphic design, appealing atmosphere, fluid gameplay and interesting mechanic (If you know Ikaruga, you probably get the whole concept).

Outland
N+ meets Prince of Persia with a few bullet-hell situations all mixed up in the jimmyjams for good measure? Sure, I'll give it a shot. The stylized levels and artwork is very pretty. Native controller support that works like you'd expect it to!

I'm really enjoying it so far.

Outland
This is a refined little beauty. From the store page, I expected a good looking but short and flat indie title with all the usual problems those come with. Instead I got an incredibly well put together, lengthy and polished title, the likes of which I'd expect from a triple A studio. The gorgeous animations, backgrounds, and other visual elements are definitely icing on the cake, but what makes this a great title is the masterful weave of mechanics and abilities with enemy interactions and platforming sections that always makes you feel like you're getting better while progressing through the game.

Highlights
Outlands learning curve, for me, flowed in a natural progressive way. As a player I found myself constantly wanting to go further and progress just to see what was next. The unlocking of abilities on the way, and the interesting and fun boss fights were like the Golden Stars you got at school when you'd studied well, and really helped up the level of engagement.

The little details have all clearly had time and effort spent on them making sure they turned out right. Everything from the ability to destroy heart drops to turn them into excess gold when you don't need life, to the placement of new enemies after a platforming section has been thought about by the developer and works together to compliment the players progress.

The art style and sound deserve special mention, all sticking to various influences from Aztec, Incan, Mayan and even Olmec civilizations and all helping to promote a feeling of the spiritual and the historical and embolden the narrative, they work really well. Outland also has some of the best title screen narration I've heard in any game.

Mistakes and Annoyances
I expected a lot more frustration and annoyance than I found in this game, and the only things worth complaining about for me were little things that could've been fixed like the option of alternative pre-set control mappings, though even this has been addressed in a recent developer update. I only ran into one bug in my entire 8-hour playthrough which forced me to restart a boss fight. Other than that the only time I ever got frustrated in this game was when I screwed up a platforming section or didn't think through an enemy engagement before charging ahead. These annoyances set to show me I wasn't as good as I thought I was and needed to learn something before proceeding, as many of the good old-school games used to.

Recommendations
Currently selling on Steam at 6.99/9.99/$9.99 and clocking in with an average playtime of 7-8 hours and close to double that for completionists, and with co-op and plenty of replay value, Outland is plain and simple good value for money if it's the genre of game you enjoy. There's even a Two-Pack option where you can save an extra 15-20% if you have someone to go in with.

There's also a Special Edition at (locally) an extra 33% which includes the soundtrack and an artbook with some development history and plenty of screenshots. While the soundtrack is unarguably good, it's fairly bland and unexciting, and the art is gorgeous, it's still essentially a collection of things in a pdf which are already mostly unlocked in game. In short, the Special Edition is cheap, but doesn't add much value.

Unedited review notes 02/09/2015 for Outland:

+Pretty as hell, the sizes/resolutions are also larger and nicer than usual
-Map legends/icons and controls are pretty weird and annoying to get used to
+Awesome narrator, this guy should narrate love books and GPS
-Game too hard to exit (6 menu selections?)
+Those boss fights are challenging, interesting, encouraging and always leave me with just 1 heart left
+Tons of smart little things like attacking hearts 3 times gives you gold instead all add ingenuity

Outland
Very nice platformer so far. Interesting mechanics, nice visuals, the music is good (a little repetitive maybe), difficulty is alright, complexity is slowly increasing... very polished. The savepoints could be a little more frequent, but I guess that's due to the world being somewhat open and something I'll get used to.

Update: Ok, so after ~10 hours I have almost completed the game, I have yet to beat the final boss. Yes, there are not enough savepoints in the game, and what's even more annoying is that when you exit the game the savepoint is reset and you have to restart the level. Outland is still a very nice game, and I can recommend it, but some parts can be a little frustrating (not enough savepoints).

Update 2: Alright. So the boss I had to kill wasn't the final boss. There's apparently one more super boss hiding after three more levels, and those levels are just infuriating. They aren't really hard, but the lack of save points makes getting through them a real chore. Still a very good game up to that point.

Outland
Outland was a fun platformer that reminded me of Metroid with a sword. The story of the game is not terribly long, taking me order 10 hours to finish. The game builds in challenge nicely without getting too hard too quickly or ever becoming too easy. The collectibles and upgrades were spaced out nicely and didn't feel like a long grind. While the game is pretty much linear, it is clear right away that upgrades from later in the game will be necessary to finish clearing earlier areas, which I consider a plus.
Positives:
The gameplay was great. I thought that the movement by the player and camera were polished weil. The game adds a mechanic of switching between a light and dark orientation, changing what some platforms do and whether some environmental obstacles are harmful or benign. This provides a nice tactic to add depth to what can otherwise be a tired genre. 10/10
Bosses were difficult, but not overly frustrating or complicated. They provided a good challenge, and defeating each one provided a sense of accomplishment. 10/10
Most of the achievements were non-grindy. (I have 8/12 right now.) The lone exception to this is the achievement to collect 1 million in game currency. After finishing the game and collecting all of the money vases, I only had 77% of this done. Some of the other achievements provided some extra amusement/welcome challenges. 8/10
Character upgrades and collectibles were well spaced. Throughout the campaign, new skills and techniques were provided at a good pace, keeping the game from feeling monotonous. Collectibles could be found in each area, but I thought there was a good balance of adding extra areas to find in areas and not littering the game with meaningless loot. 9/10
Negatives:
The story doesn't do much for the game beyond giving a sense of why you are there and what you are doing. It isn't over the top, in your face, or bad. It is just rather blase. The expose about each boss provides a little context about why you had to fight them, but feel a little contrived. All of this said, in my opinion it is much better to make the story adequate and make great gameplay than the other way around. 5/10
No comment:
I have yet to try the coop challenges.
Overall:
A lot of fun. I was a little sad it ended so quickly! However, any extra content may have started to become lengthening the game for the sake of lengthening the game. If there were to be anything added on, it probably would have required new skills as well to add more depth. I would definitely recommend the game to others. I would even go so far to say that I would be interested in a sequel if it were to add new skills or updgrades! 9/10

Outland
So far a fun game. I've played it co-op with a friend about half way of the second chapter. The game's impressive visually, fights are engaging enough for a platformer and switching between Light and Dark brings in that little bit of complexity the game needs to stand out.

Only problem I've experienced are the default controls and lack of options to change these. I eventually found out ways to fix these issues.

Keyboard Keybinds!
Go to your Steam/steamapps/common/Outland/ folder and look for the KeyboardMap.ini file. Open it in a text editor and replace the existing keys with the ones you want. In the in-game options set the controls to Default (not Alternate). Consult the ReadMe for more detailed instructions.

Controller Keybinds!
Turn on Big Picture Mode on Steam and map your keys in the Settings menu. This allows you to customize keys to your heart's content. Back" is Map

Outland
One of the, if not the best platformer game I have ever played. The artwork is magically rich in detail yet simplistic at the same time, allowing for visual clarity in the gameplay while providing the player with  a sense of wonder at the scene. The story is encapsulating and rich, with little to no lapse in game flow (some people might not like the lengthy levels). The combat may be slightly frustrating at times, but fights only last a few seconds, (with the exception of bosses, those are challenging in a fun way), so it is not a big issue. Most annoying part of the game are the obstacles in each stage; they are quite challenging and may leave you wanting to punch something.

TL;DR - Beautiful environment, very good story, very challenging but fun levels and combat.

How did they do it...................Best optimized game I've ever played, smooth as vaseline and the reading/saving speed is so fast, so fast. SO FAST!

10/10, Too well optimized to be a open world game.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
In five hours I adopted a wolfdog pup, kidnapped a spetsnaz officer, got mauled by a bear, repainted a helicopter, used the Fulton Recovery System on a passing goat, and sniped a spetsnaz recon team while She Blinded Me With Science played on cassette.

Yep, it's a Hideo Kojima game.

EDIT: So, this review got more votes than I expected. Why don't I edit it to be a little more useful?

I have 24 hours in the game as of writing this - and it came out yesterday. That should tell you something.

PROS- Who's a good boy? DD's a good boy! DD is a good boy, yes he is!
- The Fox engine is excellently optimized. This game should be playable with beautiful graphics even on middle-tier systems. If you can run Ground Zeroes, you can run this.
- The open world is well-done. It's also huge, but it feels dense enough that you're never more than a few hundred meters from something to Fulton. Environments are somewhat varied.
- There are multiple ways to approach any enemy installation, ranging from the obvious to the easily missed. It's encouraged to find a perch a couple hundred meters away and scout ahead.
- The world itself is well-done, too. There are weather changes, a day/night cycle, and these actually affect gameplay by making stealth easier or harder.
- You can Fulton extract anything. Anything. Soldiers? Of course. Cargo containers? Yes. Jeeps? Sure. Emplaced machine guns, mortars, AA guns? Definitely. Tanks? Yep! Bears, sheep, goats, and buzzards? Absolutely. I'm surprised you can't fulton-extract the freaking buildings at this rate.
- Mother Base management is like a more fleshed-out version of Peace Walker's. In many ways, this game is Peace Walker 2, and I definitely put that in the pro" category.
- Good soundtrack full of 80s pop and rock hits that you can blare out of a helicopter. Also

This is not a game, it is a work of art. I first played Metal Gear on the NES in 1988 during the slow decline of the cold war, and from the moment I started playing The Phantom Pain I immediatley felt like i was right back in my childhood again. Thank you Hideo for the memories. It was worth the wait!

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
ATTENTION: Words colored black are spoilers, so only hover over them if you're prepared for that!
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an open world action-adventure stealth game developed by Kojima Productions, directed, designed, co-produced and co-written by Hideo Kojima. The eleventh canonical and final installment in the Metal Gear series, and the fifth within the series' chronology.

Im still not exactly sure what to think about the game, as its both the best and the worst game I have ever played. I really enjoyed the gameplay and I think its one of the best open world games out today. However, as a metal gear solid fan who has played the previous entries in the series, the ending felt unfinished and wasnt very satisfying.

In fact, most of The Phantom Pain's second half doesnt really feel complete either. Many of the main ops in Chapter Two are basically retreads of the early missions at a higher difficulty, and their role as padding couldn't be more evident. The true ending isn't revealed in some grand, explosive fashion, but is simply presented on your list of things to do once you reach a specific set of milestones, making it feel hastily slapped in to give all of your prior actions context.

It's a shame, as there's no sense of closure from the revelation that we were the fake Big Boss all along, and the story as a whole ends up feeling hollow as a result. There are rumours that Konami cut Kojimas budget at some point and even denied his desire to work on the game for even longer, maybe that is one of the reasons behind this.

Likes and Dislikes below. They are just my personal opinions, so I strongly recommend reading other reviews as well.

LIKEDMother Base Management
Assigning soldiers, developing new weapons and gadgets, and further expanding your Mother Base often kept me busy in an enjoyable way

Freedom of Choice
Numerous ways to solve missions and objectives. You can either go in completely silent, killing or sleep darting every target with suppressor, or go in loud with machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and even tanks. To accomplish either, you have an abundance of tools and gadgets at your disposal. The good old cardboard box, a stealth camouflage device, C4 that you can place even on the backs of enemy soldiers, inflatable decoys that look just like you, explosive and sleep-gas mines, claymores, etc.

Interrogation
You can slowly creep up on soldiers and aiming your gun on them, they will notice and drop their weapon, begging you to not kill them. You can then choose to interrogate, kill, or just choke them till they pass out. If you choose to interrogate them, youre granted useful information about the current area. Locations of hidden resources, diamonds, even prisoners or your mission target

Supply Drops
They allow you to refill ammo, suppressors and fultons during missions. You can even drop vehicles wherever you need them

Fulton Surface-to-Air Recovery System
It's awesome and often hilarious! You can recruit new soldiers with this and remove them from the mission area at the same time. It contributes to your progression, and you dont have to hide their bodies, which can be found and woken by others. You can also extract vehicles, containers or even animals Later in the progression, the balloon is replaced with a black hole device, allowing you to even extract even while indoors

Fluid Movement
The transition from prone to crouching is very well done

Performs Well
No fps drops, no lags, no blue screens, just smooth!

Damn good console port
One of the best console ports ever created, I played it with keyboard/mouse and it was awesome

Never seen before degree of Weapon customization
Create your own favourite weapon out of dozens of weapon parts

Cassette Tapes
Though some of them wouldve been better off as cutscenes

FOB's
1vs1 online mode is intense and fun and you have to be really good to make it through 60 AI enemies and 1 real player

Precise Shooting Mechanics
You can even shoot trough small holes and there will be no invisible wall that blocks your shots

Great Soundtrack
Awesome songs in there, I recommend checking it out. Seriously, go buy it!

Custom Songs
You can add your own songs to the game and even set one of those as your helicopter arrival music
DISLIKEDCover System
Theres no key to enter into cover against walls or boxes, its a dynamic system thats at times unreliable

Silent Snake
Snake is quite the silent protagonist, and most of his dialogue is on the optional cassette tapes... During cutscenes and crucial events, he often said nothing, letting others talk for him

Driving Vehicles
Feels oddly quirky in this game, but its functional at least. Most of the time you will drift with a vehicle trying to avoid a stone, but just to crash right into it anyway

To be continued at the end of many story missions
Its not a movie and doesnt feel like one

Notable lack of cutscenes
Its unlike other Metal Gear Solid games and if there are any, they are very short compared to other MGS games

Checkpoint System
Be ready to do stuff again along the lines of Dark Souls... you die, everything is back, with no manual saving

Climbing Ledges
Its a real pain in the  if the edges arent even. Your character tries to climb, but can't and just gets pushed back down. This can even draw enemies attention as you try to climb a ledge but just cant, even though the game is telling you that you should be able to

Cheaters in FOB Mode
I really hope Konami does something about this

Credits after and during the intro of every mission
As if every mission was an episode of a TV series... It feels out of place in this game and gets annoying after a while

No Interesting Bossfights
The first Metal Gear title without them

The sudden change from David Hayter to a different voice actor, Kiefer Sutherland
Even though you aren't really playing Big Boss in this game the real Big Boss doesn't even have David Hayters voice

Repetitive Side Missions
Extract the Highly Skilled Soldier, Prisoner Extraction, Eliminate the Heavy Infantry, Mine clearing, Eliminate the Tank Unit, Target practice etc. They all can be done a bunch of times in different locations and gets slightly harder each time. Its boring as its basically the same task over and over again...

No useful fast-travel-system
There is no useful/functional fast-travel-system, you need to call in the chopper and that generates some unwanted downtime. Sure there is the cardboardbox fast-travel-system but you can only activate it if there are no soldiers around... And this for an open-world game is very bad
Do I recommend the game? Hell yeah, it is amazing! Awesome gameplay, nice story and a great soundtrack making this game one of my all-time favourites, even though it has some flaws
With over 200 hours of fun this game, it was well worth the money for me too!

If you should have any questions about the game or my review, feel free to leave a comment or add me directly.

A finely-crafted masterpiece filled with dynamic gameplay and a multilayered story about the misadventures of legendary pirate warrior Snake and his friend Kaz, a short-tempered one-armed fiddle enthusiast robbed of his future.  After rebuilding their oceanic party island, they cruise Africa and the Middle East in search of bootleg cassette tapes for the ultimate mix tape, while battling Cipher, the world's most advanced copyright enforcement agency.

10/10 would misinterpret MGS story again

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
Since I now have 100%, I guess it's time to review this game.

It's damn incredible. The gameplay is pretty much flawless. In my 300+ hours of playtime I haven't found a single bug. Well, except an AI-driven truck trying to do some offroading, with hilarious results.

The AI is really smart, able to wipe you out if you aren't careful. They use teamwork and don't aim like Stormtroopers or cheaters, being nicely in the middle. The buddy system is great, and each of Snake's companions feels like it has a purpose, with D-Dog being my personal favourite. There's a buddy for every playstyle, as long as you develop the right equipment. Speaking of development, this game has a ridiculous amount of weapons and items to develop, and even after getting 100% I still have new guns and upgrades to try out (They don't count to 100%).

As for the story, it's a strange one, and it has a lot of different opinions. I do agree with the majority saying that Skull Face isn't a massively interesting villain, mainly due to the fact that he barely makes an appearance until later on.

ENDGAME SPOILERS
The final plot twist was pretty good too, as I have a nice little idea on what Kojima meant by it, but it's too long to fully explain. Basically, I thought he wanted us to be a victim of Big Boss' antagonism, rather than play as him ourselves.

As for the graphics, the game looks excellent, with the FOX Engine keeping the game running at a smooth 50-60FPS, and my PC isn't exactly the best around. The sound and music is also incredible, with the music ranging from the calming flutes of Afghanistan to the pounding, intense drums of a combat alert in Africa. The soundtrack also accompanies the mood brilliantly.

So, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I almost can't fault it, and it's everything it was hyped up to be. Easily game of the year contender.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
What I learned playing MGS V:

-Hospitals are dangerous
-Driving a Horse is not permitted in Afghanistan
-Driving a Car is not permitted in Afghanistan
-Having an interpreter makes humbling understandble in form of subtitles
-Tanks are made with papier-mache
-Playing Hide and seek with a Metal Gear
-Hideo Kojima is a cult that you will see him everywhere, even in the Mother Base
-Punching my comrades makes them grateful
-Sandstorms are not what i thought
-My comrades are weeaboos
-Russians are weeaboos
-Sending a support helicopter is considered stealthing
-Cigars are the best thing in the world
-Grass is the most powerful stealth device in the world
-Punching your horse is very satisfactory
-The time doesn't stop while using I-Droid, no really it's the 100th time they say that.
-All russians read the same book

And probably i will learn more thanks to this Hideo Kojima game

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
What a weird game. The gameplay itself is stellar and if you're a fan of the stealth genre you've probably played this one already. It's basically a high-budget remake of Peace Walker. On the other hand, it has the weakest plot/story of all Metal Gear Solid games. It's clearly unfinished and with the current situation at Konami it's not likely we'll see an updated rerelease like Substance or Subsistence.

*NON-STORY RELATED MINOR SPOILER*

So , I was playing this awesome game enjoying every second of it , minding my own business.

And I get an urgent message from Ocelote telling me to hurry back to mother base for something important.

I make it back and promptly hear what sounds like a gunshot , few seconds later you start hearing fireworks.

I was putting 2 and 2 together and a few seconds later Miller , Ocelote and a couple more soldiers came singing Happy Birthday and they brought a cake , celebrating my birthday. A game , celebrating someone's birthday (7th September , yes it's my birthday) I was so ing amazed I kept smiling for an hour.

I never really paid much attention to the MGS series but this game takes the cake no problem.

Hideo , I tip my hat off to you , fine sir.

You have managed to leave me speechless.

This game is legendary , buy it and enjoy every second of it (I rarely recommend games since lately they've been )

10/10 Game of the Year material , would cri over cake again.

PS : Game has alot of funny little easter eggs! (Check my screenshots to find a funny one that happened during Quiet's battle)

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
Call me crazy..but I think this game was made by some sexy beast named Hideo Kojima.

The story takes place after the events of Ground Zeroes, 9 years to be precise as your main character Punished Venom" Snake has been in a coma and is now on a hell driven odyssey to get his revenge.

So gameplay wise

Game is amazing, the graphics, the story, the gameplay. I am just really amazed of what they created, from what i`ve seen the pc version is really great optimized, running with a 970 and i5 4670k maxed out at 60 fps with no frame drops. If you really like open world stealth action games just buy it and i am sure you won`t regret it. The only problem with the game might be that the k/m controls are not so great but i expect most people are using xbox 360 controllers like myself so that`s the only concern that i have. Also, i have finished chapter 1 and i only have 1% game completion so imagine that the amount of hours you could get out of this game would be more than 100 at least. 10/10

The last MGS game I played was MGS: Guns of the Patriots on PS3, that game was amazing. Having played this game & not knowing much about it before hand nor did I play Ground Zero, I've got to say that this is probably the greatest stealth game made.

The game not only looks beautiful & is well optimised (running at a stable 60fps @ 2560 x 1440 on a GTX 970) but is a pleasure to play. There are tons of missions and side missions for you to immerse yourself in as well as a base building mechanic which can be quite time consuming on its own.

I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a rich single player experince who is willing to invest quite a few hours into the game in order to fully experince it. In additon to the rich, story driven single player missions, there is also a multiplayer aspect to the game in which players can attack/defend their base or another players (mother) base.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
Well guys, so this is the epic end of a 28 years old franchise, the great and epic end that this franchise deserve, or that is what the trailers said... I'm not going to lie, if you ask me if i recommend this game, **** YES, this game is great in all parts.

PROS

+ Good story (more less).
+ Incredible addictive open-world gameplay.
+ Good sound effects.
+ Exceptional soundtrack (but they don't use it, don't ask me why).

That were the positive things

I met the Devs at GamesCom 2014. Around noon on Friday they sat me down in front of a PC and had me try the game - apparently I did well (I looked at the goblin before attacking it and noticed it had first strike). After a merry but short romp through the introduction dungeon, which ended with a green blob of slime eating my poor adventurer, I went on to explore the rest of the Indie Megabooth. Friday night though, before I went to sleep, I knew there was a bit of unfinished business: I bought the game, and not just because the developers are great guys (but that too).

The game delivers what it promisses: bite sized adventures you can play during a break. The other day I had 15 minutes to spare: 10 of those were used by a berserker clearing a swamp of monsters.
It may look like a simple game, but it has a suprising amound of depth, with many abilities, items and other things that lead to multiple ways to tackle dungeons and may have you adapting your strategy based on what you encounter.
And there is a lot to encounter. Just when you think you have seen all the races, seen all the classes, you find one more. Then you check the journal and see just how much you haven't seen yet (I found it more fun not to check how much I am missing so as not to spoil the pleasure of finding something new).

But how do you play? Simple: you select a dungeon to explore and write an adventuring permit. The permit is the character creation" process of that dungeon. For example it could say: To [dungeon name]

I picked this game up not knowing exactly what to expect.

It is part RPG, part roguelike, part math.

It frequently makes me feel a bit dumb.

The problem is that I really, really enjoy playing it.

Desktop Dungeons
It's Minesweeper with a theme.  A nearly perfectly executed puzzle game which captures in an abstract way the dungeon crawling roguelikes which have sprung up like kobolds in the indie market.  You can finish a dungeon in five minutes if you're the impatient sort or if like me you like to mull over optimal moves, a board might take  fifteen minutes or so.  There is a light and humorous background story to give the puzzles a campaign-like structure but War and Peace it ain't.  Which isn't a problem at all as this is the type of game which you'll load up when you have some random time to kill.  You will unlock various ways to customize each dungeon, such as starting equipment, races, classes, gods, etc.  The graphics are cute, the gameplay is tight, the music is not annoying.  If you like puzzle games and think you would enjoy a deconstruction of a dungeon roguelike, then buy this game.  It is practically flawless.

Desktop Dungeons
If you're reading this, you're either wondering whether you should get this game, or you already own it but like to froth at the mouth as you experience opinions that don't match your own.  I understand.

Desktop Dungeons is a somewhat randomized puzzle game cleverly disguised as a roguelite rpg.  It's also incredibly brutal.  That aside (or possibly because of it), I found the game enjoyable in that bring out your inner masochistic rage junkie" kinda way.  A single mistake can cost you the level

Desktop Dungeons
I agonized for days over buying this because I just wasn't sure it'd be fun.  It is fun, and the tutorials are very helpful.

The big appeal for me was, easy in, easy out, and skirmishes finished in around under hour.  I just can't commit to days of playing games that are skirmish-like in nature.

I'm looking forward to playing this quite a bit.

Desktop Dungeons
I guess I was expecting more RPG and less Strategy because this game seemed to me to be too difficult to be fun.

It starts out easy, you have to clear single-screen 'dungeons' that are tough but defeatable.  By the time I had finished the tutorials (and even some of those I had to cheat and look for solutions on youtube) that was the end of any successful dungeon clearing that I was able to do.

Game in a nutshell is: The playfield is dark except where your character begins.  You always begin at level 1 but can choose your race/class and optionally pay some ingame gold for starting equipment (example: a shield that reduces all damage by 2).  You are placed on the screen and have to move around uncovering the darkened squares and ultimately defeat the level 10 boss of the dungeon.   Sounds fun right?

The only way to heal yourself and your mana (used for skills found as you explore the dungeon) are potions or uncovering darkened dungeon squares.  Both are in limited supply.

The 'casual' rating of this game is true in the time required to play sense, but if you don't exploit every single weakness of every enemy, and if you don't kill higher level enemies for the bonus exp (which is harder than it sounds, again, very limited healing) you have no chance of killing the level 10 boss monster.

Because every move counted so much, and because ultimately it takes a lot of moves to clear a dungeon, I found myself getting frustrated at how incapable I found myself of clearing a dungeon.  I'd get to level 8 or 9 and simply not be able to kill enough enemies at that point without dying, to get to level 10 or have enough of a stockpile of potions for the final boss of each dungeon.

So, instead of surely dying to the higher level boss, I would exit the dungeon, able to keep whatever gold I found in there and selling off the potions for 50-60 gold, take away 10-15 it costs for the items you bring with you.  At that point I was looking at minimum 500 gold upgrades to unlock anything more fun about the game, and I decided to uninstall and give up on the game because there was no other difficulty setting.

If that kinda game sounds fun more power to you but I was looking for a much more casual game, as in not an intense experience.  I wanted to shut my brain off for a bit but this took all of my concentration and was, for me, not a fun game to play in hindsight.

I see why people like this game I really do but this game isn't for me. That being said Steam asks if I would recommend this game to people, my answer is yes but not to everyone. See the game has plenty of replay value as evidenced by a whole bunch of other reviewers putting in much more time than I did. However if you're like me and enjoy more traditional rpgs then this game isn't for you. The graphics are standard roguelike graphics with chracter pieces not sprites added in. The music is very catchy and fun. This game can be like an extremely quick and complex version of D&D or an even more complex and long game similar to D&D. This game is well made while being easy on the surface it takes a bit to master it. If I were basing this review off of my experience alone I'd give it a 6/10 just because it isn't my kind of game. However seeing the game from a reviewers standpoint and looking at how the athstetics and gameplay contribute to the game as a whole I give it an 8.75/10 it's the type of game that demands patience and persistance. If you have the time invest into this baby, lord knows she desereves it... But I'm not the type of gamer that's ready for that type of commitment sorry Desktop Dungeons but I think you should see other gamers.

At first, I didn't enjoy this game. It seemed fairly random, simple, and frustrating. About 10 or so hours in, I started to understand how the game actually works. Then, things started to click. The game ultimately, is a puzzle game, and a very unforgiving, but rewarding one. Utilize your blackspace effectively, monsters are a resource, leveling up is a resource not to be wasted.

Having to kill 1 Level 10 boss seemed daunting, but when you think you've finally learned how to do it, they then throw 2 Level 10 bosses at you! How the hell am I supposed to beat that? But guess what? I did it. I was thinking, sweet, I know how to play this game. Then, the next set of dungeons appear. Defeat 3 Level 10 bosses. No way, impossible. how the hell do you do that? An hour later, the first of those dungeons falls. The next thing I know, I have to kill 10 of these bosses? IMPOSSIBLE, and do it 3 times with 3 different classes?

Every time you think you've learned what to do, the game surprises and challenges you to do 1 better. The quest system does get a bit grindy at times, and I have mixed feelings about the lockering system, but this is a great game that's not often on sale, but if you enjoy puzzle games, this will definitely fit the bill.

Desktop Dungeons
A very interesting game that can be very difficult, but yet still enjoyable. From the screens and videos I wasn't sure this was a game I'd like, but I'm glad I tried it.

The difficulty is like FTL's, you get pummeled and you just want to keep trying until you succeed. There's quite a bit of diversity in the game with a ton of race-class options. Beyond the varying difficulty dungeon runs, there are additional challenges and quests. To top it all off, you get to build a little city for succeeding in your adventures, opening up even more options.

Dungeons seem to take 10-30 minutes to run, so you can play for short periods of time or long.

Desktop Dungeons
Talk about unlimited content! You can still find new things to do in the game even after 500 hours. Desktop Dungeons is about as close to a real roguelike as you're going to get on Steam, and doing a damn fine job at it. Procedural map generation, turn-based combat, tile grids and permadeath are all present. Punishingly difficult, but really rewarding as well. Makes hours just fly by.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is exactly the type of indy game i like.
It starts simple enough with one dungeon and your lonely weak guard, but offers great complexity and variety.
Add to this the humour, which takes a stab at every rpg cliche, and the nearly unending replayability, DD makes the ideal mix of puzzle/strategy/rpg hybrid.

It also offers the possibility to just do a quick game and play one dungeon at a time, but can suck you as easily in and you can waste some hours with the just the next quest" addiction.

The only thing i am missing would be a possibility to reuse your heroes

Desktop Dungeons
I was wary of this.  I played a ton of alpha, even after I had unlocked everything and finished all the levels.  It was a lot of fun, and I appreciated the minimalism of the game.  I paid for the advance copy something like three years ago, played the game, then stopped and sort of put it behind me for a while.

Then, just a couple weeks ago, I saw that it was released on steam.  While I thought about looking up my copy of it, minutes later I received a message saying because I paid in advance I got a steam key!

So, I cracked it open.  And for a brief minute, I was shocked.  This isn't the blocky spreadsheet I remember!  Where did all these graphics come from?  Why are these characters saying things?  A town?  I miss my grid of things!

Of course I got over that quick.  What I wasn't sure about is what changes there would be, and after playing about 10 hours of the game, I am excited to say that I think they've put an amount of polish on top that has made the game even more nuanced, more complex and overall, well, more.

The base aspects of the game are the same.  You are in a dungeon with monsters levels 1-10.  Killing them nets XP, but killing monsters of a higher level than you gets you exceptionally more experience.  And you will need to kill higher level monsters, because otherwise you are unlikely to level high enough to kill the boss.  Lucky for you, the monsters are pretty lacksadaisical and tend to just stand around in the same spot, and won't strike unless you strike first.

It also has a clever mechanic where revealing tiles in the dungeon is the prime method of regaining life and mana (aside from leveling, which refills all your life and mana). The monsters also refill their life, though, so you can't just take anything out by regaining your life over and over.

It sounds simple, but when you count class skills, items, gods and so many other factors, there is just so much to this game.  And the random generation of levels makes every game, even of just random games, a thrill and a different experience.  And I love the way they build level by level as you experience more and more - the learning curve here is a big improvement on the original which pretty much threw you right into the fray and you had to guess what would be hard or easy.  Frankly, that never bothered me because a game like this that lets you take your time, you learn in your own way, but I appreciate what they've done here.  It opens up pretty fast anyway, and I think your particular sense of play can lead you towards certain classes as the most fun or interesting.

So basically.  I'd recommend this.  A lot.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is a turn based roguelike with a little bit of a difference; each run in a dungeon takes about five minutes to come to conclusion. You are free to roam around the dungeon as much as you want, enemies will only attack you if you attack them first, giving you the freedom to work out your strategy however you prefer.

Graphics are the usual 2d style which we are seeing so much of these days, but the sprites are nicely designed with some well-known characters thrown in there such as Super Meat Boy. The UI can be a little daunting to begin with but you see all of the information you require within one click.

Each of the individual levels are randomly generated; this adds to the replayability of the game as no dungeon will ever be the same; I believe each dungeon has its own set theme" but what is included in the dungeon and how its laid out is completely random. The difficulty is something to be said for though

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is a simple game like chess, easy to figure out and goals are very clear, however just like chess mastery of this game could take a vast amount of time.

Its also got goats, you like goats right?

I am someone who loves the more challenging and strategic games out there such as FTL and the Banner Saga. Even though Desktop Dungeons are both these things, I am going to tell you why you should not purchase this game (even at sale). Desktop Dungeons is a game that exhibits a little of roguelike quality into a strategy game that is mainly about killing the boss for each dungeon." You start off with availability to one class and one race and slowly progess by upgrading your town to obtain more classes/races/items/bonuses/etc.. The progression in Desktop Dungeons is fine. The game never forces you to use the same class or race at any prolonged period of time. Because of this

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons has honestly got to be one of the best games of its kind, in my opinion.  If a roguelike where you have to carefully plan out every action you make sounds interesting to you, I would certainly recommend picking up this game.  I certainly have loads of fun playing it.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is an entertaining indie game that combines a variety of aspects from RPG, strategy, and puzzle games.  As the ruler of a kingdom, you construct buildings and recruit heroes to do your bidding for you.  The buildings themselves offer unique perks to improve the efficiency of your kingdom while you take control of a hero as you send them out into the further reaches of your lands on quests.

Each quest that you undertake is an entire adventure in itself.  Your hero starts at level 1 and you are capable of leveling them all the way to level 10 during the course of the map.  Each level drastically improves the capabilities of your character and there are plenty of beneficial boosts and magical items to find along the way.

Your buildings, on the other hand, offer options such as crafting magical gear, unlocking one of the many unique classes, adding additional boosts and content to encounter on your adventures, and even new races - all of which have their own stats that significantly alter the playstyle of -every- class.

The quests themselves are turn-based and give you all the time you need to execute the strategy of your choice.  You'll have to manage your health, mana, and experience as you try to maximize your gains and minimize your losses.  The game is unforgiving, though, very rewarding when you successfully pull off a dungeon and drag home a mountain of treasure.

I recommend this game to fans of turn-based RPGs, fantasy worlds, and strategy/puzzle gamers.  I found it to be far more enjoyable than I was expecting.  If you're on the fence, give it a try!

Desktop Dungeons
Definitely one of the best games for people who enjoy a thorough mental challenge.
It is one of those case, where a few rules lead to an immense variety in gameplay and it is for the player to find out what works and what doesn't.

Desktop Dungeons
A pleasurable timesink! The 1,000th hour playing this game feels just as joyful as the first. At the surface, it looks like the marriage between a roguelike retro dungeon-crawler and a casual kingdom manager strategy game; though if you have the patience to dig deeper, you'll come to appreciate its unique balance and variety. Great for quick casual games, though there are also some multi-stage quest dungeons later on that can challenge even those who are apt at strategy games!

Desktop Dungeons
Extremely addictive Rogue-like randomly generated dungeon crawler that, at heart, is a strategic puzzle game. It implements the unique mechanic of exploration as regeneration, meaning that the unexplored areas of a map are a finite resource that must be used wisely. Lots of race and class combinations and many dungeons and challenges make for endless replayability. As of this review, I have played over 60 hours and I still feel like I have a lot to learn and that I am improving.

Great retro art style and soundtrack/effects combined with the fantasy genre make for a great atmosphere. But be warned, this game is not for everyone - the difficulty level ramps up to the point that it really requires the gamer to do further research via forums and wiki articles for the best strategies, as the tutorials are slightly lacking. You will die - a lot. Thankfully most levels only last an average of 15 minutes. If you feel like you can go no further in the level, you can leave the dungeon and take all the goodies you have found with you.

If you are a fan of games that require some nerdy research (like terraria, crusader kings 2, blood bowl) I would definitely seek this one out. Watch some of the Let's Plays on Youtube to get a feel for the game.

Due to the difficulty, when I actually pass a tough level the feeling can only be described as or.gas.mic. Maybe the closest feeling would be beating a really hard super meat boy level.

By the way, I have rarely felt as though the randomization was unfair. In 95% of cases, the map is definitely beatable as long as you have a very strong grasp on the strategy involved for each class and race, as well as the best way to approach bosses. I have played levels I deemed impossible, only to completely change my strategic thinking and end up beating the level with nearly every single attempt.

Is the game worth the price tag? I'd say yes given the hours played. As a bonus, you can actually play this game on the desktop dungeons website (without using steam) by making an account with them and linking it to steam. It saves the game into a cloud and transfers it over to steam. Once I discovered this feature I have been able to play at work on the sly (like I said, I love this game). If you know a friend who owns this game, ask them to set up an account at the website and you can try out the game before purchasing!

Desktop Dungeons
Damn hard. That's what Desktop Dungeons is. Even the easiest dungeons take many tries to finish. This game mixes basic RPG elements with roguelike quests/levels. If you die while trying to complete a quest you have to start all over again. Now, many of the battles (at least in the beginning) can be finished within minutes, provided you know exactly what to do. Completing quests earns you money to unlock and upgrade new classes, and of course, this will unlock new quests for you. All of this should make the game a little easier.

But the game might just be a bit too hard because I couldn't even complete 3 quests. And while I still had a good time playing it (mainly because of the short levels) I think the game isn't always well balanced. It requires dedication and effort, -two characteristics I actually possess- but if you have the feeling that you aren't making any progress it's time to quit.

Still, a very good and fun game, once and if it clicks, but beware of the difficulty (spikes).

[Rating: 72/100]

Desktop Dungeons
I played the original alpha freeware version of DD years and years ago, and I loved it. The strategy and careful planning, combined with many choices in which the player must weigh opportunity costs, appealed to me as someone who enjoys both puzzle games and roguelikes. This market version, however, is a bit disappointing.

Almost immediately I noticed that the quick and seamless gameplay of the original has been replaced with lots of flashy graphics and animations, most of which are far too long and prevent input until they have finished playing. While these animations are relatively short, the slowness becomes noticeable the longer you play. Those little microseconds add up. Yes, this is a turn-based game in which you cafrefully think through your decisions, but let's be honest-- the first 2/3 of every session is pretty much blasting through the weak monsters or exploring in hopes of finding the right item with the RNG. The real magic of the original was in the last 1/3, when things start to get tense and you really have to plan ahead. So it's frustrating when this version forces you to slow down at the part that deserves to be sped through.  These slow animations carry over to the menus as well, and it's  exacerbated by the dull, mediocre banter which tries too hard to be funny, and which takes forever to skip.

And of course, there are tutorial levels you can't skip. Really? Really?? This is 2014 and you are still making unskippable tutorial levels?

Perhaps the newest feature of this version is the introduction of the gold-to-buy-buildings (which then unlock new heroes or give small upgrades) system. There was absolutely zero reason to add this, because they do the exact same thing as simply completing the challenges in the original alpha. At least in the alpha, you didn't have to click through twelve haphazardly scattered menus-- once you beat the dungeon, the next level or hero was unlocked automatically. Seriously, why even add this?

The artwork is polished, but the style is just ugly. There is really nothing redeeming about it. While the alpha had simple, easily distinguishable 16-bit pixel graphics, this version tries way too hard to be detailed. It's like staring into those gross Ren & Stimpy  or Spongebob Squarepants closeups for hours on end! No one wants to do that. The music is also unmemorable-- it sounds like generic stock medieval fantasy music, versus the ominous, synthy fanfare of the original; it says a lot when a 5 second introductory song is more appealing than an entire soundtrack.

Lastly, I want to talk about how QCF Design has trolled other indie developers. Back when DD was still in development, League of Epic Heroes, a game by a single dev on iOS, got a cease and desist and was threatened with a lawsuit for copying" the gameplay concept. At the time

Desktop Dungeons
Don't be afraid of the price.
This game is marvelous in evey aspect. Beautiful art-work, nice music and a great gameplay that never gets old! It's a mix of puzzle and tactics with roguelike elements, random dungeons and plenty of quests. It have imense replayability, as you have in-game achievements that keep the game fresh for a long time.


Desktop Dungeons
I'm kind of torn on this game.  It's obviously well done and gets great reviews.  That said, I don't enjoy it very much.  I was looking for a game that could I could play quickly on the go or as in between other games and based on the reviews, this seemed to be it.

I've played around 15 hours now, and just don't enjoy it that much.  If you like rogue-like puzzlers then it's probably a good game for you.  For me, it just lacks that balance between depth of gameplay and casual mental involvement.  If you approach this game casually, you'll almost certainly never win (other then the few introductory games); and if you approach it to  win, then it's certainly neither casual.

I also found the depth of gameplay everyone talks about to be a bit lacking.  After getting frustrated, unable to beat even the first normal" dungeons

Desktop Dungeons
I started playing the free version of the game and finally got the steam version. That was a really good choice. My advice: Try the free version, it'll show you the very core of the game. If you like it get the full version.

Pros:

- Problems to solve strategically: Essentially every dungeon is different and you can solve it in many different ways. But, one or two mistakes and you're done. This is the rogue-like aspect of the game. In the start you'll feel very lost but as soon as you play you'll start using the deep mechanics of the game in your advantage.

- Progression and goals to be achieved. Development of your kingdom and uncovering different races, classes, items, etc. through the campaign mode. This is the hook of the game, the RPG aspect, and the way it's done is fantastic.

- Huge replayability. The amount of combinations is just enormous. It's always the same idea: get in the dungeon, kill the boss/es and get out, but the amount of combinations of classes, races, deities, items, layout of the dungeon, level of difficulty of the dungeon, badges achievable, etc make every run different than the previous one.

- Daily dungeon.

- Complex and difficult. This game is all about thinking, the puzzle element is about 70% of the game. I you don't like staring at the screen for a couple of minutes checking your best option then you probably won't like the game. Difficult dungeons take about 20-30 min and you need to be focus all the time.

- Good difficulty curve and very good tutorials.



Cons:

- Can't think of any.



Overall this is an extremely well done game (once you play for a while you'll notice this in the little details). Very original and unique in its way. But remember to try the free version first, this is not a game for everyone.

Desktop Dungeons
I am at 32 hours played and still have not played every map. Not to speak of the huge amount of puzzles and challenges I have barely touched. The game has an achievement for 100h playtime, which I will probably get with normal playtime and without getting burned out on the game. You feel smarter after every beaten dungeon and after every little intended exploit" in the mechanics you find. It gets harder really fast and it takes a while before you understand all of the games concepts and figure out how to play each of the countless classes. I still have not even unlocked all classes

Desktop Dungeons
A hardcore Roguelike-Puzzle."
I know I'm not the first to describe it like that but it's the best way to sum it up. This game is tough as nails but still fair. The music is awesome

Desktop Dungeons
Bite sized puzzle game with some rogue-like elements.

Go on a 10-20 minute dungeon run with a newly generated character with different abilities. At least a different dozen other classes that play very uniquely from all of eachother, since you need to be able to effectively use their abilities to their max capabilities in order to tackle the more difficult dungeons.

There are many hundreds of hours worth of replayability and gameplay in this package due to the extreme variety of challenges.

Desktop Dungeons
There are a lot of neat aspects to this game but what killed it for me is how often you know you have lost before you have lost.  The dungeons are largely an order-of-operations puzzle (so-to-speak) and if you get the order wrong, or some other minor thing wrong, you literally cannot win.  The worst thing is when you're down to the last monsters and you know that you cannot beat them because you have done something wrong several actions ago.  In what I have played it didn't seem like there was a lot of strategic adaptability, very unforgiving.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is an extremely addictive roguelike strategy game where each randomly generated dungeon is, essentially, a puzzle to be solved.

It is easy to pick up and play but there is also a great deal to learn and lots of game mechanics to master.

The short length of each dungeon run means that it is a great game to dip in and out of but you can also play for longer periods of time. There is a longer-term aspect to the game as you unlock new options such as races, classes, challenges and quests.

Different dungeons along with the various race and class choices provide new challenges and the player is often required to update or alter their strategic thinking in order to be successful. This keeps the game fresh and engaging.

Desktop Dungeons has a lot of different race and class combinations plus many different types of dungeons and challenges. There is a high level of replay value and it is a game that you could easily play for hundreds of hours.

I feel that it is a really well made game. The soundtrack, in particular, is excellent. There is also lots of replayability here. I feel that Desktop Dungeons offers excellent value for money and it is well worth picking up if you enjoy this style of game.




Desktop Dungeons
This is a puzzle game. There's no role playing and no significant strategy involved.
Every level is a variation of the same puzzle. The dungeon consists of one tiled screen that's dark. Your character always start at level 1 and must beat a high level dungeon boss. The puzzle is how to level up your character, with limited resources, high enough to beat the boss. Sounds interesting, but there's only one way to do it: beat monsters with higher level than your character. You have a selection of spells, traits and tricks for this goal, and once you figure it out you just have to repeat it. I found the way this plays to be anti-intuitive and contrived.  It's not a terrible game but I can't recommend it.

Desktop Dungeons
A couple years in development, Desktop Dungeons has finally gone gold, and is a ton of fun to play. It's a unique mix of a light roguelike with a puzzler, and definitely exercises your strategy gland (that's a thing, right?). Each level is pretty short, ~10 minutes, so it's good in both short and long bursts. Tons of unlockables, immense replayability and staying power, light kingdom building aspects and lots of strategic depth add up to make this one a winner. The developers continue to improve upon it as well, which is always a good sign. The free alpha" version on their website is basically the precursor to this game

Amazing puzzler, there is simply no count to the number of hours to spend optimizing strategy and characters. Frustrating, in a good way.

It's like a more complex version of Minesweeper. The video on the store page actually describes it pretty well.

Hard to describe Desktop Dungeons. It's strictly a puzzle game, and a challenging one at that. Yet, the progress you make, the items you collect, the monsters you encounter, etc. etc. all *feels* very much like an RPG. Very well done. I've more than gotten my money's worth out of this gem.

Desktop Dungeons
I came into this game expecting a roguelike but instead got a puzzle game with roguelike elements. The puzzle elements force the game mechanics to be stringent to the point where making a single mistake will ruin your attempt to finish a stage, and the roguelike elements randomize everything to the point where you can't really plan ahead and you seemingly just have to hope for a good roll of the stage you're playing so you can even consider finishing it in the first place.

Desktop Dungeons
A really great game with tons of replayability, you won't find a better value game.  The game is humerous, can be tense, is highly strategic, turn based but can be played relatively quickly.  One of my favorite games.

This is a brutal puzzle game wrapped in a Dungeon Hack theme.  Since combat is almost entirely non random, you need to CAREFULLY pick your fights to space out injuries, healing, and leveling up.  This is a brain burner.

Oh, to make it more painful.  The natural way to heal or gain mana back is to explore the map, so you will use up the map over time as well.  It's hard, very hard, to win.

Desktop Dungeons
Brilliant game, best described as a mix of dungeon crawling and puzzling.
Its basically about solving" small dungeons

Desktop Dungeons
A great rogue-like rpg/puzzle hybrid with hours of gameplay value.

Pros:
+ Artwork: All functioning, no roughness, all easy on the eye
+ Soundtrack: Even its short, repetition doesnt bore you
+ Gameplay: Every dungeon is a puzzling challenge. Solving something always rewards. Many progression aspects for further gameplay.
+ Mechanics: Everything works as it is meant to be. Didnt encounter any bugs. Puzzle system is superb!

Cons:
- Sometimes a randomly generated dungeon might be too hard or impossible to solve. (Even tho' you can exit the dungeon forehand and carry your earnings, even losing is rewarding.)
- Even the game is cool and all, i find its price a little bit much.


If you want a good puzzle game (with rpg-roguelike spice on it), this is the game for you. Dont miss this one.

What can I say? I really loved the style of artwork portrayed in this game. This game initally starts off very addicted and emerssive. But that only lasted for an extremely short amount of time, leaving me unfulfilled and extremely unsatisfied with my purchase. It's not the gameplay or the game mechanics fault this time as to why it got old fast. This time the culprit was the difficulty. After the inital first few dungeons and extreme enjoyment, the game throws you in a hell hole of a metaphoric toxic goo and pretty much tells you to learn how to swim through it without dying. The tutorials they offer" (using the word "offer" very loosely) are not very great tutorials. Instead

Desktop Dungeons
I've played this game for 16 hours, the first 10 of which were a blast...very addictive and fun.

But unfortunately I must echo what others have said.  The game gets confusing/hard/tricky at a certain point and even after reading hints and tip online I couldn't make any progress.

Ultimately, very frustrating as it's such a great game idea and well done.

I've been hoping they will patch" it and provide a fix for everyone but I'm not holding my breath.

So

Desktop Dungeons
Very disappointed with this game and have no idea why it is largely getting good reviews. It claims to be a roguelike like but apart from the presentation it is simply an incredibly boring, repetitive, unforgiving puzzle game.

While the game is based in a dungeon, the enemies never actually attack you unless you attack them. They just sit there! You do nothing more than walk around the dungeon picking which enemies to attack and which to leave till later. The only way you die is when you've run out of options and basically have to commit suicide.

The art style is grotesque and is reminicent of the hideous zoomed in images of something gross from Ren and Stimpy. If you try to run the game beyond its native tiny windowed resolution its looks even worse... somehow

I'm pretty  off I paid for this game, and I got it on special. Don't make the same mistake I did and play a real roguelike instead.

Oh and the interface sucks balls.



Desktop Dungeons
I have played this game for years - even way back when the graphics were much poorer/different quality. I really like the game, but honestly it is just too difficult (and check out the games I own - I do not shy away from difficult games). I have spent many hours playing this, but could never figure out how to get 'good at it'.

I cannot recommend a purchase unless you try the free version (the oldschool one) and really like that.

Desktop Dungeons
This is not a roguelike. It's a clever puzzle game disguised as an RPG. While it has potential, it falls short in that single mistakes, or just a badly placed bad guy on a random map level can cause you to lose the whole map, regardless of what else you do.

The Good
- This is a truly hard game. If you like hard puzzles, this gives it in spades.
- The artwork and voice work is nice.

The Bad
- This game is frustrating when you lose making no mistakes. That's fine in real life a game shouldn't have unwinnable situations unless it's the Kobayashi Maru.
- Despite having multiple characters, playing gets grindy really quickly. You either get a good random map or a bad one.
- You lose your character and money spent each round. You level up by buying houses which allow you to buy add-ons.
- All these taken together give the game a pay to win type of feel like many casual games, but isn't one.

I wanted to like this game, but after playing I found myself both bored and frustrated. For some people this is going to be a good game, for those looking for a rogue-like, dungeon crawl, this is not that.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons est un puzzle game dguis en roguelike. L'illusion est tellement bien fichue que l'on a plus l'impression de jouer  un dungeon crawler light qu' un rel puzzle game. Rajoutez  a un humour trs sympa, une dure de vie colossale avec deux millions de choses  faire et des graphismes accrocheurs, bien que le jeu tourne malheureusement en une rsolution moisie genre 640 par mes couilles, comme en 1994, remember.

In regards to the negative reviews:
If this is not the way that you remember the original three Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, with bad physics and all, then please tell me what games you were playing and remembering. If this HD remaster has ruined" your childhood memories so much

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I am a person who LOVES Tony Hawk games. I've played and beaten every single one, (Save Ride & Project 8, but do those really count?) so I was super stoked to try this one out.
this was not made clear to me, so I'm going to bold this out for people;
THIS IS NOT A PORT OR GRAPHICAL UPDATE, IT IS A NEW ENGINE WITH THE SAME MAPS
why is this such a big deal? It feels different. For someone who spent 100's of hours with THPS 1 & 2 this is a huge deal. It just doesn't play the same, and that breaks it for me. There are just so many things wrong with this game.
-only single player available
-no re-mapping controls
-the only graphics option is to change your resolution
-they've taken out the option to skip  songs (why?) & They've added a lot of new ones that suck.
-They've taken out the park editor from thps2
-I run into physics glitches all the time

A port or re-release of the original games even with no HD update would have been 900X better than this, this is a poorly made, rushed-feeling wanna be remake of a classic that deserves better.

What DO I recommend? Buy or download one of the official tony hawk PC releases, or buy a Dreamcast of Craigslist and google how to burn the games yourself.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
In a day before games kept track of hours played, I'd estimate my time spent across the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) series in the 1000s of hours.  I fully completed and became proficient at games 1-8 in the series.  At the time, I thought 8 (the first entry on the PS3) was so poor that I couldn't bring myself to suffer through 9.  And then I played this disaster, which makes the constant issues/glitches in 8 feel like I was complaining about nothing.

Let's cut right to the chase.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is not the same game as the old THPS games.  The game was rebuilt from the ground up and does not feel like the old series.  While the PS2 iterations became progressively less inspired and lazy as the numbers climbed to 5, 6, 7, at least the game always FELT the same.  This feels totally different and the best way I can describe it is clunky.  I made an effort to max Tony Hawk's stats because I thought maybe it feels like garbage because my stats are so low."  I got close

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I want to tell you to buy this because its a lot of fun.  I want to tell you about all the nostalgia.

I don't want to tell you about the lack of multiplayer.  I don't want to tell you about the poor and sometimes buggy physics.

I enjoy this game, its okay, but nothing special.  Buy it for nostalgia and nothing else.

The best skating game on the PC in the past 5 years.

It's most likely also the only skating game for the PC in the past 5 years.

Childhood memory desecration simulator

The physics are glitchy and broken, you don't even need to buy the THPS3 Revert pack to get revert since its now implented in the game completely. That means in the revert pack, you're basically paying 5$ for a few THPS3 levels. Coming from a THPS veteran, I would say this game is mediocre and not worth your time. Maybe for some laughs, but the Unreal engine is the wrong engine for this game. RIP Neversoft.

EDIT: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is bad as well. Thanks for killing the series Robomodo

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Faithful to a fault, and doesn't live up to the potential this could've had.  I'm only an hour in, but I'm confident that's an accurate portrayal of the game.

This (with it's DLC) feels more or less like a mish-mash of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, 2 and 3 with HD graphics.  If they had taken everything from these games and thrown it into one amazing release, it probably would've done better critically.  Instead they hand picked certain levels, hand picked certain skaters, lost a good chunk of the original soundtracks (mostly due to licensing issues), ditched the multiplayer found in the originals (local or online), ditched any kind of create-a-skater and called it a day.  It doesn't feel like the complete" collection it could've been.  Like a greatest hits collection from a band that doesn't include all of their biggest songs

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Horrendously buggy, awful physics and lacking in the charm that Tony Hawks' games used to always deliver on. Feels more like a tech demo 'what if' than a full release game, but I guess the only thing in its favour is the low price.

I bought this for nostalgia, but all I found was despair.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
The Tony Hawk series was once one of th sports titles to look out for every year. However, after the seventh installement, the series went in idiotic directions with a pack-in skateboard that was worse than the Wii Balance Board. After 2 failed games that were playable with that board, Activision decided it was best to go back to the roots of the series. Remaking some of the levels of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and packaging them together as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD. The idea is great, but they screwed it up.

The controls suck. I tried to play this game with a keyboard and with a controller, but both times the game did not feel as smooth as the originals did. There are a lot of glitches and the graphics are horrible. I also wondered why they didn't just remake every level instead of just a few.

This PC-port is the worst. You cannot change the keyboard controls, there are no video options to speak of, the resolution is not even Full HD and there is NO Multiplayer... really?? I grabbed the old Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 box for PC from my shelf and that version had Online Multiplayer... that was 1999.

If you're curious about the Tony Hawk series or you're a fan.. in either case, stay away.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
It is horrible. It feels nothing like the original, characters are floaty, no multiplayer, no video settings, ONLY RESOLUTION, and awkward response times. Stay far away!

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Man, wasn't this game a massive disappointment. As someone who loves THPS 2-4, this game was a huge letdown. First of all, the controls are absolutely trash, and you CANNOT rebind them. They really should have just stuck to the THPS2 controls, as those felt absolutely fine, but here trying to do tricks just comes off as awkward. Second, they add some of the worst maps from THPS 1 & 2 (Mall, Downhill Jam, Venice Beach mainly). Third, reverts came in a DLC, which is unforgivable. Reverts are what made vert viable for combos past just ending them. Not adding them makes grab tricks almost useless. all of this, and the game doesn't even look that good, it looks like it could have been made 2007-2008. Dont bother with THPS HD, it's not very good, and will only make you want to play the originals. It feels as if little time and effort went into this reboot which could have been great had it just been a new THPS game that returned to it's roots of fun, satisfying arcade styled gameplay.

4/10

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
If you miss the old school THPS this will be a nice nostalgic romp.
It contains multiple levels and characters from the first few games with those same controls and functions perfectly with my controller.
I know people have their complaints, but really all I can whine about is:
Why the hell isn't this on Steam Workshop? Seriously, I miss the old level editor on THPS2.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Worst. Remake. Ever.

- Default control setup is changed to some seriously ed up settings, and you can't change them from the game (editing configuration files you can, but is that really something to be expected from game this new?
- Maps are ed up (smaller, uglier and full of bugs)
- No character editing, map editing, or any freaking options. You can change resolution and sound volume. This is not a potatobox360, this is PC. This is unforgiveable.
- Added only  music, and you can't skip them.

+ Original songs also included. That's the only good thing in this game.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
They updated the graphics but downgraded the gameplay. The original THPS2 gameplay felt way better than this HD remakes gameplay. E.g. they somehow couldn't get proper nollie flips done. Basically you do a nollie but then the flip animation is the one of a regular flip trick. Although I undestand that this issue isn't noticable or bothering for many players, to me it is a major flaw. Especially if you consider that THPS2 already did its flip trick animations perfectly fine 12 years before this remake was made. I would choose playing the old graphics with the old gameplay of THPS2 over the ones of the remake any time.
Summarizing my experience with THPS HD, I can't say it was worth the time. To me it is nothing but a pretty lazy remake and an even lazier try to cash in on the good name of the old THPS titles.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This buggy piece of crap is an insult to the original series. Worse than any other THPS game and highly not recommended !

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
If you are an old school type of guy who played Pro Skater series in your childhood all the way till now, you will be heavily dissapointed in what this game is. An abdomination with only the character names being the link to previous titles. It does not deserve to be called a Pro Skater game.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Being a fan of the classic TH games I had to check this one out.  THPSHD uses maps from TH1 and 2 (not counting the DLC in this review) as well as the placement of objectives in this undignified remaster. After hearing me say undignified, you may think that I resent this game and think that it should burn in hell for all eternity. IMO, I do not, but it seriously lacks the dignity and respect that Neversoft originally had for the series back in its hayday.

First things first, I bought this game when it was on steam sale for $5, so pricing is not an issue on that end, especially when Robomodo (the developers that took over the TH franchise since TH Ride) sold TH5 for $60, a unhinged pile of . At first i was going to let this one pass as a silly game that would eventually be fixed in the long run, until they pulled the same  on the full retail priced game. But enough of the price on this, lets dive in to the actual game.

the good: For the most part it is a classic TH game with all obectives pretty much in the same place and alot of classic 90s tunes like Superman make a return. Another thing to note is the return of the upgrade with cash system that was used in TH2, which is a nice return to form, also there is an upgraded roster, but lets be honest, if certain skaters are missing, im less likely to care. The last thing i say that is good are the returning levels, like The Warehouse(TH1), The School(TH2),  and The Hanger(TH2). I wish there was more good i could say about it, but that would pretty much be lying at this point.

The Bad: For such a game that could of taken the best ideas from the classic games, Robomodo (and Activision) decided to go the cheap route and make this game as short and barren as they possibly could to maximize profit. This makes me sad because the classics had much replayablility without feeling as repetitive. First thing I am going to hit, is how barren the game is, which is only seven levels long... Seriously... seven? That's it? No Roswell, NM? or Outer space? No Skate street?  Um.. okay. Unfortunately, thats not how shallow this game is. Remember multiplayer back in the ps1 days? Yeah those days are gone. Remember Leaderboards? Yeah, i do too... and its not in here either...How about creating your own skate park? Forget about it! Creating your own skater?  off! Wanna know what we get instead?  Big Head Survival, which is meh okay, and Hawkman...totally sucks. But wait, we havent even gotten to the best part! The physics engine! Oh man...suuuuuucks. Wtf do you think you're doing robomoto? Making a satire of Goat Simulator? I'll admit it's really funny at first, but it gets really tiresome after an hour.

One last thing, which i wont let effect my scoring of this game, but there was one level I left off of the list because i was so disappointed by what was done to it. Marsailles, France used to be my favorite level with how it was a tournament like level between you and the npcs (which you never see skate) that lasts a minute each run and you have to use your best tricks to outbeat your opponent. Well what do you get if you win? Well, a cash prize and a gold medal, which lead to future rewards. Turning my favorite level into a bland objective made me run out of steam in the end and i stopped giving a .

Overall, if you want to check this one out, wait until it is on sale for $5, or better yet, if you own a ps3, buy the classics used for $5 or less on amazon or ebay, and know what true classics are instead of living in a pipe dream with this one.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This game got a lot of bad rap when it came out. Why? No multiplayer. Does anyone remember playing multiplayer in any of Tony Hawk's previous games? No. They don't. Sure, there's no create-a-park or -skater modes, but that's why it's 15 dollars. Buy this if you want to sate that inner-skater that has lied dormant since 2005.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
A incredibly mediocre Port/Remake of the first 2 THPSs, it's buggy, barely has any content and the content that is there isn't that great (Venice is the worst ing level why is it always a recurring level???).

Also Reverts are seperate DLC so amusingly Tony Hawk himself is actually one of the worst characters without stat points because you can't combo in Verts.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This game ruined my childhood, Don't you think about touching this game. It's dreadful remake & THPS will never be the same again after playing this poop.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
An old popular skateboarding game got a remake recently, Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD. Negatively received in countless sites is it really disappointing? Read on to find out!
Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD is a skateboarding game developed by Robomodo. This game takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience for the PC.

You probably remember playing this masterpiece with your friends overnight just to hit that perfect combo and feel awesome. Now in stunning visuals, the game tries hard to deliver perfection but falls short at times - stick with me while I explain why.

Gameplay:This game is all about skating around the levels, mastering ramps, nailing those tricks and ultimately stacking up the biggest combo to earn the best score you can. The game kicks off with a variety of old faces to choose from with the worlds biggest skate pros round out the cast including: Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and of course -Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has over 8 boards, 3 special moves, and an alternate outfit.

Normally you start the career, choose a level and spawn at a fixed place in that level. From there, you  skate and explore around the level to find things you need to complete a task from your list of objectives. Once you complete a certain number of tasks, the next level unlocks ready to be skated out.

Each level has its own unique tasks to complete, once you complete them you earn cash with which you can buy skills, decks or special tricks. Upon completing the whole career mode you'll unlock the second for your character, while another mode unlocks - Projectives mode which requires 100% objective completion across every map (gaps aren't counted). This mode is the same as career mode but offers difficult challenges for those real Pro Skaters.

This game also has the old school free-skate mode where you can explore every unlocked level to find new gaps or hidden areas. Beside free-skate there are also Hawkman and Big Head Survival mode. In Hawkman you have to collect pellets in various ways, they all have different colors and all need a special way to get to clarify this let me explain, red pellets are only collectable during jumps, yellow during grinds, and so on.

In Big Head Survival all you have to do is keep your head growth below 100% or it will explode.. with the typical grow....expand...EXPLODE!. In order to prevent your head from bursting you have to chain combo's and long ones at that otherwise you'll fail and end up without a head not pretty. Both of these modes are great to play because they test your skills and wits. Graffiti mode also makes a return where you gotta nail combos and touch objects, upon completing the combo anything you've touched will change into your characters designated colour, the catch of this mode is to tag more objects than your opponents.

Content:The content of this game is worth for it's price, you get a selection of pro skater levels and it has steam achievements. The new DLC is on it's way.

The length of the game is 10-30 hours, depending on what you do in-game. If you just rush through the career you will finish the game in 10 hours, if you are an achievement enthusiast and want to master everything you'll easily clock 30 hours. Again, it all depends on your personal way of going about with the game.

For me it took 30 hours to get every achievement and game modes (beside hawkman) cleared.

Graphics:The game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo, using Neversofts original level models. All I can say is.. well done Robomodo! We finally have the HD version of the game we've been waiting for (or atleast the die-hard THPS fans). During the exploration of levels you'll just LOVE the sweet and eye-pleasing textures of the game. Everything I remember from the old games is so great to see in HD.

But still there is one thing, just a little thing I didn't like and that is the rag-doll physics in this game. This is just weird, sometimes you just hang around somewhere the other time you have a long neck...you know, graphical glitches.

In the old version when you bailed you'd fall on the ground, grab your board and continue riding, but here when you bail you'll face a white screen and respawn.. I have to say, it's not pretty. Even the blood has been reduced significantly.

Sound:This game has a great soundtrack, it is half classic THPS tracks and half new ones. Still I would love to see more variation of music added and the ability to skip a song like in the old games. Some of the returning tracks are Superman by Goldfinger, Bring the Noise by Public Enemy ft. Anthrax while the newly added tracks are quite good too like Teenage Blood by Apex Manor and many others.


Conclusion:Gameplay: 8/10
+ Addictive if you played the old games
+ Loads of pro-skaters to play with, as well as unlockable bonus skaters
- Sometimes it's hard to complete a level

Content: 6/10
+ Old tony hawk's pro skater levels in HD
+ New game-modes added in singleplayer
+ New upcoming DLC introduces the Revert from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (ETA: December 2012)
- No Multiplayer or LAN (just for the PC version)
- No Scoreboards of friends
- Not able to configure or change your controls / graphic settings (needed to be done through a 3rd party launcher or just change the .ini file)

Graphics: 8/10
+ Great HD upgrade since the old games
- Physics are sometimes weird

Sound: 7/10
+ Great music to listen during skateboarding
- More variation of music

Overall Rating: 7/10
A great skateboard game that all Tony Hawks lovers should play at least once to feel how this game really is.

Loads of people disliked this game but I can't see why. Personally I don't really need a multiplayer in this game just old school skating is enough to keep me happy, you could play it with friends in the same room (just passing the controller to each other). Anyway, if you've enjoyed THPS 1 & 2 it's time to grab the remastered version and relive your childhood, or even if you're a newcomer to the series then this is the best time to start your THPS journey.

NOTE: Old review i wrote for a website.

Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD.

Do I recommend this game?? No.

This game handles like a PC port of a mobile port of a Dreamcast game.

The Unreal Engine makes the unrealistic huge combos much harder, it slows the game down to a half.
The Tony Hawk games are funny because you do stuff you can't do in real life, I can't jump off a roof and do a 720 Melon into a Manual, but i can sit down for a few hours, get a 10 million combo and then be happy with that.
But in this game it feels like a chore, it's just not fun to play Downhill Jam over and over again.

I got 100% achievements in around 8 hours of playing, most of them came easy to me, but I can see some of them being hard to get for people who arent used to the game series.

This does not feel like a mix of the first two Pro Skater games, the mechanics are the same (with reverts added, they came from THPS 3) but it feels more like Project 8 and Proving Ground, fans of the series know that isn't a good thing

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I CANNOT recommend this game. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
Yes, yes new graphics. The graphics are really nice actually but the gameplay and the PHYSICS!
Glitching through Rails, in the ground, random falls.
You need to go into the Config in the Datafiles to change it to a proper Resolution.
No ing Multiplayer/Splitscreen or Create a Park/ -Skater.


Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Simply Awesome!
First of all i played the most Tony Hawks that came out in the past years and if you're looking for an evolution of the Tony Hawks series your wrong in buying this game.

In my Opinion its a nostalgic feeling to play the game. So its not the new and improved skatinggame" but a pretty good remake of some of the elder games with awesome graphics

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This game is kind of fun for the first hour or so, then that is where the cracks begin to show.

I was a big fan of the first 4 games in the series and was looking forward to visiting some of those levels again, and for a while i thought it was okay. Eventually you begin to realise the collision detection is not as it should be and you will find yourself bailing and clipping through walls quite a lot, regardless of how well you executed a trick. When you need to grind specific rails or transfer between certain verts, the game doesn't always detect it properly, which can lead to a lot of frustration. In certain instances i found the game wouldn't detect when i wanted to jump over a vert rather than come back down on it again; other times i would go to grind a rail, end up clipping it, being inside" it and would bail trying to get myself out of it.

The "Big Drop" mechanic seemed really hit or miss a lot too

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
First off, do NOT get this game if you don't have a controller. That being said, it's alright. Not good, just sort of meh".

The game was only $10 usd so I had no problem forking over the cash. Plus

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This IS my Childhood!
If you grew up in the 90's as a teenager this was yours too!!
This game brings some of the best levels from THPS (1999), THPS2 (2000) & THPS3 (2001) and meshes them all together with a *few* new additions to make this the remake made of all wetdreams.

If you don't like this game, it's because it wasn't made for you.
This game was made for the Day 1 Skateboard game players from the 1998 Playstation era. This game came out originally when Marilyn Manson, Deftones, Slipknot, Powerman 5000 & Otep were the best metal bands ever!!!

Play this game with that music and sit your  down for a travel back in time, HD Style!!! This is a remake, graphical wise, but nothing else changed.... that's exactly the way it should be!!!!
_____
8.5/10
_____

CONS:
- Music soundtrack could have been alot better (the left out Papa Roach, Static-X, Mudvayne, Korn and a couple other artist that I know for sure were on the official game soundtracks from back in the day.... hell, they even left out Goldfinger)

- Achievements are poorly put together, the 8 or 9 that they do have are pretty boring to a go after, alot of people may feel like it's not even worht it...

- The Skaters::: why remove some of the Best skaters (Kareem Campbell, Chad Muska and others) and replace them with NON skaters like Metallica frontman James Hetfield and Guitarist Robert Trujillo ???? WHY THE F.UCK did you make a seperate DLC to charge us for Geoff Rowley & Steve Cabellero?????

- They want to take advantage of you: by making you purchase a DLC that gives you 3 levels from THPS 3 and the Revert move.... -_- ... maybe nextime you go to McDonalds they should make you pay for your cheeseburger and then charge you extra for the FU.CKING KETCHUP!!!!!! (as.sholes)

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
can i unbuy this game?


Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Very nice game, you should buy it instantly, graphic and controls nothing more has changed but its very cool, if you want the old controls back follow my guide.

BUY IT!

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Is it terrible? No. But it is a remake that is actually worse than any other.

Usually a remake is taking what was, and adding just enough to make it better. They took alot of the original boarders off, like Kareem Campbell and Bam, and added others I never even heard of.

First play on the first level, I managed to fall on the top of the half pipe going to jump(which in every other game would land perfect) I tripped over air, and fell through the entire floor.

I understand the original didn't have switchs between grinds and manuals, but I would assume a remake would keep it as a improvement.

I would rate this a 6/10. I played so many tony hawk games from first one on n64, to THUG 1 and 2 on ps2. I never played one like this. Pro skater 3 will remain my favorite.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
There are no skateboarding Hawks. do not be fooled

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
If you have nostalgia for the early Tony Hawk games, and believe me no-one has more than me, You might want this game.

You shouldn't get it though. The whole thing feels spongy, the controls not as tight as they should be, and the balance system is heavily flawed. It will practically auto bail you If you attempt to get a combo going fort longer than 15 seconds or so.

The Remade levels aren't bad, but the actual skating and trick engine is nowhere near the originals and you'll be disappointed. Go find a copy of THPS2 and play that instead, it still works OK on Win7.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I can't say this clear enough...

You won't get warm tingly nostalgic feelings.  Instead you'll get your hopes up.  The sound barely ever works correctly.  Typically its extremely quiet until you hit on object (glass) and then its deafening loud.  The community had to find fixes for resolution and controls.

To top it all off the game randomly just will drop your save.  Absolutely a waste of time and one of the biggest dissapointments in a video game I've ever experienced.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Pretty bad Tony game.  The speed is gimped and the physics are very random.  You may go flying, and you may not.  It is pretty though, and they did acquire the licensing to play Superman" by Goldfinger."

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
this game has bad physics, tricks are hard to land, its not fluid like in old TH games. bad balance bar can't do long combos because of that. as an old Tony Hawk player i can't recommend this game. Tony Hawk series ended at Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Great to go back and play on classic tony hawk maps
My only issue is that i only ever had the first game for N64 and there aren't enough maps from the first game IMO

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I used to love the anachy" and the all the possible combinations just alone to build your skater.
Here.
This game.. Reminds me mostly of some sort of computerizede version of a (bad) iOS/Android game (Freemenium?)

What im trying to say is.. It SUCKS this game
Its boring

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
The game is just a empty shell of it former self, it try's to look the same sounds the same (sorda) but its doesn't feel the same. Gameplay wise pro skater hd is much slower then pro staker 2 and 3 (thanks unreal engine god go die in a fire), the ragdoll physics are the most annoying thing, in the the old  t.h games if your skater falls on his butt he's right back on feet in like moment but in pro skater hd it takes for ever for him to get up and waste time specialy when you are to do a objective and you only have 2 mins to do it.
The level selection form tony hawk 1 is the most confusing thing ever, this supose the best selections of levels form tony hawk 1 and 2  so why in gods name is the Mall and Downhill Jam levels that no one enjoys.
Music wise most of the songs form pro skater 2 (there is only one song from tony hawk 1)  make a return but the new track are okayish nothing bad but nothing  special either

NO CHARTECER CREATOR AND NO PARK EDITOR.   ........ WHYYYYYYYYYYYY ?

Overall this game is not worth your time and money, you might as well buy a copy of pro skater 2 on pc since it works on windows 7 64bit

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews on this game. I remember playing through the entire series when they all came out and then I forgot about this series. I saw this game on sale and I bought it for the nostalgia factor. The remake had almost everything that one would want. They include about half the levels from each of the first two games and you can pay extra to get 3 levels from the third (I did because I thought the third game was awesome. My gripe is more with the DLC in that you pay half as much as you did for the game but only get a small fraction of the levels you did with the game. The controls work well, the game supported my 360 controller. I played through the entire game, and had the same amount of difficulty as the old ones, where the levels get progressivly harder and you can never really master the game.

In the end, I like the game and would recomend it. I hope they make a new game or add levels available for purchase (hopefully better value for the dollar than the current DLC). Even at full price this game is worth it.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I put off buying this game, even though I loved the classics, because of the bad reviews. When the sale came on I finally said whatever and bought it. The game is awesome, plays just like the old school game, except with much improved graphics. I don't get what these crybabies are talking about. This isn't a revamp of the series. It's the old school game you loved to play for hours on end. My only critisism is I wish it was longer because it's so fun to play, but there is still a lot of playtime and fun packed into this game, and at the price, it's a no brainer. Ignore the neck beards and get it.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Imagine an alternate universe in which Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was never released. (To start with, if such a universe sounds like hell to you, you may want to buy this game.) All the blueprints for THPS and THPS2 were lying around, and years later, a Chicago developer picked them up and thought, yeah

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Terrible port, I bought it thinking it would bring back memories playing THPS1 and 2 on PS1/PS2, the good music is gone, the levels don't feel the same anymore either. Do not buy, I forgot to refund it within the 2 weeks so i'm stuck with a bad purchase I may only play to get my moneys worth

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
5/5 Koska kaatumiset !

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I was very disappointed in this game, i don't know how they managed mess up what should have been an easy hd port. They have changed all the interesting objectives to collect 5 of these". You are 100% better off playing the originals on the ps2 or gamecube!"

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
The best skating game for PC I know ! They need more maps tought !

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This isn't the end all be all of Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. It's a modest remake of some of the classic games for modern hardware on a modern game engine. It has a handful of iconic maps and all together makes for a pretty enjoyable expience for the price. Sure it's missing multiplayer and create a park/skater but serves for some good fun as long as you take it at face value.

With the DLC it took roughly 7 hours to do just about everything there is to do in the game but I still go back to it occasionaly to play a couple rounds and I definitely feel I got my money's worth.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I was excited to finally play THPS:HD, but immediately regretted my purchase before I was in game.  I was greeted with a 'Powered by Unreal Engine' splash, meaning this is a completely different engine, and then a 'Robomodo' splash, which while I already expected that, was still disappointing to see.  For some background - Robomodo are the people behind the Tony Hawk games that used those plastic motion control boards.

Gameplay:
The balance system is completely terrible, making it impossible for long combos.  In the previous games, every time you would grind or manual in a combo, your balance meter would be slightly reset.  In this game, the balance stays the same until your combo ends, meaning if you jump off a rail and then grind back on, you will most likely bail unless your balance was perfect.

The skater is incredibly slow, and grinding 90% of the time will only make him slower.  Moving just feels slippery and clunky.  Reverts require a DLC, and even then it's just as poorly implemented as the other mechanics.

Levels:
The levels look pretty nice and are spot on with the games they are replicating, though the goals themselves are lazily done.  For example, the competitions are replaced with just collecting 'competition medals' around the map in levels like Marseille.  In the THPS3 DLC maps there's no photo-related goals, and levels like LA have things like the car chase replaced with collecting items around the map.

Conclusion:
In terms of a remake, it just feels like an incomplete skating game with THPS levels and characters.  It doesn't play like a THPS game, it doesn't have mechanics introduced in the games (which are over a decade old), and just altogether isn't very fun to play.

I've tried multiple times to enjoy this game, but I can't.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

First Impressions:
For an early access game this game is already really playable as the sandbox mode works just fine. See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.

Your Ship:
Upgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.

Your Crew:
Yes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station/planet offers different crews with different skills.

Gameplay:
Random missions are generated all the time wich includes simple go there and shoot.." missions

Starpoint Gemini 2
This was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain/pirate.  There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've  off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.

Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?

It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.

Spaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space? (mine's space)

Starpoint Gemini 2
TL;DR: At the verrry bottom, ya heathens!

This game, wow. It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.

I bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him.

So far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.

You have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?
Also you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.

Even combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane Let's Moon'm" cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

So, you've played Freelancer, Wing Commander or Privateer. Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!!

Beta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome.

Theres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.

Perhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields.

You can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you.
Sounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight.

Seriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.
This game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!

Starpoint Gemini 2	(Updated review!)
======================================

LGM Games successful debut title, Starpoint Gemini, an RPG tactical sim set in a unique SciFi setting was released in 2010. It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.

On a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...

======================================

Pros	+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!
+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.
+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.
+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!
+Combat in big ships with fleets...
+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...
+Very well done Faction system
+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities
+Developer support that sets a new standard
+Best Community on Steam
+Awesome Replay value!
+Free content updates

ConsNone really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)

Neutral+/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)

======================================

Introduction
Starpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...

======================================

Game-play
I have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.

I played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you dont have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)

When you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...

Mastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.

This game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.

I mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, youll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.

======================================
======================================

Conclusion
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals. There is a true sense of adventure as you discover new areas of the star chart, with opportunity and danger lurking around every corner so you are constantly encouraged to build yourself up in terms of power, wealth, and relationships with the various factions.

LGM and its great team have created an instant classic that will be around for many years....

======================================

Starpoint Gemini 2
150+ Games in my account. This is the first one that makes me write a review:

+Addictive Gameplay
+Beautiful Graphics
+Amazing Soundtrack
+Awesome Community
+Sleepless, highly motivated Devs that listen to this awesome community


+/-There's no real Build your Empire" aspect as in the X-Series (yet) (Since I loved Freelancer

Starpoint Gemini 2
I have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC/Privateer/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.

PROS:

++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.

++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.

++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...

++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.

++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.

++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!

CONS:

++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad  with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is.

++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.

++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.

++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you.

I give this game an honest 10/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an easy button" but for me it really makes the game. (i'm old... ;) )"

Starpoint Gemini 2
SHORT SUMMARY:
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a bit shallow and a bit pricey for what it offers, but it is still enjoyable. Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.

However, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!
----------
LONGER REVIEW:

The good:

Visuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it.

The game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun.

The not-so-good:

The story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay.

Side-story missions boil down to repair structure there for $$$ and XP" or "kill enemies here for $$$ and XP" or "ferry person over there for $$$ and XP" with little fanfare. After you finish the main story

Starpoint Gemini 2
Overall the game is pretty awesome, but it could use some polish.


PROS:

Nice variety of skills and perks available.

Great variety of factions and areas of control.

Good selection of ships.

Can capture enemy ships.

Like the blueprints idea.

Like the compare weapons and ships.


CONS:

Traveling over 10 units takes a couple minutes.

There are four equipment slots to use and only about four that I found were actually useful, ie. shield recharge, strengthen attack, scavenger bots, hull repairs.  Even then, I rarely ever use them.

Crew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.

Blueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.

The only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.

Level 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.

Travelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.

Cannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.  Crew losses will occur if the captured ship has less.

There are three kinds of heavy weapons, but I failed to see any real difference in shockwave damage.

Exploding ships nearby do no damage.

Has lag and slowdowns most of the time.


SUGGESTIONS:

Make traveling without gates a little faster when in full engine mode.

Make some artifacts that last indefinitely / bonuses or useables that fit in equipment slots.

Change the decimal enhancement descriptions, eg. 0.5, with percentage values, eg. 50%.

Please fix weapon range.  Bonuses are not being counted.

Add a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.

Give a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.

Show radiation areas on the map.

Show map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.

Allow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.

Make plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.

Make lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.

Make railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.

Do a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.

Fix the pathfinding.

Improve AI for wanted bounties.

Starpoint Gemini 2
My initial reaction to the game was Wow

Starpoint Gemini 2
OK. this is awesome!! Think Eve Offline. From mining to full combat you are not constrained in any way, you can be a pirate, trader, miner, fighter, merc, whatever you want to be!

Starpoint Gemini 2
This is from a post I did on the forum and decided to add it here following a suggestion to do so.

SPG 2 The Good, the Bad, Oh God the Insanity


If youre on the fence as to whether you should get this or not it will all come down to what you are looking for in a space game.
This is not Eve Online so get that out of your head. Seriously, if you want EO youll need to go log into EO. There is no online multiplayer, no gate camping players, no griefers and no gankers.
That being said, this game offers something EO and many others, online or not, have simply forgotten or just dont care about. Interactive Devs.
Yep, you read that correctly. The Devs are extremely active in the forums. Id hazard a guess and say 99% of all issues, questions, comments etc. are answered near instantly.
They take concerns very seriously and look for ways to address them as quickly as possible, faster even it seems.
While this isnt to say other Devs arent around, personal experience has shown they just dont answer, are too busy, dont care and on more than one occasion are downright obnoxious and rude.

So +1 for Dev support seemingly 24hrs a day every day

Community holy crap, where to begin

There are a lot of helpful people. One or two I have noticed try to step in when the Devs FINALLY get some sleep. This doesnt mean there arent more filling in those roles, only that I cant read, re-read, and re-re-read each and every post over and over to see who is filling those roles. Though, I will admit, sometimes the forum reading is an exercise in hilarity.
Serious questions for the most part get serious answers. Once in a while they spiral out of control with loose jokes, odd references and such, though more or less after the issue has been handled.
Remember the active Devs from earlier? Yeah they contribute too.
Dont be surprised to find one or more of them plowing into your thread to partake of whatever silliness is afoot. Oh yes, my friend, they are characters indeed.
On the whole, the community is developing into a large group of knowledgeable friendly people looking to help out any way they can. Yes, some can be offended easily, but I have yet to see an all-out flame war like everywhere else. In fact, most people just apologize if they upset someone and move on, including myself.

So +1 for a truly friendly and helpful community.

Graphics
Nothing that will stress your system too terribly. High end or low end, it seems everyone can find a setting that fits the bill and allows them to play. I have seen one or two instances where certain systems (read Laptops) refuse to allow the game to run, but I have yet to see more than those.
Even then, the Devs are still trying to figure out how to get it working on those couple of problem machines. Interesting, since most would just tell you that your system doesnt have what it takes and to go get something bigger.
All in all, the graphics are very nice indeed. Nothing mottled, disjointed or misaligned. No missing pixels here and there or stand in objects for missing items.

So +1 there for that

NPCs
What do you expect? They are NPCs. They shoot at you, they kill you and they keep doing it. Unless you kill them first, in which case, they die rather well and dont whine about it. I seem to remember an account of griefing done by NPCs, though I believe that was a one-off. Funny though.
They get tougher as you progress through the game. Different levels, different types and different areas. They fight each other if they are opposing factions and will turn on you if you are low enough rep with one, or both. In which case, run.

So I give a +1 for good NPC mechanics.

Missions
Lots of them. They are everywhere in both aspects of the game. Free play or Story line there are tons. Decent rewards for the time invested as far as I can tell, probably a bit too decent considering some missions you just have to click a button and repair something.

Ill give a +1 here too.

Storyline
For as much as I have done, it progresses well. Seems to have substance and a bit of plot for as far as I have gotten.
But
It is buggy. Missions sometimes fail out. Sometimes you overshoot a zone and they get canceled, dropping you out of the storyline and into free play mode. Other times, you just crash out of the game.
They are working on the bugs as fast as they are made aware of them and that helps out a lot. More often than not, you can just reload from a save point and try to continue.

No points for this one, still needs work.

Mods

There are more than a few. Something for everyone I suppose. Uber ship, got it. More money, got it. Star Trek themed ships, go those too.
From Star Trek to vastly improve (overpowered) beginning station inventories, there is something to fit most everyone.
The game has a mod community growing faster than the game itself. Even at least one mod I saw that will completely change the game to Mass Effect themed ships and even a new storyline that appears to be in the works.
The Devs seem to support unlimited, no holds barred modding.

So definitely +1 here.

Oh, lest I forget...

Community input...

Look in the game. Look at achievements and improvements. You will see all the signs of active community involvement that has been taken seriously. (mostly)

Yeah, +100 and some Oreos for all you community peoples that report bugs, request content changes and overall general improvements.

All in all, for me, this has been one hell of a ride and its just beginning. The game is only getting better and more is on the way.
If youre on the fence, get off it. Buy the game and join the fun in the community.

And the insanity? Glad you asked...

There are the elite few who can claim this. They watch you at home while you play. They see you in your boxers. They wear your boxers, like I am right now. The Devs are part of this group, I know one, whom I shall leave nameless, who has watched me in my boxers. Yes, some of us are insane... And that is the fun of it all.

Sincerely,
Virikas

P.S. +1000 to the Devs for allowing us to be insane, taking us seriously when needed and for being on top of everything, everywhere, all at once, every day... always.

Now... which one of you took my boxers, Meep.

Early Access Review

This is a very entertaining space game with a healthy side order of role playing and is pretty well polished even at this early access stage. The developers have a genuine rapport with the community and this is helping to shape a very enjoyable game. Until the final product release and all features and story campaign are implemented there is still a lot to enjoy in the sandbox mode. If you like beautiful ships, trading, chasing anomalies, blowing up asteroids and firing lasers at baddies theres a lot to like. The music is awesome too.

Starpoint Gemini 2
This game has come a long way since its beginning and it's still going strong. For me personally it went to overwhelmingly frustrating to awesomely enjoyable. The devs are super responsive and really care about the community. Keep in mind this is a tactical combat sim with trading aspects. There is a living economy, but personally I never paid any attention to it.

Destroy enemy ships, capture enemy ships, loot enemy ships, grapple enemy ships, hack enemy ships. Do whatever it takes to defeat the enemy. Expansive map with plenty of variety to keep you exploring. Ships, officers, mercenaries, trading opportunities, weapons, weapon enhancements, system enhancements, equipment, etc.

This game is an awesome space game in terms of what its selling point is: a tactical combat RPG space sim.

Starpoint Gemini 2
** A gorgeous space game marred by painful lore elements.**
[[Recommendation comes with strong suggestion to play in sandbox mode only]]

This game was an odd experience.  The longer I played it, the less I liked it.

When it started, it took me back to the wonder of games like Privateer.  Sandbox, big galaxy, lots of options.  And it's really gorgeous, from the ships to the planets to the nebulous backgrounds.  Some of space stations look oddly low-res compared to everything else, but that's minor.

However, things went downhill when I started to follow the main story campaign.  The voice acting is truly atrocious, and the writing isn't much better, from the minor (bad grammar) to the median (dialogue) to the major (an incoherent plot with characters whose motives don't seem to correspond to events).  And when you get to a more difficult mission that you have to try several times, the lack of any button to skip the dialogue becomes truly unforgivable.

Speaking of retrying, there are several design decisions that make sense on their own, but quickly become annoying when you have to replay a mission because it's difficult or bugged (like the infamous mothership mission).  First, you can save only at stations or planets.  OK, there's a sort of 'realism' sense to that.  Second, there's a lot of empty space between points of interest.  That actually worked for me at first, because it added to the sense of scale and exploration.  But when you have to retry a mission and reload to find you are about a 5 minute cruise from the action -- and then remember that you'll have to sit through 3 more minutes of unskippable community theatre auditions when you get there -- it gets really difficult to stick with it for the next attempt.

There were also a number of minor annoyances, like the fact that missions seem to get reset when you load a game (so if you pick up someone or something to deliver, you must do it before you end your current session or forever have that passenger or item in your non-cargo inventory), some inscrutable elements, several mechanics that seemed incomplete, and a handful of crash bugs.

I think there are the ingredients of a good game here, with a good core and beautiful graphics, but the lore side of things really lets those elements down.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to ignore the story and play only in sandbox mode.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Well...the game looks nice but is actually quite boring. Here is why:

1. Unengaging story

The story consists of a lot of text (white on color, not very legible) and really really atrocious voice acting (which sometimes just cuts out). There are so many factions with text descriptions I did not bother to read all of them. Honestly I did not understand half of it because I have not played the predecessor. The game did not present its universe in an engaging way.

2. Simple missions

The free missions are all randomly generated but they consist  of either go to A and kill / capture or go to A and scan / repair (same menu button) or go to A and transport to B.

The campaign missions are the same. Go to A and usually kill everything there...done. Sometimes you need to ferry stuff. But the whole involvement is detached. You arrive...the game cuts to sequence and some voice acting..suddenly to reappear with enemies around...you kill them...cut to the next short scene...done. There is no drama, no real action, no emotional involvment. I did not respond emotionally to the characters, who are just pictures with horrible accents.

Trading and mining is a horrible grind if you like it. It is certainly helpful in the beginning but not worth your time later on. Just take the kill pirates" mission and blast everything to hell.

Once I got capturing ships down...I had so much money I could have bought ships that were not yet unlocked for my character level.

3. Simple combat

Usually you fly somewhere

Starpoint Gemini 2
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space trading and combat game, think Elite or EVE. You fly around a vast galaxy, smaller than in EVE or Elite though, doing missions, trading, mining, bounty hunting, etc. Captain your ship and level your captain in a RPG-like fashion.

I turned to SG2 for that EVE Online fix. I would call it a simplistic EVE, but it's still very good to scratch that EVE itch. You can forget about the RPG system, it's so simplistic, but the rest is a full fledged space game. The game's looks take a little getting used to, coming from sharp and shiny EVE or Elite gfx, but after a while it grows on you and flying around the galaxy is as fun as usual.

Getting through the story and all dlcs can take about 50 hrs, then there's some additional hrs if you want to replay SG story in SG2 engine, and then there is freeroam. Freeroam will not be so fun after completing everything as your ship will obliterate everything that the game throws at you, but still, 50-70hrs of game time looks quite amazing considering you can get this on sale.

I liked:
* quite a large map
* lots of different ships
* large amount of weapons and enhancements
* flying in space shooting / trading / uncovering stuff!

I disliked:
* capturing ships is the only way to go if you want to make big bucks

Get this:
* if you're looking for EVE Offline and don't mind simpler experience
* if you want to fly in space and pew pew stuff

Don't get this:
* if you're looking for complex space sim

Early Access Review

The next best thing if you want something similar to Eve and Freelancer. More arcade-ish Sci-Fi space shippy RPG. Start with a small gunship, make your way up to dreadnoughts and carriers by trading, doing freelancer missions like repairing a damaged space station, transporting a VIP from A to B, getting commodities to a planet or scanning anomalies, or just hunt criminals in hopes to get a huge bounty. The game is beautifully done, has a large selection of ships and weapons, the combat is fun although some say the camera is a bit slow, and there's a lot to do in it. Buy it! Throw money at the devs!!!! DOIT!

Starpoint Gemini 2
I must preface this by saying, I don't write many reviews at all, but when I do though, it means I really enjoy the game.

This game reminds me a lot of the X3 games, but the interface is a bit easier to get a grasp on.

Pros:
- Mod support
- Great music, think Mass Effect & EVE Online style.
- You can be anyone you want, and do whatever you want, there's a campaign mode, and freeform mode.
- Nice interface.
- Beautiful graphics.
- Runs smooth, haven't experienced any crashes.
- Combat is fun.
- Controller support.
- There's a large selection of ships & weapons, and you can upgrade your ship.
- All of the above points help with immersion, you really feel like you are in space driving your own ship.
- The developers work hard and are engaged with the community.  They do have their own forums where they answer questions, etc.

Cons:
- Space can be a bit lonely at times, but, it is space after all.

TL;DR - If you're looking for a game that is part X3, part Eve Offline that can also serve as a stopgap until Star Citizen & Elite Dangerous, you could do a lot worse than this game, especially when you consider the game is currently only $28.

8/10

Starpoint Gemini 2
Loved this game. Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play  the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine.
Just like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as  was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...).
No game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!)

In short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!

Early Access Review

As a long-time fan of the great grandfathers of space trading, exploration and combat games, (Elite, Wing Commander, Privateer). I am always on the lookout for a game of this genre that has the feel and enjoyment these classics gave.

Starpoint Gemini 2 goes a long way to bringing back those days in a modern, eye pleasing, fun package that is not overly complex like some of the modern games ( later X Series, EVE Online) which although are great games and in many ways superior, probably due to much larger budgets, leave me feeling like I have just sat the final papers to a masters degree.

Starpoint Gemini 2 which is still in beta at time of writing this review, shows great promise and I eagerly look forward to the future updates and release of this enjoyably challenging game.

I hope to add additional updates to this review as new releases come out and I explore the game further.




Starpoint Gemini 2
Well-made hybrid of SG1 and Freelancer. with light RPG elements on top.
Pros
+Vast selection of ships from fighters to dreadnaughts and carriers
+Engaging combat
+diverse systems
Cons
-Lack of persistent objects. You won't see ships traveling from one system to another, because they are always generated when you enter a system.
-There is like 30 factions, but reputation system is two-dimensional. So when you help one faction you improve/worsen relation with the rest of them.
-Below average performance.
7/10 (8 of 10 if the they fix bugs and improve optimization), worth buying if you are into space genre. If you are not, you can wait for Christmas sale, a lot of things should be fixed by then.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

The playstyle is an assorted combination of the Freelancer + tactical elements of Star Wolves + diversity of EV Nova + some good original ideas on top.
Do you remember that feeling of excitement when you discover something, something that makes you feel more alive? I feel a deep immersion when playing this game which is so rare nowadays (even in alpha state atm (nov 2013), with only a basic features present). The devs put a part of their souls into creation of this, I feel it in all those small details here and there. I'm looking forward for a release, and quite positive that anyone who loves space sims" won't be disappointed with this game

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

Very good game for being in ALPHA - quite a lot has been implemented to keep you busy, and the best part is the full support for modding!

I was looking for a space game that could keep me interested, and I found it with Starpoint Gemini 2.
Fun game mechanics with a nice RPG twist.

I recommend you go check it out, and if it tickles your fancy, buy a copy before the price increases!

Starpoint Gemini 2
Enjoyed the game a lot and felt like Freelancer!
Heaps of places to explore, lots of ships and good variation of weapons and effects not just different coloured lasers.

Loved it.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Very much recommended. a very good space opera game full of originality and good ideas.
A unique RPG experience made with spaceships, and the best developer support ever.

Besides, with 861 positive reviews and some negative cretin reviews which say this does not work on XP" when XP is not supported

Starpoint Gemini 2
TL;DR version - GET IT! Fun as heck! Some minor issues and bugs but devs are hard at work on fixing them!

Ok as far as space games go, this is easy to get into" and "fun" to me. Easy once you actually READ the tutorial tips and understand how it all works. And it's fun cuz I found myself needing to "just go over to that next unexplored sector" to see what's there.

However

Starpoint Gemini 2
I wish I hadn't bought this game. I loved Freelancer and thought it would be something similar but boy was I wrong.
This game lacks any atmosphere and feeling of a space-traveling universe. Docking at stations and visiting stations is one of the most disappointing events I ever encountered in a space game. There is no radio chatter, no clearance for docking; you never hear anybody over radio nor do you see more than one or two ships (even near well populated planets!). This game feels so incredibly dead and empty, that travelling and exploring just simply isn't any fun at all. It all feels so static. Add to that that planets and stations you visit are not animated but all just have a static, bland screensaver in the background of dull buying menues. There are no bars or other places that give you the feeling of really setting a foot on a place. Rather it all feels so incredibly generic and it doesn't get better if you add the boring go there and kill pirate x"-missions that we all have seen way too often now.

This game is nowhere near Freelancer and if you look for something like that

Starpoint Gemini 2
I recommend this game because of the following

The minor bugs are actively being fixed
The devs are responding on the forums
ExplorationSpace feels large, but it's only one solar system
Plenty of travel shortcuts
The map has to be uncovered by visiting each sector
There is, sort of, an autopilot for easy travel to a waypoint
CombatCombat is fun
Auto-fire if you don't feel like aiming
The controls work well, controller support
GraphicsThe visuals look good (DirectX 11)
All of the screenshots are from the in-game engine, not works of art.
The planet-side artwork is nice
The space stations and ships are varied and have style
The game is well polished
Simple user interface
Equipment and LootThe ship fitting is pretty simple
There are multiple types of ships, weapons, and multiple styles to choose from
There is a collect all button to make looting quick
There is a quick way to sell everything in your cargo hold
OtherYou can do more than just shoot other ships
You can choose free-roam instead of doing a campaign
You can crash into a planet
Achievements with in-game bonuses
It's able to be modded
Easy to learn
Music and sound is good
It's not complicated, but I am also a fan of complicated games
What's bad about it? Not much, just things I personally prefer.  Others might consider some of these to be Pros
No multi-player options
No empire to build
Freelance missions do not have much variety.
The officer system is a little strange.  You can only hire them in their original location, they go home when you fire them, then you have to fly back there to hire them again.
You can't equip ships unless you are piloting them.  This can cause you to lose crew or be forced to sell cargo.You might like Starpoint Gemini 2 if you like these games. Freelancer, X3-series, Eve Online, and space based games in general


Starpoint Gemini 2
A good game that could have been a great game.

After several hour of play the missions quickly get repetitive. Trading and mining get boring even quicker. The real challenge of the game is capturing enemy ships (and it is the only way to make enough money to advance in the game).

The faction system didn't much much sense to me, and didn't seem very important as it was just goodies vs badies in the end.

Near the end game there was nothing to spend your cash on. The weapons at the end of the game really aren't much better than what you get 20% into the game.

The game crashes from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game thanks to the auto-save feature. It is a 32bit only game and seems to run out of virtual RAM. The developers should have also included a 64bit executable in the install package.

So, good fun for maybe 20 hours.

Some suggestions as to what would have made this a great game.
- Some ship customisation (and why can't I see the weapon arcs)
- More variety in the  enemy ships (maybe some boss ships)
- Some random system wide events. Not just random pirates
- The hacking (and anti-hacking) features making some sense. I didn't get hacked ever, but had zero protection.
- More high end weapons and gear
- The galaxy having low and high level sections rather than being seemingly mostly uniform. At the moment sectors are either friendly or impossibly hard.  I never found any netural sectors.

Early Access Review

MINDBLOWING!!
This game has everything Xrebirth failed to delivered.
Which is... EVERYTHING!

Space sim at its best!
Awesome graphics, ultra complex UI, systems, skills, perks, menues, customization and upgrades!
Frekin' beautiful soundtrack, breathtaking space surroundings, detailed ships
fully customizable with your own colours, designs and even logos and names!

Full sandbox open space with Missions, from Bounty Hunting systems, to Repair, protect, assinations and trading.
Full mining system as well, with different tools including mining torpedos!
Tons of camera views, full manual aiming to fire at will auto-weapons.
Your own crew on board, from gunships to Capital ones, fleet or trading merchants, or even engineer corvettes.

The technical aspects of this game is AAA+
Bugs? I havent found any yet, even if this game is on beta stage, which is impressive!
There is a lot of things the devs will add following community guidelines as well.
A full story-mode and MODS are on the way!

Starpoint Gemini 2 is a masterpiece, a gem, and a chef-d'oeuvre for the price.
Thank you LGM for such a polished game.
I cannot wait for you guys to implement all the goodies including achievements!

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

For an Early Acces title a great amount of fun, quick and often updates, Freelancer-ish feeling, 3rd person flight, tactical rpg. :)

Constant devs to players interaction gives a big plus, and another bonus regarding the implementatnions of player-desired solutions, and on top of that is the MODABILITY.

If you like space games and tactics - this is one of few I'd recommend:)

Starpoint Gemini 2
Most have taken to calling this EVE offline, but I find it to be more EVE Lite or Diet EVE. Think the core concepts of EVE in an open sandbox map rather than many separate systems, but with the waiting 5 months for a skill replaced by grinding for a few hours and all the player interaction removed.

At the end of the day you're left with all the things that made EVE great, with none of the stuff that makes it only suitable for people with vast swaths of time available. You can jump in, do a quick mission, save and jump out. You don't have to worry about being dicknailed by a ship fifty levels higher than you at any given time, and you get an experience that's much more simple than EVE.

I'll reccomend it. I've come across some bugs, and the voice acting is really, really bad at times, and just pretty bad at others. Personally I think the 20 bucks out of pocket I paid (had 6 bucks steam credit) was in the right area for the game, maybe a little high. I'd say buy at 5-15 for sure and 20+ only if you like the sounds of EVE Jr.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Really good fun, was worried about some of the EVE comparisons but tho it does lack first person/cockpit view its not to its detriment and it seams to make the fights more tactical and less frantic also i havnt done any spread sheet crunching yet.

pros

Big seamless world with lots to explore, compleat with random space anomalies worm holes and nebulea

lots of different ships at diffrent lvls to fly

All the different playstyles youd expect, fight, trade, pirate ect

space drugs

its fun

its not X rebirth

cons

seams like quite a grind to earn cash for ships but kind of expect that and it makes that first ship upgrade seam all the more special

it has crashed on me a couple of times (nothing game breaking ) but meh that will probably get fixed in time and the auto save is pretty good

Starpoint Gemini 2
Finally out of Early Access, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great entry point into the genre. While you're waiting for things like Elite and Star Citizen to come down in price (or release), this is an excellent stop gap game. While the science behind it isn't world-accurate like other games, the pure amount of things to do and systems in play is excellent. Workshop support is excellent and the modding API is well detailed on the developer website.

Starpoint Gemini 2
This game gets compared to Freelancer a lot (particularly by forums users), but it's like a poor man's version of Freelancer without any of its artistry or high points like the lore backgrounding the game, and the great universe design. There are similar mechanics: do some basic trading, have a ship...

TBH it is a bit of a disappointment after the hype you hear about it from fans. To be really blunt in its current state I think this is a $10 max game. It feels a bit like it would be a good iOS space game, but as yet isn't a good PC space game. It needs an additional layer of depth and polish to become anything more than average. I'm playing it a bit but it's mostly as a time filler and because its a pretty massive grind to get anywhere (which I assume covers for a lack of content).

The forums seem to be an unadulterated love fest for this game and that was one of the main things that swayed me, but it's fairly average so far. I think it has something to do with the developers being active on the forums, big-upping anyone that says anything positive. Will update this review if my opinion changes, but I have a pretty good picture of the core dynamics: capture till you get a bigger ship, capture till you get a bigger ship until you get the biggest ship. Do really boring missions until you get your rank up. Otherwise you might do the really boring version of trading or mining (compared to other games).


THE BAD Tutorial and the campaign to date are pretty bad and unengaging (I kinda know what I'm doing but just don't care).
Visuals are mediocre, although the ship art is okay.
Universe feels empty in a bad way.
Voice acting in the plot is amateur.
You can only save in certain places which is a pain in the  (there are some lackluster excuses about this)
Combat seems fairly one dimensional
RPG elements are lighter than I expected (4 skills that you level, and some perks)
Crew are just stats bonuses
Trading economy and mining seem extremely basic
Overall I think a game like Starsector has far more RPG depth.

THE GOOD...You can customise ship colours, decals, and names so we can all call our ship Stormbringer, however, I haven't tried naming one Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath - it might be possible.

The cosmetic stuff like naming the ships and changing colours seems to be my high point so far. It might end up being a good timewaster...here's hoping.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Sorry for the negative review, but I found this game frustratingly boring...

- The game is a real grind.

-Freighting cargo around doesn't pay well at all, and I installed a mod to try and solve that issue, but seemed to not help.

-The story did not capture my interest. With sad voice acting, and the death of the characters farther on the second mission, I felt nothing for it, and was simply poorly laid out.

-Not a fan of the combat, it's clunky, panning the turret cam is slowed in combat. (that could be due to my system but the graphics run fine in combat, I suspect it's something else)

-A lot of the free roaming play is go here, go there... with not much inbetween. maybe some random combat

-No feedback on some systems, if you can't charge your engines in combat, no way to tell how long they will take to comeoneline, or I didn't find any readout to tell me

-not a fan of magical powerups/skills but that just my preference

-The sell all button is poorly placed with no confirmation, will also fail you if you're smuggling. you can't buy it back to complete the mission sigh...

-Not a fan of the docking anchoring system. it makes the long or short trips that much more unsatisfying :(

-missions seem to be straightforward but lack information eg. where am I smuggling this to? You want help, what kind of help? Missions simply lack information that would give you the choice to make a educated decision.

-Combat music sounds very VERY similar to Freelancer... just putting that out there...

I have tried to get into the game twice, tried to give it a chance. I have put 13 hours into the game... I don't feel there is any need to put more.

I strongly recommend anyone considering purchasing this title to thurellery research it on youtube or forums, as actual game footage it not supplied on steam, and is quite misleading...

Starpoint Gemini 2
Updated review as of October 1st.

First impressions: Broken. With a lot of potential.

Secondary impressions: It's an acquired taste. It does grow on you. But it's lopsided. Strong gameplay props up a (very) weak campaign.


Initial review:

This game may be out of early access, but do not be fooled. This is NOT a finished product. Not even close. It is sorely lacking in decent voice acting, and the campaign hangs together by the thinnest of threads, and liberal deus ex machina. Frequently you will look at the screen in confusion and ask Who is that? What is happening? Why am I supposed to do this?" The game approaches storytelling in a very basic

Starpoint Gemini 2
Update : Now LIVE V1.400 (Internal Test build)

I myself have been playing since Alpha (September 2013 release) and I have seen SPG2 come along in strides. Below is a basic list of what is in-game and can be done whilst playing. SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80's onwards.


Star Point Gemini 2!

DLC - Secrets of Aethera - Adds in new ships, new storyline arc, tweaks and updates to game systems.

Riftways - Oh my, something to experience yourself! - Rollercoaster rides in Space.

Fighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.

70 ships to buy/capture/destroy

Equipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancements

Customizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.

Consumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etc

Power ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)

Ship cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)

Hero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM's competition)

Global events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.

Junk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.

Trade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)

Board and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.

Worm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere You dont want to be")

AI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me

Starpoint Gemini 2
This is a good game for space adventurers. However, there should be an emphasis on the word adventure" more than action on this one.

There is story here

Starpoint Gemini 2
So I thought Id wait before writing this review until I got at least 10h+ gameplay and finished the story. So at the time Im writing this I got 43h+, and just finished the game.

My favorite space game of all time is probably Freelancer, and other games Ive tried havent even come close to it. But when I heard about Starpoint Gemini 2 I got my hopes up a little. Started following the game, checked in-game videos and such, and I got very interested.

So I decied to buy it a week before the release cause it was on sale.
Its a good game. If you, like me enjoyed freelancer then you will no doubt enjoy this aswell. Its not as good,  but its definitely not a bad game. The RPG elements are an interesting addition to the game.
You start of by choosing your class which are:  Commander, Gunner and Engineer all with different set of skills. Depending on your play style if you prefer being in a small group of ships or just pure loner/dogfighter etc, I think most players will find these classes interesting.

Alright, now to the positive and negative aspects of the game: I really liked the feel of the ships, smaller ships are easier to maneuver while the bigger ones are heavier, and I like that feeling it really does feel like you are flying a ship. So the developers got that down quite well, spot on. I do wish they would have added like a secret ship(s) that could only be found and bought at a specific place that was hidden.   And continuing on the topic of ships, there are A LOT of them to buy. Allthough you will be very discouraged with the prices in the beginning, but dont worry cash will eventually start flowing in. Just do side missions or if you prefer mining or trading etc.

The map is huge, and you have a lot of exploring to do if youre into that. Just wish there were more things to explore, more secrets and mysterious anomalies etc. There isnt really any suprises or wtf moments in this game, which is sad. No mystery.
The graphics are awesome, no complaints here its a living world and the designs are nice.

The sounds and music are awesome. ButI really wish they would use at least more than just ONE battle tune, cause it gets reaaally tiring to be hearing the same  over and over again. Specially since battle is a big part of the game. Would it have hurt to put in at least 2 more songs in? Other than that the rest of the songs are awesome, it really suits the mood and game.

There are also enemy heroes in this game, which all have bounties on them. And they give you a lot of cash, I totally missed this feature when I started playing so it took forever for me to get cash in the beginning.
So thats a nice feature, but would have been even more interesting if they had like one final hero that was nearly impossible to beat, unless you were leveled up to the max with the best ship etc.

Now to some of the negative aspects of the game: Map travel, when you press M or whatever button to bring up the map, the game pausesso while you check your map and try to plan ahead for your future travels, the game is on pause and you dont progress at all. So while I was travelling to this planet, and checking the map at the same time I noticed I was right where I left of. So thats annoying.

The autopilot fails a lot of the times. It only does this after you have docked with a starbase and you click on your next destination to go there autopilot, most of the times it just freaks out and takes you in circles.
The voice acting in this game is a big joke. And not in a good way either, cause sometimes bad voice acting can at least make you laugh, but this was justugh.

The storyline is nonexistent. Which is really sad cause of the big universe the developers built up they could have written such a better story for this game. So if you buy this thinking it will have a nice or at least mediocre story, rethink why you want this game. Im not saying not to buy it, beacuse the good things outweighs the bad in this game.

So to end this Id say it probably is the best new single player space game out right now.

Id give this game a 7/10

+Many ships to buy
+Huge map, a lot to explore
+Pretty graphics
+Music
+Enemy Heroes
+RPG elements

-Maptravel
-Music
-Bad voice acting
- story
-Autopilot fails

Starpoint Gemini 2
(Still in Alpha stage)
Pick a style that you like to play, space sim wise, and go do it..lol Be a pirate/bounty hunter/merchant/miner..ect No story line ATM, but as it stands right now, it is still worth the money. You can easily get 20 buck worth of enjoyment out of it, plus some. When the game is done, you will be glad you did get in on early access. Fun ships and plenty to choose from, even now. Good fight and flight modes of flying. Great space eye-candy. No loading screens to get from one side of the map, to the other. Unless you are using the jump gates, then there is a small load. You want that ship the npc is flying? Just board it TAKE IT!!..lol Over all, I cant give much of any complaint. As a reference, its like a graphics smak down, with a upper cut in gameplay, to Freelancer!!..lol (only SP, no co-op multi..-1/2 star..lol)
I give it 4&1/2 stars out of five: with it, as it stands, in Alpha

EDIT:
Now that this little gem is fully released, I can go ahead and say I wasn't wrong in my EA review. There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!

Starpoint Gemini 2
When I was a young adult (28) I bought an Amstrad CPC 8-bit computer and a cassette with the game Elite" on it. I played that religiously at least a year and after that again every now and then. The graphics were underwhelming (green wire graphic)

Starpoint Gemini 2
Pros:
+ Beautiful game; very nice to look at!
+ Lots of small interesting mechanics and ideas, such as boarding other ships, hacking their systems, etc.
+ Mining and trading are well implemented, although it's very hard to get rich through either
+ Plenty of unique ship designs and overall great attention to art
+ Very decent music and sound effects

Cons:
- Boring story
- Abysmal voice acting
- No multiplayer
- Excessively combat-focused (good luck getting rich as a merchant)
- easter egg hunt (in a space sim? sigh, okay)
- only one star system, seems limited for a space sim
- the prices for using the jump gates are insane, get your podcast playlist ready and have fun trucking through space
- lack of animations for entering or leaving stations/planets (yeah this one is a bit nitpicky)
- placing stations and artifact containers right next to riftways is borderline sadistic
- what REALLY pushed me away from this game:

WELCOME TO USER INTERFACE HELL!
oh my god, this game's interface makes me want to stick puppies in a blender!

--> fifty thousand menus that don't give you all the information you need
--> 'why can't I select this station? oh the waypoint marker is in the way, let me place it somewhere else for the 1000th time so I can move on with the docking procedure' (same thing applied to any static object in space you hope to interact with)
--> 'does a green price mean it's a good sell, or does it mean the price is very low?'
--> 'why can't I use the turret camera while in PTE mode?! oh, I can, but I need to press Mouse1 simultaneously. wtf?'
--> 'time to compare some prices, now let me just find the item in this huge list which isn't alphabetically organized'
--> I spent several hours having to remind myself that the BLUE bar under the red HP bar doesn't represent shield, but speed. Why do I need a speed bar? God only knows. And one that looks like a shield bar, on top of all.
--> I could go on, but the point is: if this game's UI had been better conceived, SG2 wouldn't have  me off so often. I'm not saying it's a bad game, just that... it's not great fun. I guess that's enough.

Starpoint Gemini 2
I'm 60+ hours into the game as I write this review. I have to say that I haven't played space sims for a while but do have fond memories of Freespace 2, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer and Darkstar 1. The good news is that SG2 has some interesting elements. Could it be better? Sure, but let's get to the nitty-gritty. There are 3 things I'll comment on: RPG elements, SIM elements, and GAMEPLAY elements.

RPG:

	Not great -- voice acting is poor, and I don't really care much about the storylines (I have Origins, Aethera and Titans DLCs), which I feel could be better or more compelling.
	Not enough random events by NPCs, etc. The universe is constantly changing economically, politically but it doesn't feel ALIVE. The characters seem dead.
	There is a points/perk system where you can improve your character but that's about it.
	You get some credits and blueprints for completing campaign missions (no medals or other perks). The blueprint reward system is interesting but really tough to complete a whole set, so what's the point, really?
	The NPCs you deal with are flat and uninteresting. Oh and the voice acting sucks. Or did I mention that already?

SIM:

	This is supposed to be a space sim, but many controls are lacking. e.g. You can't coordinate attacks with wingmen or give them specific orders.
	Other sims even let you contact NPCs/wingmen over comms; not here.
	Combat is simplified -- which may or may not be a good thing. i.e. You have an auto-fire button for your light weapons, and a key for your heavy weapon. You have to be facing your opponent appropriately before other non-frontal weapons will fire. Sometimes the AI fires at other targets even when you're locked on the nearest one.
	There doesn't seem to be full support for my Thrustmaster -- I can't map the buttons, nor does it allow me to use a Joystick / keyboard combo. There is a turret cam view that can be useful, but without my joystick, it's pretty pointless.

GAMEPLAY:

	Pretty graphics
	Fun sandbox (free play) mode. I actually spent more time here than on the campaigns.
	These are cool: Space stations, T-gates, T-drive travel, worm hole travel, boarding ships,
officers and mercs you can hire
	Lots to explore
	Faction/reputation tracking system
	Very useful star map with overlays and filters
	Game seems skewed towards battle; i.e. hard to get rich through the economic model

Overall:

The game world is pretty. While the devs try to create a decent economic model, I'm not quite sure it succeeds. You can't really make much cash that way. The quickest way is to board and capture ships with your troopers, then sell the vessel, or through bounty-hunting. This skews the game towards a combat model -- not complaining, mind you, but if you want to have a robust economic model, well, then make it workable. Players should be able to make MORE money through mining, gas clouds, and trading. There's a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to play a merchant. This is a shame because there is an excellent transport infrastructure -- i.e. you can travel vast distances using T-gates, rifts, worm holes, etc.

I like the fact that there's sandbox mode and campaign mode. Having hangars and your own fighters/bombers is a nice touch; and being able to beam your troopers to enemy vessels to try capturing them is fun.

All in all, SG2 is an entertaining and pretty game, but it falls short of being great -- more RPG elements would help, and of course, proper joystick support... and yeah, the voice acting sucks! I would recommend getting it only if it's on sale.


6.5/10.0

Starpoint Gemini 2
This game will give you hours of fun, not a fast pace action packed in your face game but the strategic plan your every move with every action having consequences game. In saying that the combat is very rewarding with many battles containing the fast pace action (if you manuver your ship properly to avoid incoming damage and allow your weapons to target correctly while adjusting speed, shields and/or gunnery). Interface gets the job done but can take a few minutes to understand which isn't a negative with a great tutorial that can be accessed at any time if you forget something.
There are not many camera angles which I look forward to an update on this to make a more fluid experience especially in combat (there is free move camera angle which can hinder while flying and looking around). I truly would enjoy a cockpit view from the captains chair to feel really immersed while mining or ship to ship combat. I also want to see more interactivity with planets and stations ( one suggestion would be allowing the player to approach an enemy planet to try a diplomatic or subversion mission to change the flow of power/status of that planet).  In a nutshell try this game it makes for a great space flying simulator.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Starpoing Gemini 2 is a humbling game.  It isn't on the scale of some star exploration games, being in only one star system.  But where it lacks in size to its competition, it makes up for it with sheer density and diversity in play.  You can be a star trader, pirate, a security operative, or... yes, even a mere space station mechanic -- only accepting missions to repair other space stations to earn your money.  The combat is intelligent and engaging, but not too challenging.  The only drawback is I cannot bring my friends in.  But with a list of objectives like I have in this, who has time for them?  time to go kill some pirates and steal whatever they've stolen, and sell it!  BETTER SHIPS ES


Starpoint Gemini 2
At a glance Starpoint Gemeni 2 is a sandbox space sim, nothing special and it has been done better before.

I could live with it if the game features an interesting story, which the game does. The game also has a tendency to crash during or shortly after finishing a story mission which makes it a race to reach a save point before the game crashes and you need to redo the mission. So the redemption from story doesn't apply. If anything it just makes me more frustrated.

Looking further into the game, you realize it is a single player MMORPG, ship upgrades are gated behind arbitrary level requirements. Ships handle basically the same except for the top speed, so your carrier is just as agile as the starting gunship.

Weapon upgrades follow a similar MMORPG route, some weapons are poor and you go through the game trying to find better weapons. Weapons that are described in awkward and sometimes even incorrect ways, such as rate of fire" being the delay between each shot. Once you get over the initial hump of how weapons operate you realize you need a calculator to figure out which weapon to use.

Sure I can play this

Starpoint Gemini 2
Excellent game, now that they have the story in.

I've gotta say, that I've watched this go from an alpha state (when I first bought the game) to a completed project.  It's truely an amazing experience.

Buy this game.  You won't regret it.



Starpoint Gemini 2
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great space rpg.

usually a statement like that needs clarification, so here we go.

this game is basically if you took the most complicated parts out of games like x, opened up the game world like evochron mercenary and throw in a control system not unlike eve online. what im getting at is that its not as complicated to play as the aforementioned games but leaves the best parts of each and marries them into a system thats fresh and familiar.

one of the things that irritated me about the x series and evochron for that matter is that missions had to be acquired at a station. my question has always been, why? no long range communications in either universe? in SPG2 that is a thing of the past, when you enter an area, you will be notified when missions are available and you can accept missions directly from the starmap

which brings me to the next point. the starmap is one contigious area, like in evochron, there are no load screeens and while the actual area is smaller than evochron, its a lot more detailed visually. so yes its probably not 100% true to life because there are very few areas that just look like a black void in space, but the visuals are well done and give you more to look at than just black with white dots everywhere.

controls are reminicent of eve online though i havent played it in years, it reminds me of that. not necessarily a terrible thing, but if you are looking to find yourself in the cockpit of the ship, these ships dont feature cockpits. if anything even the smallest class available would have a bridge. so in comparison to the ships in X or EM, youre piloting a capital ship right off the bat. in fact to give some comparison, the M5 through M3 classes of ships in X are basically bought as commodities to place in the hangar of carriers. you wont be flying anything that small and if you were, youd have reason to be very very afraid. it would seem that the gemini system doesnt build much of anything in small scale :)

As of this writing there are a few technical issues that arent game breaking but considering the devlopment team is very active and even communicates with the players regularly i feel that this game will evolve into something even better. if you like rpgs and space games, this will be right up your alley. LGM has done a great job keeping the game fun and challenging without making it a nightmare to learn how to play.

Ragnarok Online
Playing RO for around 10 years.


Ragnarok Online is good, it's a good time killer with very friendly community
(Even tho the game is anime-ish" there are not so many weebs as you could think)
Ragnarok Online 2 is a terrible sequel

Ragnarok Online
It's like I'm 16 again, only this time it didn't take a day and a half to download the client.

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok is something I wasn't expecting to see in Steam in late 2013.
So, does that mean that Ragnarok 2 failed so hard they put 10-years-old-game on steam?

Ragnarok Online
I hate this game why do I keep coming back

Ragnarok Online
One of the first MMORPGs to grace the Internet. It still has the same look and feel from 2004. Despite it's outdated graphics, the sprites and music make this game cute and nostalgic enough to re-try again. The game is still active after all these years and has a very familiar feel to it. It might be hard for newer players to just pick it up without any outside research but still worth it.

Ragnarok Online
This is by far the best MMORPG I have ever played, even now that the game is 10 years old. If only modern MMORPGs followed this game model instead of WoW...

Ragnarok Online
After 2 weeks of coming back, it is obvious that this game is cashing out on its old legacy. It used to be an amazing game I admitted. But if you're looking to come back for the good old days, there's not much iRO can offer here.

1) Pay2Win system:
It is against term of service to purchase in-game gold (zeny) using real cash. Yet it is ok to sell your warp portal energies into zeny ( which is obtained by cash). So the only way to cheat is to give money to WarpPortal.

Cash shop items also rendered many other in-game gear useless. And the only way to upgrade safely to +9 is to choke up $20-$50 in game cash for it.

2) Cheaters
There are so many bots in this game. Honestly I only see around 100-300 active players in game, and the rest are either bots, vend bots, or afkers. Worst part is some bots are actually ok, I see them roaming around cities buffing people, and somehow that makes everything ok? Also there's this thing called ragial which is obviously run by third party bot systems.

3) Lag issues and DDOS:
It's 2015 and this game is still constantly lagging and I am using 75mbps fiber optics internet.  Also their servers keep crashing very often,  and usually at the worst time of the day.

4) Immature game design decision:
For those who paid for VIP for leveling, the GM sometimes decide to change the turn in quests so impossibly difficult that only godly geared veterans can do them. So you're likely wasting 1 week of VIP time afking or slow grinding your level. Also good luck finding public parties to play with outside of the turn ins.

5) Slow customer support:
It literally takes them days weeks or months to answer ticket issues. Worst part is they will just ban you and give you no reason sometimes. So you have to open them a ticket just to find out that some of the items you bought may came from a cheater, causing you to have weeks of downtime.

6) Good luck finding players to play with.
Finally, good luck finding enough players to play with. It's a dying game, and most of the time you'll be spending time waiting for a party to setup (30min - 3 hours recruiting time just to setup 15 minute leveling session)


I'd say save your money folks. The old days of Ragnarok is loong gone.

Ragnarok Online
This is my first online game that I've ever play. My childhood is here.  A very good game to play. A game that worth to learn.

Ragnarok Online
This is for the Classic Loki server. I have not played on the Renewal server.

In terms of a decade old MMORPG, Ragnarok really hits home for the nostalgia factor. Gameplay is still smooth and fun. I quite enjoy playing.

That said....

The botting is rampant, don't bother trying to sell anything through vending. Someone has more on sale for less because bots.
War of Emperium is a cycle of 3-4 guilds exchanging castles on a weekly basis. If you want to try and bring a new guild in, be prepared to be squashed by maxed out veterans wearing god-items.
The market is beyond skewed. The botters have so much on the market that you are LUCKY if you keep a vigilant eye on sites like ragial.com for good deals, as some poor sap tries to undercut the botters of their excessive amounts of loot.
To counter the botters, folks will often crack dead branches" (spawns high-level mobs) where bots frequent in an attempt to grief kill them. Chances are you will die a few dozen times to these things walking from Prontera to Izlude or just trying to get to your hunting grounds.

Logging on

Ragnarok Online
Came for the RPG, stayed for the hats.

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok Online was for me the best MMORPG out there, but its official servers confront some issues mong them:

I. Economy. The cash shop of Ragnarok Online offers a lot of powerful hats and items, that aren't available normally inside the game, of course, you can purchase some of those items with IGC if someone else is selling them at the market, but this has two issues: 1. A player can become rich in a short amount of time by purchasing items from the Cash Shop and then selling them for IGC. Making it completely unbalanced for F2P users. 2. The price of those items is so high, it demands a ridiculous amount of effort to acquire only one item. It's funny how is illegal to sell IGC for real money and yet is OK to sell Cash Shop Items bought with real money for IGC.

II. Bots. The game is plagued with them. There are many solutions to deal with bots, but, either, Gravity got tired of trying or just didn't try hard enough.

III. Lag. The server has lag peaks, not only on WoE time, but at any other time as well, it makes it horrible to play, even when alone. The problem must be either, the way the servers are distributed or their capacity, which is strange, considering there aren't that many active players nowadays.

IV. Rates. People grow and time decreases, the rates of experience and drop of the game are so demanding, that you either, have a lot of time in your hands or you can forget about getting anywhere inside the game, it doesn't particularly appeal to new players and it didn't adapt it to its actual player base, causing a constant drop of users.

As you see, those problems could be easily fixed, but Gravity never seemed to care about them, that's why, if you still want to play Ragnarok Online, I'd highly suggest you a private server instead.

 | Loved it, but disliked iRO servers

AFK-Merchant Simulator.

Ragnarok Online
I've been playing this game for years off and on, have tons of fond memories of playing with my brothers and friends.
No matter how much time goes by and no matter how many new shiny games come out, the original RO will always
have a place in my heart and games folders.

Ragnarok Online
Hi steamers. I played Ragnarok Online religiously before it was released on steam and while it was on steam. Although it seems my hours are not logged, They are there. I have had the best times in this game. It really breaks my heart to not recommend this game.

Best friends of mine who played this for decades, girl friends who hated my soul for WoE timed events, craziest card drops that changed the whole tide of war, awesome battles in WoE, and PvP. Please beleive me. I am trying to warn you of your current time.

Year 2000. Alpha and Beta stages all alike. This game was the best MMORPG you would ever of played, even surfacing vanilla WoW Imo if u had a chance to play it. PVP and Guild WoE slaughtered the idea of capture a flag.

Since around 2005 till now its cash shop has screwed and spread like a virus crossing the korean world and globably to not just this game but many others. It has ruined this game. This game is also ran on a bot fest economy, if it isn't then problems start showing up. This is another hatred of many. But the problem is that its needed, yet not allowed, supposedly lol.

This game has turned into a phantasmal ghost yet people still feed into it and I can't blame them, It's beautiful. Not alot of games come close to the joyous, no holding of the hand feel of entering a world such as midgard. There is always something to do unless you have it all. Venturing map to map as your cool class, seeing and slaying awesome pixel monsters, hopefully with friends. Hearing some classic music that makes your nostalgic sense kick in always, and collecting items such as cool hats, accesories, and of course those cards. Gosh, next to increasing your skills and stats through an allocation system. You will never wanna leave.

But heres the hard truth. This free game still lives because of the real life dirty money still being pulled through botting and idiocracy. You either need to be in this game to be slaving someone, becoming a botter, or selling into the cash shop. But why not do it all? Lol. Zero game experience

It will never shine like it used to and as a retired vet take my word of advice. You are better playing on a private server or just a different game. The people playing this game are mainly young millennials experiencing a zombie game full of bright colors and cool effects being mislead, or adults still milking this game dry.

Do not be mislead by my words.

R.I.P. RO

Ragnarok Online
My love for Ragnarok is deep and infinite. I quit playing years ago because (much like The Sims), this game is a giant addictive time-suck... in an amazing way. Years later, I still love seeing those cute little pixelated sprites.

It's still a great game for people whose computers can't handle the more graphic/RAM heavy MMOs.

I now love Ragnarok from afar, like a creepy old lady at the park.

Ragnarok Online
Can't help but recommend this game. Yes it's old like other people have said but it's graphics were setup in  way so they don't age. Wonderfull 2D sprites in a amazing easy on the eyes 3D world. I've actual played this game since late Alpha, early Beta, about the 1999-2000 time frame. And I still play to this day, though mainly on the classic server.

Beside the easy on the eye graphics another amazing feature is the customization you can do with your character's stats and skills. Unlike nearly every other game on the market you stats matter. Your character's ablity will change massively based on what stats you take.

Want a Swordsman that dodges attacks and hits faster instead of just taking hits and having high hit points ? Put points in to Agility instead of Vitality. This means you trade High Hitpoints and high defense for High Flee (dodge) and high Attack speed. You then could go on to make a Agility based knight or Crusader with your swordsman. Or go the middle of the ground and do a hybrid of Agility and Vitality, You might not dodge as well as pure agility or have as much hitpoints as pure Vitality but you can take less damage per hits then agility based characters, and dodge more then pure vitality.

And this is just the start of it, You can go pure support acolyte forgoing increased melee damage for the ability to heal massive amounts of damage, or for a true acolyte and have a mix of Melee damage and Healing ability.

Want a Mage that beats things as well as toss magic at them? Put points into Strength, Vitality, and Agility, instead of going pure intelligence. You lose magic damage but can dodge, take hits, and do better melee damage then a pure magic caster. Go the sage route and get the skills that let you move while casting and add the chance to auto cast a low level bolt spell while your hitting monsters.

Like making money, while beating on things with axes, swords or maces? Go a Merchant class character. They don't have the Melee skills of other classes but you can carry more loot or healing potions items then any other class, can buy cheaper and sell for more then any other classes, have access to a cart to carry even more loot/potions, and use your fortune to pay the god of the merchants to attack your enemies (Mammonite skill). Want to craft potions or weapons, take your Merchant to ether Alchemist or Blacksmith. And even Blacksmith and Alchemist have the ability to go Pure Battle, pure Crafting, or a Middle ground, not building items as well as their pure counter parts but still being able to fight for themselves.

And there are many other classes to chose from like Archers, thief, TaeKwon Kid, Ninja, Gunslinger ans Super Novice. On top of all that it's free to play, with subscription players (only 7 bucks a month) only get 50% more experience and loot drops, larger storage and other minor abilities. I've spent most of my time since it's gone free to play not using a subscription (they call it VIP) and had no problems with it. So give it a try, nothing to lose but a lot of your free time, and a lot of fun to be had.

Ragnarok Online
First MMO I've ever played.. This game brings back sooo many good memories. The music in this game never gets old and brought a tear to my eye when I came back to playing it after many years. I still remember that excitement I felt when I created my very first character all those years ago and all I wanted to do was explore the world of Rune Midgard. Sure the graphics can't compete with today's more modern games, but then again today's more modern games don't have the sentimental value this one will always have for people like me who remember talking about this game in school and then rushing home to continue an adventure with friends. I can only hope that they will make a (third) remake of the game that only involves making the graphics better while maintaining virtually everything else to preserve the feel" of the original."

Ragnarok Online
Never gets old, Hack and Slash at its finest. Better than RO2 and always will be.

Ragnarok Online
This game... Oh boy this game. Where do i even start,  For starters i am what you would call an old time veteran when it comes to Ro1. This game and me go way back, I couldn't even tell you how many years/months/days i have spent running around in this game. This is one of those classics situations where i have a sudden wave of nostalgia and emotion run through my head just thinking about it.

Now, here's the nitty. I have of course played this game, i was an avid hard core player of Ragnarok, But i moved on to other things and basically rarely ever turned back unless i was just casually hopping on to see what changed or for nostalgia purposes. And let me tell you this game is not the game it was back in 2002-2007. Oh no, The new IRO is just a mess of Trolls/Bots a very strange slapped on questing system as well as many other band-aided systems trying to keep this game afloat or up to par with what i would call mmorpg standardization. Many server merges causing lots of strange naming conflicts and renaming issues. Some people given free character name changes, While others somehow being skipped over.

The game at its core is still the same old Ragnarok, But the magic that is Rune Midgard has just somehow been lost somewhere down the road these past years. Partially the community, and just the way the game is ran, The game even seems to somehow run worse now than it did years ago, as if the Server technology has been downgraded even tho computers have gotten better.


So what is my final verdict? I would say give the game a shot, But don't go into the game expecting a lot, It's pretty laggy and seems very quiet at times. gravity definitely seems to be letting the game run its course, But on the bright side at least it seems to be alive and probably kicking for many years to come.

Ragnarok Online
Lets be clear: I love RO.  My username is a result of my love of RO.  I played on iRO all those years ago, and broke into tears when I hear the Prontera Theme for the first time in years.

Thing is, all that love is nothing more than rose tinted glasses now.  This game is old.  REALLY old.

Old time Thief players (like me!) will easily understand that much of the combat is literally just Right Click

Ragnarok Online
I was super into this game back when it was in alpha. It was at least 2002, if not earlier. I have no idea how the f2p works, whether it's pay to win or purchasing character slots, but it was an enjoyable, if korean-grinding, mmo.

Ragnarok Online
I adore this game. I have been playing on private servers for years. My one complaint is the botting. There is no community. I have only once ran into other users that actually talk. I try to stand even at eden group or warp points in prontera. Nothing. If I ever had a question, I'd go to like 5 different places to ask it and was lucky if I had one response at all. Needless to say, great game, ing terrible community.

Ragnarok Online
Welcome to the worst private RO server the world has seen... Made official. The key areas have so many people sitting around with chat lobbies and merchants that the NPC's are overwhelmed, and you can't even move properly, let alone interact with anything.

Complete with a thoroughly bot-infested community, this RO server needs severe de-brining before it's playable.

Ragnarok Online
What can i say. Im a sucker for the classics.

Ragnarok Online
This game brings me back to a very nostalgic place called Childhood. Ragnarok Online was the very first MMORPG I've ever played, and it really is a good feeling to relive the adventures I'd had when I was 12ish.

Ragnarok Online
great old game, but the servers that this game runs on, are so slow, it makes the game unplayable.

Ragnarok Online
Game is far from it's glorydays 10 years ago. If the classic server didn't die I'd probably still be playing, but with how it is now, it's less populated than some private servers.

Ragnarok Online
Don't let my game time fool you.... I played this game AGES ago. My first MMO ever. Absolutely loved this game when I was a freshman in high school. I couldn't wait to get home from school just so I could sit my happy  down at the computer and log in, haha.

Ragnarok Online
This will always be my favorite online game. Lots of fun to play with a group of friends.

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok Online is a game where you star as a ruthless warlord who murders tons of small, fluffy, blobby creatures.
Revel in victory when your murder entire villages of fuffly animals (including the younglings)

Collect and build your character until you level up to the ulitment warlord.
Start a guild and go on a murder spree with your fellow maurders

Never go to prontera, we dont goto prontera

Ragnarok Online
My favorite MMO of 2002 is finally on steam, thanks gaben

Ragnarok Online
Product received for free

Found this Gem on steam,

It is the Real deal, the original game.

Pros:

Weekly Updated
Good story,
Good Quests,
Good PVP system,
Good Group PVP event.
Runs Great on almost any PC.
Little to no Lag (Thor Server)

Cons:

Not enough players (thor Server) needs more. (Very Low Bot (read almost none) Count)
Seems to have been forgotten in the mists of Time.

I use to play this when it was a subscription game and fell on times that prevented me continueing it. It is now Free to Play with a VIP / Cash Shop option.  Big hint The Cash shop stuff does not Really break the game if you know how to Hunt for Gears.  The market on thor is not insane there are good equips for vend.  The people mostly come from the phillipines so US time zones there is a low Population and almost no Lag unlike the Chaos server which has a higher US population.  The Player base is very nice and welcoming to new players.  Aperently the Game has been getting updates every week, has an active GM staff.

A worthy MMO that will not tax your system.



Ragnarok Online
Where to start...This is one of those games that if you played it when it first came out, years would pass, you would try multiple other MMOs and realize that you keep coming back to Ragnarok. There's just a certain charm to it.  On the surface this might seem like a usual simple grind-fest, however the game is very complex. Mainly because it gives you complete freedom to build your characters the way you want (and make many, many mistakes in the process).
Want to build a battle-priest because you do not like monks? - go for it.  Want to make a full-crit assassin with the sole purpose of hunting high-def monsters? - go right ahead. The beauty is that with enough research and equipment planning you could make even the most bizzare character builds work.  Or you will fail miserably and realize that you want to try again, with a different skill-set, different stats, different cards and equipment..possibilities are limited only by your imagination.
Even though the game is quite old, it definitely held up very nicely and is worth a try.

Ragnarok Online
You're better off with private servers.

I was excited with Steam first came out with this. I mean, I used to play this game from the beginning of middle school to my high school years. And now I've graduated. But when I started to play Steam's server for RO, I realised it wasn't helpful at all. You're out of luck if you're alone, if you're poor, and/or if you don't know the basics of RO. So either you study outside of RO, or you play with friends. Otherwise, Steam's server was a huge let down.

Ragnarok Online
its ok.

Ragnarok Online
A classic definitely. Clunky mechanic and does not work properly on Windows 8 nontheless (Run the options and the game in compatibility mode for XP S3 and you should be fine. Don't run it in full screen, you have been warned.) However, it retains the charm quite nicely and the new renewal patch makes grinding more fun with kill quests.

If you are looking for a F2P MMORPG that is mindless, look no further. Also, since it is free, give it a try will ya. If it's a no go, then just uninstall it. :) Just... don't get addicted.

Ragnarok Online
This game has had a lot of influence in what I expect from recent MMORPGs. To this day, the core game is still engaging and dynamic, which is more than I can say about 99% of the MMORPGs from the 3D era.

Desprite how much i love this game, how many good memories with it, i still NOT recommend it on Steam. Ragnarok Online is so great. Cute sprites, nice music. But server here is too lag for anything to feel good. The developer should ashame of themselves that offical server is not working as well as private servers.

Ragnarok Online
nice and entertaining game to play beside dota 2..

Ragnarok Online
Great game... brings back a lot of nostalgia
The player base is great.
If you liked ragnarok ...you SHOULD get it on steam :D

Ragnarok Online
old school yet stil fun to play

Ragnarok Online
I havent played this game in years, but when my index and middle fingers are the first things to go arthritic, Ill KNOW what did it.

Ragnarok Online
Seriously, I do like RO, but this server probably has more than 200ms anywhere, and it's not just the delay, but the actual LAG, it is unplayable like this.

Ragnarok Online
UPDATED 06/05/2015
Games still Slow and Laggy Cant Enter Any Dungeons/towns/maps/houses Without the tremendous lag - Developers really know how to stick it to old fans of the game. this game is only playable living close the servers, I play on free servers and give my support to People Who host These Servers Better then the Actuall DEVELOPER OF THE GAME ITSELF.


DO NOT LET DEVELOPERS LIKE THIS STICK A FORK DOWN YOUR THROAT AND EXPECT YOU TO SWALLOW
This Game Should Not Be Supported (AT LEAST NOT YET) Let me tell you why

I Remember a time when i played this game Day in and Day out Almost 10 years ago now, It was really my first mmo And one of the best still to date. the sense of community and love you feel for this world is somthing still not found anywhere else Comes down to being a very friendly and social Game.

All these good things So why should i not play it. Cause this game has been Put to the side There is TREMENDOUS LAG Which Results in miss clicks, Getting killed, Miss casts, Aswell as terrible walking. I dont know what happened but i used to play this game on my OLD BAGE Desktop that was slower then molasis AND i was on dial up at the time an i never experinced this Much lag in the game.... So obviously the developers REFUSE to update servers for the huge surge of players... or for any reason from what my knowledge

And I hear people Say oooo customize this

Ragnarok Online
I have been playing Ragnarok for 9 years and counting. I play other games, and I've tried other private RO servers, but I always come back to iRO.

My favorite aspect of the game is the social aspect. It's fun to make new friends and explore the world, do quests, or hunt MVPs together.

Ragnarok Online
Good old ragnarok got better. But gets repititive very fast as you go around killing monsters over and over again to level up and thats it. But definitely worth a try for rpg fans.

Ragnarok Online
One of the best MMOs I have ever (and still am) playing, it has stellar innovation and diversity between classes, coupled with a very friendly online and international community. There's a place for everyone in the the wide world of Rune-Midgard (and surrounding in-game countries), so why don't you hop on and give it a shot? It may be tough for a new player, but the game is still going strong after ten years of running!

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok Online is a 13 year old MMORPG that has charmed its way into the hearts of millions and continues to this day. Collect hats, PvP, PvE, run insances, make friends, and many many more activities can be done in this grandfather MMO.

iRO is a F2P server, but you can purchase what is called VIP to speed up your leveling experience. I would reccomend this if you are serious about the game.

I will not lie, the cash shop makes this game somewhat P2W but it is not impossible to play without spending a dime. Overall I love this game and it has been a part of my life for the past 8 years and I would change any of the time that I have spent on this server. Long live Ragnarok Online.

Ragnarok Online
Product received for free

Just a jewel of the MMORPG history that i've played for 13 years (still with some comebacks randomly)

Playing Tree of Savior now but Ragnarok still stays in my memories.



Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

I have been playing this game for 15mins. It's hilarious!

The controls are very good and responsive, which is a must for this type of game...
Because it's also unforgiving.

Not because it's stupidly unforgiving, but because there's just SO many unexpected ways you can interact with items... and die.

Now, onto some of my favorite deaths:

#1   I manage to jump and swim across a pond full of piranaes.
- Haha, look at them. They're biting and still looking at the edge of the water, mad that I managed to make it across!
*Piranae picks up speed and jumps out of the water into my face*   X_X

#2   Hmm, a pounding trap... let's see if I can activate it using my slime!
- Yes! Ah crap, now the trap is glued to the bottom of the shaft, preventing me from passing...
- I wonder if I can unglue it by jumping on it and hitting the chain repeatedly
- Oh oh, its unstuck and coming back my way   X_X

#3   Sweet, I just killed this orc thing.
Let's loot it!
- Ooops, I ate it. Only the bones remain.
- Okay, what's up with these bones... let's eat them too?
X_X   Died from choking on the bones.

10/10, would die from choking on bones again.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Despite my (currently) low play time, rest assured I've put at least 30 hours into earlier kickstarter-exclusive builds. This a simply fantastic roguelike platformer. To me, it feels like a combination of Spelunky and Super Smash Bros in a fantasy environment.There are four big selling points I'll discuss below. TL;DR: Very fun, fluid movement, challenging skill based combat, incredible variety of organic environmental interactions, and all play styles are equally supported

The thing that initially drew me to this game is the way the player moves throughout the environment. It's the smoothest system I've ever played with, and traversing the environment is not just a means to an end, it's a pleasure. The only gripe I have with it is there are occasionally environmental hazards you can't protect against, but they're few and far between.

This game is extremely difficult, make no mistake. In my opinion, not all of the stats are as balanced as they should be; it's very difficult to survive hits from Grumbuls (humanoid enemy, think orc) early on, and getting good will definitely take practice. That said, the combat is very fun. Killing the enemies is always satisfying, and your deaths feel horribly brutal, but never unfair. The magic system is very intuitive and is useful both in and out of combat.

The third and perhaps biggest selling point for me is the interactions that happen organically in the world. For instance, within the game there are poisonous mushrooms, boulders, pools of water, and fire magic. Let's look at the interactions possible between these four objects. If there are fish in the water, a mushroom can be thrown in to leak poison into the water and weaken the fish. Using fire magic, you can burn up the mushroom and it's poison cloud to safely pass. Using the same magic, you can super heat the boulder, and hit it into an enemy to deal extra damage and potentially set them alight. If you need food in a pinch, you can heat the rock, push it into a pool to boil the water, and then throw in the mushroom, which will cook and become edible.

The final aspect is that this game supports playing essentially however you want. In many roguelikes, leveling up is based on getting experience from fighting enemies, completing objectives, and so on. In Catacomb Kids, each floor has a leveling orb, which, once picked up, allows the player to level up once. Nothing else matters, as long as you get the orb, you can level up. That means if you want to play by dodging dangerous situations with teleportation magic, no problem. Want to slaughter everyone you come across? Cool. Tackle the levels however you want, because you won't be punished for skipping rooms and opponents like you would be with an EXP system.


Overall, it's a very fun and unique experience that I think is absolutely worth $16 in the current state. The developer is very communicative as well, and does weekly Dev streams on Twitch.

Edit: I forgot a HUGE aspect (equal playstyle representation), so I've updated the TL;DR and added the section.

A thing people always loved about those cranky old-school ROGUELIKES was the fact that the worlds they presented adhered to rules and could therefore play on their own". A foe could find a flask of poison you dropped

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Introduction            	 Catacomb Kids is the Dark souls of the roguelike 2D platformers. If you mess up just a little bit in this game, it punches you in the gut and kicks you in the teeth. Randomly generated catacombs and randomly made characters make the game infinitely fun. Right now Catacomb Kids is in Early Access, but there is tons on different variants in the game. (Weapons, shields, armor, potions, catacombs layouts, and different types of magic.) Right now there is only two classes with more on the way in future updates. Along with all the single player features, there is a verses mode with eight different arenas, but there is only local co-op and verses an AI. The only bad thing that I can say about this game is that there is no setting for changing the difficulty.
Pros
Versus mode
Randomized catacombs
Randomized playable character
No game breaking glitches
Great controller support
No performance issues


Cons
Can be too hard for some
Very unforgiving
Barely any display options


Conclusion
Catacomb Kids is a brutally fun roguelike game, but it could be too hard for some people. It really needs a difficulty setting.  Catacomb Kids has almost unlimited replay value because it has randomly generated playable characters and catacombs. In the end, Catacomb Kids is 100% worth a buy even in Early Access, and there is more content on its way to make this game worth it even more.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Twenty minutes into Catacomb Kids and I've died approximately twice every minute. Completing the tutorial alone saw my death toll rise into high double digits. With over three hours under my belt, I'd say I passed the 100 milestone some time ago.

Catacomb Kids is malicious. I'm not a skilled gamer, but I'm experienced enough to pick up a few universal tricks. This game cares nothing for that; if you go in overconfident, you're going to be humbled. Any bravado will be wiped clean as you're forced to learn the ropes from the very basics. It's difficult not to reference the Souls series, though I'm loathe to as it resembles it in spirit only, but it's still an apt comparison. The game may be a seething, malevolent entity but it's not at all unfair.

You have every means possible to succeed, even from the very beginning. The variety of classes possess myriad skills and equipment, while leveling offers increased stats and perks. Your melee swings must be timed but they're reliable and spells provide valuable effects from a safe range. Your repertoire is further boosted by agile rolls, boost jumps, throws and Mario-style head-stomps. On top of this, you can find loot all over the dungeon to increase stats, quaff or hurl at unfortunate enemies.

The danger you face is all-pervasive. You have your usual mobs which so far have been pretty standard aesthetically but their behaviour helps mix the action up. Slimes cling to surfaces and charge when they spot you, bats will pester you from the sky and bands of goblins will gang up but flee when over-powered. Empty rooms are no reason to let your guard down though; there are minute details revealing traps all over the level. Tiny, pixel-thin tripwires will trigger a flood of gas once broken leaving you a couple of seconds to flee before it ignites, setting the room aflame. Pressure plates will send massive weights crashing to the floor and hidden spikes will pierce you if you get close enough. The sheer variety of ways you'll be dispatched is enough to ease the blow when you're once more incinerated, devoured, flattened, stabbed, poisoned, decapitated etc.

The controls are a little wonky to begin with, at least with keyboard (no mouse necessary). I can see it improving greatly with a gamepad but there are currently some issues the developer plans to address so I've not tried it myself. Of course, I'll update the review once I've had a chance to test it out. There are three main buttons alongside the directional keys but apart from some initial confusion, it works well enough. Later skills, magic and items have appropriate hotkeys; it's all very standard and can be reassigned easily. Once you've adapted to both the control scheme and the mechanics themselves, all the initial issues have resolved.

It's one of those lovely Early Access experiences that could easily function as a finished product but that's not to say that it wouldn't benefit from the months of work ahead. I've had one instance of graphical glitching but nothing game-breaking, so far at least. There are clear plans to include extra content, with entire menus exhibiting future items and the class system promising more than the inital two types. It certainly could do with a little more of everything but what's here already is a solid product. It's hugely playable in its current version, which at least helps ease the worries that comes with all my EA titles.

I'm a roguelite/roguelike fanatic and the recent resurgence of the genre has been my personal Golden Age" but I'm not blind to the flaws inherent in the formula. Catacomb Kids might not sidestep all those pitfalls but it works with what it has to be both unique and exciting. As such

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

There was 4 of us to begin with

We entered the dungeon, came out of the door one by one, the first to go met his fate when an axe swinging back and forth from the ceiling almost cut off his head, he rolled under it just in time, went off the edge because of his roll, and straight into some spikes off the side of the edge

There were 3

The Second to go had found a fancy chest, but it was to dangerous of an area to open it in, he grabbed the chest and brought it with him until it was safe, but the first gap he came across he tried to jump, he fell into spikes AND triggered a pressure plate which sent a hammer flying down and squishing his already dead body.

There were 2

He opened the door confidentally while i stood back watching him, he rolled into the room and was surrounded by tons of monsters and met his maker

There was me

I had 1 health, i rolled through a bunch of monsters, opened a door and before the monsters could get through i closed it, i was safe, i found a dead body, and i was screwed any other way so, i ate the body in hopes food would help me heal, i started eating anything edible i could find until i found a skull, i shrugged, bit into it, and choked on a bone.

There were none

This game is very unforgiving and hard to get used to, but very rewarding if you play well, i give this game in its current state an 8/10

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

I can't express how happy I am that this game has finally made it to steam. I missed the kickstarter so I have been twiddling my thumbs and biting my nails in anticitpation since the day I first saw gameplay. This game hits all the sweets spots when it comes to my criteria for rouge-likes. Lot's of random/procedural goodness, stats, classes, weapons, enemies, clever traps, etc. There is even a brilliant implimentation of some basic physics built into the game which you must strategize with and use to your advantage. The aspect that really makes Catacomb Kids stand out are the small details that add comlexity to such a simple platformer, for example, I discovered that when you are weilding a magic dagger of electricity, jumping into a pool of water will (for now obvious reasons) f***k you up. Another neat mechanic is your food pallet. Eating certain combinations of enemy corpses will have varrying effects. There's tons of small details like these that just gives the game charm and character.

Overall I'm super excited to see how things will progress and just how active the devs will be. The price is a bit steep but I don't regret buying the game. In it's current state it is 100% playable and the most fun I've had with a game this year. My pros/cons:

Pros:
-Hard as nails (in a challenging/fair way)
-Proceduraly generated goodness
-Great pixel-esque graphics and wonderful sound
-Controls are really tight and dialed in (playing on a 360 controller)
-Good varriation of weapons/loot/potions
-The one boss that I've made it to was really badass
-Lots of depth in the game mechanics and strategizing is a must
-The exploding trap is really clever and I've never seen it in another game

Cons:
-As of right now the level layouts and room/combinations repeat quite a bit
-At first the menu and gameplay were really confusing and the tutorial was buggy and confusing as well
-Only 2 classes at the moment (obviously I know this will change)
-Spells are fairly limited as well
-Minor game mechanics that need tweaked/balanced
-All the other expected buggy things/ lag spikes that come with an Alpha build

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

A genuinely fun, if unforgiving, roguelite platformer, Catacomb Kids is a seemingly simple game with excellent gameplay, good atmosphere, and a really neat soundtrack. It is still very much an alpha at the time of this writing, so I would recommend waiting if you're concerned.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This game is unforgiving. Although no mouse support, gamepad support is present and I am yet to try this. Controls can be remapped, especially as jump on Z is annoying.

Like the top review, A LOT of funny playthroughs have happened in my short play time.

1) You can jump on things to kill them. I jumped on a poisonous mushroom to destroy it... which launched me into a swinging trap. No more leg. I landed in a lake with pirahnas. Dead.

2) Ate a troll thing. Survived. Ate another troll thing. Got poisoned. Ate is bones. Choked and died.

3) Drank a clear potion. Turned into a block of ice and died.

4) Drank an orange potion. Poisoned and got killed by a flipping bat.

Many ways to die.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Prepare to die! MANY times. This game is all about making wise decisions at a rapid pace.
Do you fight that skeleton or stealthily avoid it? Do you jump that lava chasm or hope for another way around?
With a little bit of luck and experimentation.  You will learn tactics to survive and overcome your enemies. Using the traps of the Catacombs against them. Spells, and random magical loot also help in survival. Nonethless though, it all can end quickly as one mistake can spell your doom. Catacomb Kids is an unforgiving game.

I made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Before the review, I'd like to say this is my first time reviewing any game, and I have been hyped for this game since 2013, so this review may be slightly biased.

Where to start... most things about this game are excellent! The controls are excellent IF you use a controller (I'll get into that later), the enemies are really fun to fight, the combat feels pretty nice, and mechanics are what makes this game stand out.

About the controls, I say it's excellent with a controller because the keyboard is a little weird, however that's just my opinion. It's not unmanagable though, and if you prefer keyboard, go for it!

The enemies are really interesting, since the grumbles, which are the main enemies, tend to have a lot of health, however are easily predictable. The slimes, goos, and byats are all easy meals, which is great. When you descend deeper, more types of enemies start to appear, making the game a little more difficult each floor.

The combat is something that made this game really great. With blocking, rolling, parrying, and dismemberment, you have tons of options. There are a variety of melee weapons, aswell as tomes for those who prefer the mage class. Speaking of tomes, the spells in this game are each unique, and are all good in their own way.

The mechanics, however, are what makes this game what it is. For example, you can heat up a boulder using a fire spell, then push it into water, pick up a poison mushroom and cook it, ridding the poison and making it safe to eat. You can beat enemies to death, create distractions, or activate traps or switches with JUST a rock! You can melt balls of slime or goo, and consume them for health, or use them as weapons against grumbles by blinding them. You can knock over torches and create a fire, burning enemies in the vicinity. Plus how each kid is randomized with different traits just adds more variety to this game!

That's the end of this review. Keep in mind, this is my first one, and it may not be clear. If you're interested in difficult, but fun rogue-likes, you'll definitely want to pick this game up. 9/10.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

I absolutely *love* this game, early access though it may be.

It's *brutal*. It's not uncommon to roll away from an enemy and straight onto some spikes within seconds of starting the game.

But it's *fun*. It's like Spelunky (you HAVE played Spelunky, haven't you?) except with some traditional action RPG elements like classes, equipment, skills and attributes, and it makes for lots of intriguing possibilities.

Maybe you play as a Wanderer, and you pick up the first Grumbul corpse you find, hold down V to track the Grumbuls. You find the leveling orb and level up Intelligence and choose Trajectory. You aim the first mystery potion you have at a pair of Grumbuls, but it's a potion of might! Fortunately, you also knocked over a sconce and set the floor on fire. One of them makes a beeline for you, so you run like mad. Fortunately, you chose Boots of Gossamer and you don't trip the pressure plate, but the Grumbul does... but not slow enough to get caught by it. It hits you for two health out of your four and sets you on fire. You roll into water to put the fire out and then jump out of the water, but not before a -off fishana jumps out of the water and takes your final health point.

Maybe you play as a poet, and you chance it with three health. You learn the Double Jump spell (it's a spell in this game!) and find another Magic In Motion spellbook. You hold C to learn that one, too, but click on the middle, which gives you the floating book skill Otherblink". You get the leveling orb and choose Strength with the skill Heavy Lifting

Early Access Review

This game is tough. Like it will rend you a new behind, tough. It tests your intelligence, skill, and overall ability as you fight the myrid of opponents the Catacombs have to offer. I am new and have been killed by a slime 6 times and by falling into darkness that lead to spikes 4 times. Despite the deaths I still want to play, it is that kind of game, the kind that keeps pushing you down but regardless you keep getting back up. The developer Fourbitfriday truely has put his love in this game. So if you like platformers that have RPG elements and are very difficult going in, then this game is for you. I myself shall continue to explore those Catacombs and fight the Grumbuls and other monsters it has to offer.

Vagante's older Brother.  Catacombs Kids expects you to become a real MacGyver, to make the most out of what you got to get through each level. This is where the game truly shines. You can't just steamroll through everything. Sometimes your ingenuity will get you further into the game than pure strenght. Knowing the strenghts and weaknesses of your character, you must assess the situation and sometimes act quick to get through certain areas.  When you do kill enemies or get through the level by using your head, it feels extremely rewarding.I am so glad i bought this and Vagante as both provide a kind of different experience but ultimately both are very fun.

Death 1: green slime
Death 2: green slime
Death 3: burning green slime
Death 4: purple slime
Death 5: spikes
Death 6: ricocheting bottle of lava that i didnt know existed until i used trajectory into lava and hit hit a green slime on its way back to me killing us both... fml XD
Death 7: still laughing about death 6, while getting murdered by a green slime
Death 8: grumble

This game will test your resolve and make you go insane if you let it. but kleep in mind 99% of the deaths you inevitably will recieve will still be as funny as your first time playing and they will be YOUR FAULT, you were too slow to react, jumped a tad bit too far/late drank the wrong potion ect. The game gives you a few ways to puss out by Finding another way" to do things but if you cant handle it

I backed this on Kickstarter, so I didn't pay the full $16, but I would if I had to. Worth every cent, I knew this game would be awesome when I first saw it, and now that I've been able to play it, I have been proven right. I know that a lot of people are wary of early access games, as they should be, but this one is 100% worth it. The developer is kind and quick to fix issues, and the game truly speaks for itself. It's very challenging, but so much fun. Great game, highly reccommend.

Tough, unforgiving, and death is often. Rewards players who think about their surroundings instead of rushing head-first into the room full of baddies. I'd say it was worth the wait.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

One of the most detailed, polished and simply fun Rogue-Lite" games out there even in it's early stages. I genuinely think it can compete with the likes of Spelunky and Binding of Isaac if it continues to be developed like this.

Edit: I have been a kickstarter backer and have been playing the alpha for much longer than what is visible on steam."

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This game is so mean to me, but I love it! I've been slimed, decapitated, torn to shreds, burnt, poisoned, drowned, poisoned and drowned at the same time, burned to death with my own spells, burned to death after knocking over a torch, burned to death after incenerating a goblin, only to have him start me on fire, and many more.

Fastest death so far? 3 seconds after spawning (yep, my fault). Longest lived character? Probably 40 minutes and I was DAMN PROUD!!

Hard as it is, it's totally fair. Each of my deaths was due to inexperience, rushing in without looking, panicking and mashing the attack button instead of timing it, mis-timing a jump, or (most frequently) losing a fight due to poor strategy or timing. The battles can be pretty epic, especially once your skill level rises and you can be more creative with your combat choices. Early on you'll be happy you lived at all.

There's something about the way permadeath is done in this game that makes it fun and very compelling. Part of this might be due to the fact it's only in Alpha 0.0.9 and is extraordinarily fast & responsive, and impressively bug-free for such an early version.

There are a couple issues I'd like to see fixed. The jump mechanic can be a little wonky. If you jump into a wall with a ladder on it, you'll stick to wherever you hit on the wall as long as (a) there's a ladder there, and (b) you're still pushing left or right on your controller. However, if you roll the controller UP as you reach the wall (a natural movement, since you'll be wanting to go up the moment you get there), then you will not stick to the wall and instead fall back to the ground.

Lastly, a wired XBOX controller makes a HUGE difference -- it's much easier than the keyboard for this game -- but the controller bindings don't work for OSX. I ended up buying ControllerMate for OSX and then programming it to match the KBD1 key bindings.  The game doesn't seem to actually recognize the controller; it works because ControllerMate converts each button press to an equivalent key binding.

Overall, if you like dungeon crawlers of any type, this may end up being your favorite.

Early Access Review

Catacomb Kids is a real-time roguelike platformer that draws more than a few cues from Spelunky, but approaches the genre in a manner all its own, resulting in a game that mashes roleplaying elements with platforming and inevitable death with a suprising degree of depth and tact.

Fromt the start, Catacomb Kids serves up a generous helping of character diversity, with two (and eventually six) different classes to choose from in the beginning, and an infinite pool of randomly-rolled characters with entirely different starting stats and equipment within each class, not to mention a randomly-generated appearance and name, just to reinforce how different each of your runs will be. Even in the game's current incarnation, the Bully and Poet classes offer an entirely different gameplay experience from the start, and even then, a vividly different experience depending on whether your chosen victi-er, hero" is

Already worth its price, no risk of early access disappointment.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

First this game is still in Early Acces but it feels already pretty finished. There are NO awful bugs and the game runs pretty well. Furthermore the developers are constantly working on the game and they are very close to the
community( https://www.reddit.com/r/CatacombKids/new/  ) as you can see here.

There is enough content to play hundreds of hours or even more and not only because it is a rouge-like. Catacomb Kids has so many possible ways to play. On every new run you can try someting new and so its never get boring. For example there are five different weapon classes(Hammers, Swords, Daggers, Spears, Axes) and each weapon class splits into six differnt typs. And those are just the weapons, there are also magic, armor, skills for each weapon class and so on. This game can be incomprehensibly complex, but this is the point why Catacomb Kids makes so much fun! Though you have to invest some time to understand everything and get into. And yes the game is really hard and you will fail at the beginning however its a part of the game and you will love it.
The graphics are functional that is clear. But the Pixelart has its charm and the game looks in his own way very beautiful.

So just buy this piece of software and have fun! You won't regret it :D

The price may be intimidating, but regardless this game is amazing. Whether or not you want to pick this up though, is your choice. Even in early-access this game is relatively bug free, haven't run into a single one, Yet not all content is there yet. WARNING: This game does not mess around when it says 'brutal'. Normal enemies can one shot you if you have low defence. Be prepared.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

As of this review, the game is currently in Early Access for about $16, so its price and content may not be representative of its final product.

So continuing on to the actual part of the review, This Pixel-art Rogue-like game is amazing. I don't even know where to begin, so I guess I'll start off with the background. I originally torrented an earlier version of this game. Yes, I'm a terrible person, but keep in mind how hard it can be to judge a game from a trailer and some gameplay footage. (Hint: It's bloody difficult.) I did end up purchasing the game though, because I think that the content that they placed for early access was spot-on.

What piqued my curiosity from this game is the depth of this game. There's just so many interactions in this game that you simply would not expect a Triple A developing team would do. While I am comparing apples to oranges here, let's say you're in an Open-world RPG and you kill a goblin. Would you have been able to eat the goblin down to the bone? Would you have been able to eat the bones of the goblin and possibly choke on some while losing health? Simply put, you can in Catacomb Kids. For anyone playing, if you kill the purple slime and throw the ball toward the kombold, then it blinds the enemy allowing you to kill it or let it fall into the traps.

If you are able to, you can bottle a ball of slime and cook it in an open camp fire and drink the slime. Luckily for me, it was sweet. After going through some floors, you can meet a merchant, which sells a number of different equipment. Of course, on the off-chance that you don't have any money from killing the goblins, you can try and kill the merchant him/herself to acquire some loot. It's just these little things, like throwing a goblin into a lake of piranhas to get across without being gnawed to death, that is really fun.

Each time I enter a new floor,  goes down. Quite literally; there are traps being activated with spikes from a pressure plate, flammable gases dispersed to blow up, mushrooms that extrude nauseous gases, and potions that can either freeze, zap, or burn you to death. Simply put, each floor is pretty unforgiving in its current state of the game, and on the off chance you step on a trap and it teleports you to the bottom of the stage, you better hope that you don't get stepped on like a goomba. Personal experience from that.

Gameplay aside, Controls in the game are top-notch, but a bit atypical from what I expected. If you have some experience using a Super Nintendo Emulator like snes9x, then you will get into this game a little bit smoother than others. I wish that the interaction between the ladder and wooden platform would be a little bit smoother, but that's something to wait for later I suppose.

As for graphics, the game seems to be currently set to a 4:3 aspect ratio resolution, but won't be a huge deal as most of the area will be covered in the shadows. There's no options for AA whatsoever or quality settings, but let me be honest here. You won't need to worry about having 800x600 screen to play this.

My main gripe at the moment is probably the music. It's not bad in that it doesn't fit, nor is it just poorly composed. I just wish I had an option to turn it off, even moreso it would be nice if the music would be muted when I'm on a different program. Other than that, it's quite soothing.

**

Overall, a lot of people have been saying to wait until the final product comes out. I don't disagree with this statement. I'd hate to be hyped up for a game only to be disappointed and regret investing my money into this team, but this game deserves my money. While I have not been able to get to the end of the game, the content they currently have out right now feels like enough content to be a full-fledged game. Just not for the same price value.

If anything though, I wish that there would be some more random interactions between heading to the next floor. So far, I've been able to see two different merchants, a kombold encampment, and a narrow dungeon. There would be times between each floor where I get a wad of cash, not knowing when or where I'll spend it. Perhaps a clergyman can heal players, a wizard that can imbue weapons, or a tailor can disguise you as a kombold. They're probably coming in the updates, but here's to hoping that this game will be worth the investment!

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

It wasn't until now, dying once again to the Reaper, that I decided to write a review. You'd think this would come after finally defeating him -- but I still haven't. I just had my best chance and blew it, and it was truly awesome. I'm not great at platformers at all, but this game is difficult. Yet, unlike, say, Dark Souls (not really a platformer -- I know, shhhh), it always feels fair. Not at first, no. At first it's going to feel like you're bouncing down a flight of stairs, and once he adds stairs you probably will. But eventually you'll understand the various complexities of what makes a good build and how to navigate the world without dying. How to navigate quickly, eventually. And how to find, after hours and hours, the thing that's truly exciting about this game. That shot of adrenaline.

I might play a 20 minute session or two hours. For instance, I spent more time writing this than I did on the run that inspired me to write this. But it's not a casual game in the slightest. It's unforgiving.

I can't wait to see what classes he adds next and what other weird systems he'll introduce. I haven't felt that way about an EA game in a while. Most of the time I just sit tight and hope for the best. In this case, I check daily to see if the new build is out, because I know there's a new class in it (Wanderer).

Use a controller.

I hope it gets optimized as it goes, since it starts to chug a bit on my Mac around Floor 3. My gaming PC handles it fine though, so (shrug).

There's not a ton of content just yet, but I've been entertained for almost 30 hours over the past few months by it, and I expect to play a lot more as it grows. I also play a lot of games and cycle through them pretty quickly. I have this sitting firmly atop my Perpetually Playing" category.

It's dope. I feel cool playing it even though I suck at it. Like I know that it'll either be huge or it'll just stay this rad secret I know about. Either way -- but I hope it takes off

This is A tough as nails roguelite platformer and I love it! It's currently very tough. If you are looking for a casual game, look elsewhere. It has excellent controls, especially with a controller. I know why I died every time.

I'll update later, but I've been playing the alpha builds. It's only getting better with each release.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Disclaimer, I backed this on Kickstarter and played quite a bit before EA.
If you want  the short version: It's pretty damn awesome.

Okay, slightly longer one. Mix of Spelunky and Darks Souls kind of fits but with even infinitely more weird stuff that happens. It's always the bunch of things that interact in ways you had never thought of making something awesome, just so you can abuse the hell out of it next afterwards.

You can  and really should experiment. If only your life probably will end quickly otherwhise. And with time you learn tricks that help you tremendously - or kill you because you make some incredibly dumb mistake. Maybe lay a  stone on the pressure plate to trigger the giant weight and go through before it is back up? Maybe stop it by freezing the whole thing in place? Or just use some slime to stick it to the ground? Or maybe you should cut of the rope and throw it around with that one strength boon? Or just let enemies run into it and laugh? Or use it to craft items? Or put bouncy paste under it to throw enemies into the air just before they become pancakes with no chance of escape? Or...

These lists of interactions can be made for pretty much all gameplay elements. And all these things you can do connect with the other things you can find or make.
For the EA part: It's surprisingly polished. At the moment the biggest stuff missing is content past floor  5. There are a bunch of supre scary enemies and variety but if you get past the Twins (yeah, as if, good luck :P) the difficulty slowly decreases because the later stuff isn't there yet. Also, so far only ~20 from the ~60? level up boons are implemented so if you get that far you probably don't want to focus on one stat only. To be fair, you will have to play for a loooong time until you see any of that.

It is a game of YASD but you keep comming back and back and back. And I don't think there is any game quite like it.
In short: It's pretty damn awesome.

What to expect

Similarly to, Rogue Legacy, you will play as a randomly generated character with various skill buffs and deficiencies. A trait like Likes Swords will give your kid a skill bonus, while a trait like clumsy will make them particularly loud when landing. You level up by picking up glowing orbs, or gain magical spells by finding books in the dungeon. Its fairly easy to get into the rhythm of bounding around and fighting off the denizens of the catacombs.

You should expect to DIE without warning. This game is incredibly difficult, and it doesnt care how or when you die. You will enter a level and suddenly youve been slain by an orc, or by drinking a potion that happens to burn you alive. Once that occurs, its back to square one with a new kid and on to penetrating a new dungeon.

Catacomb kids is definitely not for the squeamish or the impatient. You have to take your take to assure yourself safe passage through the catacombs, and keep your guard up against the terrifying A.I. of the monsters. Im not going to say the game gets easier when you get higher levels, or gear, because Ive never had the pleasure of becoming a powerhouse. Catacomb Kids takes pleasure in destroying your hopes and dreams, and more than likely it was your own damn fault.

This game uses objects in a way that not many others have. You can eat the corpses of the fallen, or throw their goo against a wall to create a sticky trap. You can combine meals to increase your stats, use potions as bombs, and so much more. There is a lot to the system if you live long enough to bask in its glory.

Changes we want/Additions

Attribute deficiencies  I dont mind the random skills that give the player some negative factors, but the negatives in stat points is unnecessary. The game is already brutally hard to the point that it seems like an annoyance to lose stat points. Especially when you can enter a catacomb and instantly die from the swipe of an enemy after finding a perfect stat combination for your character.

Scenery - Level design is fine for a Rogue Lite, but the levels become a cluster of cobbled rock too quickly. Id like to see more of a varied look to the areas. If for nothing more than adding a bit more ambience to my continuous deaths.
Platforming  Platforming is a bit too floaty and will lead to tons of accidental deaths. I wish it was more traditional to the 2D spirit of Super Mario and other platformers.

Enemy Difficulty  When youre starting out the enemies are much too powerful. Youll face off against monsters who can take 5 stabs from your weapon, and instantly kill you in one hit. Its a little too frustrating after dying multiple times in a session, and finally gaining victory and receiving terrible drops.

Gearing up  Since Orcs dont mess around and can kill you in one hit at the start of the game. The reward for defeating them is usually an awful piece of gear. Since these hard nose battles can end with them simply winning through a battle of attrition, defeating them should feel more rewarding to the player. Mostly because they are pretty adept at breaking through your attacks, and ignoring any top of roll moves you attempt.

Cooperative play  This title features a competitive mode which is cool and all, but Id love to tackle the dangerous catacombs with a pal. Make it happen!

Early Access Verdict

As of Early Access release Catacomb Kids is a brutally hard game that often focuses too hard on frustrating the player. It has a lot going for it in the way of a great item system and interesting combat. The A.I. is murderously powerful and unrelenting, the jumps are a little imprecise, and slaying the enemies isnt as rewarding as it could be.
As of now the game is loads of fun, but feels as if determination isnt enough to progress through the catacombs. Id prefer better rewards and investment for tackling death at every corner. It needs a little less Dark Souls and slightly more Dungeon of the Endless at the moment. Lets see how it shapes up in the next couple of patches!

This game is already more full of content then many full games...

And it's GOOD content. I played at least 100 hours before it came out on steam, and it looks like I'm getting a lot more.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

My Let's Play, skip below for the quick impressions:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9310oIFNIds

Roguelite Platformer with tons of RPG mechanics.  As you explore, your map will slowly flesh itself out with an almost intense fog-of-war shrouding your playing field which managed to kill me good with traps just out of sight.  Even though I know they are randomly generated levels, they feel designed with cruel intentions.  Which is to say, this game is HARD.  Unmercifully hard.  And it's permadeath.

But the game is about experimenting.  Not only do you have to pick a class with specfic attributes, you're given a random roster of characters to choose from (within that class) that have a random assortment of starting equipment and attributes.

And even though it's only version 0.0.6 game is really tight.  Animations are excellent (in my Let's Play, I land on a ledge and my character had to catch his balance which felt perfect for the situation because there were a set of spikes right below me) as well as cause and effect.  Find a potion and drink it? Now you have an empty glass bottle.  You could throw it at an enemy or drop it on a trap.

You can carefully open doors so that you may re-close them, or you could bust them open and then destroy them.

There are only two classes to choose from right now with another four to be released at a later date.

I think my only real complaint is that it's local co-op and not online co-op.

Amazing game. Hard as hell. Permadeath dungeon crawler platforming game with many ways to approach situations and tons of ways to die. You will die a lot, but it makes succeeding that much more rewarding.

You begin by selecting one of three (at the moment, only three) classes and then you pick a character from a randomly selected group of individuals, each with their own unique abilites, items and weaknesses. Once you enter the catacombs you are free to do whatever you like. You can go back through the door you just entered right from the start or you can rush the door to the next floor. However the smart way to play would be to explore the area and grab the orb of leveling" which can be found on each floor as that is the only way to level your character.

You can interact with just about everything in the environment

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This game is probably one of the most mechanically solid experiences I have seen. The animations are excellent, the combat is great and the difficulty will make you wanna stab yourself.

I particularly enjoy the interactions between objects and enemies. It is reminiscent of games like Spelunky (which I love). There is also a nice amount of detail like Grumbuls hunting smaller creatures and being able to knock over torches in the background to set things on fire.

The mechanics are fantastic and things like climbing and jumping feel responsive and fluid. Combat is nice and entertaining with things like shield blocking, grappling and using the environment to your advantage. Everything feels" just right and it's a joy to jump and run and stab and so on and so forth.

So far it is a bit lacking in content though. Only one "area"

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

One thing this game really needs is a intro message saying This game is not for the feint of heart". The reason being is that catacomb kids will beat your  into ground and then chew on it for good measure. Even the tutorial is hard to get trhough without dying atleast five times. Yet despite it's ruthlessness I feel an odd mix of total satasifaction and soul-crushing depression every time I play it. CK is increadibly in depth and leaves much to be discovered on your own. I lost track of how many "not so obvious tricks" I learned from my ("checks death counter") 73 deaths. But don't let my ever so depressing review scare you away

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Item and environment interaction is something so integral to good roguelikes. It's something that sets them apart from games like Rogue Legacy, that have the kind of difficulty roguelike fans look for, and an affectation of 'nintendo hard' platformers that hit people right in the nostalgia, but have no real substance behind them.

I could tell right away that the developers of Catacomb Kids were not only familiar with more venerable roguelikes, but that they had a keen insight into what makes them so captivating. I often find myself thinking my way around a problem much like I would in Nethack or DCSS, where I'd tally my resources and make calculated decisions that would often fail spectacularly. My poor catacomb kid would die, but with every death I learn a little more about the game's logic.

This level of complex entity interaction is something I expect from any game calling itself a roguelike (much more so than, say, the overzealous expectation of an ASCII interface), even to an extent that I believe it's a cornerstone of the genre.

Catacomb Kids does not claim an indulgence of weapon types, monsters, or classes for the player. Instead, they have created a meaningful and treacherous arena for players who want a game that demands that they think tactically and, most importantly, learn from their mistakes.

Catacomb Kids

Gracefully dismember three Grumbul, knocking two of them into a brazier and sparking a fire that finishes them off. Yeah. I'm a badass. Pick up a hot potato attempting to rifle through the pockets of the bodies. Die. Fear the potatoes, they know when your guard is down. They know when your health is low. They come to sear your palms when you least expect it.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

My takeaway so far - Its very much like Vagante, but with a little bit crisper platforming controlls.

If you dont know Vagante, then this game is essentially a traditional rougelike but with a side scrolling  dungeon/cave instead of top down.  The main difference being that its not turn based of course.  This isnt a rick dangerouse/splunky/ect style thing (no they are not rouglikes at all).  This type of game has a lot more focus of RPG things like leveling up, finding equipment and spells ect.

Its good so far, playable and fun.  A few crashes from time to time but its very early alpha and is pretty polished at this early stage.

Its hard, like vagante, but because the movement is a bit crisper and free flowing, its not as frustrating.

Recommeded if you like the genre.



Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This is a strong recommend from me; even at an Alpha stage of development. The procedurally generated dungeons and the statistically random generated characters add endless variety and unique situations.

Brutal and unforgiving. Expect quick deaths if you do not have appropriate reaction speeds; the random generator can create incredibly difficult to traverse trap rooms. One nice touch right from the beginning is the ability to re-roll by entering the exit from the previous floor.

There are too many gameplay elements to explain, but the attention to detail in the weapon-type combat, spell-type combat, and ailments is very refined and filled with variety, even at an Alpha stage. The level up upgrades (Rainbow Orb); if you survive long enough to make it to these coveted items, they will allow you to use attribute upgrades like parrying, free-running, reduced damaged from traps, plus many more expanded as you obtain more orbs.

I am very excited to see the game develop further, to see more classes, and see how refined the gameplay between them comes. To be honest, the two class system works for me currently, but having more, it would be interesting to see. I for one, would love to see a miner-like character.

Catacomb Kids

This game is amazing! Its brutal and fun and every run feels so different. Already played it for around 12 hours and its really good. Not like a lot of other rogue-like's where randomization feels bland. With the diversity of kids and layout and starting armor and magic etc, you feel like ever run is unique.

Closure
CLOSURE is a black and white alienish platform puzzle game where the world exists because of light. Without light, there is only nothing and I mean nothing, if you try to jump onto a platform that doesn't have light near it, you will fall through the world. If you are swimming and your light floats away, you will drop out of the world without it. Solid walls become jumps when there is no light on them. The object of each of the almost 100 levels is basically to make it to the door at the end. You can pick up lit orbs, you can put lit orbs into carriers that will carry them. This leads to some really interesting platform mechanics, such as moving lights turn into elevators when normally they'd be solid walls. You can put orbs into transporters that will make 2 areas lit instead of 1. There are push boxes, push rollers that will of course roll, lit push boxes, lamps that you can adjust to cast light onto different areas and so on. This is a unique, enjoyable, atmospheric, immerse game, but I have a feeling that once you're done, you're done. They made a really alien world here and the music is awesome and belongs in a suspense drama. After the tutorial levels when the game opens up, the music eases up so its not as intense. Very worth a play through, I own it a few different ways, Steam, GOG, did I mention its free for Playstation Plus members?

Closure
Guide your little person up the ladder, across the gaps in the floor and out the door. But if you can't see it, It doesn't exist. Walk off into the darkness and fall into oblivion. Wall lamps can be rotated to reveal floors and glowing orbs can be carried to light your way. Some doors need to be unlocked with a key and you can carry only one thing at a time. Appropriate for a game about light and shadow the odd art design is done entirely in black and white.

The levels were a bit on the easy side, But I enjoyed the light/dark aspect, music and art design. Things are kept at a minimum, Though perhaps too minimal. I think more interesting things could have been done with the games gimmick. There's no story in the game. Just different themes for the three groups of levels. Which is fine as the game is fairly abstract anyway, But filling out the vignettes more would have been nice.

Closure
Closure's puzzle design is new, unique, and absolutely brilliant.  The story is told without you ever reading anything or any voice acting.  The music and art style is extremely moody and creepy in an almost Tim Burton-esque way, but still has plenty of it's own personality.  Highly reccomended for it's top notch atmosphere and genious puzzle design.  Solving the puzzles always feels rewarding.  I cannot complement the developers enough on this masterpiece.

Closure
Closure is a platform-puzzle game in a very unique form.

It has a very beautiful and minimalist (and kind of creepy) design all in black and white and very good sound and music as well. The way the game works with the shadow/light is pretty cool, and the levels are very well design, some of them has more than one way to be completed or some secrets"

Closure
I suppose the concept is pretty original, yes, but I think that's for a reason... there's just no way it could've worked. A puzzle platformer where the puzzles are easy and the platforming is clunky. Spend several minutes on tedious puzzles only to fail a jump and have to restart the entire level. Whoops, that looked solid, but apparently it isn't. Item babysitting is really fun, especially when the entire game is focused around it.

Sigh. I can't be nice to this game, there's not much enjoyable about it.

The puzzles" in this game are not ever too challenging. The hardest part is figuring out whether or not what you're trying to do is actually possible

Closure
This game has a unique aesthetic combined with a novel game mechanic. The multi-legged shape-shifting protagonist uses light to manipulate the game world. Whatever is not illuminated does not exist. The levels build on this mechanic and become increasingly complex as the player works through the challenge of completing the game.

Some levels (at least for me) are fairly challenging while others will seem straight forward, but I suspect different gamers will find a varying level of challenge on the same levels. i.e. What is a piece of cake for me might be a bear for you and vice versa.

I've played this game for about 8 hours over a few days and am closing in on completing it. Hoping to achieve 100% completion. The game has fascinated me and left me wanting to get back and see what new creative challenge the next level holds.

Closure
Closure is a puzzle game with a simple premise - what you cant see really isn't there. I thought this was a cool premise.

Most of the puzzles were very easy some even purely atmospheric. However, many times i fell through annoying small holes in the ground or messed up on something really minute causing me to replay the whole level. This game was still very fun despite being really annoying.

The final level set and secret bonuses were mostly pretty challenging and enjoyable. Closure has no replay value but the over 100 levels should last a decent amount of time themselves. There is also a developer commentary unlocked when you complete the game any%. I found it fairly interesting.

I got this game in the 1$ humble bundle. I thought it was a great game buy it if you like an atmospheric puzzler

Closure
Remember those short levels in Yoshi's Island where you could only see through a small light circle surrounding your character ?
This puzzle game elaborates upon the idea on more sophisticated ways, but with a unique catch: what cannot be seen does not exist. Platforms and walls become thin air when not in light.
From this base, there is enough variation not to be bored along the way.

Please note that the atmosphere is very strange and gloomy in this game, which you may or may not like.

If you want a demo, I advise you to try the Flash prototype the devs published a long time ago at Newsground. The final game is slightly better and more refined iirc, but it should give you a taste.

Closure
Closure is a 2D platform puzzle game, where everything that has light on it exists. Everything that doesn't have lights will make you fall down. If you fall  down to the bottom of the screen you will die. That sounds really simple as a mechanic, but is really well executed in the game. With a great look at detail. The thing you have to do is in every level is that you have to open a door to get to the next level. So you  for instance have to find a key or get some object activated to open the door.  You will be really challenged by many of puzzles. Some puzzles also got me really stuck for a while. What I like in the levels are the many different puzzles with new objects. The design and the sounddesign combine well within the game, working well with the game's aesthetics. The only bad thing I can say about the game was that at the third stage of the game the puzzles where strangely enough really easy. When compared to the stages before that. (Maybe it was just me.) Closure is instead of many other puzzle games I experienced, packed with many hours of gameplay. (12 hours )
Closure is also one of the few games that convinced me to replay some levels over again to get all the collectables. Which is challenging.

In short: A puzzle game with many hours of play where only anything in the light exists.

If you are interested you can try the gameplay out on newgrounds:
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/480006
( Also maybe interesting for people who own it because it has different levels )

Closure
Very unique puzzle - platforming game, utilising light as the main element. The game introduces different mechanics very well on each level, and tests the player with different combined mechanics  within a level. The artwork is brilliant, Tim Burton-ish style glamoured with Lovecraft's world. The music is beautifully composed, bringing up different theme on each level but still retaining the eerie atmosphere. The game also entices you to explore the level- not just completing the puzzle, by putting hidden moths throughout all levels which is complusory to finish the game completely. I would recommend this game for people who likes puzzle games and/or gothic art style.

Closure
The fear of the dark is one of the most common phobias. But how many people really fear the dark, and not just the real or imagined threats it conceals? Certainly anyone who plays Closure, Eyebrow Interactive's wickedly creative indie game. In Closure's world, only what is visible exists-- step on a shadow and you'll fall right off the screen. To light a path through each level, the player must learn to use various arrangements of fixed, rotating, or portable light sources.

This is two-dimensional platforming like you've never seen before. Carry lamps to preserve the solid ground beneath you. Divide walls into stepping stones by lighting them in segments. Free trapped objects by temporarily eliminating obstructions from reality. Even across 72 levels, these inventive puzzles never fail to surprise.

Closure's spooky, greyscale style perfectly matches its central theme of light and shadow. Artist Jon Schubbe is responsible for the hallucinatory environments, which range from underground mines to deserted carnivals; Chris Rhyne provides the unearthly music and sound effects; and programmer Tyler Glaiel ties it all together. With no unnecessary parts, this game is an articulate, memorable experience.

The player takes control of three human characters throughout the game, each with their own backstory that is left open to interpretation. The player can also travel to the hub world, a land of doors occupied by an arachnid creature with horns and a hollow face, who gives access to the human protagonists. The difficulty ramps up smoothly when the levels are played in consecutive order, but if you get stuck in one world, you can use the hub world to jump to another.

Gamers exhausted by the frantic pace of many games will find relief in the methodical progression of Closure. No time limits or point scores here-- not even a Heads-Up Display. The game clearly wants you to share the unhurried pace of the protagonists as you explore their environments. Before proceeding through a level, it is sometimes necessary to study the paths taken by meandering globes of light, which I found to be a relaxing, almost meditative experience. If you're feeling impulsive, however, a fast respawn speed lets you experiment without punishment.

With Closure, Eyebrow Interactive proves that a game built around a single gameplay mechanic can offer not only an absorbing experience, but a re-playable one as well. To reach the game's many collectable items, players are often required to devise entirely new solutions to familiar puzzles. This results in a more sophisticated difficulty scale than traditional easy or hard modes, as players can choose their difficulty mid-level. That said, some of the later levels are mind-boggling. But a good challenge is healthy, and in a market saturated with mindless button-mashers, it is good to see a game that encourages thoughtfulness.

TL;DR -- Cool concept with a haunting aesthetic; smart puzzles that award creative solutions.

Closure
One of the few puzzle games I've completed without resorting to a walkthrough. The solutions are by no mean obvious or easy, but they always make sense.

Closure
A very challenging puzzle-platformer presented in black and white to take advantage of the shadows.

Whatever the light does not touch does not exist.
Expertly guide the light from one side of the map to the next to progress to the next room.
It is not as easy as it sounds, believe me.
This is trial and error in every sense of the word.
You are going to die. Alot.

8.5/10

Closure
Closure is a game unlike anything else out there.

Which isn't necessarily saying much on its own merit; there are many games out there are that are one-of-a-kind but also aren't really well-made games.

Closure isn't this game.

The core mechanics consist of a puzzle-platformer where solid ground shifts according to what is visible in the light. A very simple concept to understand, yet in end-game becomes very complex.

The atmosphere and art direction contribute substantially to the light/dark dynamic, and overall create a particular experience that only Closure can deliver.

If you enjoy puzzle-platformers, interesting art design, and conceptually stimulating gamesets, this is a game you cannot miss.

Closure
In Closure you will find challenging puzzles based on special orbs of light which you play with in a strategic way to reach the end of each level . It's got original and funny graphics along with a great soundtrack as well.

Closure
A well-paced and very challenging puzzle platformer with some interesting game mechanics, great art style and soundtrack. The disturbing and surreal atmosphere and plenty of room for its interpretation also make this game stand out among other platformers.

Closure
B&W platformer with a dark atmosphere. Play with lights & shadows, tons of possibilities. Just began trying to speedrun it, and there are some amazing shortcuts. Ambiant music is quite soft, has a nice ring, and not too tedious, even after listening to it for couple hours straight !

Closure
If I cant see it, it doesnt exist. This is pretty much the premise of the game and it is executed to very good effect. Closure is a puzzle platformer in which you are a weird little creature with no face, running about in the dark, and clinging desperately to the light so you dont fall off into nothingness while you try to map out each level and locate the exit. Oh and then you steal some peoples faces or something and solve light based puzzles in their bodies or whatever.

The puzzles themselves are pretty clever. In each new zone you start out with some pretty simple puzzles which gradually introduce new elements to you, but towards the end of the zone youre having to work out some pretty complicated stuff. The way these puzzles work is that walls and floors do not exist in the dark, so you have to position lamps and orbs of light about the place to let you do stuff like pass through a wall and not fall through the floor into the abyss, or maybe ride a spotlight up a wall to the exit. Its a bit weird at first really, but definitely an innovative twist on the standard puzzle platformer. One thing I really like about Closure as a puzzle platformer is that it doesnt just delight in killing you for no reason (unlike certain other dark puzzle platformers). Every level has a good sense of logic about it that you could probably work out without dying if you were careful and really thought about it; Closure doesnt resort to tricking you into dying, thats just not its style. The fact that Closure puts such a weighting on logic rather than trickery or trial and error (though I did have many trial an error moments trying to get my head around some of the harder puzzles) means that every level completed comes with a strong sense of accomplishment, as opposed to other puzzle platformers which only provide the feeling that youre glad its over before you walk into the next ridiculous trap.

The music that accompanies the game is top notch and really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Closure even makes use of some Tuban throat singing, which I dont think Ive heard in a game before, but it works really well for the existential and slightly creepy theme that Closure has going on.

There is one thing that I would warn people about with this game, and that is that I encountered a really weird bug playing this game on my new laptop (Windows 8.1 with integrated intel graphics) which caused light to not interact with surfaces properly and made me perpetually fall through the floor and die even though it was lit up  it was a game breaker. Ive also played this game on a rather old laptop (dedicated graphics, Linux) and on my main PC (dedicated graphics, Windows 7) and on both machines the game runs perfectly. From what I can tell the devs seem pretty active and willing to help resolve any issues but since this problem only affected 1 of my 3 devices and I was so close to finishing when I tried it on my new laptop I didnt bother getting it sorted out.

I have absolutely no recollection of purchasing Closure, which has added to the mystery of the game for me. Im just glad I did buy it (if I did buy it) and then happened to stumble across it in my game library. This is truly one of those hidden gem type games and I would definitely recommend it.

8 out of 10, would illuminate.

Closure
A very clever game where the intangible becomes tangible with help from a bit of light.

10/10.

Closure
Extremely original puzzle platform, a little creepy but very charming. They did an amazing job with music too (notice for example the water thing).

Closure
Closure is a 2D puzzle game that use elements of light and darkness to manipulate your environment and solve the puzzles of the various levels. The concept sounds good on paper, however the levels and gameplay become very repetitive and tedious that makes the game just not very fun. If you fail at anytime during a level you have to start all over which can make the game very frustrating and even more not fun. Looking at the overall Steam achievements only 3.5% of the game owners have even beat the game, and less than 10% have even beat the first section of the game which shows you how little amount of players have progressed through the game.

Closure
Closure is an excellent monochrome puzzle game in which you mostly deal with light and darkness.It's fresh and has quite challenging puzzles.You will feel a sense of accoplishment each time you manage to beat a puzzle and its truly enjoyable.You won't be frustrated if you get stuck in a puzzle as after finishing it you will realize that the solution was right there.Brilliant Game 4/5

Closure
Attrative and unique visuals, a delightfully atmospheric soundtrack and a wonderfully clever central game mechanic make the early levels of this game an intellectually stimulating creepy journey of discovery. Sadly as the game goes on the levels become tedious and obtuse with even minor errors forcing you to repeat entire level no matter how much progress you've made in them. If you see this on sale I would absolutely suggest buying it and experincing the core of what it has to offer, but for $10, as little as that is, there simply aren't enough decent levels to justify the asking price.

Closure
What isn't lit, doesn't exist. Everything is based around this concept, but somehow the levels don't feel repetitive at all. It's astonishing how many different puzzles are packed into this game. And I assure you that all of these puzzles, while not easy, can be solved if you learn how to think in terms of the game. No need to bang your head against the wall (and look for walkthroughs).
Add to that beautiful art and nice soundtrack. And we get a very, very good game. Do give it a try.
P.S. Some light sources don't exist until they're lit... and then they keep themselves in existence. Coooool.



Closure
Closure is a pretty clever black & white puzzle game. The game revolves around lightness and darkness--the world around you only exists when light shines upon it. So you can literally walk through walls and fall through platforms by removing the light shining upon them. Some of the levels are very simple but many of the later levels get quite tricky.

The initial learning curve required a lot of trial-and-error to struggle through. However, once I fully understood how to use the light correctly, the game became much easier making many of the later levels seem simple compared to the early ones. I think the game would have been improved by a rewind mechanic because if you fail, you have to start each level from scratch.

Overall, a very enjoyable puzzle game.

Closure
Usually I don't play platformer games.

But this one, turned out to be exceptionally good. It's a dark, surreal adventure that introduces rather interesting and involving light-darkness mechanics.

Only what you see in light exists. What is shadowed by darkness does not, and you will fall into it. This creates as you can well imagine, creative gameplay posibilities.
But in all honesty, the game for me is probably too hard to ever complete, yet it seems to be accesible for the first few levels and the atmosphere is amazing. You explore 3 distinct environments: A Factory, A Murky Forest and A Circus.

It has good music and each of the three characters that morth" into your spidery-like creature have a story of their own

Closure
Closure is a solid puzzle-platformer, hampered only slightly by its limited scope but aided by gorgeously stark visuals and moody score.

You play as a weird little spider thing that puts on masks of people's faces and traverses their memories (I assume, as there's no spoken dialogue). Platforms are only solid when a light source is illuminating them, and you manipulate a variety of these to create or remove terrain so you can reach the exit door in each stage. The mechanic is consistent, buta llittle finnicky -- terrain partially lit by orbs tends to create sloped edges or free-floating pixels of floor, which combined with slippery controls will kill you a few times. The most frustrating moments come from falling through a floor or wall after painstakingly setting up platforms in a 1-2 minute stage, because you weren't quite precise enough. But engine quirks come with the territory in indie platformers, so it's easily overlooked.

What makes Closure really work is the way the level chains are paced. It has over 100 levels, but cerebral puzzle-solving is broken up by stages that serve only to (literally) illuminate the backstory of the characters whose lives you're navigating. You only realize this as you're moving through it, and realize there's no puzzle beyond carrying the light to the exit and seeing the environment unfold ahead of you. It's a neat trick that made me want to keep playing in a way that an unbroken string of puzzles wouldn't have.

The game has some rough edges, but it's a very enjoyable playthrough if you like puzzle-platformers. Definitely recommend.

Closure
Closure has a lot in common with Limbo, and by a lot, I mean more than the eyes can see. It's not just the innovation, the black-and-white visuals, the puzzles or the uber-simplistic UI. It's that unique feeling that you get to play and experience something special, different, that makes a game not only a form of entertainment, but a form of art.

Anyway, I still like Limbo more, as Limbo felt somehow more alive, more artistic, more personal, and more lyrical (the spiders, the story of the little boy searching for his sister, those evil killer kids, etc.), while Closure is rather liniar (all you got to do is use the light and get to door, in every level). Maybe Limbo can be defined by a mere layman as nothing but an artistically-looking puzzle-platformer, but Closure's original concept of using the light to solve the puzzle is the only thing that remained for me to like after playing a couple (12) levels of this game.

Closure might be unique and innovative, but it's too damn difficult for my short life to waste any time with it. I mean, I couldn't still pass level 2:12 not even after seeing on YouTube how it's done. If I just gave up on my pride and searched for the solution on YouTube, and I still haven't passed that level, then ok, I'm an idiot, but I'm also leaving this game once and forever.

Closure
Such a bizarre AND well thought puzzle game! If you enjoy solving puzzles this is the right game for you. With a dark atmosphere (actually the game is all based on light and darkness) you get to control weird characters through a series of chambers". I love the concept

Closure
An excellent puzzle platformer with an extremely unusual central mechanic. Balanced far more towards thoughtful planning than refelxes or pixel-perfect jumping, it will confuse at first, then challenge (but usually stay just the right side of frustration) and eventually have you thinking in its strange language. Imaginitive, orignal, sometimes ingenious puzzles in a brillianlty drawn dark world which rewards the urge to explore & discover - this is a unique, weird delight among the thousands of seemingly similar games on Steam. I hope more people find it.


Closure
I freakin' love this game! It's one of the most interesting and beautiful puzzles I've ever played.

Closure
2-D puzzle game with unique light-shadow experience. Too bad it was so short. But still the game was very fun to play and some puzzles were hard to complete.

Closure
What if there is only what you can see? What if nothing exist in the dark and existence is only in the light? Cannot go through the wall? You can if you don't see it. ;) It's a brilliant concept and if you like puzzle games and unique ideas you will love this game. And wait till you hear the music and see all the art behind. Go for it, buy it, enjoy it.

Closure
THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND I'M NOT BIASED AT ALL

Closure
Love the simple & clever gameplay and the weird art style. Great puzzle game to sink time into.

Closure
This is one of the most unique and atmospheric games I have ever played. If you're on the fence about buying this, I urge you. Do it. You will not regret it.

Closure
It's LIMBO plus an acid trip, except unlike LIMBO the puzzles are actually very good and challenging.

The platforming and physics can be inconsistant at best, with bits of the geometry rematerializing as it's illuminated and pushing other stuff out of the way, but those rare moments aside, it's very well thought out and put together.

On a more personal note, I find the atmosphere/artstyle/whatever to be a bit annoying. The entire game is dressed up in that Tim Burton-y style where it tries to be creepy through being weird, or tries to be weird through being creepy, or whatever, but just manages to be irritating. The lowest point for me is any time you have to be underwater, and the normally passable music slows down by 50% and becomes a nuisance. This is probably a personal hangup that won't affect anyone else too much; I've never been a fan of things like Nightmare Before Christmas, either.

All in all, good puzzle game.

Closure
Really interesting game, great concept that I hadn't seen before. Essentially anywhere that is lit up exists, and anything that isn't lit up, does not. Can be tricky to get your head around the concept, considering at times you know there is a platform there, you just can't see it. If you do however go to make that jump, you will fall to your death.

The graphics are quite well done, sticking to the black and white theme throughout the game does not make it seem bland in any sense; rather the play of the lights is the main graphical focus.

The soundtrack was really good, quite symphonic in some areas which really worked for the mood of the game.

Not too sure what the story was about, not even too sure that there was one. At the same time the format of the game does not suggest that there really needs to be one.

The only two downsides would be the length of the game, taking roughly 7 hours to 100% (some maps will have you stuck for a while, where others you will complete within a minute). The other issue is something that really goes with the genre, and that is the extremely touchy physics. If something is not quite right with the positioning, it can mean restarting the whole level. There also seems to be some inconsistency with the falling of objects, in regards to whether they will bounce badly or simply land flat...

Overall, I would give 8/10.

Closure
Nice puzzle game.
It has quite interesting visuals, fine puzzles, bit strange controls and very interesting game mechanics.

Creepy \.^_^./
9-9.5/10.

Closure
Closure is a puzzle-platformer (emphasis on the puzzle side), based on a brilliant idea: only what is lit exists, the rest is not solid and the player or objects fall through the endless void. This could have gotten old after a few levels, but the game design keeps using new ideas to make use of the system and refreshing the experience. The level design is very good and well thought, making good use of the ideas. The game is cut in smaller levels, so getting lost on an adventure map is not an issue. Although going from one level to another (that is not the one right after) can require to go through a bit too many loading screens.

The art and music are pretty nice too, giving soul to the levels.
There is not much of a story, very minimal story-telling, but it is not really an issue, the gameplay and atmosphere take priority.

Closure
It has a magnificent mechanic centered around light and darkness, however it can't build an enjoyable game around that. It lacks a motivation to press forward like a story or something like that, it's basicaly just a series of challenges which is a bit disapointing. But deserves some praise for the fantastic and inovative mechanic.

3/5

Closure
The game itself is good; the main mechanic creative and well utilized, the puzzles are difficult but fair, the levels are varied and well-designed, and the art is beautiful.
However, I can't recommend it in it's current state. The game has a major graphical glitch. If you have the wrong graphics card parts of the screen will be darker which renders some of the puzzles unsolvable. For example, at the begininng of a level the portion of the floor the character starts off on is missing causing you to fall into the abyss in an endless loop. Or a platform is missing but you don't know that so you wind up spending an unnessecarily long  time trying to solve a puzzle that you didn't realize was glitched. You could go back and tweak the code but that renders the other puzzles unsolvable. Basically you have to back and forth between the code and the game every few levels. It really sucks the fun out of the game because you're never sure if you're failing a level because you did something wrong or because the game is glitched. If you want to play this game I recommend the free flash game instead. It's smaller, shorter, and harder than the Steam verison but at least you'll be able to finish it.
Edit: I recently picked up Closure again and it works perfectly fine now. I haven't found a news about the game developers patching this bug on the Steam page. (If there is let me know and I'll edit this review). So I don't know if a computer update fixed the problem or the developers patched it or what.
Now that I've finshed the game I stand by what I said last year. The only new thing I have to add is the puzzles toward the end of each level are frustrating. Not because they're particularly hard but because some puzzles require an annoying level of prescison. I got stuck on puzzles I knew how to solve but I had to do them over and over again because I didn't put a spotlight in the exact position. Or because an object I needed bounced into the abyss becuase the platform it was suppose to land on was slightly too small.
That aside it's a fun game and it's worth playing. However, I'm keeping this rating until I get confirmation the glitch was formally fixed. At this point I'm not sure if the game actually works now or if I just got lucky.

Closure
I admire original idea, visual style, sometimes catchy music and of course great puzzles. I recommend this piece for everyone, who likes to solve logic puzzles. I appreciate also achievements, which are not insane and don't force players to uselessly reapeat the game.

Closure
A clever, dark and atmospheric puzzle game that will enlighten you with its unique concept, but will eventually leave you in the dark with its rather anti-climatic finale. However, the solid game design and the smart riddles make this title a little gem worth playing.

Closure
Nothing you can't see actually exists; this is the concept behind Closure" and the change in thinking required is very similar to how "thinking with portals" is different than other puzzle experiences.  Simple design

Closure
This is one of those games  that you can play for 20 minutes when you have just a little bit of time. It's dark, moody and somehow relaxing to play a few levels before moving on to other things.

As for the game itself, it's a different spin on a platform puzzler. In itself not so special, but it does make the puzzles quite different from what I'm used to. And that's never a bad thing.

Highly recommened if you're looking for something doesn't require ages to learn or many hours at a time.

Closure
Closure  um game de Puzzle, Dark 2D bem legal.
Gostei da sonora, ambiente e os desenhos.
O que achei mais legal  voc ter que manipular a luz dentro do cenrio para andar, explorar e resolver os puzzles.
Comprei no Winter Sale por 1,99 e valeu super a pena, recomendo =)

Closure
I've installed it for cards and started playing. After a few minutes, I forgot about anything else than how to solve THAT little annoying piece of ... puzzle. And so on and so on - level after level, hour after hour.

Closure is worth its price. It steals whole evening and makes you go to sleep later that you planned.

Closure
Another quality indie platformer with a unique gimmick.

Trust your initial reaction to this review's headline. I expect you'll either be excited for another fairly well made entry into one of your favorite genres or you'll bemoan that the indie scene is oversaturated with these types of games. I find myself starting to lean toward the latter.

Generally Closure's puzzles are cleverly designed with an adequate amount of variation. There are some that were too easy as well as some that, for me, crossed into frustration territory. These aggravating stages were always the longer stages where if you made even one mistake you'd have to start over and redo numerous steps that quickly become tedious. Where the game faltered most for me is that I'd estimate a third of my a little over 7 hours playing the game was spent on these infuriating levels.

Adding to the challenge are 30 collectable moths hidden throughout the game that you'll need to gather all of to get any kind of ending. I got 17 of them during my playthrough then elected to watch the ending on Youtube rather than go back for the remaining 13. I'd suggest skipping the moths unless you are really enjoying the game.

Taking a look at global Steam achievements suggests that the game isn't as widely appealing as its positive reviews would make you believe. Currently, 48.2% of game owners have completed the tutorial stages. Only 8.4% have completed the first 24 levels called the Factory." In other words

Swipecart
This game. Oh boy this game. Just don't even bother. Simple as that. Here is why...
It is broken. The mouse controls are just down right broken. I could only continue playing this because I have an xbox controller to plug in. Even then this game is barely playable. The physics...who programed these physics, they make no sense. Was no effort put into making this? When you roll down a hill, hit another hill GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, you somehow gain speed and keep going up. This can be level breaking in some levels in which you have to stop or you will fall off.
The first chapter has 30 levels and the second chapter has 9. Did they forget how to count? Why the sudden change? I am still trying to finish the game 100% and so I do not know how many levels are in the final third Event" but at this rate it should be around 3. It seems that as the game development progressed the just completely gave up. Speaking of giving up on design

Terrible PC port of a smartphone game. Glad I got it for free.

Swipecart
Good (I guess) for a smartphone, bad for a PC. Everything is HUGE on your screen, as a result of not giving it a minute of work on redesigning it for a PC screen.

I got it for free, but if you didn't, please don't buy it.

Swipecart
Did the first 5 tracks and got 1-0% top scores on all of them so the controls seem to be alright... yeah they are finnicky and imprecise in some ways but they work for me fine at least. Got the game for free so I'm satisfied so far. Give it a go if you can get it cheap or for nothing.

EDIT: This game is insane... in both a good and bad way. It's a love or hate it kind of thing and I got to agree with some of the reviews that this type of gameplay is better suited for a touch enabled mobile device but still, for cheap, it can hit that gaming itch on the pc as well.

I for one am glad it's on steam.

Swipecart
Please note the name of this game is 'swipe' cart and not 'works with a mouse' cart.

Swipecart
Don't mind me
I'll just take my cards and go

Swipecart
First - Ignore the Shouldn't be on steam" hate

Swipecart
So in general this game is a solid concept. However, there are a few issues with this game.

1. There are levels that are very difficult to beat, with a mouse.
2. The game is a swipe game that uses the mouse as a controller input.
3. As a result of 2, we end up with the problems associated with 1, leading to a very difficult game as it is difficult to accurately control the speed of the cart.

Devs, take note this is NOT how you port a game from a touch screen to the PC platform.

Swipecart
Thank God for Steam Trading CardsThis game has thankfully allowed me to make a profit through the steam trading cards. Other than that, there is no other redeemable quality to this game. Everything is total trash from the controls through the graphics. The game just isn't interesting at all so i suggest that you just idle this game until you get the cards and GFTO.

Swipecart
The games pretty original and fun, and exactly what most people look for in a mobile game. But, its not particularly well optimized for PC, nor does the gameplay translate well. For those looking for a good mobile game, Swipecarts a great game. But PC players may want to be a little wary.

Swipecart
You know how when you buy a bad game and overrall you are disappointed, but there is still atleast one redeemable quality about the game? Yeah well, this game doesn't have any.


Pros+Trading Cards Just take them and go.

Cons-Mouse controls are awkward As suggested by the title of the game, you have to swipe in this game... With a mouse. Sounds like an alright idea for a mobile game.... I'm not going to go any further about the controls are terrible.
-Graphics Trust me, pixelated graphics can be done well, but this is just plain disgusting. The character's little pixelated head is rage-inducing and the background looks like someone had sharted and pixelated their excreted substance.
-It's just not fun. It just plainly isn't. After 1.1 hrs of searching for some form of entertainment I could not find anything.

Overrall:A cancerous game that is not worth your time. I got it for free but I still have strong opinions that this game is as bad as a diseased fish. Not diseased in a metaphorical way but diseased as in, this game actually went and swum into an underwater druggie hangout and took one of the needles and injected it into himself, giving him hepatitus C (or hepatitus Sea for that matter). C is also a better rating than what I will give this game because it is most certainly elementary.

2/10

Swipecart
Game crashes on startup and forums/developer won't help. (forums are dead)

Swipecart
SWIPECART
Want to kill your mouse? If so this is the game for you.
The game has a poor control mechanism in which you have to keep on click the damn mouse throught out the game.
The game is actually like an sentimental movie indeed it doesn't make us cry but make us angry.
Ain't going to suggest this game at all very well i didn't loose a single penny just because i grabed the game for free.

What it was worth for?

Trading cards ofc ._.

Bought a new mouse after playing this game.
R.I.P Mouse

Thanks.

Swipecart
This just barely gets a recommendation -- and only if you have a controller to play it with. The game is in my opinion unplayable with mouse controls. If you do not have a controller - skip it.

Swipecart is not an action game - it is a physics puzzle game. You control a minecart which you give speed at the start, then strategically slow down on the actual tracks in order to not fall to your death.
Each level can be played either for maximum speed, or getting all gems, and these two are tracked separately.

Play this windowed as it does not look good in fullscreen on a large monitor. But if you can get past these problems, you're left with a decent game to waste a few idle minutes with, and the presence of online leaderboards keeps you primed to try and do better.

Swipecart
Swipecart a game that came from phones, that should have stayed on phones, because most people don't have a touchscreen (TS for short) option on their monitors.

Graphics - Mediocre, not pleasent on the eyes if you are playing for a long period of time. 2/10

Music - The only good part about this game, especialy if you have a bass system. Still not worth getting the game only for its music. 4/10

Cinematics and Story - None

Content - A few levels and a level editor, yay (still not worth it) 3/10

Controls - Only if you have a TS monitor, and yes I know the game can be beaten without a TS monitor, but be my guest, It is really hard the normal way, bonus note I am a bad player (take whatever you want from that). 0/10

Gameplay - Stiff and downright bad. 2/10

Do yourself good and don't even think about getting this game, it is not worth it, Be right back, going to check it out on the phone.....yea don't buy it even there, just forget this game even existed.

Final Score: 2.2/10

Swipecart
i got this game for free but I still thinks I paid to much for it

Swipecart
Basically what you do in this game is you move the mouse cursor back and forth to gain momentum before you cross the start line. As soon as you cross the start line you can no longer increase your speed, you can only break. The objective is to come to a full stop at the finish line.
This game was made for smartphone and then ported to PC, so graphics quality is bad. Perhaps this game is fun on a smartphone, I wouldn't know. What I do know is that it's no fun at all on PC. It's boring.

Swipecart
I would if I could...totally recommend this game, however it can give me serious rages on some maps. The main reason for this review is to establish that anyone who has a short temper should NOT play this game unless they don't play it on a PC.

It has really awful control of the breaks and wheelies...it makes some maps impossible to get with gold medal and perfect gems even though you played it right (unless you do it like 30-50 times until you get it perfect).
So...as a conclusion, when they'll update the controls (which after all...are one of the bases for a game), I would totally recommend the game for thrill seekers and stubborn people who like challenges.

Swipecart
I have tried my hardest to like this game. Its good in concept, but the controls are astronomically bad. It would not be good on any platform. The controls sometimes stick, and im pretty sure its not my mouse, cause it works at other times.

Swipecart
I can see people enjoying themselves with it, but it's just not doing it for me.
Concept is decent all the rest is just mediocre, just a simple little flash game.
Wouldn't recommend it unless you can get it for free.

Swipecart
More like a nonsense puzzle game.

Swipecart
Bad port with weird controls.

Swipecart
i got this game for free and decided to play , sadly , it wasn't a very  good game , it uses the mouse only as a controlling mechanic , it was ok , but i think this game should be developped for mobile devices not  for pc

2/10

Swipecart
Swipecart is not optimized for PC, and that's a bad thing. It can be entertaining at times, but it's not a game I'd recommend to the average PC gamer.

Swipecart
Smartphone game...

better than Bar Rats/10

Feels good to be the alpha.

Swipecart
Love the music at the begining of the game lol :)

Swipecart
Swipe and hope your cart reaches and stops at the exit.

That's it. That's the whole game.

Also, the controls are really weird and the game is obviously a port, as swiping can be really awkward at times with a mouse.

Swipecart
Wandering around my library I spotted this gem, it was installed.
I brothered checking it and my eyes spilled blood
Now there's blood everywhere, and my family thinks I'm a girl


Anyway, to the review:

Swipecart is a port of a really bad android game. If the game was bad on android can it get worse on steam? Oh hell yeah.

Well first the port is a bit obvious by just looking at the name swipecart"

Swipecart
I would play this game on smartphone/tablet but definitively not on PC.

- I took time to figure out how i can control" my cart and to understand the menu (RIP my mouse).
+ The tracks

Swipecart


Swipecart
This game should be on a Flash games website, not STEAM!

Swipecart
Has a deacent idea but is missing things like good physics.

Swipecart
This is a game where you have to manage your momentum in order to beat the levels.
The biggest problem that I have with the game is the menus they are so clunky and it shows in many aspects that it is a mobile port.
So overall this isnt a good port because it doesnt feel like they have put effort in doing it.

Swipecart
Should Have just been a flash game on a browser.

Swipecart
Precision skill based minecart game that lacks good UI/UX.

Swipecart
A bad port. It made the attempt, but it failed. Just get the mobile version.

Swipecart
I don't care about the graphics but for some reason i really hate the controls

Swipecart
Very bad IFONE game, control are awful, the 1st levels are easy after that, it's start getting very difficult which will lead to frustrating, glad I got it for free and not in my smartphone, if so i will smash it

 final judgement : 30/100 

Swipecart
Just no.

Swipecart
Just no.

Swipecart
This game was obviously a terrible attempt at making a quick buck
-It's a port of a mobile game, never a good sign
-Very simple options:turn audio off and resolution(only in windows mode)
-30FPS cap
-Constat lag spikes
-Broken mouse controls
-Highly unintuitive menu design that took me a while to figure out
-Terrible physics
-Gets repetitive fast
-For some reason all 'k's are capitalized
-The text format often breaks
-Servers are never online
-The music is all blatantly stolen songs that are just made 8-bit"

0/10 would buy bad rats instead"

Swipecart
I got this free, so I am thankful for the free cards. The game has an interesting concept, but is a very bad PC port. Might be fun as a phone game.

Swipecart
Giving this game away for free didn't do the game any favors as it allowed even more people to see what a mess this is. It's just a crappy iphone game that somehow became a badly made port of a crappy iphone game. 1/10 will no play anymore.

Swipecart
The Game is a great timekiller at least for a little bit. Probably not worth $5 but it is not a bad game. Give it a shot if its on sale.

Swipecart
hehehe funny retro game

Swipecart
In general I really enjoyed this game, it is very simple, yet fun and addicting. I encourage people to buy this game since it is only $5 and since it's like no other game on the store. For more details check out my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pmO6Ozr47U. I hope you give this game a chance, especially if it's on a sale!

Swipecart
Really needs a UI fix. Its pretty messy. Maybe an option to rezise it to be smaller. Otherwise a pretty need cheap game.

Swipecart
un poco entretenido, me gusto 6/10

just one word: classic!

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

First of all, this game is inspired by Titan Quest. However, it is NOT Titan Quest, don't be fooled with the title. I will compare it with TQ time to time but basically just to show differences than similarities.

Is it good or bad? Neither. It is just another game. It inherits many features from TQ - the same engine (that's what makes some people to think the game is just a masked TQ), dual mastery system, basic skills ideas, itemization principles, inventory management and others. However, gameplay and overall feeling is not the same. I wonder why some people look at Grim Dawn as at skinned TQ because it feels very different in terms of pace, combat, quests, athmosphere. It is... err... faster. It's the best description I can imagine. Everything happens quite fast in the game. You start to feel your character powerful relatively fast - pretty since the first level. Many things support this feeling - from the actual raw power to hits animation which makes you feel impact on most of your hits. It could get boring soon if you would not unlock new skills with levels so you still will have something new to play with :)

Basically, it's the game about doomed and dying world where mankind was pretty much eradicated by two powerful magical races. You're one of few remnants survived the just happened Apocalypse and trying to establish themselves in the changed world. So there are lot of remaining ruines and lore in the world. I actually like the way Crate has placed world information and story in the game - it does not come in forms of long quest dialogs but as pieces of paper here and where which you can read if you are interested or skip if you are not interested in learning the story and want just to kill things. I tried both and must say the story is very well-written which is rare case for ARPG genre. Just try to read that diary of the dead child... The world is also well-detailed with many small pieces adding the feeling of doom pretty everywhere. Overall graphics is probably not that detailed and eye-catching as it was in TQ but I guess TQ had it somewhat excessive while GD looks just fine for the fast-paced game where you won't pay too much attention to details most of the time anyway. It is still look fine when you stop for a while and zoom in to see details like a doll on the stairs. So the graphics is just fine on my taste. It looks much better with AntiAliasing and AnyzotropicFiltering turned on though ;) Overall story and graphics is much more mature than TQ with some of dark humor and some serious emotions it causes but much less pathetics. Bad guys actions are basically better reasoned and logical based (if you bother to read the story pieces).

Quests. They are various enough to not get bored. You will meet those kill X monsters" and "collect Y pieces" things along with exterminating big bad guys

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Grim Dawn is one of the most richly detailed and beutifully sculpted unfinished game I've ever played! It's definitely one to keep your eye on.

I'm a massive Action RPG player/addict with 1000s of hours in Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, Van Helsing & countless others. Hell, I've even made a career out of making YouTube videos for them. Grim Dawn was little more than a curiosity to me when I first checked it out in the Alpha. But since then I have repeatedly come back to it whenever a new build is released and each time I play it I fall a little more in love with it!

Development progress has been slow, I wouldn't expect a launch this year, but the quality of updates has been phenomenal. The devs at Crate have their finger of the pulse of the community and have a very clear vision for the game they want to make - it's the game they want to play. I recently spoke to Mediera one of the developers and he said that he barely even played Titan Quest when he was developing it - but while developing Grim Dawn he can barely tear himself away from it, with 100s of hours spent 'playtesting'.

This game is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, with some of the developers that originally worked on the game now making up the indie dev team at Crate Entertainment. The game is built on a heavily modified version of the same engine Titan Quest was built on. You'll notice the similarities between the games if you're a fan. But this game is not Titan Quest reskinned - it's a much better game in my opinion. It's taken some of the best features and mechanics from that game, put them into an immersive post-apocalyptic world and expanded themin interesting ways.

Grim Dawn is the type of game early access should embrace - supporting great and communicativbe developers make games the fans want to play. Keep this one on your radar!

If you want to see more of the game and my thoughts on it you can find me on YouTube & Twitch as 'ZiggyD'.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

In-Depth Review
Prepare for a long read!


First off the Story:
Grim Dawn is full of interesting dialogue and well written textbooks that truly immerse you into the game. Furthermore there is a multitude of sidequest that often allow you to make meaningful decisions and sometimes even determine the fate of a whole village.

Unfortunately these stories are hard to follow for someone who doesn't read through all the text. As much as I know the devs plan to voice the main story towards release.


Atmosphere:
The graphics present you with a harsh and sinister environment which is further emphasized by the great music and sounds. The handcrafted maps are quite large and feature hidden passages from time to time. It also feels great when you encounter hostile factions attacking each other and follow the transformation of Devil's Crossing from a small survivors-enclave to a small town as you progress through the story.

Only downpoint for me was the repetitiveness of some maps, especially the 3 swamps in act 1 and arkovia/broken hills in act 2. I was told that the devs are planning to rework some of these areas though in terms of visuals.


Gameplay:
Gritty, fun combat, just as you would expect from an ARPG. The constitution system makes sure that you don't just wait to regenerate and the scarcity of potions underlines the fact that you are survivor of a perished world. Unlike Diablo 3 leveling feels rewarding and presents you with relevant decisions that influence your progression later in the game. The dual-mastery system of Titan Quest opens up a ton of possibilities and will further improve the more classes are available. The locational damage will probably not suprise TQ-veterans, but for ARPGs in general it's a really noteworthy feature that adds further depth to the game. (On a site note: There is an existing faction system that will be dramatically improved in the upcoming build)

Since build 20 there is a well-working multiplayer, unfortunately the damage monster deal is also scaled if you play together. Resistances don't show much effect if they are not pushed quite high and casts and even aoe skills can miss enemies. Coming from WoW I was never very fond of a accuracy" stat as it pretty much forces players to cap it.


Itemization:
The game features a multitude of stats to choose from: many types of retaliation

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

You know that itch that Diablo 3 couldn't scratch?

That.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Pros:  Rough around the edges, but still an excellent value.    If you loved Diablo, Torchlight, & Titan Quest then this is the game for you.    Combat is solid, the story is well presented, monster design is top notch.   Spiffy animations.   Art direction takes a few cues from Fallout 3 & Borderlands.    A few shout outs to H.P. Lovecraft.    No crashes for me & almost no bugs.    Very stable game!

Cons:  has pretentions to being a 'Ye Olde Skool' hard core ARPG game.    Thus the game lacks modern rpg conviences like quest markers.     Expect to wander lost for stretches at a time.    Game balance is nightmare.   Playing a caster is easy mode.    Loot drops are a bit sketchy, but it is getting better.    Crate employees are swell & willing to listen to feedback.   Crate fans on the other hand...     Well, let's just say they are a bit defensive.    Saying that there are flaws with Grim Dawn is tantamount to calling their baby ugly.    The Crate Forums are going to be very interesting when the final product ships...

In conclusion: post apocalyptic, low fantasy that doesn't pull any punches.    Some of the game design choices are real headscratchers, but they're being ironed out.     Crate entertainment is a pretty decent indie outfit  & deserve support.   It's a work in progress that takes you on fun, brutal journey.    8 out of 10, Above average.   B+   Four Stars out of Five.

Grim Dawn
Disclosure: Review Written at Level 25

Do you miss Diablo 2? Do you miss skill synergy that matters? Do you miss abilities not being worthless, and having options?

Grim Dawn opens up an interesting school of thought: You begin as nobody, and at level 1 you're given your official class: Are you the melee tank guy? Explosive experiment guy? Arcane knowledge guy? The angry zoo manager? Pick your class and begin to carve your way. But don't lose sight of What Might Have Been.

At level 10, you are able to pick up a second class. No penalities. You become a Something / Something. Want to play a Tank / Mage? Done. Want to play a Caster / Pet class? Done. Pick your flavors, combine then, and destroy everything. Right now, I'm a Soldier/Demolitionist that is made out of tank and explosion, and when things come near me they go on fire, and if they hit me they go on fire EVEN HARDER.

You will get your fill.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Let's get my opinion across to you as a reader as soon and as clear as possible.

I genuinely love this game.

For an early access game, it feels very polished and content rich. But then, it has been in early access for some time now.

If you like Diablo, you will definitely like this game. Because it offers the same hack&slash loot fest gameplay as that game, but without the frustrating bull****, such as the permanent character damage of Diablo 1 and the excessively restrictive builds (And rare respec) of Diablo 2.

The game offers at present 5 different classes, of which you can combine any 2 of them to create hybrid classes. There is the Soldier (Typical warrior), the Nightblade (Rogue with a melee focus), the Demolitionist (Archer type, but with versatile crowd control options and traps), the Occultist (Debilitation and pets) and the Arcanist (Spellcaster). There are skills in each class that well complement those of another, but a pure class build is just as viable.

There are no skills that are purely support, since the developers have made a conscious decision to make singleplayer just as playable as multiplayer. Instead, most classes offer some form of skill that applies a bonus or ability to you, as well as an equal one to other players and pets, allowing increased power and versatility in multiplayer without compromising the viability of the skill in singleplayer.

It's a lot less restrictive than most similar games in how each class can be built and still be viable, but it is worth putting some advance thought into your build. Skill points can be refunded if spent on skills, but not if spent on class mastery (Which increase your stats linearly and unlock further skills).

Content wise, the game currently contains 2 full chapters of reasonable length and 2 out of 3 parts of the 3rd chapter. A total of 4 chapters are known to be planned for the full release. There is a lot of various equipment to find with interesting items offering unique skills to complement the arsenal of your chosen class. There is also a lot of varied enemies to use your weapons and abilities on, with especially dangerous (mostly) randomly spawned unique Heroes to contest with, each with their own special skills and abilities.

Four difficulties are planned, each which will be unlocked for a character as the previous is completed. At present there is only two difficulties available, Normal and the optional Veteran. These two difficulties can be alternated between at any time from the main menu and share the same campaign progression. Completing the game on either will unlock the next one, once it's added.

I strongly recommend playing on Veteran difficulty in singleplayer, as Normal mode is a tad too easy. In multiplayer, the game scales the difficulty based on the amount of players, making Normal mode offer a decent challenge and making Veteran very challenging.

Enemies do scale to your level, but as I understand the scaling will be lesser in the full release and is only set as high as it is now to offer a continuous challenge for higher level players.  Right now, the maximum level is 40, which is still plenty enough to allow the construction of very interesting character builds that do end up feeling extremely powerful in spite of the scaling enemies.

Story wise, the game features an original world by the name of Cairn, with has an Victorian-esque aesthetic and technological level. It offers you the usual swords and shields but also black powder guns, bombs and magic. In this world mankind is at the brink of extinction with the event dubbed the Grim Dawn" as it's cause

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

By far my favorite ARPG I've played since Diablo 2. I've had a craving for years for something fresh that borrowed as much as possible from Diablo 2 and implemented it well and Grim Dawn hits an absolute home run in that department. I enjoyed Diablo 3 and sunk a ton of hours into it, but man does Grim Dawn feel like what Diablo 3 should have been. It's that good. It's like everything Titan Quest and Diablo 2 did well had a baby and this is our result.

I've been a supporter since 2012 and playing on and off since well before the game ever hit Steam Early Access and man... it's incredible how far this game has come.

If you're a Diablo fan of any sort and wasted away who knows how many hours of your youth on Diablo 1 and 2, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. Even at the full price of $25 it's an absolute steal.

10/10

Grim Dawn
There's a reason that Grim Dawn has 94+% positive reviews on Steam: it's a great action RPG.

I'll start by talking about Grim Dawn's character building system. The class system involves mixing two classes together (you unlock a second class at level 10), which is pretty unique to the genre. Titan Quest had this system and now the same developers have incorporated it into Grim Dawn. This adds an additional layer of depth to the character building process.

Let's say you're looking to build a poison focused Nightblade. You can pair your Nightblade up with the Occultist class for even more poison capability (Nightblade combined with an Occultist makes a Witch Hunter"). If you want your Soldier to have some of the abilities/theme of a magic user

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

this is probably the best ARPG i've ever played.
- coherent and in-depth lore
- very unique dual class system that allows for tons of customization and all the replayability you could ever want
- beautiful and well-optimized (still looks great on lowest settings and can run decently even on a toaster). the art direction is better than Torchlight/Diablo 3, kind of reminds me of the first Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2. plus, a rotatable camera allows for every detail of the environment to be admired
- quests are interesting and fit perfectly with the game world (no collect 20 monster hides" for no reason)
- loot is abundant

Grim Dawn
I never imagined to throw faeces at enemies as a method of obliteration

Full game review
It is almost a miracle. After about 6 years of development, Crate Entertainment's Grim Dawn has finally been released. A game that had been in early access on Steam for so long due to the developers experiencing some personal difficulties. Not only that, they also greatly expanded on the game's original content due to fantastic support by fans along the way. The result is a superb aRPG that is currently among the very best. Having owned and closely followed the game for about 2 years, looking at the (finally) complete game is a pure joy. Hold on tight aRPG lovers, because you're in for a most wonderful ride with this one.

<<<Story>>>

Enter Cairn, a dark and mysterious world that was once a great empire, but now on the brink of extinction. At fault are the overly curious arcanists who brought Aetherials into their world. These spiritual beings seek to use humans as hosts and consequently turn them into powerful, yet abhorrent creatures. If that wasn't already enough, survivors also have to battle the Chthonians: they have the malicious intent of offering as much blood as they can to their almighty god. You, the player, awaken at the worst time possible: a grim dawn. For a little while, you yourself were possessed by an aetherial and thus have no memory of your former life. This possession almost cost you your life. However, those aetherial remains dwelling inside your body seem to grant you odd, yet useful powers ...

<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>

Grim Dawn is an aRPG like there are quite a few others in the genre: Torchlight, Diablo, Van Helsing, Path of Exile, Victor Vran, Titan Quest ... While each game differs and has its uniqueness, they all have the same core gameplay: run around, kill monsters, find loot. And all of that in an isometric perspective. Even though a bit repetitive in gameplay (which is no problem if you're a fan of the genre), they have great replay value, mostly due to their theorycrafting: how to create and finetune the 'perfect' build(s). In trying to do so comes a lot of experimentation and farming, which can take quite long.

Unlike certain other aRPG's, Grim Dawn does not force you into a specific class. Mages don't necessarily have to wield wands and warriors don't have to wear heavy armour and shields. Every character has access to all gear. However, you are required to invest in specific attributes in order to wear different equipment. Another feature that is quite welcome, which was present in Titan Quest also, is how the game lets you combine any of the 6 available masteries to create your personalized class (= 2 masteries combined). A first mastery can be chosen at level 2 and the second at level 10. There are so many skills that one can choose to build around, that even within the same mastery, there is a lot of room for variety. This allows for an insane amount of experimentation and theorycrafting, which is sometimes even more fun that actually playing the game!

One day, Crate decided that character customization wasn't deep enough already, so they released the devotion system. What is this system exactly? It is basically another (yet smaller) layer of customization where players have a total of 50 points to invest in certain passives (e.g. +10% piercing dmg, +20% elemental resistances etc) or actives that enhance your main skills. Those actives can be bound to certain skills and will proc under various circumstances (e.g. 100% to occur when critically hitting). Devotion points can be acquired by restoring old shrines that are spread throughout the whole world and between the 3 difficulties (normal -> elite -> ultimate).

Seeing the amount of customization, being able to (partially) respec is a relief. Reallocating is done by visiting the spirit guide in one of the major cities and can be done at any given time, granted you have the currency for it. It starts out pretty cheap, but can get extremely expensive for those who experiment endlessly. Both skill and devotion points can be reallocated; mastery and attribute points can not. This allows for decent experimentation, but also reminds you to choose carefully when needed.

Cairn is a place full of mystery and secrets and is not afraid to reward players who feel like exploring everything. Exploration is rewarded by various things: one-time chests containing extra rare loot, hidden devotion shrines and notes. More loot is always good to have (this is an aRPG after all), devotion shrines keep your character's customization up to date and lore notes inform you of the story - which was better than expected - of Cairn.

Besides the deep character customization and satisfying exploration, Grim Dawn offers other features that may interest you. The first thing that comes to mind is the 'fast travel' system. Your character can use rift portals anywhere, anytime (except in certain challenging rogue-like dungeons), which sets the game at a good pace. Don't worry about picking everything up, as you can sell it right away by teleporting back and forth. Another feature that is a nice 'extra' is the faction system: by killing certain enemies and completing certain quests, you gain reputation. This reputation allows you to buy certain goods and complete certain objectives. A last feature that is definitely more than welcome is the ability to play with up to 3 other people. There are no dedicated servers though, since the game is more single player focused. But the fact that it is there, is what counts.

<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>

Like many other aRPG's, actions are mostly executed via the mouse: killing enemies, opening doors, speaking to npc's ... everything's done with the mouse, with the exception of using your skills. They are activated by pressing the corresponding keys. All keys are rebindable if desired.

Graphically, the game seemed a little outdated in certain places, however, it is not too bothersome. Aesthetically on the other hand, the game is very well made and really brings that atmosphere of eeriness and desperation to life. Most animations are ok.

The soundtrack was enjoyable to listen to for the first x amount of hours and certainly added to the atmosphere. However, certain tracks get replayed over and over again in way too many areas. A little bit more variation certainly wouldn't harm the game. Tracks that are most excellent are the boss tracks. They sound exciting and make the fights more epic.

<<<The verdict>>>

Grim Dawn is one of the finest aRPG's I have played in the last couple of years - if not my favourite of all time. Victor Vran seems a little too simplistic, whereas Path of Exile can be overly complex. This game brings the best of two worlds together: being indepth enough without being overly complex. Therefore it is recommended to all aRPG lovers for 100%, but even regular rpg/hack & slash fans might enjoy this one, if just for 1 playthrough.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Since i have played Grim Dawn, Titan Quest and Diablo 3 a LOT, here's what i think about this game:

Pros:
- Skill system is similar to Titan Quest and very complex, allowing you to customize your character alot. There are obvious builds just like in D3 (Pet-master, Fire-builds etc.) but you are not limited to them.
- No allways-online, you can in fact play this game completely in offline mode, characters are saved on your harddrive. (similar to Titan Quest)
- Many items with the same system as in TQ where rare pre- and -suffixes can occur on normal items. Also Epic and Legendary stuff (including sets and abilities granted by items)
- Farming: A combination of TQ and D3, boss runs are still effective (TQ) but there are also Hero spawns in normal locations that can be lucrative (D3)
- Simple Multiplayer system, you can either host a game (and others might join you, you can set a password or kick others) or you can join a game yourself (direct join to your steam-friends or browse existing hosted games)
- almost no bugs, the few that are there allways get fixed ASAP


Things i personally dont mind but might be important to you:
- performance issues when ALOT of stuff is going on (R9 290, 16GB RAM, i7 and dropping to 20fps on high settings, can be improved by lowering the settings though)
- Multiplayer MIGHT not allways work, make sure you have administrator rights when searching for games or it can crash (just like in TQ)
- even though they are not popular, you might find cheaters online (since save-files are on your harddrive you can just manipulate them). In that case just host a game yourself and kick them :P
- no voice acting and average grafics might scare you. but keep in mind that crate entertainment is a really small studio (Crate Entertainment has grown from one man with a dream to a team of ten with veteran developers....") so what they achieved is actually really impressive.


Conclusion: A really good ARPG. not a tripple-A title like D3 with millions of budget

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

There are three things that matter in an ARPG. They are:

Build diversity
Itemization
Fun combat

Build diversity:

The game features dual classing. I can play the exact same two classes as my buds and all of us would have a character that behaves and functions completely differently. Want to be a melee summoner? Dual wielding spell caster? Tanky totem user? Alright, we gotchu. Stuff just sort of works. Maybe not for the highest difficulty, but that's part of the fun of this game. Because playing it is actually fun.

Itemization:

I've gotten items for character ideas in this game I've never even thought of. I've gotten items specifically built for the character I'm playing as. A plus? They actually look pretty cool, too.

Let me put it to you like this. I have a tanky totem guy who uses spells to tank and does vitality damage. There are items specifically for this. Do you understand how cool that is?

Fun combat:

Alright, so, let's be real here. You are going to make characters that just don't work. You'll get to a point and maybe you didn't spend enough points in to your mastery and just don't have enough health. Maybe you don't do enough damage. Maybe you just kind of walked around and made it to the final difficulty and now you're stuck. Well, you had fun doing it.

And you had fun doing it because the combat is a blast. Oh, you want to shoot a laser beam at enemies? We gotchu. Want to use a shield to destroy your enemies? Hey now, I got something for you. Want to use that same skill but make it spammable and useable with two handers? Yeah dude, no problem. Want to put a bunch of mortars on the ground and run around like you would in the real world? Ayyyy, yep.

This game has it all. And it's all fun.

If you don't buy this game, I feel bad for you.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Grim dawn is a deep loot driven rpg, with a unique setting, and good atmospheric graphics running on a heavily updated and improved version of the titan quest engine. If you thought that developers won't invest in this style of game again, think again. Love has gone into this.

You start with a classes character, if you are a titan quest fan - you know the drill. If you do not, you start out without a class, think elder scrolls. Then you pick up an item, do some damage, and eventually you get some gear. By this point you will have leveled up and you can choose your class. Usually the player chooses something depending on what they have picked up, however you can choose something completely different and scour for items to match what you are going for.

Once you level up some more, you can choose a second class. Allowing for two to coexist concurrently - also like it's father titans quest. There are large number of class combinations. I don't find that every combination is satisfying, however most are at least interesting and fun to experiment with. One issue I have with the second class choice is that they are usually targeted at a specific item combination. For example, the soldier tree has many two handed skills, whereas the rogue tree has many duel wielding. That means you won't be able to pick the major skills in either tree. Since it's wasteful to be good at a two handed weapon and duel wielding skills. Unless you hotkey weapon switching. It's far better to just invest fully in whatever items you choose. Which means you are scouring the second tree for non-weapon based skills. It's not ideal.  However almost any combination you choose will be viable. And thats good enough. At least it represents freedom. If you want you can just stick to the one class.

The loot system is solid, although it lacks the pop you got a legendary" sensation that diablo managed. The melee combat

Grim Dawn
Update: The game is now released, and it still doesn't suck. 10/10

Early access review below:
I very rarely do Early Access reviews, solely because of how quickly a good game can go wrong, and vice versa.

So when I say Grim Dawn has not only met, but surpassed my expectations, I want you to get my full meaning.

Long before Act 4 was finished, Grim Dawn was always a very solid and playable Early Access title. Crashes were rare, nothing felt glitchy or unfinished. You'd just hit the level cap, or hit the wall of the next unopened area.

Which meant, even when there was only 1 complete Act and a couple of class choices, there was a lot of fun to be had. It stood as a testament to how the rest of the game would play, and Crate has delivered. It's been a long time coming, and I mean a solid 5 year development, but it was always consistent enough to never have felt abandoned or misled. A trait I'm finding more and more important with Early Access titles.

I'm not going to compare it to other ARPGs, as I'd much rather compare it to other early access titles in general. We had notes for every patch and hotfix. Always updates on what will be in the next patch along with future updates. I am glad to have supported this game in its early days, and am excited to finally see it's release, because I can absolutely say it does not feel rushed or unfinished. Crate put the time and effort necessary for a quality release, instead of giving us a half baked game and selling us the rest later.

Grim Dawn sets the bar for what we should expect from Early Access development and release. Bravo, Crate Entertainment.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

So, in the entire time that Path of Exile's extreme skill customization was a nice change to the Diablo 3 habits of hand holding style. With Diablo 3 and Path of Exile now being moreso known as the top two of these kind of games, there's in between Grim Dawn.

Grim Dawn for one, has the same customizations like the old Titan Quest, you don't have any skills to start with and you have no class, you make your class by progress. What makes that so special, is that there isn't a single class to choose from, one character can specialize into two paths(You don't have to).
Surely not all will be fully suitable for another, but it takes a little curve in knowing what to choose and why. Rather then a path being chosen for you, you can make yours from scratch.

Along with this in terms of skill customization, the game features a nice amount of loot, along with the entire factions offering you their items for trade as well, given you are on their good side. As for the looks of the game, its like the name suggests. Its grim, dark and grimy. Nothing in this world is given to you on a silver platter, and don't think you'll be quick to make friends.
Along with the nice bit of gunpowder skills and weaponary given to you, it gives another feel to the usual magic and swordplay world that is like PoE and Diablo 3, the combat is nice and beefy, strikes feel like they hit hard and enemies are plenty, either to be vaporized by magic or chopped to bits by a gaint sword.

Having played this game a fair bit, I can say it bring back the old feel of Titan Quest, in a new and fresh setting, unlike the PoE and Diablo 3 universe.
I can surely say, to those that enjoyed Titan Quest back in the day or want something different from the two big boys that are Path of Exile or Diablo 3 to check out Grim dawn, its not done yet, and its not perfect. But its a really nice change of pace and well done so far I can say.

Grim Dawn
Writing with only 16h of gameplay:

If you loved playing Diablo 2 as a kid (like myself), Grim Dawn is THE ARPG to buy!

Just forget about Torchlight (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it was made by the same team from Diablo 2).
And forget about Diablo 3+ (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it's the successor for Diablo 2).

And go ahead and buy Grim Dawn.

Here's why:
I played both Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and PoE and Titan Quest), and they won't even come close to make me feel like I'm back in my teens playing Diablo 2 with my friends.

Grim Dawn does it!

All the ambience, the sound tracks, the atmosphere, the theme. All the darkness, the condemned world, the shading, the monsters, the bosses. All the item hunting, the items themselves, the skill trees, the character evolution. They all feel very much like Diablo, WAY MORE than Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and Path of Exile and Titan Quest and ... ).

Sometimes when I'm playing I get this strong feeling that I'm finally playing a true new DiabloSometimes I get the same feeling I get when exploring a dark, hellish dungeon from Diablo 2.

I strongly recommend this game if you like Diablo 2, and I want to say Thank you so much dev team for making this game! This is like a dream coming true for me. This is the Diablo sequence I was waiting and hoping for.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

This game should not be overlooked by anyone who is interested in either Diablo 2,3,Titan Quest, or POE. While all of the games have fundamental differences in gameplay. Grim Dawn brings something fresh to the table that I have found lacking in POE and D3.

The Pros:

- Attention to detail (for example piles of burning bodies in fields and outside of burrwitch lead one to believe there was a major fight against the rampaging Aetherials, which leads me to my next pro".)

-The story telling ( while it does lack in lore like some of the AAA games (Diablo) it does  a masterful job at telling a story  without spelling it out for you. Different scenes you come across throughout the world really get you interested in what had happened as you put it together.

-Itemization ( the loot is both unique and visually appealing)

-The Combat (the melee and spells feel really good)

-The MUSIC ( is just amazing

Grim Dawn
It cured my dota 2 addiction.

Early Access Review

Hello. I rarely review.  40 year old gamer here.  Been gaming my whole life...TT and PC.  This is without a doubt the greatest RPG/ARPG I have ever experienced.  186.6 hours of play time later, I am still amazed at this masterpiece.  It may be the best PC game ever made...but I will stick with best RPG.  Seriously, the designers of this game have truly just created a work of art.  That is all.  Buy this game, play it to death and then play it more.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

If you are an action RPG  Lover, then the hours I have put into grimdawn should tell you enough :)

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Grim Dawn  is one of the best  Early Access  games on Steam right now, and one of the few Early Access games that I totally don't regret purchasing. I'll be using a few comparisons to other popular games in the ARPG genre, and giving some reasons on how Grim Dawn differentiates itself.

Grim Dawn is developed by  Crate Entertainment. They are only a small indie team of 7 or so, but they have some noticible talent from from titles like Titan Quest and Diablo 2. It's actually amazing what they have managed to accomplish with such a small team as the game was originally going to be a lot smaller in scope, but Crate had a fairly successful Kickstarter Campaign, which let them increase the scope of the game substantially.

So what does Grim Dawn manage to do right? What are some key features that are different from most ARPG's?

Huge Open Map
Grim Dawn features one giant interconnected map. Every Act has it's own feel and tileset, and areas connect and loop back to each other in such a clever way that at times, it reminds me of the level design of Dark Souls. There are plenty of Dungeons and Caves throughout these maps to explore, usually rewarding you with a cool side-boss. The big map design is a really cool feature considering games like Path of Exile have really small maps in comparison.
Exploration
Most other ARPG's mostly focus on the combat, which obviously--should be a big focus for any ARPG. But Grim Dawn kind of encourages you to explore and pay attention to the environment a bit more then the others. There are breakable walls in Dungeons (which are quite well hidden), but if you manage to find them, you tend to be rewarded with secret areas and enemies, meaning every Dungeon is worth fully exploring.
Combat
Since Grim Dawn is running on the Titan Quest engine (though, it's been modified and upgraded), there are some very satisfying physics and ragdoll effects.
Monsters tend to explode into gibs!
Combat is slower paced compared to games like D3, but it is responsive and punchy.
Animation quality ranges from good to excellent. There are some really nice looking abilities, but I have noticed a few animations could use a bit of work. The monsters are fantastically animated though!
Combat and movement in general is smooth.
Monsters Drop Weapons They Are Using!
This feature was in Titan Quest I believe, but I'm glad Crate decided to include it in Grim Dawn, as it's an awesome feature that most ARPG's should have.
What this means in more detail, is if you see a creature holding a weapon that looks unusual, and you notice after it hits you, you were drained of some energy for example, there is a good chance that monster is going to drop the same weapon it used to drain your energy.
This adds such a cool dimension to the game, as monsters can already have random affixes on them.
Loot
Every ARPG needs good loot. Good thing Grim Dawn delivers on that too! I'd say the loot system is a bit more old-school in it's design and approach, as there are a lot of % based modifiers, which is pretty standard, but a lot of items also have abilities attached to them. Other then that, you have your usual loot rarity system that are similar to most other ARPG's (Common, Magic, Rare, Epic) and Legendaries--which are not in the game yet.
Looting in general is just satisfying as hell. I love how loot explodes out of chests, and you even get loot piata's from killing bosses/mini-bosses.
Crafting & Components
The crafting system is actually quite in-depth and deep. It's perhaps not as deep as Path of Exile's crafting system, but it's not as simple as Diablo 3's either--it falls somewhere in between. One great thing is it's not as RNG focused as other crafting systems I've come across in other ARPG's.
Components are basically upgrades for your gear. They are found and crafted, and they can be attached onto most armour pieces. Components can also have abilities attached to them. Overall, It's quite an interesting take on an upgrade system, as components let you easily fix some flaws in your builds.
Sound Design
Absolutely amazing soundtrack! It's probably one of the best soundtrack's for an ARPG since Diablo 2, and I don't say that lightly.
There are some very well done ambient sounds, such as hearing flies buzzing around corpses, crackling around fires, etc--which adds a nice layer of detail to the sound design.
The Combat sounds are quite well done. The guns are punchy, spells sizzle, and weapons thud like you would expect.
Day & Night Cycle
This really adds to the games presentation and atmosphere, while also adding a layer of believability.

Now, some cons:

Lack of Cinematics & Voice Acting
There is some voice acting, and what's there is actually pretty well done, but there is no voice acting for quests and dialogue. The writing is overall pretty high quality, but I think some more voice acting would help sell the story more. This is only a minor con imo, as I think Crate are planning to add in more voice acting towards the end of their development schedule.
Slow Start
I gotta admit the game didn't immediately click with me at the start. This seems to be a problem with most ARPG's, as you have a general lack of abilities and gear in the first few hours. But, it gets a whole lot better if you decide to stick with it for a couple of hours and get a few abilities.
Lack of Visual Customisation
Games like Diablo 3 let you dye your armour, as well as transmogrify a peice of armour to look like another piece. Path of Exile has microtranscations for those things too. This is a great thing for games that are so focused on character development, and it's one feature that is sadly lacking in Grim Dawn. It does suck when your character is wearing armour that is not matching, with random colours and such. I'm hoping Crate adds a similar feature in the near future.
Lack of Randomised Dungeons & Maps
There is a rogue-like Dungeon which is meant to address this, and admittedly it is meant to be a pretty kick- dungeon (I haven't checked it out yet, but I have seen videos). Compared to Diablo 3's Rift System and Path of Exile's Maps, it's missing a lot of Enemy and Tileset variety.
Development is a little slow...
The game has been in full development since around 2012 (counting from the Kickstarter date). The general consensus seems to be that new builds take a little bit longer to release then most would like.
Most of these cons were only minor cons for me, but can be major cons depending on how you feel about them.

Overall, Grim Dawn does A LOT of things right. It has some features that should be standard for ARPG's, and those features make Grim Dawn feel like a very believable, detailed and rich gameworld. There is a lot of depth and replayability here, and if you even have a remote interest in ARPG's--Grim Dawn should be a no brainer.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

I was and I still am a huge fan of Titan Quest. Grim dawn has exceeded my expectations by miles so far. I like the graphics, I like gameplay and I like the way you can improve gear by using collectable items. Gameplay is great, resources are not too scarce but its still a challenge. I just love it!

Yeah, progress is slow, the game is still in early access state. That's because developers resources are low and mostly because they are doing it right instead of releasing a half baked thing. Where I live we use to say do it right

Grim Dawn
Grim Dawn let me make a sorceress with a shotgun. More than that it encouraged me to, because that shotgun happened to be the perfect fit for the build I was working towards. I could have given her an enchanted pistol, or a giant warhammer, or really any of the countless weapons to be found throughout the world, and made it work. But as I was dashing through the ruins of a seaside town, ducking in and out of crooked doorways to blow zombies and floating eyes to hell with burning buckshot, I knew I had found my calling. At least until I find a bigger gun.

Freedom of choice is the chief takeaway from Grim Dawn, one of the most recent entries in the crowded ARPG/Diablo lootsplosion genre. Unlike its peers, Grim Dawn decouples weapons, armors, and even skills from specific classes, letting you be anything from an armored shaman with a lightning scythe to an arcane fire-slinging gunman to a demon-worshipping hammer-wielding assassin. The only thing limiting your gear choices are your level and your three base character stats, which all rise as your character grows and you invest in your classes. And yes I said classES because Grim Dawn lets you choose two of its six archetypes to mix into your character.

The classes themselves can be a bit of a hangup for new players because of the unique level of control you have over your skill progression. Rather than unlocking skills at certain levels, each class tree has a Mastery bar for you to spend skill points on. This bar grants you important base stat boosts and unlocks your actual skills with enough points invested. Of course, then you have to balance spending points on Mastery or the skills, and across two class trees to boot. It can be a bit daunting until you realize your greatest gains come from your Mastery, so you'll generally want to one-point your skills until you unlock them all.

Many of your skills are passive, meaning combat tends to be less technical than Diablo or other competitors. Indeed, more than a few battles are won or lost in the preparation of auras, toggle abilities, and weapon selections. You'll also find skills baked into the gear and upgrade components you find, some powerful enough to design an entire build around. In another liberating design decision, class skills are much more focused and specific while item skills are your more general fireballs and lightning novas, allowing you to make a pure caster out of literally any class combination.

Unprecedented freedom means nothing if there's nothing to do with it, but Grim Dawn does not disappoint here, either. The world of Cairn is in the throes of a magical apocalypse, with ruined towns and valleys and forests full of unspeakable horrors to bludgeon. Enemies and allies alike are divided into factions, with new quests and gearing options availiable from those that like you, and new bosses and challenges from those who don't. The main quest will keep you busy for a good 30 hours just putting down one of the major threats to the world, but building reputation and uncovering new secrets can last you dozens more hours.

And my God, the secrets! I'm a big fan of exploration in games and few reward you so richly as this. Unmarked dungeons and unique bosses can pop up just about anywhere, providing unexpected challenges at any level. Virtually every map has breakable walls and hidden chests, and much of the best loot to be had is found in hard-to-reach containers. I once found a secret dungeon beneath a side dungeon inside a completely optional dungeon! On top of all this, there's another character progression system called Devotion that uses points earned from hidden shrines all over the world, a genius system that more ARPGs would do well to ape.

Grim Dawn doesn't hold back in challenge, either, with some brutally hard side dungeons and optional bosses right from the first few hours. The main quest is easy enough to get through for even the inexperienced, so you have your choice of difficulty through exploration as well. All of this is presented with a gritty, moody look and some meaty sound work, though the soundtrack is pretty lacking and gets repetitive in a hurry. The Lovecraftian themes are well-realized and there's a ton of detail to the world, from engaging lore to morally gray decisions to make. Even if there wasn't so much to work with in the gear and skills systems this would be a solid competitor to Diablo and its ilk, but the wealth of options and progression systems easily makes Grim Dawn one of the top titles in the genre.

PS. FU Blizzard"

Grim Dawn
One of the best early access games I purchased. I love the world, graphics, combat, and skill trees. If you enjoy these types of games, you know how satisfying it is to think of a build and go for it, only to see it work better than expected. Good stuff.  In my opinion this is better than Van helsing series and Diablo 3,.. As of others have said, this is closer to Diablo 2 and what Diablo3 should have been. Also, you can play offline and online if you choose.

Grim Dawn
I am a great fan of the diablo series, but this game feels like how diablo 3 should feel.

You start off in some small city and from the first moment in, I felt it to be ''just right''. Even when they used the same engine as Titan Quest, the graphics in this game looks amazing and stunning.

Its like the developers didnt want ANY place in this game to look like it has been created on a hurry. Every single bit of environment you encounter looks just right. The trees, the little abandoned cottages, the looks of mobs. As far as I have played, which isnt that much yet, even the most outlying places looks great.

I am a fan of multiplayer, and the way this games handles the ''drop-in'' and ''drop-out'' of multiplayer works like a charm. Indeed, they dont support their own servers for multiplayer, but they did an awesome job here. No port forwarding needed. Just enter if you would like to play single player, multiplayer using LAN or INTERNET, or joining one of those. Everyone with a decent connection should not have any problems with this game playing over either Lan or Internet.

The dept of this game overall is amazing. The skilltrees, the devotion points (Points that can be acquired through shrines around the world), the dual specialization, the different classes. The blacksmith who can craft amazing and lots of items and add-ons for your character. The shared stash tab, so you can share items between other characters instantly.

Although Grimdawn is an ARPG, the different playstyles you can combine with or without friends feels so good. I have played a lot of RPG's and ARPG's before, but Grimdawn feels like something ''new''. Not the standard hack and slash experience, but something feels different in this game. All the variation in it makes it so great. You even have an option to turn your camera around, so if you're bored with this game (I cant image why), you could turn the camera 180 degrees and its like you're playing a whole new world!

Would I recommend this game?
Well definitely I will!

And that for only 25 euro's? Thats amazing!

Grim Dawn
This is one of those games where you can just feel that the developers poured thier heart and soul into its creation.  Solid from start to finish and challenging on the ultimate difficulty.  Skills are fun to use and the multiclass system adds additional depth to character creation.  If you enjoyed Titan Quest or Diablo 2 I would highly recommend that you check out Grim Dawn.

Grim Dawn, a spiritual successor to Titan Quest (check that out if you haven't already) a new standard for ARPGs by Crate Entertainment, better than Path of Exiles, Torchlight 2, and WAY better than Diablo III.
Full character customization
Mix 6 different classes for different play-styles
Explore a HUGE world
Craft
Gain reputation with several factions
Reap great rewards and fight big bosses
The world of Cairn is gritty and dark, with interesting lore that definitely is inspired from Lovecraft and music that reminds me of the good old days of Diablo and Diablo II.

All in all my new standard for all ARPGs, Path of Exiles is a great ARPG, Torchlight 2 is a goodARPG, Diablo III is not a funARPG, for me, Grim Dawn has everything and then some that all of these other titles don't have, and for that reason alone its worth the purchase.

Need another reason? Its only$24.99USD, that is what I like to see on PC gaming, great games and great prices.

Support these guys now! And thank you Crate Entertainment!

Grim Dawn
I've been playing ARPG's since Diablo, am a firm believer that Diablo II: Lord of Destruction is the best ARPG ever made and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls is not a true successor to the series. Besides that I've also put time and effort in Torchlight II and Path of Exile, which I both found to be better than Diablo III but which still couldn't satisfy my ARPG need. Now I've purchased Grim Dawn early on but due to performance issues I was unable to play it at that time (which have been fixed) and I left it until recently.

My experience comes from playing Act I in Hardcore Veteran mode, both solo and with friends in multiplayer. The difficulty at Veteran -which is a modifier to Normal difficulty, increasing the amount of Hero enemies" and the rewards that you reap from them- is very solid. You will roughly level from 1 to 18-20 during Act I

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

After 30+ hours of playing the first act i'm still having loads of fun! Plenty of replayability due to experimenting with different character builds, tactics, and the awesome dual class system. From what i've seen in act 1, the difficulty is good: A gimped character will die alot, as well as players rushing head long into the fray. Graphics are awesome, although carts on fire still eat up all my frame rates...
Definitily buy this game if you are a fan of TQ, or if D3 wasn't enough to satisfy your hunger.

Grim Dawn
With nearly 400 hours played, and being old enough to play Diablo 2 when it first came out, this brings back memories like you cannot believe.

I would recommend 100% for any ARPG lovers out there... Only good things to come in the future.

Very much worth the $30 CAD on the game, better than any Popular" game in the RPG genre"

We now have Voiceovers and an intro video.  It's hard to describe here, but the overall smoothness" feel of build 31 is significantly better than it was in b29/30.  We have gotten some added content in act 2

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

After nearly 500 hours of early access playtime I feel i should weigh in on Grim Dawn. Also at 491 hours and rising it should tell you i've enjoyed this game greatly, and have paid for two other copies that i gave to my brother and a friend. Now lets get to the actual Review.

Grim Dawn as a game does not hold your hand, in quests you are told to seek out something or someone at a location, after that you are left on your own to search for your objective, only once you get near your objective(about near the edge of your screen) does a marker show up. This encourages exploration of areas in full and i also reccomend that you fully explore an area there are many secrets in the game to be found, from loot, to quests, to bosses that may or may not kill your character when you first meet them.

The world is also not sectioned off like say as it was in Titan Quest or Diablo, it is instead one continous worldspace, akin to Sacred, some complain about this giving the games world areas too similar to one another, i personally enjoy this as it creates a more cohesive world.

As for the games story, i find it enjoyable enough, when you start the game your character was to be hung at the gallows for being possessed by an Aetherial spirit, said spirit abandons ship before it dies with you, you're cut down, then asked if you want to stay you need to earn your keep by assisting the settlement of Devils Crossing, i wont spoil much more, but another thing i would like to address about the games story is that some NPC's you meet arent helpless sods needing rescue, bar some casses. theres quite a few times in the game where you find the odd NPC camped out somewhere surrounded by slain monsters, I find this a refreshing change of pace compaired to other ARPGs. Lastly much of Grim Dawn's history, backstory, and lore are found via notes scattered throughout the world, some are journals from before the game, others history of the world, or just the odd bit of why a particular foe is with a faction. Again encouraing more exploration of the world.

Now to the meat and bones of any ARPG, Character customiztion, progression and loot. Lets start with the Masteries, in Grim Dawn there are 5(and a 6th coming in the next build, Build 27) Masteries, Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist, and soon to be the Shaman.

the Soldier is your melee specialist,  hearty and strong, a robust choice for someone new to grim dawn.

The Demolitionist is all about explosions and fire. Like seeing the world burn? then this is the mastery for you.
The Occultist Focuses on debuffs, pets, and debilitating attack spells. command minions to maul your foes or debilitate them with vile curses.
The Nightblade is your melee dual wielder, focusing on speed, and very fast attacks, want to shred your enemies into ribbons? chose the nightblade
The Arcanist is a pure spellcaster  that rains down destruction and devastation. the glass cannon of the game
Each of these masteries can be combined with another to create a dual class, covering one masteries weakness or bolstering anothers strengths. in my opinion this lends the game a great deal of replay value because i am the kind of person who will explore all avenues of play. with the varied skill pool of a single mastery there are quite a few dual class combinations you can take advantage of and explore different playstyles.

The loot in Grim Dawn is quite good, the qualities ranging from White(basic), Yellow(magic), Green(rare or rare monster infrequent), Blue(epic) and Purple(Legendary, not yet in the game). Curiously magic rare and epic are competative, in some character builds a good yellow might be all you need to properly outfit an equipment slot,  while another can get by with some basic epic items, or builds looking to gear in all rare equipment. there are a number of affixes to suit any and all builds, as well as epics.

There is also a Faction system in Grim Dawn, there are many groups you can aid, and many you can anger. Increasing your standing with friendly factions allows you access to their equipment and augments. these augments offer additional bonuses to your items and can be worth the effort to obtain access to them. Conversely further angering hostile factions makes them send more dangerous enemies at each threshold, culminating in the chance to encounter a Nemesis, a random boss linked to the faction you angered. these nemesis bosses while rare drop incredible loot, and assure an epic from their defeat, and once they are in the game, an increased chance of legendary drops.

this last section I am going to adress some deal breakers: Many ask will there be secure servers?" at this time there are no plans for such

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

When I was a wee lad, I had an addiction to Diablo 2.  Sure, other games would find their way on to my 500 MB HDD, but they were just visiting.  That's where D2 lived.

I waited 13+ years to Diablo 3 and, well, we all know what happened there.  I was left without a new ARPG that could scratch that itch.

Then stumbled upon Grim Dawn.  It scratched.

The visuals are stunning and gritty.  The atmophere is oppressive yet relaxing.  Hit detection is perfect.  Balancing seems on point.  Classes look and feel unique.  Skills are inventive and beautiful to execute.  Loot is expansive. Mechanics are sound.  MP community is wonderful.  Story is awesome.  Etc., Etc., Etc.

Serioulsy, if you're like me and haven't been able to find that ARPG that satisfies that craving, this is it.

10/10

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Well... I suppose I'll write a review after testing the game for over 1k hours though after the game's release I will definitely update this.

So. Let's start with the company. Crate Entertainment currently consists of a team of 8 people who not only communicate with the community (this is amazing) - but also know how to create a kick  game. They started with only 2 people for quite some time while receiving off and on support from people they knew who also worked on TQ - gradually and with help from Kickstarter + Steam Early Access sales they have managed to expand and continue to amaze the fans who are eagerly waiting for this game to be released (even now it is defnitely worth it imo).

Grim Dawn takes all the good things from Titan Quest and makes it better while also distinguishing itself in it's own way. The game plays and feels like Titan Quest while it also reminds me of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 when it comes to the grittier/darker visual appeal. This to me is the ultimate combination of ARPG games and to be apart of the development process in testing and providing feedback for such a game is an amazing experience.

Now to the game.

Story - Grim Dawn is actually what the peope of Cairn (world of Grim Dawn) call what is pretty much the apocolypse in that an invasion of 2 otherwordly races have invaded the world. One race, the Aetherials want to possess everything that lives all the while pretty much terraforming the planet in order to make Cairn a more liveable place for them - while the other race, the Ch'thonians want to stop this from happening which means butchering those that the Aetherials are interested in possessing which includes you and any survivors that managed to live through the initial invasion.

That is the overall plot in which the beginning of the game is more stressing the survival aspects of living in a now ruined world - while also building a foundation for future encounters with the Aetherials and Ch'thonic invaders. The danger is very real - and there are other nasty beasts, creatures and outlaws that also pose a threat to your survival.

There are Quest Options for choosing different outcomes in a quest, and there will be factions that will be added later on in development (perhaps late this year or early next year hopefully).

Combat - Very much like Titan Quest but having a faster pace. So far it's been quite good and the devs continually update animations, balance skills, and fix bugs with skills when they can. Definitely not Diablo 3 which admittedly has some good combat that flows very well (one of the few things that I'll give to the game) - but it's still pretty good. Hopefully as development continues whatever issues that people find will be fixed and improved upon.

Characterization - Creating a character has only male/female options but this will probably change later when it comes to having different options for faces/hair as pertaining to a dev post. As this isn't hugely important it will be done later on I would imagine. However the main thing: replay value and creating Skill Builds. This is definitely there. Just like Titan Quest, Grim Dawn has the dual mastery system where you start off with one mastery/class at level 2 and once you reach level 10 you can choose a second one. With 5 Mastery's that is 15 combinations of either sticking with 1 mastery or using the dual mastery system. Itemization also expands character builds by a lot which brings me to...

Itemization/Crafting - Really good. Common/White items are useful for the couple low levels in which you can then turn them off (making them more of a visual look when it comes to enemies dropping stuff they are wearing/using(!!!)), Magic/Yellow items are next in line which although not usually as powerful as later tiers they can roll a lot higher with their affixes, Rare/Green items have affixes that are unique and can be quite powerful, Epic/Blue items have set affixes with merely the rolls being varied + they can be set items, and Legendary items are not yet in the game.

Needless to say the itemization in this game is fantastic and compliments both the skill building aspect of the game and the loot hunt part of the game.

Level Design - Handcrafted world means the level design looks really good but of course trades that off with less randomization. Enemy camps can be randomized in some cases and there are randomized barriers which players can encounter and have to find a way to get around them via an alternate route - giving some slight randomization and also promoting exploration. The level design for each area is done in such a way that the player can continue on in the direction of the next area quickly - or spend time to explore the area for loot/dungeons/caves/quests. Essentially levels are short but wide - so later playthroughs you can choose whether or not to spend more time exploring or continuing on with the quests. The game isn't finished yet so content on Act 3 and perhaps the miniature Act 4 that may be added will also be quite interesting to see.

Enemies - Are quite diverse and are also in their own faction which means you can actually see Aetherials and Ch'thonic enemies duking it out before you even get to the fight. As with Titan Quest later difficulties means secret bosses/challenge dungeons that would have been locked in the previous difficulty.

Some more Positive things:
-Modding - is amazing. Titan Quest and Diablo 2 both have great mods that I have enjoyed and since GD's modding tools will be better I am hoping for some amazing mods later on in the future.
-Survival Mode. Sounds just like it says in that you need to survive against waves of enemies, modding can definitely expand on this.
-Open World PVP. Though the game's skills/itemization isn't based on PVP modding could definitely create balanced PVP and probably some interesting game modes I would imagine.
-Camera that is fully rotatable and has decent zoom.  Might not seem like that much of a deal but after playing GD - trying other ARPG's or even Moba's can be relatively frustrating due to lack of camera control.
-Weather + Day and Night System.
-Will be DRM free on release - for those that are wary about Steam and want to fully own the game.
-No economy.

Some possible Negatives:
-Single player based with optional multiplayer. Single player mode is perfectly fine while multiplayer can be a bit iffy mainly due to it being just released - optimization will definitely improve on the multiplayer experience.
-No closed servers. Like TL2 and TQ there aren't closed servers. Should the game do amazingly well the devs have expressed their interest in such a thing but they would rather spend money on more content before considering closed servers. That being said public games are usually pretty good and if someone joins in with a modded character you can always ban them from the game/server. A con when it comes to modding but the pros definitely outwheigh the cons.
-No economy.
-Slow development. Though I expect the game to be finished either early or middle of next year - the pace is relatively slow due to having a small team. That being said they do communicate well with the forum users and give updates every other Monday.
-Costs $25. For some reason people really like F2P games but I'd rather pay a flat price for a full game rather then have a gimped free version of the game. For what you get out of the game $25 is super cheap even with the content that is available now.
-Not optimized. Though I can run the game at max fine, that doesn't mean everyone can. Obviously lack of optimization is a given that will be improved later on in development - however both the devs and the community are pretty good in trying to help those who are having issues with running the game.

Conclusion: Grim Dawn is definitely worth $25 if you enjoyed Titan Quest and perhaps Diablo 1 or 2.
10/10 for an excellent Early Access game. Will update on release.

Grim Dawn
In the grim dawnness of Crate Entertainments' ARPG, there is only excellence...
Grim Dawn has had one of the longest journeys through Early Access, I've been there right from the start, when it was a very rough and ready prototype with the first act, when the frame rate was choppy and the scenery was a little bit flat to say the least. But gods, the core gameplay was satisfying. It scratched the itch that only Diablo 2 and more recently Path of Exile had scratched in a very specific, and pleasing way. Over the intervening timeframe, it has grown, evolved, and refined itself, and matured into this majestic, noble thing.

Scalable across a wide variety of systems, able to look beautiful on the very highest of rigs and still managing to look good on systems of modest means whilst maintaining a good framerate, the levelling and class development has grown with six base classes available, and the ability to dual class means that in effect you've the choice of no less than fifteen possible combinations from which to pick your build from. Twenty one if you decide for whatever reason to stick with a purely single class setup (which is eminently possible, but who wants to just go one way these days when you can swing two...). That's not even touching on the brilliantly insane devotion system, which unfolds like something that looked at Path of Exile and went You know

Early Access Review

My friends were all like ITS LIKE TITAN QUEST! ITS AWESOME!"

Guess what; its like titan quest. Its awesome."

Grim Dawn
**New In-depth Review Update**
I'm still playing this game.

**Old Review w/ 50% less depth**
Look ya s! As you can clearly see I am entirely too busy actually playing this game to write you a proper review. So.. Look at my hours, now look at my recommendation. Finger it out and buy the game. Peace.

Grim Dawn
TITAN QUEST 2.0

After 550 hours of playing Grim Dawn, I think it is time to write up my review.

So, what is Grim Dawn? The short answer is that it is Titan Quest" 2.0. The long answer is that Grim Dawn is an ARPG from Crate Entertainment. The game takes places in the world of Cairn

Grim Dawn
I haven't enjoyed an ARPG so much since I summoned my first Clay Golem at level 6.

Ya know all those other ARPGs that have come out since then? Each one tweaked Diablo 2 just a little bit, and added or altered stuff, but never really quite hit the preposterously high bar D2 set. They were good games and I enjoyed most of them that I played, (except Torchlight, wasn't a fan for some reason) but they still left me wanting.
If you can relate, Grim Dawn is what you've been looking for, its cherrypicked the best systems and ideas of all the recent well-done ARPGS, and basically jammed them back into a reimagining of Diablo 2 with great results

Its the most worthy among a slew of competitors for the true successor to Diablo 2 (including PoE, D3, Titan Quest:IT, Torchlight 1 & 2)
If you feel like this genre had gotten stagnant, like I did, this game will renew your hope.

+1-4 player, instanced loot, trade loot, enemy difficulty/loot scaling by player
+Atmosphere and feel of Diablo 2, but with guns
+Class/level system of Titan Quest
+Tons of components, crafting, and enhancements that significantly alter playstyle and can easily alter build path, like Path of Exile
+Fantastic character build options
+Shoulder slot
+Totally needless amount of isntanced loot
+good loot variety
+good enemy variety
+huge enemy groups, frequent enemy heros
+fun, satisfying combat
+Main quest is decently long, high replayability
+reasonably priced

=some pretty blatant recreations of Diablo 2 encounters (definitely more of an homage than a copy)
=Class-granted skills are varied, but uninspired. (The excellent customzation comes from combining them with various other effects)
=Lots of skills that prock on or or are dependent on % chance-per-hit

-Environment variety isn't so great, simialr colors and titlesets pretty much the whole time
-Summoners can only have one of each summon, no hellhound army builds :(
-Storyline is meh. Not terrible, but clearly not its focus



Grim Dawn
Ok calling all RPG fans....

Grim Dawn was made just for you if you liked
Diablo 1 or 2, PreSkyrim Morrowind cycle, Throne of Darkness, Van Helsing, Titan's Quest, or any of their closest kin.

The opening plot starts with you being possesed, tortured for inforrmation, and being hung. The hanging exorcises the aetheric infestation (4th dimentional being has no desire to die stuck in your body). Your rope gets shot down and the game starts with you enhanced body being asked if you're willing to redeam yourself and help save a small parcel of humanity. No spoilers there folks, watch the trailer (nicely done).

The setting is as if someone took magical Renaissance era Europe added a touch of the old West, a dash of Tesla, and iced it all with some Soloman Kane.

Graphically
You've got the 3 person top down angle camera view.
And well folks... while the detail level isn't bad. This game is dark, grubby, and crumbling in looks. A while one occationally gets to walk through areas like this
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652567803
more often you'll get dungeons like this and darker
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652567901

I turned up my brightness. Cause everytime I was in a dark area at night. Even with light enhancing items, it was bloody hard to see. Which is realistic (and can be nice in a horror game) but I personally don't find it fun in a dungeon crawler.

Audio
30% of NPCs have voice acting. The rest speak only in text format. The hacks, shots, grunts, ect are worthy; but nothing special. The background music is your typical ignoreable mood enhancer stuff.

Gameplay
Now here's where it gets enjoyable. It's your standard mouse point directional walk, left click attack, right click ect.. with the customizeable 2 layered slots for potions, spells, special attacks, and the permanent spot for your personal rift portal (that your lovely modifed humanity grants you). A great class system and you'll get to choose 2 of them eventually. Then you get you devotional choices once you restore your first shrine (on a nice astrological skill map). Your inventory will expand with some quests. You have a storage chest and the ability to send items to your other characters. You get enhancement bits to add to your items. Once you help the blacksmith, the ability to craft.

And if all that seams familar to you (to any core rpg player it should) there's the truth of this game. The developers have taken nearly every well working gameplay aspect from all the games before and used them.This isn't a bad thing even if it's not truly inovative. It's nostalgic without being hokey.

There's also multiplayer available.........

Overall
I really think if you ever enjoyed a 3 person view RPG you should buy this. It's a premium experiance and a excellent dungeon grinder.

Grim Dawn
It's like the creators went to the salvage yard, found the old and rusted remains of Diablo II, Titan Quest, and Fallout and thought Hey

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

I actually had low-ish expectations going into Grim Dawn as I'm not the biggest fan of ARPG games, but I've really enjoyed playing this. This game has TONS of loot, many different class combos, exciting combat and a decent story to hold it all together. I picked this up when it was 50% off, but I would have still been happy having paid full price of $25 as there is a LOT of content here.

This game is still in Early Access (full game due around Q1 '16) but you wouldn't know it while playing. The dev's have focused on releasing one act at a time, and releasing quality content instead of a full game of bugs and glitches. I've played now for about 40 hours and haven't encountered a single bug, which is quite impressive. The only negative I could think of is the frame rate gets a little choppy at times, but I'm guessing this is just an optimisation thing, which will no doubt happen before launch.

In short: Great game and really good value considering the content within and the asking price. I totally recommend this to all ARPG fans or just RPG fans in general.

Grim Dawn
Before I begin. here is DAIL mod. it is updated as often as possible and has an installer.
http://www.nexusmods.com/grimdawn/mods/11/?
(1000s of actual edits, new content, 3 new masteries infinite maps, 12 mods merged in etc)

now for the Review"

This is my new favourite time waster/grinder
It doesnt have the disneyland polish (not always a good thing) of torchlight 2

Grim Dawn
At first this game seemed like one of 'those' Diablo copies. But as I played through it, several positives that other similar ARGP's don't have become clear:

Positives:
+ Grim Dawn has six well-rounded premade 'classes' you can invest in.
In Grim Dawn, you start out with all options open and you can choose from a big variation of offensive and defensive skills.
+ Grim Dawn allows for Dual Class mixing.
After reaching level 10, you can start investing points in another 'class' skill tree, allowing you to mix with even more offensive/defensive skills from that other class.
+ Grim Dawn has an item for most skill builds.
The items in Grim Dawn are unique, but also generic in a good sense. Flat bonuses to whatever type of damage your character deals are widely available.
+ Grim Dawn has a massive variety of item-enhancers (called Materials).
You find these in the world and can attach them to items to make them more powerful in a certain way, or use them in the extensive crafting system. They can be somewhat compared to 'socketable gems or runes' in Diablo 2, but every item has a 'socket'.
+ Grim Dawn has a very extensive 'talent' system (called Devotion).
In the world you find shrines that once defeated/something sacrificed to award a talent point. This can be invested in a very broad talent system. This has a slight downside for those who do NOT enjoy theorycrafting; it can be a bit overwhelming.
+ Grim Dawn plays fluently.
Now this may seem irrelevant, but for those who played Path of Exile and were thrown off by the 'clunky' gameplay (I know I was) will have a much cleaner feel of gameplay flow in Grim dawn that is almost similar to Diablo 3. You character feels very responsive to your actions and he goes where you want him to go.
+ Grim Dawn has a good mix between realistic and clear art style.
To make a game both pretty in a realistic way AND still be able to see what happens where is NOT easy, and Grim Dawn does a good job at it. The minimap, map and color scheme are all clear enough to see (I am r-g colorblind).
+ Grim Dawn is fun to play with friends.
Once set up, GD is a very enjoyable multiplayer experience. You can easily build characters that complement each other, or slaughter each other in a duel.
+ Grim Dawn items can (usually) be traded/given to friends.
Yeah, this is good. Not like Diablo 3 where every-****ing-thing is soulbound. Some items in Grim Dawn are also soulbound, but with reason.
+ Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.
It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.

Negatives:
- Grim Dawn has a seemingly pointless mechanic of stat points.
You are allowed to invest in Physique, Cunning or Spirit. Physique gives hp and other health bonuses, Cunning gives crit and hit bonuses and Spirit gives more energy to spam your skills. It SEEMS like a choice at first, but because items REQUIRE flat amounts of these stats (715 Spirit for that great caster item, 715 Physique for that awesome armor) this choice is an illusion. In fact, this can be very frustrating for a first playthrough; you might not be able to wear something awesome you find. Diablo 3 doesn't have this problem (but many others).
- Grim Dawn tends to stutter a bit with large amounts of monsters and particles on screen.
Played on a high-end PC (2016 built), with 3 Wind Devils, 3 Storm Totems, 1 Wendigo Totem and 4 packs of monsters can give lag, even on the best of machines. This is not any worse than on similar games like D3 or PoE.
- Grim Dawn leveling can become tedious.
After level 50, the experience needed to advance increases rapidly per level. Reaching max level on a character is an every-day, 2 week investment at least.
- Grim Dawn needs portforwarding for most people to do multiplayer.
Right now, hosting a game in GD requires you to manually open port 27016 (UDP/TCP). Although this is easy for me, it may not be for those less technically inclined.
- Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.
It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.

I hope you found this summary review helpful! Have fun :)

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Disclaimer, This is my first review.

First and foremost, I was highly skeptical about this game before I bought it. I saw it and thought Re-skin of Titan Quest." I am happy to see the spirit of TQ perserved while establishing itself as it's own Intellectual Property and its take on Action Role Playing Games.

I was let down by the charactor creation (I spend a lot of time on charactor creation in games like Saints Row 3

Grim Dawn
TL;DR-  Grim Dawn is a fantastic game with an immense amount of depth that might intimidate casual players... if it weren't so Dag Nabbed fun and hooking right out of f***ing box when you fire it up.


I've been playing since I believe March or May 2013ish... TBH, this game is the whole reason I initially downloaded Steam. For awhile, I wasn't a big fan of the whole Steam idea. Now it's a part of life. Strange how things work out. Anyway, deciding I should actually start supporting these talented small teams early instead of just crossing my fingers like I did with GGG, I backed Crate pretty heavily on Kickstarter (for me at least) and had to install Steam to test their Alpha releases.

My opinion has, of course, wavered throughout the last few years. At the finish line, I can assure you that this is a top-notch aRPG that belongs in ANYONE's arsenal who claims to be a fan of the genre.

My pet-peave at the moment is that with it's stellar reviews on big-name sites such as ign and such it is of course getting the indoctrinal which is better" treatment.

Grim Dawn is it's own beast.

Path of Exile is my social aRPG. I play it for teamwork. I play it for that economical atmostphere. Sure

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Ultra Street Fighter IV is not a game for everyone. It is a very hard game. A few hundred hours is the basic learning curve for essentially being a beginner. That being said even for people not planning on being competitive there's a lot of content just in the combo system. It's satisfying working towards just doing combos in themselves or eventually beating your first opponent online. That being said, this is where the true nature of this game comes out.

USF4 Is a game of competition and self-discipline. This game will appeal to yourself if you always strive to improve. There will be an unlimited amount of times you will frustrated and convinced you hit a brick wall. This game is about gradual improvement, a constant cycle of finding new plateaus and satisfaction of overcoming them with practice, hard work and intellect. This is a personal game, you shoulder all the blame for losing in a competitive setting. If you are prone to rage-quitting then this game will quickly be deleted from your hard drive in anger.

Pushing past this however, you see the evolution of play and how you express your personality and play style as well as who you are playing against. It's oddly intimate in that you can recognize someone solely based on their movements, actions and decisions. In every game it is you against another person, another individual wanting to get better and improve, wanting to learn from you as you learn from them. This is the addicting part of USF4 and Fighting games in general, your best friends are always your enemies and you push each other constantly. Nobody will ever truly be satisfied in being good enough"

Ultra Street Fighter IV
I only played a little but it was fun.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
100 hours and i still suck

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Genre: 2.5D Traditional Fighting Game

Summary:
SFIV is a footsies-based fighting game that emphasizes slow methodical play and meter management between rounds.
Game features the inclusion of 'focus attacks', a universal move that grants a character one hit of armour and the potential to crumple the opponent; the nature of focus attacks allow characters to aggressive advance through attacks without infringing upon the effectiveness of projectile characters.

Pros:
- 39 characters, an additional 5 in Ultra Street Fighter 4.
- The majority of match-ups are balanced (future update to provide further balance).
- Decent netcode if neither player has much traffic.
- Large established player base online and offline.
- Great for players trying to get into fighting games. Will teach fundamentals through play and the abundant tutorials on the internet.

Cons:
- Single-player modes are lacking; arcade mode has terrible A.I. and the challenges aren't fun.
- The game itself does not provide instruction to newer players.
- No theatre mode for the animated clips from Arcade Mode.

Neutral Points:
- There will be a learning curve; it is a fighting game afterall. If you are a new player then you will be terrible for a while.
- Input leniency allows newer players to perform special moves more easily but can become an annoyance at higher level play.
- There is a comeback factor for newer players (Ultra) which becomes a tool at higher level play.
- The plot is barebones, but hey, that's a norm for fighting games.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Online has been patched. It was an issue on Steam's end, and now many problems have been fixed. Reviews before March 2015 lamenting online play might be outdated. Online isnt perfect but it is definitely playable (and better than Netherrealm fighters at least).

In my opinion this is one of the best fighting games on Steam. If you want a deep and competitive game or just want to jump into the genre, this is a great title to pick up, especially with EVO right around the corner.

+Diverse roster of 44 playable characters
+All classic SF2 world warriors (Guile, Sagat, Cammy, Akuma, etc.)
+Good mix of SF Alpha and SFIII characters (No Alex or Q though)
+Wide range of controller support
+Very balanced. Every character is viable in the right hands.
+Good soundtrack (Character themes aren't nearly as good as in SFIII: 3rd Strike though)
+Useful training mode with attack data, input display, dummy recording, and even 2 player online training
+Matches can get pretty hype
+Runs well on PC (80 fps on an AMD 7770)
+Solid netcode. Again, not perfect (unless you live in Japan) but most matches are smooth.
+Lots of colors and costumes (everyone has at least 3-4 costumes and ~12 colors)
+New unique Focus Attack system.
+Extensive Trial mode gives a fun way to burn time if you want a challenge
+Interesting Japanese ink brush art style with great 3D visuals (sort of prefer the old 2D sprites though). Fireballs look beautiful.
+Online community is still active
-V-Sync causes input lag
-New Revenge Meter is built up by taking damage. At 50% you can do an Ultra combo. This feels like it rewards bad play and makes comebacks more common and less exciting.
-Ubiquitous 1 frame link combos. These are much more punishable on a missed link due to the large reversal window, allowing players to mash out a dragon punch if you mistime your inputs
-Typical cheap arcade fighting game A.I. with psychic reaction time. Final boss in arcade mode is cheap as hell
-3 joke characters. Dan is funny, but Rufus was unnecessary, and El Fuerte should be removed entirely.
-Character Select starts 1P at Juri and 2P at Hakan. Why not Ryu and Ken?
-Did I mention El Fuerte?

With USF4 what you get is a well polished, balanced, and deep fighter. What makes this game enjoyable to me is the high skill ceiling; every time I play I have the opportunity to improve my ability. Heck, even with the amount of hours I've put in I still kinda suck. Much of my playtime consists of playing in private lobbies with friends, which is always a blast. While Street Fighter may seem technically daunting, I definitely recommend it to those looking to get into the fighting game genre. A learning curve is definitely present, but the fundamentals you pick up from playing this will carry on to other fighters. This is also currently the most played fighting game in the tournament  scene, so those with a competitive drive should be satisfied. Whether youre familiar with fighters or are a total newcomer, I recommend picking up Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Well what can I say ... I spent some time on this game, and I'm pretty sure that is one of the best fighting games of all time.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Probably the most balanced versus fighting game ever, easy to learn, hard to master.
Just play it, have fun and make people salty.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Title: Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition makes for a very intriguing title. It contains one of those fancy circle Rs which probably stand for something legal, so you don't have to worry about any legal issues when you fire it up. Title has you covered.
This game is also rather super, as every single character without exception has a super move that can be activated when you have a full super meter. Each character also has Ultra combos, although the title will not reflect that until an upcoming change in 2014.
Street Fighter IV is the defining Street Fighter of this generation, with over four street fighters to street fight as. Furthermore, this is the arcade edition. Arcades are known for many things, but I don't actually know what any of those are. I remember that I never wanted to play in them that much because I'd have to pay every time I wanted to try again, which would be extremely frequent. I'm terrible at this. Fortunately, you do not have to buy a respawn DLC, even though this is the Arcade Edition.

Graphics: The game comes with graphics, many of which are even 3d. The camera does fancy spinning flying things when you do ultra combos, and while that may not be related to graphics, I feel that is a very huge selling point as there is no better way to emphasize just how hard you punched that little casual in his filthy jaw. There are also fancy effects you can put on the characters that make a subtle but noticeable difference I can't put my finger on because my monitor does not have a touch screen.
At any rate, the answer to Does Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition have graphics?" would be a resounding "Yes!"

Gameplay: As you might expect

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Played online and now I am saltier than the ocean

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Yeah, what can I say. Greatest game ever made if you put in the time to learn it at the higher levels. This is definitely the deepest game out there. Pro's have to consistently hit timings down to 16 ms, in addition to reading the opponent, adjusting to their character, and developing their own strategies to psyche them out. In reality this is psychological fighter IV, and if you like deep games, you can forget about any of the other ones out there.

USF4 takes the cake.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
- I choose Dan
- My opponent picks Dudley
- It's the last round and we both have 20% health
- I'm in the corner. He throws out an Ultra 1
- I blocked and now he's open. I go in with Dan's Ultra 1
- Window pops up The player has left the session"

Can't get past Ryu Trial #1

10/10

No, for real though, Ultra Street Fighter IV is a superb fighting game, boasting some of the
most iconic characters, music, and mechanics that's ever been put on PC, Console, or otherwise.

Keep in mind that this isn't a overly fast-paced 10,000 combo fighter,
know that Online Multiplayer has a few hiccups, but overall is actually quite good now,
grasp that USFIV doesn't play like Third Strike or Street Fighter II in regards to timing and
execution (though some aspects definitely strike Street Fighter II more than any other SF
title to date), don't expect too much from this title in regards to story,
and you'll know what to expect if you've every even glanced at someone else playing a Street
Fighter game.

Like any other Fighting Game, it will take time and dedication to arrive at the
same level as others you might come across online, but at the end of the day the rewards
greatly outweigh the effort you'd put into the game.

If you like Fighting Games at all, PICK THIS UP.

Maybe when it's on Sale, though. I know the struggle.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
I hate this game so much, but I can't stop playing.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
As an avid Street Fighter 4 player, I consider this game to be one of the best fighting games currently available.  Not only the character roster great, comprised of 30+ old and new fighters from the series to date, but so is the sophisticated combo system that is both easy to pick up yet difficult to master.  I wasnt particularly a fan of SF4s visual style and initially reluctant to try the game because of it, yet Ive grown to appreciate the unique look and feel of each characters and stages that the developers faithfully recreated in this title.

Like many similar games in the genre, SSF4 was initially released on console systems and then ported over to PC.  Luckily, the developer Capcom has done an amazing job, implementing number of customization options for PC, such as support for greater than 30fps and multiple resolutions including 1080p.  In addition, the game also supports many controllers out of the box including XBOX 360 controller and numerous fightsticks.  Outside of Games for Windows Live, game runs smoothly and the loading time is relatively short, so there isnt much for me to complain about this quality port.

Although brief single player portion of the game is quite good, the multiplayer is where this game truly shines.  Thanks to its improved netcode, finding multiplayer matches are quick and reliable.  Built-in match setups work consistently for the most part and despite it missing my favorite championship mode from a previous title, both ranked and endless mode keep the game interesting and fun.  I really like the replay / save feature as well, which helped me to capture and savor those favorite character match ups over the years.

Super Street Fighter 4 definitely isnt perfect and the game isnt groundbreaking enough to likely persuade those of you who arent interested in fighting games.  If you hold even a little preference over the genre though, this is good as any place to start.  I wholeheartedly recommend this to both casual onlookers and fighting game fans.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Ultra Steet Fighter IV is an update for the original Street Fighter IV which was released in 2008. Believe it or not, but this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise.  This game is a standalone product too, allowing you to just purchase this definitive edition.

This update brings the total number of playable characters up to forty four - each of the characters also has a different version of them selves, meaning you have in effect eighty eighty different characters to play as. Street Fighter IV has one of the best combo systems I have played with, much better than the combo system in Mortal Kombat X to say the least. You can easily view the combos for your character on the pause menu, meaning you can learn them on the fly,

The graphics are really quite nice too, it shows a cartoony style art much like the previous games, but with a more polished and finished look to it. All of the special moves and combos each have their own animation, as well as special effects, making this a really good looking game to look at whilst spectating.

Each of the characters in Ultra Street Fighter have their own story line, so with 44 different characters, that is a lot of story to include! I was quite surprised at this amount given the very linear style of fighting games I have played in the past. Obviously some of the stories are more in depth than others, but each of them give you a good amount of content to see.

I only managed to play this game on Easy mode, and even then, on some of the latter stages to the arcade mode, I was struggling. I would hate to see how devastatingly hard the normal and hard modes are, because I was having to retry plenty of times before being able to beat some stages. That being said, this is the sort of game that you will just get better at with practice, you won't be pulling off massive combos to start with (unless you are highly experienced with this genre) so it will take some time before getting right up to speed.

I have completed four characters arcade mode, meaning I have another forty left to go, this has taken me just over two hours to do, so there is a heck of a lot of content on show here, and that is just the single player. Ultra Street Fighter also has a local and online multiplayer too which will really wrack up your hours with ease.

I had one technical issue whilst playing, I for the life of me could not get the game to run in 1920 x 1080 AND full-screen. Not sure whether this is intentional of a bug with my game. It runs fine in that resolution and windows mode though. That being said, you probably won't notice it too much given the amount of time you actually get to look at anything else whilst playing.

I can easily recommend Ultra Street Fighter IV, even though this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise, it really does a good job of introducing you to this style of game and giving you hours and hours of content too. To buy this game from scratch, the 22,99 price tag is easily justified with the quality and quantity of gameplay on offer.

Tom's Score Card
1) Stay away
2) Only recommended when on sale
3) Recommended
4) Highly recommended
5) This is a must play

Ultra Street Fighter IV is not a game for everyone . It is a very hard game. A hundred hours is the basic . Always people say you need to know combos No!
What You Need To Know This Game
+Basic Elements
+Game Systems
+Frames
+Hitbox
+Save/not save combos/moves For example Heavy/Ex Shuryuken is not save
What i like in ultra street fighter 4 is W-Ultra is the big standout here, giving you access to both of your characters ultra combos instead of one or the other.
Neither will do as much damage, but the utility it provides is almost irresistible for characters like Dudley for instance, whose Ultra 1
against those whos like to throwing Hadouken's but his Ultra 2 when making combos at the corner almost at the end need make ex machine gun blow C.HK Ultra 2
very useful to It's a great additional tactical consideration that adds dimension to many formerly stale matchup consideration.
Red-Focus-Attack on the other hand, are a little more situational in application With multiple hits and more combos.
The most changed is blanace like increased damage reducing and fixing .
For instance Ken's Shinruyken non animated version is now increased and Cammy and Fei long was reduced damage But Rufus Messiah Kick And Chun li Ultra 1 now is fix it and others.

Online/Gameplay
Steam version was with problems connection .Even when my opponent's connection quality is green, one out of every six even with even ,with green bars was bad but now after patches works good.
Online is pretty funny endless mode you can meet strange people you playing too good you kick it you playing bad kick 0pp/bb deafet opponent with more then 1kpp/bb kick it even .
I remember my first matches First Match-Lost Second-Rage quiter Third-Lost Forth-Rage Quiter and circle gose again i won after after twenty times by cause to many rage quiters sometimes even i quting matches:D
after more hours in rankeds i win againts high rank player sometimes but even opponet wanna rematch when i lost match reamtch beggins i got the advantage almost at the win opponent The Player Has Left The Session almost everytime
.I saw there almost at the win rage quit's almost everytime even i saw on steam community screnshots/youtube video's i saw how low pp/bb almost deafet opponent with high pp/bb
The Player Has Left The Session :D.
What really my friends/people thinks this game is so easy some of them say this is mash buttons this is not hard and not competitive this game not popular bla bla bla bla hater gonna hate talking bull  :@ :@ :D :D.
I have friend whos always say it this game so easy has no skill and i can take 50 win streak is not hard even more than 50 win streak this game is not so hard.
My friend try this game on free weekend about Jul 16 and after first match his got rekt so hard and say this game not blanaced i get only strong players is not impassible to make combos
talking nonsense about this game when it is crap but for me and others this game is not crap is so funny :D :D.

The Final Review For Ultra Street Fighter 4
9-10 Very Good
Ture competitive game with real hard gameplay what people say about this game this game is so easy  don't lising to those people

Ultra Street Fighter IV
While the game itself is quite good as far as fighting games go, the PC version suffers from horrible network performance. Also some of the new characters are a bit buggy. I wouldn't recommend it on PC until it has been sufficiently patched.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Capcom still doesn't know how your ing PC works, news at 11

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Still better than Street fighter 5

Ultra Street Fighter IV
No longer properly functions online after GFWL removal
The game breaks into bouts of pasuing and stuttering stating it's retrying for a connection and sometiems even drops mid-game. This is a massive hazard when making inputs.
Judging from people willingly going for a rematch agaisnt me even after it, it must be the norm and not just me
I did not have this issue even once before steam integration and now it's in nearly every match
I for one would rather not play Super Stutter Fighter IV
Additionally everyone who joins my games is said to be local canadian players but their steam profiles have been in kanji or cyrillic and listed as being from entirely different parts of the world

Ultra Street Fighter IV
If you are going to exclusively play offline, with fight requests off at all times, the game is entirely worth it and I recommend it wholeheartedly. But because I would like to play online and I believe most interested people would as well, right now I cannot recommend this game.

It is a fun game and the community can be really great, but the state of online play is unacceptable and the fixes being released are few, far-between, and are seemingly half-baked and not nearly enough to address its problems and, due to the history of the changes implemented so far, I don't see the online issues being actually fixed soon.

Ultra Street Fighter IV is a great game, but as of mid-October the online portion of it is mostly useless because of bad net code, and it can even affect offline elements of the game if you have incoming fight requests on while playing offline.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
The best fighting game in the last few years, it offers an addictive and engrossing experience. To master each character you will need to spend some time tinkering with each moveset, but once that character clicks in your mind (and fingers :D) it is a blast.

If you decide to go online after practising with your favourite chars, you will find a good range of fighters available in ranked and/or endless lobbies. My favourite way of playing online is to activate in single player the 'fighter request' option, so you can practice with any character against the cpu, honing your skills while you 'receive' requests to fight some real people.

Last but not least, I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone interested in the game to buy a fighting stick, it is essential to master the game. I know they are expensive, but nowadays there is a good range of sticks under 100 that will allow you to feel sharper and precise controls compared to what you can do with a gamepad.

If you are commited to spend some hours with the game, you will experience one of the best fighters ever.

'The answer lies in the heart of battle'

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Since they implemented steamworks the games are far laggier and they pause mid-game with the message Waiting on other player" it's completely un-playable

Ultra Street Fighter IV
I ing hate the people who play this game

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Fantastic game, ashame steamworks had to ruin it for everyone. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I really miss GFWL!
Cons:
Laggy beyond all belief
During said lag it says Waiting for other player, whoever reconnect first gets to attack first while the other player is waiting at his mercy to not land a free ultra/combo.
Can no longer message people, instead forces you to use a mic to communicate with whoever your fighting.
Mic must be either on or off, you can no longer toggle a button to make it active, extremely annoying.
Announcer is annoying as hell and there is no way to turn him off.
Did I mention the lag?
If you bought a dlc pack from someone other than steam your SOL.
Pros:
Can change your name at will whereas with GFWL you had to spend money to do this.
DLC from steam convert over.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
After having this game since release with over 1000 (yea 1000) hours played and at one point being the number 1 ranked guy player on pc in the world it saddens me to say this game is now unplayable. Going from GFWL to Steamworks has made this a laggy terrible game that disconnects CONSTANTLY. It is now absolutely unplayable in online vs. Such a terrible shame to ruin such an amazing game like this.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Optimization and Netcode performance 10/10
would play again while downloadiing

i am not a fighting player at all the only fighting i play and i am super good at is Mortal Kombat series. i got this game from bundle for a really really cheap price then i just wanted to test the netcode and went directly online, well honestly even with red bar connections and me downloading and playing at same time i had no lag at all, the best part is game is not even fps locked like MK. i could reach over 91 fps at a time and have extremely smooth matches online.

instead of wasting your money on netherrealm garbage products just support this game and buy it and gift it to your friends and play together because online WORKS in this game. in MK series there is no online it is just an option which never works...

^ this comment comes from a guy whose life was dedicated to Mortal Kombat and you wouldnt be finding a hardcore MK fan like me, but when the developer has ZERO respect to at least test their product before releasing it on PC after getting $90 for their garbage game (MK X) it can even turn a fanboy to hateboy. i probably start learning SF and play it more i just have to find me favourite character then it is a GO!

Ultra Street Fighter IV
*Has Vs against CPU
*Has Arcade mode
*Online works and has modes you can actually play.
*Has more than 16 characters

10/10 Not Street Fighter V

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Like hard games? This is ing hard.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
The developers don't care about the game anymore and have betrayed their playerbase multiple times. The online mode is a bug- and lag-ridden mess that doesn't uphold to modern fighting game standards.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
its ok

Ultra Street Fighter IV
So it's about a year until Street Fighter V comes out and people who haven't really took Street Fighter seriously are wondering if it's worth the purchase.

The answer is yes.

I've been a complete casual Street Fighter player for years. But gradually over the years I always saw the pros and wonder if I can compete at their same level. Quite honestly anything is possible.. Except in a fighting game you don't rely on what level you are, or what kind of stats and skills determine the outcome of your character. It all boils down to memorization, muscle memory, adaptation. Honestly, the entire point of Street Fighter is the interesting aspect of the mind games between 2 players. It has the ruggedness of not a multiplayer game but some odd form of chess/board game appeal. As I played dozens of hours of this game I seem to realize it really does have a chess-like learning curve to all of these characters. As long as you put forth the effort into learning patterns and the characters mechanics (strength/weakness) and overcome all the mistakes you've been making as a casual player, this is a very rewarding game. Anyways, All I'm saying is if you're looking for a worthwhile fighting game I suggest you pick this up strictly to learn the fundamentals until Street Fighter V comes out. Also, Online play is very habitable. Pick it up before V comes out I promise you.. You won't regret it.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
laggy multiplayer online,
1. should not have been released if it needed a fix as capcom admits
2. fix still not here.
3. bs

Ultra Street Fighter IV
From an outsider's perspective, the differences between Street Fighter 4 and its three existing sequels must look marginal at best. The first game made its console debut back in 2009 and helped revitalise the fighting game genre. Super Street Fighter 4 surfaced a year later and added 10 new characters to the roster, but since then, the game-to-game differences have been tailored more towards the dedicated fans. Ultra Street Fighter 4 continues this tradition with five new characters, a trio of fundamental system changes and not so much as a story mode in sight.

If you're not the kind of player who spends hours learning combos in the training room, discusses the finer points of character match-ups on a regular basis and stays up till the crack of dawn watching the Top 8 duke it out at the yearly Evolution Championship Series, then the Street Fighter 4 series' consistent lack of single-player content will be a tough pill to swallow. But for those who view Street Fighter as a competitive fighting game that only truly makes sense when two minds are trying to outsmart each other, then Ultra can be seen as both curtain call from Capcom and the most substantial sequel since Super.

Of the new talent, Poison stands out as the easiest to get to grips with. Her lingering fireball and feet-first dragon punch mean she shares some shoto fundamentals with Ryu and Ken, but when you also consider her Rekka-like whip special and her command grab Ultra, it's clear that Poison isn't as orthodox as she initially seems. The larger than life Hugo, on the other hand, is about as heavy-handed as a grappler gets. His normal attacks have extremely limited combo potential, but if you can close the distance and land his wall-bouncing command grab, you can inflict severe damage.

New girl Decapre can combo into her air throw from her launcher. She can also use the new EX Red Focus to land an Ultra off her Rapid Dagger special.
If the fighting styles of a pink-haired cross-dresser and a gigantic wrestling simpleton don't sound like your thing, then the other new characters offer something a bit more technical. Elena returns from the Street Fighter 3 series with two far-reaching overhead attacks (must be blocked standing) and one frighteningly quick overhead special that can combo into respectable damage. In comparison, Rolento is more of a hit-and-run-style character with excellent mobility and lots of long-range pokes. He can quickly get out of trouble with his EX roll and his Pariot Sweeper Ultra will combo off anything stronger than a sneeze.

The last character on the guest list stands out for two reasons. Firstly, she wasn't previously playable in Street Fighter X Tekken or any other fighting game; secondly, she's the first new charge character to grace Street Fighter in what seems like forever. Indeed, Decapre may look like just another Shadaloo Doll with similar moves to Cammy, but once you actually take her bladed gauntlets out for a spin, you'll realise that she's fundamentally different. Her variable dash can be cancelled into her slide, dive kick, launcher or even one of two baits, and while most characters tend to have one standout Ultra, Decapre benefits from two.

Choosing which Ultra to incorporate into your game plan has been a core feature of Street Fighter 4 since Super, and now with the advent of the Ultra Combo Double system, you have the option to take both at the cost of raw damage output. Other additions to the core mechanics include the Delay Stand and Red Focus. The former prolongs the time it takes for your character to rise after a hard knockdown and is useful for escaping vortex pressure from the likes of Akuma, Cammy and Ibuki, while the latter lets you absorb any amount of hits in addition to giving just about every character a viable way to combo into their Ultra.

Six new stages have made the journey from Street Fighter X Tekken. That should decrease the odds of getting Volcanic Rim on random.
The fact that there's no way to elegantly highlight the impact of these changes without dipping into fighting game terminology just reinforces who Ultra is aimed at. The same is true of the extensive list of frame data tweaks that have been applied to the existing cast of 39. Evil Ryu has more health, Yun's EX lunge punch is (once again) advantageous on block and dragon punches are no longer safe after focus cancelling forwards. This might not mean a lot to casual players, but if you've invested the time with any one of these characters, then the chance to fight with a heavily revised set of rules is an offer that's hard to refuse.

There's no way of knowing where Ultra will take the competitive scene or how much the changes will affect the overall balancing, but if you feel like going back to the series' roots to see how much damage Vanilla Sagat could achieve off a simple Tiger Uppercut FADC into Ultra (it's over 600), then the new Edition Select has you covered. This isn't the first time that Capcom has put all past versions of each character into one game, but its inclusion suggests that this will be the last chapter in the Street Fighter 4 saga. Plus, there's nothing like picking the definitive version of your character when you're trying to prove a point.

Despite boasting a thriving community that streams regular tournaments and keeps the online competition flowing day and night, the Street Fighter 4 series has always been somewhat lacking when it comes to useful features. Ultra helps to remedy this with the option to record your matches while playing offline and change your button configuration while on the character select screen. Better yet, the Training mode has been expanded with a network simulation tool that lets you mimic input latency and a save state feature that makes practising your setups less time-consuming.

Poison's Ultras basically boil down to a kick in the crotch or a whip-assisted assault on the buttocks. Tough choice
The only feature I couldn't find was a way to reduce Elena's health so I could test out her Healing Ultra, but that's a minor grievance. On the flipside, the new Online Training mode lets you practise against another player without health bar limitations. There's also a revised Team Battle mode that pits two teams of three against each other with a shared health bar that carries over between matches. It feels a bit gimmicky when weighed against the other new features, but at least Capcom has added something that isn't focused purely on the one-on-one experience.

Taken as a package, Ultra is an easy recommendation for players who view Street Fighter as a sport. It offers highly refined gameplay married with a rich art style, and by acknowledging fan feedback in an effort to make a well-rounded game even more polished, Ultra feels like the work of a developer that's content to please its core audience rather than trying to grab everyone else's attention. That's rare, especially from a studio that was responsible for Resident Evil 6.

The only thing that holds this sequel back is the sense that it was made on a fairly tight budget. It's the little things, like the meagre choice of new" characters and the way that some of the new Ultra animations lack the dramatic flair of their predecessors. But with the development team's passion taking up most of the slack

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Problems that need fixing before you consider buying this:

1. Random freezes / lock-ups in game.  Offline or otherwise, not related to netcode.
2. Buggy netcode, frame-skips, lag and poor matching.
3. Players using bots online.
4. Players can disconnect from ranked matches with no consequence denying other players their legitimate wins.

Not recommended at this time.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Basically the counter-strike of fighting games. (As in skill and practice is rewarding + competitive)
Everyone seems the same until put into play, difference in skill stands out greatly. So much that you can feel when someone is bad. However, equally high-skilled players make for very intense fights.

Has many tactics and mechanics and such which sound complex but become second nature with practice.

Warning: GAME CAN EASILY MAKE YOU RAGE IF YOU'RE BAD, DON'T PLAY IF YOU'RE A BUTTHURT MONKEY WHO CAN'T ADAPT.

Dude...just get it...

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Do not buy this game.
Since the transition from GFWL to Steam the online is broken, matches are very laggy, matchmaking is much slower with many timeouts, and it's generally a very frustrating game, and now today I can't even play online, I get session creation failed" and can't search for games.

Capcom has gone really downhill

Ultra Street Fighter IV
This is absolutely unplayable online. There's amssive lag spikes even on green latency. while waiting for players in training mode there's even random lag spikes. this game garbo, no go

The Old Tree
You can beat the game in 10 minutes, but it is completely free so that is hardly something to complain about (although it would be nice to play more of this). The art is great and the music is relaxing, the puzzles are fairly easy but this game wasn't trying to be Myst.

If you are looking for a short game to pass some time and don't want anything too heavy and complicated this is well worth playing.

The Old Tree
I just really love these interactive experiences...kinda a sucker for em you could say. lol...This is totally worth the short bit out of your time to check this out...Someone worked very hard to create this artistic view of what the first few moments might be like for this little creature...I super enjoyed the creativity of the graphics and the interactions of the character on his little life adventure! :))...Reading another review I do agree that if you have your brightness turned down you will not be able to see very well what you need to do. (I did not have this issue as I prefer my particular settings at the brightest.)...So if you enjoy an artistic point of view, interactive short stories, and something rich in uniqueness and an immersive experience then I highly recommend trying out The Old Tree. *double thumbs up*

The Old Tree
Every once in a while you come across a game that is more than the sum of its parts yet defies traditional definition. Such is the case with The Old Tree, a minimal and simplistic point and click adventure that takes less than a minute to download, less than twenty minutes to complete, and leaves a lasting impression.

The gameplay has you clicking on interactive objects while the camera follows a small squid like alien through several unsettling and atmospheric scenes. You could say this is more interactive art than actual gameplay  it is a little creepy, and the games experimental nature is clear from its opening.

Yet this doesnt detract from the experience. The art is clearly the major draw for this game  and the minimal design aesthetic works well in its favour. There are several small puzzles that work on a light versus darkness factor, and this is usually very easily discovered. There really is no frustration. It feels familiar and yet different.

The sound is also minimal and simplistic, with an unnerving background drone-like soundtrack. It repeats often, but I think this also is to The Old Trees benefit. Im not sure what its trying to accomplish, but I feel urged on to completion and at the same time just slightly rattled.

While there really isnt anything to say for the games replayability or even for the games controls  The Old Tree is an easy recommend. Being available for free helps  but I feel its important to recommend games that are just a little different than the norm. And in that  The Old Tree really works.

7.0/10.

The Old Tree
This is a small, short Flash game that has you guide a cross between an apple, a snail and a squid to its destination.

There are a few of these small free flash games around, most notably Little Wheel"

The Old Tree
Short and very cute point and click adventure game designed in the style of Samorost / Botanicula / Machinarium. If you enjoyed those, then you will probably have a nice time playing this one too. If you have 15 minutes to spare, then try it, since this mini piece of art is definitely worth it!

P.S.: Another game developed by the same people is still in the greenlight phase, you can vote for it here: Tales of Cosmos.

The Old Tree
This review will be incredibly short as there is not much to say about this incredibly short title. So lets get this show on the road.

I'm not really sure what the game is about. You play as this little squid who hatches from an egg and makes his way up on top of a tree.

The game is a point and click game, but you don't move the character. The character moves on his own and you just clear the path so he can continue this journey.

The art style is incredible. It's this games best feature. It's fun to just to look around at the environment.

The game is also incredibly short clocking in at around 15 minutes long, so when you finish it don't expect a second playthrough.

Overall this game is a fun short experience. If you're looking for something while you're bored give this game a shot.

Final Rating:
7/10 - Play It

If you have sixteen minutes to spare and you enjoy a non-challenging point & click adventure then check out The Old Tree.  It's a true free-to-play game where you take the role of a young alien hatchling who is yearning for some adventure.

The Old Tree
Very short and simplistic, with much of the interaction dependent upon clicking on items that you can barely see.  I would have liked to see some actual puzzles and more interaction with our character, but as it is, if you'd like to relax for five to ten minutes, this is a charming way to pass the time.

The Old Tree
While it took me only thirteen minutes to play through The Old Tree, the impact it had on me, my state of mind, and my general outlook on life was greater than that.  I'd say it had an impact of at least a fifteen minute game, maybe even more.

I know the descriptions say its an alien, but I couldn't help but think it looked like an apple, and that it would probably fall pretty close to the tree, because, you know, proverbs.  No, I don't mean like in the bible, I mean in the colloquial homespun wisdom passed down by old people on rocking chairs.  Ever wonder just why these wise old folks are almost always found in rocking chairs?  I do.  I wonder if maybe they're not all that wise after all, if maybe for some reason we are all just programmed to accept anything said by someone in a rocking chair as being wise.  Now that I think about it, my grandmother would sit in her rocker and by golly it seemed like all she could do was spout pearls of wisdom, but I'll tell you this much.  As soon as she got up from that chair, bam, we put her  in a home.  Just kidding about the home, the truth is we had her put down.  Such is the way of our people.

So, yeah. it's well worth the time to play The Old Tree, it is a pretty game, little bit like something Amanita would do, also reminds me of The Plan.  I give it something out of something else.  Whatever, I can't do maths.

The Old Tree
The Old Tree is quite a charming and atmospheric little point and click adventure game. I'm not kidding when I say little either, the entire game took me 8 minutes to complete.
You have to guide a newborn alien(or at least that is what the game description claims it is) to it's end destination mainly by clicking on and elimination obstacles and generally helping it on it's way. The artwork is very subtle and understated not overpowering any scene and creating the right mood to allow the game to shine with it's relaxed slow pace.

If a nice relaxing 10 to 15 minutes of gaming is what you are looking for, then look no further that The Old Tree.

The Old Tree
More proof of concept than game, this short, free little point & click by small hungarian company Red Dwarf Games is a spinoff of their upcoming full release, Tales of Cosmos. You play as, well, probably some sort of small alien baby that wants to go places. Help it by observing the environment, clicking on things, removing obstacles and allowing it to move forward.

Without any explicit story, and with very basic puzzles in the vein of Samorost and Machinarium, there isn't really much that is particularly new or exciting here. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult if you are observative - but there's still a well made guide you can consult if you get stuck. Even so, this 15 minute experience is well designed and evocative, with beautiful art and a nice soundtrack - and if nothing else, it made me curious enough about Tales of Cosmos to download and play its demo. (Something less than an hour worth of puzzle and exploring in space, with some interesting ideas - worth trying out!)

If you have 10 spare minutes, you really have nothing to lose and may gain a few free smiles. Go help the little blob reach the big wide world!

The Old Tree
I did like this; short, sweet and unique, however I recommend raising the brightness on your screen if you have it low like I do because at a few points (particularly the water puzzle) I spent ten minutes clicking wildly everywhere, could see nothing I was actually interacting with and had to look up a walkthrough to see where they clicked to finish the game. Unfortunate when it's just a little game but again, may have been my fault for my screen settings.

The Old Tree
Less of a game and more of a 'mood piece',
the surreal setting was interesting, unpredictable/unexpected and had a somewhat relaxing vibe

Cons
---
The ending was rather anti-climatic

Earlier puzzles were not intuitive - required too much trial and error

Alien creature could've interacted more with the environment

Steam store banner/image did not represent the game well

Pros

The mood & atmosphere

Superior in every aspect to The Plan"

The Old Tree
This game is a tiny little thing, sweet and interesting enough to linger on the palate. It's brilliantly brief. You can play it here, or on the developer's website, and in this and other ways, it's kind of Samorost-y. It should take you 15 minutes or so to finish, though I put in more time than that because I tried playing it at work and ended up having to quit and start over later from home.

Basically, you play as the watcher who makes safe passage for a little hatchling who looks like a cross between an apple and a squidlet. You'll left-click a couple of times on likely spots, and when the coast is clear it will creep along to the next puzzle. There's atmospheric music, seamless execution, and an upbeat finish to this trifle. A properly-calibrated monitor will make this all much easier, since some of the puzzles are in murky dim light.

Totally fun, and made me happy.

The Old Tree
Had a longer campaign than TitanFall

10/10

The Old Tree
An absolutely exemplary instance of free gaming in practice.  Aesthetically gorgeous, genuinely wondrous - my forty-two year old mouth whoa"-ed an awful lot of times during its roughly ten to fifteen minute duration - and extraordinarily intuitive in its mechanics and puzzle-solving.

To all you other wannabe devs putting out short games which are free - or at the very least which SHOULD be free (!) - the benchmark which this incredibly simple yet incredibly beautiful game sets leaves you with NO EXCUSES not to do something of similar quality.  And at the risk of offending some of the parents out there who are no doubt keen to dub this a refreshingly "kid-friendly" Store page

The Old Tree
hmmm....I'm not totally sure what this game was really about, but it was a pleasant and short experience. An alien is born (hatched) and makes his/her/its way through a series of rooms and tunnels, sometimes with the help of a bee (or was it a fly?) on it's way to.....who knows. That isnt disclosed, lol.

Anyway, the puzzles werent challenging, but they were clever nonetheless. The graphics were polished and looked nice, and the representation of the apple/octopus hybrid looking alien was kind of cool. Why there were flies/bees (?), a microscopic robot, and a full sized squirrel/chipmunk/something similar, is beyond me. The reason for the elvators, bike pump and so on were equally mysterious. Nonetheless, it was what I would call a quaint experience. The final moment of the game was also quite nice.

All in all, for a ten minute free game, you probably wont find a better looking game with as good a puzzle mechanic.
I liked it well enough even if I have no idea why it exists or what purpose it truly serves, lol.

8/10

The Old Tree
I thought it was a mutated apple but then it's an alien baby.
I thought it just want to find it way to the top of the tree and get pollen (because the bee/firefly is your friend) but then it just want to find his way out to nowhere.

For 15 minutes, my whole life is a lie.

The Old Tree
Not much to say here...  Very short and it's a bizzare 15 mins.

OverviewGameplay: Artfully done point and click adventure.
Graphics: Great - I loved the art and is really the only reason you should check it out. I hope this dev does more games done in this style... maybe make the next one a little longer, because really, I want to see more!
Sound: Decent... Music is drone-ish and the sound effects blend nicely with it.
Controls: Just point and click - not much more to it.
Replayability: Sadly NONE! You'll play it for 15 - 20 mins and you might be like whoa" for those few mins and you'll unistall it but it's free... so it's worth checking out. You have nothing to lose except 15 - 20 mins which you were going to burn on video games anyways...
Overall: "Worth Checking Out!"[/list][/code]"

The Old Tree
If one is observant enough, they can find many interactive short animations disguised as (Flash) games on the internet. Even Steam has a few, The Old Tree being one of them.

This product follows the journey of a squid-like creature  freshly hatched from its egg  through a series of corridors built into a large tree. While there are a few elements which may be classified as very lightweight puzzles, The Old Tree is more of a 10-15 minute long animated journey than an actual game.
Is the journey worth it at least? If you like silent short animations that rely on their imagination (think of something like a very simple Amanita Design game), then yes, absolutely, itll be a memorable experience that wont even take much of your time.

The Old Tree
Thought the thing was an apple.
10/10

The Old Tree
Another one of the artsy games on Steam. It does this well. Just a warning: contrary to many of the other games on Steam, it's not exciting (it's not supposed to be, so if you're looking for some action-packed adventure, find another game). However, as one who appreciates things like this and further proof that video games are an up-and-coming art medium, it gets a thumbs up from me. :)

The Old Tree
This masterful piece of art is without a doubt a beatiful symbol of the progression through childhood and ascension to adulthood.
The simple yet fascinating puzzles represent real life struggles and challenges that are often difficult in the present but simple in retrospect.
The journey through the phases of life are captured and blended seamlessly through background cues. Recurring themes such as the elevator are likely symbolic of similar real world themes with staying power.
Often times the puzzles result in the destruction of environment in order to progress, akin to the difficult choices we often must make- opportunity cost is not free.
But this game is.

The Old Tree
Super Short but fun and very cute. Some parts can be a little hard to figure out.

The Old Tree
Simple,short,cute point & click game. Simply amazing!

The Old Tree
download ->play 15 minute -> uninstall
Good game but it have a low playable time.
we can only end this game under 15 minutes,
if this game had a more chapter it will be good.

The Old Tree
I got to make soup
10/10 would cook again
but no really I did enjoy this short little game it was fun and simple with a minor challenge.
The look of the game was beautiful to me I guess I just like the general feel of it.
All in all it's a good game I recommend this game.

The Old Tree
Download this? YES!

The Old Tree
It's a cute, short game. I like it. :3

The Old Tree
A little fellow needs your help to reach a certain place. All he needs is ten minutes of your time.
He promises to be quiet, he'll follow your instructions and patiently wait for you to figure out what needs to be done.
You won't have an hard time helping him and there will be music   gentle music   to accompany the journey of you two.

And if you happen to feel sad, this journey will mend some of your wounds.
At least, it did it for me.




The Old Tree
Its not a very long game but its easy to finish with many hidden meanings to the story. It was enjoyable if you're looking for  a quick 15 minute game, more or less in time.

The Old Tree
The Old Tree is a free to play adventure point&click game that is pretty cute and fun to play through. There's no tutorials and it's all up to you to find out how to finish the game, some puzzles were a bit tricky to understand, but overall it's a very easy and short game.

You don't lose anything trying out this game, it's free and it doesn't take any space at all on your PC. So if you like short point&click games, so ahead and play it, it's pretty good!

The Old Tree
short puzzle game with weird but cool art style.
and since its free, definately recommanded.


The Old Tree
A very short game.  Maybe 15 minutes.  But it's free, so who cares?  (I only mention this because I've noticed some people REALLY do care.)

It's fun!  A good style going, appropriate soundtrack, easy but not completely trivial puzzles...  A solid way to pass a bit of time.

The Old Tree
The Old Tree. The game where you play as a green apple with legs. It is the most hardcore puzzle game I have ever played!

No hand holding!

No dialogue to tell you what to do!

No quest objective!

Challenging enemies!

No respawn!

A true next gen experience!

Nah, Im just kidding. But honestly, you are like a green apple with legs o_O Took me 15 minutes to beat this game and I have no clue what I just played. You just got to try it for yourself (recommend)

The Old Tree
Interesting art style.++

The Old Tree
Very nice game worth plying.
And it is free :)

The Old Tree
Cute, simple, free game

The Old Tree
A free, point and click puzzler that can be completed in around 10 minutes.

- Lovely artwork & music.

- Cute character

- No particular story, only one goal which remains ambiguous

Worth a single play through.


The Old Tree
still waiting for a multiplayer version :D

The Old Tree
Cute Game, short. 

Couldn't take screenshots because Steam Overlay was not working.
Tip: Turn off the lights when playing The Old Tree".

The Old Tree
I have bouight multiple copies of Machinarium and Botanicula for my very young grand kids as they love the graphics, the non-narrative format, and the music. The puzzles are secondary to them. I help them complete the puzzles so they can keep the story moving. They love to verbalize their own stories to match the action. It's thrilling for me to listen to their imaginative accounts of what they think is going on in the story.  I have Steam accounts for the three familes and Steam is the perfect vehicle for me to add the games I think they will like and are in the problem-solving, imaginative genre.
I would have paid $10 for The Old Tree, for all three families, so they could have another quality game in their Steam accounts. When I visit the families, instead of a bedtime story, the kids want to huddle together around games like The Old Tree. And so do I. I highly recommend The Old Tree and thank the developers for making it available at no cost but I do think they should charge something for the game.

The Old Tree
A very nicely done short indie game. The artwork alone is worth taking the 20 seconds to download, and less than 15 minutes to complete. Especially when it's a free game.

The Old Tree
While it is not a challenging puzzle game at all, it is very calming and nice to play.

The Old Tree
This is the greatest 10-minute Flash game I have ever played! Definitely 10/10!
In this game you'll lead a small alien baby through different obstacles. I can't tell you more without spoiling your gameplay. I can only say that game controls include just left mousebutton clicks, so don't get confused if you think you end up in a situation without any exit. No more words, just go and play it! :)
Graphics: Very good
Sound: Very good
Idea: Very good
Have fun!

P.S. And I don't mind playing the sequel (if it exists).

The Old Tree
my cute alien octopus child :')

The Old Tree
The Old Tree is an atmospheric puzzle game. As a newly born alien, instinctively walk the strange world that surround you towards an uncertain destination, solving puzzles to continue forward.

Pros: The eerie and the unknown meet with beautifully handdrawn-like graphics and atmospheric music. You have absolutely no idea what you're trying to accomplish, just that you must go on, bypass the obstacles that block you, and proceed. The puzzles are simple, but they are only obvious once you've figured them out. The world feels utterly alien to you, as it would to a new born baby alien. There is no fighting, to violence, no dialog and no age barriers to this game, just the feeling of discovery.

Cons: The game is very, very short, 15 minutes tops. There is no mistake you could make, nothing that would require you to restart, and no progression or branching path that would entitle a form of replay value. Most puzzles involves an extremely obviously click, maybe two.

Verdict:  - It's up to you

This game was made with heart, with care. It's quick, it's free, there is no reason why anyone wouldn't give it a try, if only to see it for themselves. You may think you just wasted 15 minutes, or you may spend the next hour or so pondering its meaning and the undefined mood it left you in. All I can recommend is to just...see for yourself!


This was just my opinion.

If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

The Old Tree
A really short and experimental point and click adventure game but the art,soundtrack and atmosphere are quite good.i enjoyed it. I will check the developers new game Tales of Cosmos" when they will release it."

The Old Tree
I feel like its intended to mean something, but really it's just a 4-legged creature that has telekenesis who can cook.

Good art though and sound effects.

The Old Tree
This is an interesting one.

It's more like an interactive short story than a game" in the traditional sense. You solve some puzzles to help a little blop advance through the story

Rush Bros.
Since playfire rewards made me play this piece of... worthless software again, it reminded me just how terrible this game is, so I thought why not review this and help potential victims avoid it.

If I had to describe this game in one sentence, it would be - demands perfection, doesn't offer precision.

The game tries to be an electro version of super meat boy, and while the music is fine and likable, the controls are just awful, everything feels very stiff, and unresponsive. The levels are by far the worst thing in this game, they are not built for speedrunning or fluent platforming at all, in fact I think they created a set of levels that were perfect for a game of this type, and then they just inverted them totally to make them this bad, they are just atrocious. Also levels sort of react" to the music - traps spring up quicker when faster music is playing... trust me it makes things even worse when you are achievement hunting as the ingame playlist is randomised and you can't lock it to a certain track that would actually allow a human being to beat a level in time for an achievement. Another HUGE minus would be that every time you restart a track

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros Oh my, where to begin.

Its incredibly rare that I come across a game so absolutely, irredeemably awful Im forced to leave it after a mere twenty minutes. Thats a shockingly short amount of time to spend on a video game, free or not. And yet, Rush Bros manages to be that rare kind of awful. I honestly think that the developer was actively trying to scare people away from their game. The menu alone is enough indication of that.

Let me break down the basics of just what exactly Rush Bros is for you. You are one of two Rush Bros, your goal being to get from one end of a 2D level to the other. So, yes, its a platformer. But wait, theres more! The games claim to fame (can we even call it that?) is that your music library (or, if youre too lazy to actually point the game at your music files like me, the set of techno that comes packaged in) determines the way the levels play out and react. Cool, right? Yeah, that sounds great! I get to listen to my music, and it changes how the game works! Wow!

Well, unfortunately, very wrong. This feature is barely used for anything but a spike or two popping up and out of the floor every few beats, or a lever that needs to be pulled on the beat (a mechanic which, by the way, is very poorly explained). Its incredibly lame, and it means that Rush Bros is nothing more than a  platformer with some funky tunes.

Now that weve established Rush Bros is completely devoid of originality, lets talk about the graphics. Theyre bad. And I mean really ing bad. Once again, it manages to be that one breed of terrible that not only assaults your eyes with character animations which look to have been haphazardly assembled in flash by a sixth-grader who just figured out how key-framing and looping works, but it also has the audacity to apply filters to the entire image which, after only five minutes, will leave you with a piercing headache. Think Max Payne 3s most egregious examples of cutscene visual tomfoolery, except constant, always there to taunt your eyes with what could have been clarity instead of a bloom-addled, disco-infused fever dream.

Oh, and of course, the controls. Or rather, what controls? This game has controls? Couldve fooled me, because the first 10 minutes of my time with it was spent trying to figure out why the hell I couldnt move my character around the screen, at all. Well, as it turns out, unlike most other (well put-together) games, Rush Bros completely ignores the fact that youve plugged in a controller when you actually begin playing it (despite the fact it works 100% properly in the menus you use to actually take you to the play portion of the game). Yes, you have to manually bind the controller to the actions you want your character to complete despite the fact it tells you right from the get-go Hey, we made this game for controllers! You should use one! Well, are you sure you made this game for controllers, XYLA Entertainment? Because from where I stand, that really doesnt seem to be the case.

Once you actually get running, it quickly dawns on you that everything about the running, jumping, positioning, and wall-grabbing in this game is completely off. Jumps seem to inconsistently propel you varying distances, movement is so floaty its impossibly difficult to land on a jump pad that takes up nearly 20% of the screen real-estate, and the speed at which your character slides down walls when he grabs them will have you wondering if hes composed of primarily molasses. I cannot tell you how many times in the mere 20 minutes I spent with this steaming turd I died due to the horrific controls.

Oh, and dont even get me started on how hard it is to actually start playing the game in the first place. I still havent been able to figure out how any of it works, since when trying to select the singleplayer stages, I kept getting requests to join the games of others. And you know what, I dont blame those who spammed me with the intrusive offers, either. Hell, Im sure I did the same, because despite the fact that Im very obviously trying to play singleplayer through the singleplayer-labelled Arcade menu option, the game seemed to love pairing me up with total randies from the boundless realm of The Internet. Im still not sure if I managed to get into the singleplayer at all, actually, seeing as how every time I finished a stage the game showed me the statistics of an unnamed, invisible second player who never seemed able to finish the level before me. Or maybe the game was just unable to identify that I was playing alone, which seems far more plausible.

Credit where credits due, the in-game soundtrack (read: not the one you import) is actually pretty good. I enjoyed the techno tunes included, and must admit its mostly because of them I even stuck around long enough to get past the first few levels (which are only about 30 seconds each, by the way). However, whatever algorithm the developer is using to apply the beat to the in-game geometry is flaky at best, since it always seems to speed-up or slow-down completely at random. Hey guys: if the feature youve touted as revolutionary and unbelievably innovative for the platforming scene doesnt even work with the music you tested and included it with, I think there may be an issue somewhere. But hey, Im no programmer, so what do I know right?

To sum things up, this game is awful. Why I even dedicated a whole 1010 words to it is actually beyond even myself. Stay away from it (not that you honestly ever intended to buy it) and spend that cash elsewhere. Im just glad I got this smear for free.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros attempts to marry the minimalistic, highly difficult platforming of games such as Super Meat Boy and I Want To Be The Guy, with the music generating gameplay of Beat Hazard or Audiosurf while putting a heavy focus on multiplayer. Unfortunately it fails abysmally at being comparable in even one of these aspects, with almost every feature going against the basic concepts it tries to establish, resulting in a game that I could barely force myself to play.

The problems with the platforming star with the controls. Your character feels as if he's made of putty, plodding along at anything but a rush and sticking to walls like glue. This is a problem firstly because the entire game is based around speedruns which become almost impossible to pull off when movement is akin to running molasses and are you're character is constantly getting stuck on the environment. Secondly, because the level designs haven't been tweaked to compensate for this slowness, with much faster hazards and gaps that are virtually impossible should you miss a speed or double jump powerup.

On top of being frustrating to navigate, the levels or to be more accurate, tracks are chock full of tedious backtracking which often sends you all the way to the start of the level after you grab a key or open a door. Checkpoints are also a point of contention as there is no rhyme or reason as to their placement or even inclusion. Some tracks feature nearly endless checkpoints before every obstacle, others without a single one to speak of which needless to say vastly changes the difficulty level.

Although it's clearly the main focus, Rush Bros manages to somehow be even worse in multiplayer games do to the completely unbalanced powerups that randomly pop up during play. Once again it goes against the core speedrunner mentality, instead resorting to unnecessary gimmicks that cheapen the thrill of winning a match.

The final aspect is the use of custom soundtracks to change and augment tracks, but it is so inconsequential and often unnoticable that it's hardly worth mentioning. The actual music that is included is of a suitably low quality, and the graphics are incohesive with each background seemingly plucked at random from the user generated reject of other games.

I had high hopes for Rush Bros, and even after playing it feel the concept of a music generated platformer has a lot of potential, but the execution here falls apart with every lazy step it takes. Though it's becoming exceedingly rare for me to play a game where I cannot find even a single redeeming quality to latch onto, but Rush Bros truly does nothing of note and there is no reason I would advise anyone to play it, not even for novelty's sake.

Rush Bros.
Upon starting the full retail version of the game you are greeted with a EULA for what is stated to be the DEMO VERSION of the game that includes some truly pernicious terms of service and also some plainly rude language telling the customer that if you try any funny business you will incur a bunch of legal costs through arbitration, also it is unclear about the scope and nature of the data collection the game will be doing or why a simple platformer needs to store any personal information about me on an out of country server in the first place.

I don't think I have ever seen a EULA that looks quite this bad before. So I was like is it just me

Rush Bros.
The concept intrigued me, but the execution fails like mad in this game, where the order of the day is less on platformer skill and more on memorization - if you do not a) locate and b) precisely follow the 'correct' route every stage, you are not hitting the time trial goals, and if you're not playing to hit the time trial goals, there is, as far as I can tell, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to this game. Aside from playing against a friend (or random people who can drop-in from Steam, which is a decent enough feature), there's really no reward or drive to keep playing that I can tell. All(? there are 47 I want to say) stages are unlocked from the beginning and... I dunno. I wanted this to be good and it let me down.

Rush Bros.
not worth the money for this game. the controls mess up all the time, really difficult and repetive levels. do yourself a favor and buy another musical game is that more fun other than this. this is cancer right here, atleast the music is good. but this is horrible.

Rush Bros.
Avoid this game. Laggy controls and repetitive levels. Do yourself a favour and get a Bit Trip Runner game instead.

Rush Bros.
thank god it was free.

Rush Bros.
Rush Brothers is a side scroller  la Knytt series with a knack for speed and precise platforming, a mix that sometimes performs well, other times lets you wanna throw your controller/keyboard off your room with the whole console or computer.

The game has been marketed as a competitive musically-driven" platformer and I could agree with the former adjective since the Steam multiplayer allows "challengers" to hop in your game and play

Rush Bros.
Pure frustration,good concept but not good enough execution,randomized traps that depends on music without any discernable pattern.

some levels demand perfect execution of moves,irrelevant of traps/music,too bad the controls are not provided for it since it does at best 90% of the commands issued,and that 10 really does matter.

In the end,if it wasn't for playfire I wouldn't even play it again.

Rush Bros.
If Super Meat Boy and Jet Grind Radio had twins, they would be the Rush Bros. This precision platformer starring two feuding brothers doesnt just test your jumping skills, but does so while throwing a ton of bright colors at you and using an awesome soundtrack to make every death seem like a good thing. While you may want to be frustrated as a gamer, as a person, you cant help but be glad since it lets you listen to more music! Its a brilliant way to make a game fun at its most challenging moments.Its classification as a racing/platformer may seem a bit confusing at first, but when you play the game, the term makes a lot of sense. Rush Bros. is a time trial-focused game with a side focus on beating stages with as few deaths as possible. Obstacles in your path arent just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else youll add precious seconds to your time. Its always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so thats never an issue. Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits  so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the games environments, which tend to be bathed in color.

Not a bad game per se, but nothing particularly good about it, either. Platforming is pretty basic, controls seem a bit off, visuals are nice but not really outstanding, being able to use custom music is nice but the stage elements that depend on the music don't always work well with that. This game is bundled often and I'd say go for it in a cheap bundle, but I wouldn't buy it on its own.

Rush Bros.
Music game that has nothing to do with music...
Without power-ups it's unplayable.

Rush Bros.
If Super Meat Boy and Jet Grind Radio had twins, they would be the Rush Bros. This precision platformer starring two feuding brothers doesnt just test your jumping skills, but does so while throwing a ton of bright colors at you and using an awesome soundtrack to make every death seem like a good thing.

While you may want to be frustrated as a gamer, as a person, you cant help but be glad since it lets you listen to more music! Its a brilliant way to make a game fun at its most challenging moments.Its classification as a racing/platformer may seem a bit confusing at first, but when you play the game, the term makes a lot of sense. Rush Bros. is a time trial-focused game with a side focus on beating stages with as few deaths as possible. Obstacles in your path arent just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else youll add precious seconds to your time. Its always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so thats never an issue.

Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits  so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the games environments, which tend to be bathed in color. Beyond the usual things like space-themed and forest backdrops, there are even some with creepy faces all around them. Theres no sense of sameness with the look of levels, and the use of little color trails for power-ups only adds to the visual overload.

I personally loved the game, but WARNING! only play with a controller as it feels alot better and more smooth.

Rush Bros.
Of fun game the music really gets you in the mood to play this worth playing :P you can even import your own songs O.o

Rush Bros.
Not worth $9.99. Anyone interested in this 45-stage obstacle race course game should buy it in the Indie Gala Intersteller bundle for $1 like I did. Not worth a cent more.

Rush Bros.
Basically, the game is simple and based a bit on skill and reflexes. In addition, the music is also not bad but that's a matter of taste. The maps are well designed and the control you get used very easily. Multiplayer, local co-op mode, steam cloud, and controller-support is offered. For 10  a bit expensive but if it is on offer can afford each.
My conclusion: Rush Bros can be a lot of fun, but it is a game which is not too versatile.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros. Is basically what it says in the game desc. A fast pasted platformer. Although I normally avoid platformers because they cause rage most the time to me and others I got this due to me meeting the dev. of this game. He also said there would be a hat with it in tf2 called the fuzzy wub wub that never came out, o well. Anyways this games level design changes with whatever music you put in it, causing some obstacles to move faster or slower depending on what music is playing and when the base drops in the song. Of course like i said that does cause lots of confusion and makes it so you normally die 15~100 times depending on map and if there is a checkpoint system in the map you chose. Luckily deaths are fast and they spare no time throwing you back out there to continue. All in all this game gives you enough fun for its price and its fun to play with friends and share your music with them. I'd give it... 6.75/10 I think. Gives you enough fun for your buck. (I'd recomend getting it while it is on sale during winter or summer. Although it is fun I can't see to many people playing it over 4 hours.)

Awhile back I wrote a review for this game. I thought about it and then I thought, Wow

Rush Bros.
The game is pretty normal and there are many games that are basically the same but the graphics are amazing and the levels designs are pretty sweet . Also , there are some nice musics in the game where you can listen even when you are not playing the game . If you like those type of relaxation game , this is one of those game but i suggest buying it during discount as the regular price is a bit high .

Save your money. Controls are terrible and the gameplay is boring. If I got this for free, I'd feel overcharged.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros is a pretty addicting race platformer, which lets you race against friends or other people on the internet. It is challenging, but far from impossible.

First of, this game has a main gimmick: music. You can import your own music into this game or just play one of the music within the game as background music for the stage. The fun thing is that Rush Bros applies your music to the stage. Some obstacles, including spikes and pillars, go along with the beat of your song. That means that it can be used in your advantage or in your disadventage. When you are playing online though, the opponent has his own music, and therefore also his own obstacles.

As I've said before, Rush Bros is a challenging game. But that is mainly for the achievement hunters or the competitive online players. Whenever you die, you respawn just before the point of death. You have infinite lives, so you don't have to worry about dieing. This also goes for online play.

Me, being a speedrunner, absolutely love the stage designs and eventually reach the goal as fast as possible. I myself do not care much for achievements, but it's a nice aim nonetheless.

However, this game is mainly for online play. If you don't have anyone to play with, this game is less fun than it is supposed to be. Also, you might want to use a controller, as it is clearly not made for keyboard use.

Rush bros is a fun and entertaining game, but I would advice buying this game when it is on sale. Otherwise, it is not worth it.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros is a interesting platformer with a couple of cool concepts. But tries too much by using conflicting concepts. The game would be better as two separate games that only use the concepts that support each other together. Because it tries to be a speedrunner where you can run against each other or alone against time. But also have different styles of level designs almost each level. Most levels you need to backtrack for keys. That's fine but not when you're speed running. The randomness of the level reacting on the music is also goes against the speedrunning. And you have some trail and error dead traps in the level design.

The controls feel a bit off in the beginning and I think it's because of the stickiness when you wallslide. In most games where you can walljump the wallslide is fast but here it's really slow. And it's counter intuitive to the speed running. It's really annoying and I don't get why they made it like this.

I really want this game to live up to it's potential. The music is great and the art style is pretty cool. It just isn't working as a speed running game. If you just play too casually complete the levels it's fine. But the whole racing against each other and time just doesn't work for this game because the developers wanted too much. It could have been an amazing platformer like Super Meat Boy or Electric Super Joy.

Rush Bros.
Godawful piece of  game.
It's super boring.
The music feature makes no sense at all.
There is no purpose.
It's buggy as hell, keep getting stuck.
Lags when loading songs 25%-30% of the time.

Just stay away from this garbage.
You are warned.

Rush Bros.
This game would be awesome . . . if the gameplay follow. When you see graphics, musics, you think of a Meat Boy like game, very fast, you never stop. Here you never stop, but because you feel so slow ! Jump even has a little second before actually seeing the character jumping ! In a game like that, you cannot mess whit the gameplay at this point =/

Rush Bros.
Absolute crap platformer masquerading around as a time-attack super meat boy clone. Moving obstacles change speed depending on whether you're moving or not, and controls are unresponsive, making your character seem sluggish and unpolished. Rush Bros. feels more like a beta release than a full game.

Oh, and who sets online versus mode as the default on first install? (turn Accept Challengers" off to play single-player mode)"

Rush Bros.
After playing the game more to give it further analysis here are my thoughts.

The game is okay" but not worth anything more than $2 because of how boring and stale it feels. It often tries to tote itself as a precision platformer but fails to deliver on adequate platforming. The jumping feels awkwardly clunky and more often than not you will end up falling because it doesn't recognise input for more than 100ms which is unacceptable. The game falls off and the level design is interesting but the platforming mechanics feel weighted and not precise at all. My biggest gripe with the game is that it often tried to get me to play against other players in a race before I have even played a level

Rush Bros.
I like the idea of the game, and there isn't really much else out there specifically designed for head-to-head racing like it is, but I super cannot get into how movement in it feels. The controls are at least consistent, but everything feels weighted and timed wrong to me. I kept going for a while to get used to it, and it did get a little better, but it's more like less wrong at this point, not actually right. The levels I played did seem reasonably well designed for running through them once you get to know them though, and the soundtrack is great, so there's that.

Rush Bros.
We spent 2 hard, long years developing Rush Bros. and our biggest weakness right now is word-of-mouth. We're trying to do everything we can to make Rush Bros. known. It's a hard-core racing game which can be enjoyed by both casual players and dedicated speed-runners. The philosophy behind the game is: Play the way you want to. When you're on a playground you don't normally declare the rules before everyone jumps in a sandbox. By the time you get there somebody is probably already making sande castles. Then somebody screams The Floor is Lava" and things get really interesting. Rush Bros. is themed around this kind of play- this more organic make-up-the-rules-as-you-go-along kind of play. This is a hard concept for some people to understand because it's something more natural / organic and less structured. If anything else Rush Bros. is an experiment with how you can allow your players to design the rules for how the game is played while they are playing it. You choose what levels to play on

Rush Bros.
I'm pretty disappointed.
This game looks and feels like a flash game.
Now, I can get along fine with that, but the problem is that as a platformer, the physics feel like a flash game aswell.
The jumps feel linear and unresponsive, just like a flash game (even when playing with a controller).
Which is the biggest sin for a game like this. Jumping doesn't feel like it should in platformers.

On the plus side, it has great music, but thats about it.


Rush Bros.
Solid platformer with good controls, fun to play while in a Skype call with your opponent. The music in the game's quite good too.

Note: To everyone complaining that the achievements are too hard: they're supposed to be. That's why it's called an achievement, you have to achieve something hard to be rewarded, instead of being spoonfed worthless messages in easy games.

Rush Bros.
The only reason I bother to download and play Rush Bros was to get the achievements. A lot of them seemed simple enough. Finish this level in under a certain amount of time to unlock the achievement and what not. What I didn't realize is that in order to get the achievement, a person would have to be nearly perfect to obtain it which was made difficult by the fact that the obstacles were set to the rhythm of the music in the game making it extremely inconsistent. This made achievement hunting more unbearable and annoyed me to no end when the controls in game were unresponsive at times. If anything, Rush Bros tries to copy Super Meat Boy and the like with a musical element added which ruins the overall gameplay. I'd avoid this title unless you like dubstep or want to give this to someone you want to really annoy.

Overall Score: 3/10

Rush Bros.
Fun at start, but gets boring quickly.

6/10

Rush Bros.
This game is nifty, and can be fun in short bursts, though I can't stand to play it for more than 10 minutes at a time. Might be worth getting while on sale or as a freebie, but I wouldn't bother with full price. It claims to use your own music for gameplay, and in a sense it does, but it only uses it very minimally. I give it a resounding Meh.""

Rush Bros.
Edit from the future: A patch came out that said they've fixed the achievement bugs. I don't want to play this game anymore, but at least they fixed the stability issues that I've complained about in this review.

Original review:

===

First the good stuff: amazing music. I would recommend paying for the OST.

Now for the bad: Its buggy. I have been trying to get the No death" achievement on the "Spikes Everywhere" level. It is hard enough

Rush Bros.
Sorry but no. The level design I found terrific, it's very sonicish"

Rush Bros.
Control of the character is awkward, pace feels slow (in a racing game). Unlink most other custom music rythm hybrids (Audiosurf, Beat Hazard) it doesn't seem to change anything gameplay wise. What you end up with is a mediocre stylized platformer, of which the indie game scene has a nearly infinite supply of.

Rush Bros.
This game seemed like something good on paper, jumping around to music and competing with other players, however about 5 minutes after purchase I realised this game is a bug infested waste of time. It tries to mimic other great platformers however it horribly fails to do so by giving you and un-fun and minimalistic challenge of running across an empty space without power ups only to get a better score than another player. On top of that the game is filled with bugs, I often found myself challenging other players to a race when I clearly selected that I wanted to race alone. This game in a short summary is a waste of money and a big disappointment.

Rush Bros.
if you're looking for a hard super meat boy-like game with decent tracks (some are pretty good) and colorful, well-drawn levels backgrounds , you can give rush bros a try ,
although it has one of the worst things for a platforming game - laggy controls , it still manages to be challenging enough and dare i say satisfying once you master a level and finish it in a new record triggering that achievement notification (managed to get 21 achivements through 3 days for playfire rewards, if i play it more i'm sure i can get at least +40) ,

give it a try if you're into rage, hard games , maybe not with the 10$ price tag so wait for a sale (in case you haven't grabbed it for free at GMG promotion)

Rush Bros.
I would have expected the controls to be better on a game like this.

Pretty good (customizable) music, a good game idea, and a pretty cool art theme unfortunately didn't make up for the controls feeling a little sloppy and haphazard.

Great concept, but the game is pretty unforgiving and frustrating, leaving me unlikely to pick the game up again.

Rush Bros.
The music changes beat too quickly and rapidly, making for good techno music but terrible platforming.

Rush Bros.
The creators of Rush Bros manage to completely miss the basic concepts of their own game, while managing to make it look somewhat pretty and have a good soundtrack. They fail to make the platforming fun or even feel right. It seems like they spent very little time getting the feel for the game correct. The animations are also fairly poor. Even the colorful visuals and music can't make up for it what is really just not a fun game to play. If I paid $10 for this game I would be pretty . In fact, I got this game for free as part of a Play Fire Rewards promotion and technically got paid for it, but I am still not happy with my decision to play this game.

If you want to play a game that does the Racing-Platformer concept correctly, I would suggest SpeedRunners.

Rush Bros.
I saw many videos and trailers of this gmae and thought hell yeah

Rush Bros.
I really, really tried to like this game. The idea of a platformer that you play to your music sounds good on paper, but I feel that Rush Bros. doesn't deliver on it's cool-sounding concept. If a game has the option to play with my music more often than not I will choose to do so. In Rush Bros. however, unless you're playing anything other than electro house you're probably going to have a hard time moving through a level since obstacles will either focus on A) the back beat B) the vocals or C) some other element to the song that isn't made readily apparent to you. This results in either trying the level with a different song or the default music (which works fine, btw) and I feel that's very poor design on the developer's part. Speaking of poor design, some of the levels in this game are just terrible. This game excells when you're going fast and dodging obstacles and there are quite a few levels where you are put in a maze and have to find keys to progress almost in a puzzle-platform kinda way. Being forced to slow down and think your way through a level wouldn't be so bad if the wall jumping didn't feel as sticky as it does, which sucks since in the puzzle levels there are tons of walls for you to stick to for whatever reason. Again, I really wanted to like this game but some of the core parts of this game just don't click with me.

Rush Bros.
The MOST IMPORTANT thing in a game like this is how responsive the controls are. The nput lag just kills any chance of this game being fun.

Rush Bros.
Avoid it! i took it free from GMG and at least got 3 cards, LOL

Rush Bros.
Horrible game, probably one of  the worst platformers I've ever played and that's saying something. even though I got it for free, I feel scammed by the low quality it presents, the controls are quite clumsy as hell and the background music ends up being monotonous and boring incredibly fast. Don't waste your money or your time here, do yourself a favor and get super meat boy instead of this crap. completely unfun.

Rush Bros.
Honestly Rush Bros. looked really promissing when I saw the trailer and I was really excited to play it but after getting my hands on it I can safely say that pretty much the only thing the game has going for it is the soundtrack and even that may not appeal to some people. Visuals, level design and animation quality is something to be desirable on Rush Bros and story is pretty much non existent. The game might be fun if you play with someone else but playing it alone, as I did, will probably be a waste of your time. Even if you're a fan of platformers I doubt that you'll have fun with this one on yourself, playing with a friend might give you somewhat a good time and probably some giggling when someone dies but I honestly don't recommend Rush Bros. in any circunstances.

Why So Evil
I've played some ridiculously hard games in my time, but none with controls that feel luck-based, obstacles in almost every level that can either desync or become luck-based to dodge. One of the most amazing things about this game is that I'm at Level 49/50 on Practice Mode with around 2794 deaths. Why on practice mode you may ask? Well if I wasn't I'd probably have 10000-100000 deaths, because everytime you die in the other modes you get sent back to Level 1 and there's some ridiculous level design in this game and you will always be fighting the controls. The graphics are awful maybe just barely hitting the PSX mark and with bare bones textures at that. Nothing in this game looks visually appealing in anyway shape or form and it's using a barebones Unity Engine that doesn't even work properly. I literally think with all this it's pretty much impossible to beat the game on anything other than Practice Mode. For anyone curious where I gave up or why I gave up  here you go:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87l9Eisr5t4

Why So Evil
Why We Can't Have Nice Things, or Tragedy of the Commons: Steam Edition

When Why So Evil was on Steam Greenlight, I voiced my concerns politely, but clearly. The developers did little to assuage my concerns, but I am nothing if not forgiving, so I decided to pick this title up and give it a fair shake. This game goes to show exactly what purpose Steam Greenlight served, because now that the gate has been torn asunder and the guardian slain, all manner of hellspawn issueth. And I don't mean in a good way.

This game has a 3D take on the Super Meat Boy style of challenge: unforgiving difficulty with unrelenting learning curve. I ended my first playthrough at Level 9, and I feel like, even in my short time with the game, I got a fair feel for how I'm going to like it long term.

First, the good: The designers show a good head for iteration. Each level (from 1 to 9 admittedly) showed decent improvement challenge-wise from the last. The game was, indeed, challenging, but with a game like this, being unable to beat it is not a fair argument for it being TOO challenging. For now, I will say that I got to level 9, and that level was too frustrating for me to beat at this time.

Now, the bad. The user interface on this game is bare bones, to say the least. Think Air Control"

Why So Evil
Clearly a first attempt at making a videogame.  This looks like someone's homework.

Why So Evil
Well, that's a very simplistic game idea with messed up controls making it very hard. No idea why they called it 'Why So Evil' instead it should be 'Why Bother At All'.

Why So Evil
Another game that claims to be incredibly difficult, but instead just has poor controls.

I got to wave 27, I'd highly suggest staying away from this game unless you are a ego maniac.

Why So Evil
I got this game for free.
I want my free back.



Why So Evil
More words below, but a simple list first:
-Bad controls
-Bad game design
-Bad UI
-Bad textures
-One looping song (at least untill level 30ish)
-Game breaking bugs in some levels (granted some of them will actually help you)
-Holding a direction while dieing will cause you to have to let go and then repress to start moving again... with instant respawns, this can kill you again.
+The concept behind it could have worked, if more time and effort was used.
+A toaster could probably run it, if you set the graphics to the lowest.

Probably the biggest issue at hand is the whole, you are a box. This makes movement extremely luck based, due to your edges causing you to ricochet in random directions. You basically have two control schemes, one for if your corner is facing the way you intend to move, and the other for your face. If you are moving with your face first, you will roll your box, which causes a ton of rng for exactly where you will go. If you move with your corner first, you kinda just slide in that general direction.

There are also plenty of bugs and bad texture mapping randomly throughout, though you probably will quit before encountering too many. The most noticeable bug is the fact you can climb up over some walls or moving objects if you hit it just right, which happens more often than not. Alas, other moving enemies can also utilize this (e.g. a chaser" type of enemy climbing over locked doors before you even open them).

It is evil how bad this game is, but then again, Steam trading cards worth more than the game are lovely (   )

Why So Evil
Well, it is evil, if evil is defined as annoying.  It is clumsy to play, tedious to beat, and has some annoying tricks that are played on you.  I played about 30 minutes and got through many levels with tons of deaths.  Then I just let it run to get the cards as I was not enjoying it at all.

Got this in a bundle, for about 35c and did play about 30 minutes, which exceeds my US$1/hr threshold.  I wouldn't recommend it at full price.  The cards are worth about 32-36c so it was a free game basically.

Bundle (<50c) - recommend 5.01/10 for the cards
Full price - no way  2/10

Why So Evil
Very often Ive asked myself why I have such an addiction to rage games. I suppose because being challenged to a point of frustration by a video game leads to a greater sense of accomplishment when you are finally able to conquer it. Its also what attracts me to rogue-likes. When its always do or die, you need to be in top form in order to even get close to the finish. Why So Evil? wants to be both of these, but ends up coming close to neither. The game opens to a startup launcher that allows you to pick your resolution/graphics, a windowed checkbox, and a controls tab. The launcher is my favorite part of this game. Almost nothing in the game feels as well made as the launcher. I could end the review there, but my masochism wont let me, so lets look at this game a bit more in-depth, and ask ourselves the question, Why So Awful?

The game is launched without a menu. No tutorial, no further options, just a room with a green cube, a blue cube, a bouncing red cube, and a horrible-looking default Unity UI. Now, I understand the difference between a AAA title and something from an indie studio But to leave the default buttons and text on a UI that cant be turned off? Pure laziness. Anyways, WASD appears on the screen, and you will find that you are the green cube. If you are intuitive, you will avoid the red cube and head towards the blue. If youre curious you will test the red one. This sends you back to stage one. Which you were already on. Okay, no harm, no foul. We now know that red cubes can kill us. So you roll past the red cube, everything lights on fire (Which, for a game that touts its realistic weather effects, look exceptionally unfinished) and in that horrible default text it asks Are You Ready For Hell? Whereupon touching the blue cube, you will be forced to complete the first stage for a third time. Leading me to believe that the blue cube isnt my friend at all. Everything in this game seems to kill me, lets be smart, shut it off, 3evil5me. Am I ready for hell? Probably. But that still didnt prepare me for this game.

The first few stages arent really hard, the hardest thing about them being getting used to the wonky physics of this game. Sometimes moving left or right will cause you to roll, but it usually doesnt This leads to a game that feels clunky and cumbersome instead of the death-defying action game it advertises itself as. Around level five or six, the game will start punishing you for making it to new levels. Youre placed in a big blank level, with the exit nowhere in sight, and suddenly platforms start flying every which way to knock you off the edge If it were a well made game, you might be able to roll toward the edge of the platform and save yourself. Instead, youll usually end up stuck inside of it and swept off the edge. Then you get to go back to level one again, and play through 20 stages, all so you can get a few more seconds learning which way the platforms come from on that last stage you died at. Are we having fun yet? Yaaawn. This is simply a glorified memorization game, and I understand it calls itself evil, but I think the most evil thing about this game is its lack of effort.

Even if you can undergo the kind of repetition that Why So Evil? will force upon you, you will inevitably ask yourself Why? There is no sense of progression Theres no sense of enjoyment. Theres no sense of accomplishment. The only thing this game was able to deliver was artificial difficulty, and monotony. I think I gave this game a fair shake. Its not as if I dislike this sort of game, I raved to my friends about EDGE. But this lacks any of the inspiration EDGE had. It physically pained me to see that they thought this game was good enough to not require any updating (as stated on their store page), because in order for this game to be worth any amount of money it will require quite an overhaul. It isnt all doom and gloom though, some of the weather effects are done quite well Well, the rain looks good at least. The soundtrack might also be enjoyable for some people too, if you enjoy techno or house. Also on a positive note, most things about the game are passable, and the level designs that arent unfair can sometimes be quite clever, but to me it isnt worth the pain because there is no reward except for more pain. If you need to fulfill some masochistic tendencies, pick this game up Otherwise, buggy physics and unfair level design will drive you off the deep end.

Summary: A neverending masochistic adventure that tests the limits of human endurance.

Final Score: 4/10 for weather and soundtrack. Could be brought up to 8/10 with major physics/level design overhauls.

Why So Evil
This game should have been called Why so ""

Why So Evil
You play as a cube and you try to tumble through a bunch of different puzzles.  There's really nothing wrong with it, but at the same time, there's really not much reason to keep playing.  There's nothing to really change up the gameplay.  Each puzzle is a bit different, but they seem very repetitive.  The developer seemed to make a basic game mechanic and did nothing else.  It's essentially a bare minimum game, and there's not much satisfaction in completing it.

Why So Evil
I just can't recommend it.
Frustrating (but not challenging!), poor hit-detection (not even touching the hazard but die), lame design + traps and sometimes strange physics (sliding box), high system requirement for such game...

If you really want it, get it from bundle or wait for 75-90% sale. I bought mine on 75% sale for 1.
But instead of this, check out Lost Marbles, Puzzle Dimension or Spectraball.
Or Super Meat Boy! Those are awesome games!

p.s: You want a really evil game? Check Syobon Action! (Cat Mario)

Why So Evil
Almost four hours of idle for 4 miserable Steam trading cards...

Why So Evil?""

Why So Evil
If this was a traning demo for Unity it would be considered incomplete - as a game it's worse than that

Why So Evil
I got this game for free.
I want my free back.

Why So Evil
Default Unity menu, streched rock textures for walls"

Why So Evil
I don't like to leave negative reviews. I know someone put time and effort into this and takes pride in it... but they shouldn't.
This game is awful.
-It's ugly
-The controls are clunky
-The movement is clunky
-The interface is lazy
-The level reset when you die is boringly simple
-The challenge" isn't in the gameplay

Why So Evil
Go from A to B avoiding obstacles. Thats all.

So unless it is a bundle... Dont bother.

Why So Evil
you need ASAP change the game name to Why so laggy.
not worth with the price

Why So Evil
Why sio evil?" That's what I asked my friend when he made me play this game.

It's awful

Why So Evil
It's a simple physics puzzle game where you play a cube and you're trying to cross a field filled with obstacles to get to another cube.

Why So Evil
Pros :
Trading Cards

Tutorial how to play this game : Download it, get cards, delete it.

Why So Evil
Not that cool. You're a cube and you hit another cube while avoiding things. Not that cool.

Why So Evil
Do you know the old flash game the worlds hardest game" by armor games? Yeah this is a blatant ripoff in source engine with a cube as movable object. The levels are created without love and thought

Why So Evil
Really bad controls are the only reason this game is hard". I had 32 deaths and got to level 26 in my one and only session

Why So Evil
It's not that really a bad game, it's simple and plain and challenging because there is no checkpoints in the levels and it can get quite complex futher down the line.

 I do not recommend using keyboard controll because it's so terrible, so i prefer a controller.
 Should buy this in Sale/Discounted.

Should suggest they add achievements and workshop.

Why So Evil
!! cubical Hell !!

Why So Evil
A friend of mine gave me this game as a gift, im gonna sue him.

Why So Evil
I got this game on a 97% sale (including the second one), so i can't even regret it. I'm in lvl 39 so I can point it's main flaws:
-Ugly HUD (Unity default HUD, they didn't even bothered to change it)
-You can't move the camera, that's really annoying.
-2 players mode is completly useless since you lose if just one of the players dies.
-IT'S A CUBE!: it's difficult to control and sometimes you have to rely on luck. A sphere would make the game much better, not easier, but enjoyable.
As you can see from my play time it's not THAT bad but isn't worthy the full price.

Why So Evil
Rather boring in all honestly...

Its not really a game..
More of a standard physics test someone new to coding would make...

Why So Evil
Game developers need to understand that terrible controls don't make a game hard, they just make it bad. This game is a waste of time and energy, not to mention money.

Why So Evil
Em, WTF?

No, no, no.. This game is horrible. Gaben, why? ;-;

1/10

Why So Evil
This (not-so-realistic) physics-based puzzle arcade of rolling a dice towards his mate thru mean environment. Will put yr nerves to test, if you dont ragequit at 20+lvl you might as well successfully apply to zenmastery black belt or work as an electroshock dummy at torture museum.

Why So Evil
first i dont wanted to write a review because there are already enough, but this game is so bad that it hurts!

Why So Evil
Its not that bad, its just not worth anything above $0.0099

Why So Evil
At this point it's clear for me that this game should be published for free. I understand that somebody put a lot of effort into releasing this product, but it looks like it was an alpha release. Simply, good things in this game are so scarce that I cannot recommend it.

Why So Evil
I think in some ways this review goes out to the people who made the Unity engine.  They made it very easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things, and the people at Valve gave them an outlet to thrust mediocre things to millions of people who frankly deserve better.

In this case, Why So Evil" is a very poor puzzler/timed obstacle game with really terrible highschool student graphics and an even less imaginative premise.   Roll the green cube to the cyan cube

Why So Evil
It's a rage game.

Simple graphics, repetitive soundtrack, and levels designed to annoy you.

But it's a well crafted rage game. If you like things like Kaizo Mario, Why So Evil will be right up your alley.
If not, skip it.

Why So Evil
It is a bit challenging and some can have fun with it. I only recommend it with a big sale
the game is not pretty and sometimes it is a bit sloopy, but, well, it is playable

Why So Evil
Very evil game. Don't be fooled by reviews, it has good controls. Everyone's just butthurt from the fact you're moving a cube. If you're going to play expect tons of changes mid-game and try to expect the cube going crazy if you have it propped up at one of its corners. Although there's no intro, I found that you control a green cube that you move to avoid red cubes and any other obstacles to reach a blue cube. Very short game though.

Why So Evil
This is a far better simulator of the unfairness of life than Call of Duty will ever be.

Why So Evil
This game could be fun if it was a top-down view and if the controls weren't terrible.  I have 1 good thing to say about this: this is the same dev who made the depressingly bad Zatwor series and this is slightly better, but it still sucks donkey .

Hitman Movie/10

Why So Evil
Borring lazy poorly made game where you get the bonus points for ramming against the wall a few times to get over it.
3d is lazy, objects overlap wrong. Lack of dept of the objects. Poorly made hitboxes. Poor physics.
Give me my money back.

Yes it's sorta challenging. Yes it made me go oh come on" a few times. But it's not worth a penny to be honest. You can find much more elaborate games online for free.  This one is not even worth the time."

I like this game. I've played it a lot.

I had it for about 7 years before I had it on steam.

Peggle Deluxe
Its like plinko on shrooms.

Peggle Deluxe
This is entirely addictive. 4 hours flies past like nothing. Can't sleep. Must Peggle.

Peggle Deluxe
This one is the perfect game to kill time when you have 5-10 minutes free. I really like the concept of this game, it's fast, simple, yet extremely fun. You can try hard or just chill and play, launch it and then relax, your moves takes only a click. Good job Popcat.

Peggle Deluxe
Wow!, what a colorful and  addicting game this is.  When I first played Peggle several years ago it took me back to the old arcade  games I used to play when I was a kid, standing on the pier spending all of my  money on those machines.  That game was called  Pachinko,  (where you send a metal ball bearing spinning around a series of peg like mazes, trying to  get your ball to drop into various cup like  recepticles on the board)  and it is  still all the rage  over in Japan where  whole arcades are devoted to the game.

Peggle has become one of   my favorite 'short term'  arcade games of the last decade barring Ricochet Infinity and Gish.  What I mean by short term, is the ability to play  for  just a few moments in between other games, or when  on a coffee break from more important  things.     With Peggle,  you have to  attempt to knock out all the orange pegs  from  various arrays of  blue and orange pegs  (55 levels in the adventure mode)  using a ball launcher/cannon  that fires a ball from the top of the  game board.  You get 10 balls  to clear the board of the orange pegs.  If you can clear the whole board of both orange and blue pegs plus any special pegs,  you get  extra bonus points.  There's a bucket like object that is constantly on the move at the bottom of the board.  If your ball falls into this you get your ball back which in turn makes it easier to complete the  round. There's also  more points gained depending where your ball finally comes to rest, with a jackpot score of 50K  from the central well, 25K from the two adjacent wells and 5K from the outer wells.  The first time  you fail to hit any pegs  you will get your ball back, but this only happens once on each board.  Each new board includes two green pegs that give you one of several special powers when you clear them away.  These can  help you clear  the orange pegs away easier, for example  you may get   a double ball that enables yopu to clear away  a lot more  pegs, especially if you get it early on in the level (as more pegs get in the way), or extend the length of the ball catcher to give you a greater chance of catching the ball and getting it returned to the ball launcher or  a marker that shows you where your ball will bounce.  Some of the powers come into effect immediately (like the double ball which only lasts for that turn) or on the next turm that last for the next three turns; (the latter power is very useful for  aiming your ball for maximum effect).  Each of these specials  continues through several levels before changing to a new power, that are introduced   via Peggle Masters.   There's also a purple  peg that when hit  gives you bonus points.  Each time you flick a new ball, the  purple peg changes position.  Scoring over 250 000 on one board  gains you an extra ball as well.

There's four different modes included with the PC version, Adventure mode with 55 levels spread over  10 stages,  quick play, which allows you to play any  board you've already unlocked, duel that  allows you to play against either the computer or a friend (with the X-Box version you can play online against up to 4 players) and finally theres the challenge mode, which has 75 harder levels and is locked until you've completed the adventure mode.

There's two different  versions of the game available on Steam,  Peggle Deluxe and Peggle Nights, both of which are well worth buying if you  like arcade games.  Sadly there's no  level editor, but Steam do have a free version  Called Peggle Extreme that features   levels dedicated to Half-Life 2, Portal and Team Fortress.  There's only  ten levels with one special (also known as Peggle Masters), and five Challenge levels, but it's enough to gives you   an introduction to the game.  It's more like a demo, but is different to  the two commercial versions, so is worth getting if you  like the game.   I think they also made a second free themed  version that's not available on steam, but I've forgotten what the theme was.

The beauty of this game for me is that it never gets boring.  The levels are  vibrant and  enjoyable to play;  each time I replay the adventure mode or replay  levels via the quick play  mode   the game is  never the same and it's great  playing against friends or family, sadly it's only local play on the same computer and you share  the 10 balls.  If you play against the computer  you can select one of four difficulty modes.

The game is  only 4.99 on steam  in the UK  or $4.99 in the US (it's cheaper to get a freind in the US to buy it for you if you live in Europe).  I oriignally paid $20 for each version   via Reflexive Arcade when it was first released seven years ago.

You can see a video speed run of the whole game HERE  (it's 2hr 14mins in length), which gives you the opportunity to skip ahead and check out all of the various levels available in the deluxe version  or you can check out the free Peggle Extreme version HERE

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle is a fun casual game. It's very straightforward. Aim for the orange pegs. Hit the green ones to get various power ups that change every few levels. The power ups are all very different and keep things interesting. Some are not as useful as others like the lobster claw flippers. Each power up makes you think differently about how to approach a level.

As straightforward as the gameplay is, Peggle isn't simple. You only have 10 moves to clear all the orange pegs and it's difficult to predict just where your ball may bounce at times. Most of the time the results are what you aim for, but sometimes the judging an angle slightly wrong can turn into a wasted ball. Other times, you might just get a layout that works against you. While the design is always the same, the placement of orange pegs varies. But that's the challenge of Peggle.

There are 55 levels in the game, so plenty to play through. You can always replay levels of your choice later outside of story mode to try your hand at clearing the entire playing field of all blocks.

I wouldn't really consider Peggle a largely re-playable game. I played through story mode twice on a non-Steam version of the game, and playing through again on Steam didn't really hold my interest. But I would definitely consider this a great game for at least one or two playthroughs that is worth it's price point.

The only negative aspect of this game is the resolution, which is low and doesn't stretch to fit widescreen monitors.

Peggle Deluxe
Do you like Diehard?

If so every time you finish a level its like receiving a High Five from Alan Rickman.

10/10 Would High Five Alan Rickman again.

Oh and something about pegs.

Peggle Deluxe
I played this game to 100% completion in college. My laptop then died and lost all my local content. I replayed it to 100% completion again. I then bought it on Xbox 360 and completed just the story then. I then bought an Xbox One with the main purpose of playing Peggle 2.

Peggle Deluxe is very good.

It's nice to play Peggle anytime. You can play it as a quick break. You can play it while watching tv that doesn't require total focus (sports). You can play it while listening to podcasts.

Play Peggle. Join us.

My friend bought me this game as a joke.
I now have a shrine for our true lord Bjorn.
10/10 would shoot ball again

Peggle Deluxe
Who would of thought that hitting pegs would be fun?. Well it is. Especially when you unlock all the characters and get the different power-ups they possess. Cool.

Peggle Deluxe
It's fun I played a bit.

Peggle Deluxe
Are you looking for a game that offers the same play style as Call of Duty? - Well champ, Peggle Deluxe is the game that offers this one of a kind experience.

The game begins off with a cut-scene of a character named 'Peggle' starting his or her own tour of duty. Yes, this is game is exactly like Call of Duty: Ghosts where you are able to make your character male or female. I must assure you that if you do not play as the female, you will not get the benefits of being a grill gamer. However, if you do not mind what sex you are, then you'll enjoy the game regardless of the limitations that is given to you when you're handicap. (i.e. Not a female or grill gamer)

As you adventure more into Peggle Deluxe

Peggle Deluxe
You shoot balls and rainbows happen.

5min of this game (all character powers)
https://youtu.be/NADS7LWfcbs

This is a take on pachinko an Asian gambling game but in here your just trying to hit all the orange blocks.
This game has 10 parts with 5 levels each = 50 boards in all.
Each of 10 character has a special power that activates when you hit a green block.
Then pink blocks boost your points. points will fill a bar each time you release the ball and you'll get a Extra every time you fill it but it resets on each launch.
There is a basket on the bottom that moves back and forth and if you can get the ball in here you won't lose it.
The game end when all orange blocks are hit or you lose all your balls.

Peggle Deluxe
Incredible! Has so many levels, and is very fun! Would recommend for all ages!

Peggle Deluxe
 you if you don't like Peggle. What are you, some sort of prick? Some sort of prick who does nothing but play ARMA 2 all day? Some sort of prick who is ing dumb and stupid?  you!

By far the closest game to CoD ever.

grandma put 800 hrs in this game.

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle is a casual puzzle video game developed by Sukhbir Sidhu and Brian Rothstein of PopCap Games. Initially released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems in 2007, it has since had versions released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, the Nintendo DS (with the help of Q Entertainment), Windows Mobile, iOS, Zeebo and Android; the game has also been ported as a Java application, and an extended minigame incorporated into the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. A sequel was released in September 2008, titled Peggle Nights.

Inspired by pachinko and bagatelle, each level of Peggle challenges the player to shoot a limited supply of balls at a field of colored pegs to clear out specifically marked pegs while attempting to achieve a high score through skilled shot planning. Special powers associated with a number of cartoon Peggle Masters" can be activated to aid the player in this task. Peggle initially sold slowly but was boosted by the inclusion of a specially designed demonstration in Valve's The Orange Box

Peggle Deluxe
Watch a ball go from the top of the screen, and hit pegs on the way down.
Considering that I've lost countless quarters/coins in real life machines that share this same game mechanic, it's pretty easy to sell this game on anyone familiar with the machine(s) I am talking about.

Recommended.

Peggle Deluxe
Excellent game, this was heavily advertised in the orange box and with good reason, the quality of this game is on par with what valve made. It's a pity that since then valve has almost completely stopped making games and popcap has been eaten by EA...

Peggle Deluxe
why am i so good at this game

Peggle Deluxe
Addicting and amazing, but you shouldn't buy this on your PC. You can't change the resolution from anything other than 800x600, compared to Peggle on Xbox 360 and iOS which take up the maximum screen real estate. If you can, get those versions instead. However, one advantage to the PC version is that you can use your mouse cursor as a de facto crosshair to aim your shots more easily.

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle Deluxe is a casual game that takes fun to new levels, its objective is simple, but its execution can be frustrating. With 10 different characters, all with rewarding power ups makes this game a jem among dirt. Completing this game is an amazing sight, but the fun doesn't end there, once you complete the game you unlock Dual and Challenge mode.

Peggle Deluxe
It's a combination of pool and pachinko.  You can pick your shots with great accuracy or marvel at your luck with a casual shot.  Fun to play solo or while entertaining a group.  The melody of Ode to Joy" never had a better use."

In the last three days, this game will not start.  been playing for several years and is one of my favorites.  PopCap, please fix it and Peggle Nights!!!!

Peggle Deluxe
 MY BALLS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle has always been one of my favorite games. It is a game where you shoot balls at orange pegs with the help of the professors of the Peggle Institute, and if you hit all the orange pegs before you run out of balls, you win the level. It is fun and addicting, and is worth buying.

Peggle Deluxe
play it

Peggle Deluxe
Its all the fun, bright lights, and fantastic sounds of playing pachinko... without sitting in a smoke filled gambling parlor.  Also goofy cartoon characters.

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle is a fun pop cap game. This is a game thats very easy to play and most people can understand what it is and how to play. This is a fun game but it is a game you can play some were else for free like online on game sites so i would get it only if it is on sale. Other than that this is a fun shoot the ball hit the orange pegs and you will win. The colors are amazing and bright. This game can be played by all ages i strongly recommend this game!

Peggle Deluxe
hours of fun though beating all the challenges is a PAIN.

This game is pretty good.

This game is just so much fun ,this was a very difficult game to purchase on CD when we went hunting around the shops for it, then my son saw it on steam, and I just begged them to buy it for me ,I just love this game ,it's a great buy for sure : )

Amazing!

hej

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle Deluxe is the Deluxe version of Peggle. This already shows that it is the better version to choose to play and if you say otherwise  Shut up you ing idiot .

Peggle is a game that involves complex calculations and mechanical skill to ensure that the screen is cleared of small little multicultural dots. The dots vary from a cold-hearted blue, a tanned slag of an orange, and a nice combo of purple and green, thanks doc. By firing out your little ball, you can make it bounce around the screen, hitting these dots to build up a score"

Peggle Deluxe
Really fun and addicting game.
It's a good time waster if you feel like playing something simple and quick.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
One of the best Digital Collectible Card Games out there... until Ubisoft let it fall into the dreaded hands of the endlessly incompetent Blue Byte. After almost a YEAR with absolutely no support (including ignoring GAME-BREAKING bugs that any COMPETENT developer would fix in DAYS at most), they finally release the long-overdue draft mode.... together with an announcement that they wouldn't be developing any more content for the game, so it's basically dead (oh, but of course they're leaving the servers up so suckers can still buy cards with real money, because THAT doesn't take any effort). Hey, Blue Byte? YOU NEVER DEVELOPED ANY CONTENT FOR THE GAME AT ALL! Oh and just to add insult to injury, this last patch broke the blasted game, introducing more game-breaking bugs and crashes than they managed to fix! The uselessness on display is simply JAW-DROPPING! They took the game and KILLED it because they simply didn't care. A heinous display of incompetence by an utterly worthless developer squandered a potentially fantastic game. Damn you to hell, Blue Byte. Damn you to hell.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
If you are thinking to begin to play this game I suggest read what I wrote.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
>>>Before the recent update (heart of nightmares)

<Short Game Review>
Card game evaluation from 1 to 5

Mechanics 4/5
It has a grid on the field that is quite distinctive it has melee lane and shooter lane, gives 3 main types of creatures (shooters, melee and flyers along with hybrids) other than creatures there are fortunes and spells each have the ability to change the flow of the game. There are factions that all heroes of might and magic fans should be familiar with. Each faction has distinctive characteristics. There are also differnet spell schools which do determine your limits and openents battlefield tactics for example if you know they have fire spells you can assume they have fireball so you would avoid have any creatures near eachother. Mana is produced constantly by +1 each turn. It has heroes what is expected from might and magic. Life points that each hero has differs which makes it more ineteresting as it represents the idea that everything has a cost and to master the game you need to master your ability of making your deck efficient, which limits you in way since all decks will have a weakness, so you have to decide whether you want to invest more in rushing to victory or playing a steady slow game. Another thing that was intresting is that you can redraw your cards at the beginning, with consiquence which is weird to me, but I am staying neutral with it. I gave it a four because I feel like they could of added another lane, made it at least 5x5 instead of 4x4, so then it would five enough space to make it more strategic. What I mean by that there would be a middle row on both sides which would be harder to dominate since the center would be the most dangerious spot on the field. By making a small difference such as that it would increase the variaty of formations possible, not sticking to them would bring additional dangers to the player.

Flow/Economics 4.25/5
I was really happy with this game. Economics of it was most appreciated, since there was a daily reward that grows for 7 days and then is collected on the 7th day along with being awarded 10000 gold and 100 seals per level. There were also some achievements that rewarded in seals. Prices seemed reasonable to me except the fact that five towers set packs were not available for gold, which didn't make sense to me. If you look pass that then everything else is accessible each level as you go on (except the fice towers they are only accesible later when you have enough seals) cards in the game at a reasonable pace. I liked the fact that they have a sacrafice pit to recycle cards in a way but you need a lot to do that. Another thing that it makes it flow more is that there are such things as wild cards which you can use for getting specific cards in the altar of wishes, but first you hace to unlock them though by buying packs. It's a 4.25 because I think each set of cards should be accessible with gold and only the boxes should be priced with seals as they are now. Only when the set is really new it should be priced with seals for a month and then it should change to the ordinary price as the other packs.

Aestetics 4.25/5
It's organized each faction has it's own field look, quality pictures on the cards, nice log in menu background. There are also alternate art for some cards. The flying creatures move up and down, there is some other animation. I cannot give it a five though, because that would mean there is no room for improovements to be made. The aim of each card game should be to become more lively and more animated, so there would be movement and with it comes character of each creature. Everyone wants to see their creatures come to life and all spells become animated. I think even basic animations would be a start like one for each type of spell I guess. When thinking about makes you think about the ability to change the whole field and that change gives certain effects.

Story 1/5
I think there is something written on those 13 quests. I think it needs some story each hero at least to add more depth to the game. More quests some short animations or at least pcitures with writing on it or descriptions on cards.

Total: 14/20 I would recomment this game to all people that like card games and strategy.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
<<<After the update

Mechanics 4/5
Nothing changed that would have a huge impact.

Flow/Economics 1/5
There seems to be no more daily rewards just some daily quests and no award for leveling, it almost seems that they don't want to reward their players really for playing the game. All prices changed to seals which disguisted me. I think it is also not fair as other people that are further ahead get the advantage as they had the ability to earn more seals. If you start just now you will never go ahead of other people. I was really disappointed by their choices that they made in this area as they also removed the achievements that awarded seals. I mean how will you feel knowing that there is no way to catch up with people unless you empty your wallets. Before it was player friendly now it's not. From play to win to pay to win.

Aestetics 4.5/5
They added some spell animation for each type and menu looks cool. Event animaiton different.

Story 1.5/5
They added more quests. There were description on every one of them.

Total: 12/20 I would not recommend this game anymore after the update.

Final remark: They ruined the game after the update. Changed it from play to win into pay to win. If you want to play you will have to pay. Before the update I liked the game so much that I chose to support it by buying some seals as a sign of my appreciation, but now I began to regret doing so. I am very disappointed.

-Thank you for taking the time to read.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Was good.. Until this recent expansion... Now it's another money hungry Ubisoft game. Good job guys, You f***ed up another game

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
First of all, this game is now neither pay to win, nor unbalanced: reviews which say so are usually pre-Griffin Bane expansion, which immediately gives new referred players all six starter decks, plus tons of gold to buy cards upon completing the introductory campaigns, and  brings back all Factions to competitive levels.

More complex, varied  and ultimately satisfactory than Hearthstone, this game has very nice mechanics, with the board consisting of four rows and two columns (shooter and melee) for each player, spells which can affect single creatures, specific areas (squares, rows, columns) or even the entire board, and fortunes which usually manipulate cards and decks.
Creatures can be basic or have a lot of useful abilities (immune to retaliation, stackable, outmaneuver, etc.), including enter the board" effects.

Simply put

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I've been playing this game for less than a week, but I gotta say, it's probably the most fun I've had playing a card game in years. Now, granted, I haven't tried Hearthstone or Shadow Era or any of the other online card games that seem to be popular, but I used to play a ton of Magic: the Gathering and have watched a lot of friends play Hearthstone. Honestly? This game has just as much strategic depth as MTG, if not more, and both MTG and Duel of Champions blow Hearthstone out of the water if you like complexity in games like I do. The one thing that MTG has going for it though is that it's been out far longer and there are way more cards to play around with and collect (though there's no shortage of cards in DOC either). With a little more investment from its developers in terms of expanding the content and team, I can definitely see this game becoming one of the best/most popular card games around.

EDIT 10/12/15: Welp, they've just announced that they'll no longer be supporting this game with updates. Honestly, screw Ubisoft. They've proven that they have no idea what they're doing, and can't handle games that have potential, especially with how HOMM 7 turned out on release. Still holding out hope that eventually they'll turn it around with expansions, but definitely not gonna waste my money on it for now. Tl;dr: don't buy anything related to Ubisoft ever. Wait until it's in the bargain bin if you must.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Don't bother. The devs have abandonned the game, but not before releasing a final patch that broke just about everything.

The game now crashes more than my cat driving my car.

Sad end for a game that could've trumped Heartstone anyday if Ubisoft bothered enough to give it a dedicated team instead of leaving the commands to a  group of nobodies that didn't care.

Otherwise, best CCG when it works. Artwork is quality too.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
UbiSoft has gone UbiGreed... no more free seals :(

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
MMDoC is a digital Card Collection Game (CCG) with cards belonging to six different factions, each having their unique heroes, crreatures, fortunes and buildings. Each hero can use spells from 1/2/3 schools out of a total of 7. There are also 8 event cards in play from both sides. A duel is a fight to death between two heroes, each having 18/20 Hit Points. Each card uses resources. Spells, creatures, buildings, events and heroes have synergies. One good combo can change a 25 turn long game. Nearly every game for the first 100 games teaches you something if you are experimenting. Just imagine. All this, for free. Paying money only to get in game currency that buys premium packs, or buying premium packs as-is. The best CCG concept, with the most balanced and innovative F2P model.

Only I have any clue how painful it is to mark a thumbs down on this game; because, this is was hands down the BEST digital CCG ever. Don't get me wrong, it still uses essentially the same game mechanics - easy to learn, complex to use and difficult to master - that made loyal users and fans of a lot of players. But just when everyone thought Hey

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I have played this game since the early days, having 1500 hours more or less between the standalone client and the Steam client.

This game has been completely ruined by the greed of Ubisoft and the lack of effort by developers to maintain a decent game, with poor design of monetization.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
It's impossible not to compare this to Hearthstone or Magic, but I think MMDoC can hold it's own against these two other giants of the CCG scene and here is why.

Comparing it to Hearthstone:
-MMDoC is much deeper strategically.
-You are rewarded with a lot more packs by just playing the game.
-Much greater card variety.
-Automated tournaments.
-Three formats to play the game, open, standard and weekly (the latter is a bit gimmicky, but can be fun)
-Spectator/replay mode.

Comparing it to Magic Online (Duels of the planeswalkers doesn't really compare as it is just a dumbed down experience)
-Much better UI
-Can get new cards by playing the game
-Free to play
-Ladder
-Much more newbie friendly

Conclusion:
It's a shame that Warcraft and Blizzard have a much bigger fanbase that most people looking for a Free online CCG are going to gravitate towards it without even hearing about this game. Admitedly, I've always thought the art in Might & Magic games were a bit generic, but the artwork on the cards are excelent.

It may not be as deep as Magic the Gathering, but as a computer game it provides a far better experience.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I've used to play the non-steam version before, so my playtime here is inaccurate.
MM: DoC struggles with several issues that make it hard to enjoy in the long run.

Firstly, progression is very slow. Rewards for a single match are negligible and you're only rewarded with a reasonable amount of gold (basic currency) when you level up. The problem is, after the first few levels it will take you around ten hours of playtime to get another one. Some mechanics are in place to make the grind less monotone, but they have their own share of issues.

There's a PvE mode available in the form of campaigns. Each campaign consists of 5 missions that, upon being completed with one of the six available factions for the first time grant a significant amount of gold plus some experience points. Clearing the entire campaign with a faction also grants a free booster pack. The problem is, those free boosters are largely useless, since following an overhaul in 2014 most cards from older sets can no longer be used in ranked play. The gold rewards for campaigns also happen to have a nasty incident in their early history. Two weeks after being introduced those rewards were increased by a factor of five and this increase was not retroactively applied to players who already cleared the campaigns. Since the increased rewards were ridiculous - clearing 2 missions took next to no time and granted as much as a single level up normally does - pretty much all the players who weren't already veterans found themselves in a situation where it would simply be easier for them to start the game anew (which isn't allowed), even if they already spent money on it.
The previously mentioned overhaul also made it impossible to gain seals (premium currency) without paying money for the game, even though previously they were received upon leveling up and as a reward for 6 consecutive days of playing. Since every new card pack is only available for seals for the first few weeks, this also means that paying players now have an actual advantage over non paying ones.

There's also a lot of balance issues. Unless you manage to build a decent deck, which involves lots of grinding or spending several AAA titles worth in money on card packs then you'll struggle even against mediocre necropolis players, mostly because dark magic school is broken to the point where it enforces the meta (not worth it to use any creature costing more than 4, because otherwise casting Soulreaver or Death Seal will remove it for a lower cost, while casting Wither will make it useless). Necropolis isn't exactly overpowered though: it just isn't really possible to counter if you lack cards, so for the first ~40 levels or something around ten times that amount in dollars/euros.

If you bothered to read this wall of text, you might've noticed that most problems are nailed down to the controversial overhaul, that:
1. added PvE campaigns and then screwed over everyone who finished them
2. made over half of the cards in the game useless by excluding them from ranked play or the so-called 'standard format'
3. removed all the free ways of gaining premium currency, except for some achievements that are mostly hard or even impossible to get without paying for the now obsolete card sets in the first place.

Point #2 effectively negatively affected paying players by making some neat decks that require a select pool of cards useless and wasting their money in the process, point #3 made the game feel like a 'pay to win' for free players, while point #1 was a bad decision that screwed over everyone. What all of those points have in common is that the combination of these things irrecoverably ruined the trust in the developer that many players had at that time.

Even with those problems playing MM: DoC can be enjoyable from time to time, but as far as I'm concerned, major updates tend to create more problems than they solve, not to mention that removing what used to be half of the cards available in game from ranked play instead of actually bothering to balance them (and not even managing to tweak the remaining half properly) was probably the most lazy development decision I've ever witnessed.
If you're looking for a more complex alternative to Hearthstone, you might want to check out Infinity Wars instead.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
See how all the positive reviews are really old? The game is way too expensive and then they reshuffled things and made a ton of stuff no longer usable and it's just not worth your time. It's a shame because it was a good, fun game

If you aren't willing to spend a decent amount of money on a regular basis to buy cards in a game no one plays, then this game is not for you.

Edit: some people would like to point out that there are now various formats of play some of which will let you use (modified versions of) your old cards. I didn't mention this because it doesn't matter. The only way to get old cards is if you already have them, and so if you play the old style you will be playing pretty exclusively against people who already spent a ton of money on their cards.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game is absolutely worth your time . It has depth , quite a few cards to choose from (around 600) and one of the best F2P models I have experienced . I hope the community will keep growing now that it is on Steam.

EDIT : I am taking back what I said . The game does look very promising but it only gets worse as you level up . Your dependency on packs is not visible when you are a beginner , but when you try to face an opponent with 500+ elo , you WILL find a guy that has emptied his wallet on this game . More specifically :

- The lack of a trading system is killing MaM . It does not matter if you want THAT card .You have to buy a pack every time and expect to find it there . Most packs contain 10-12 cards . There are all in all 600 cards. You do the math.
And it gets even better . Most of the epic monsters can only be found in 2 card packs , which sometimes DO contain duplicate cards . So if you want one of those cards you are pretty much screwed.An alternative to praying to the godess of luck , is to purchase it directly with wildcards , a currency that you get with packs.

However the only sure way to have them is to buy packs with seals . You get 100 seals per level up (roughly 20 matches if you haven't bought cards with real money , as you will lose most of the time ).There are two packs ( essentially one )  that you can buy with seals.The ''normal pack'' costs 175 seals and gives 3 wildcards , along with 12 other game cards . The second one costs 225 seals gives 4 wildcards and has the same card pool with the previous pack , with the onl difference being that they are ...shiny.
So after 4 level ups (400 seals) you can get 7 wildcards , 48 random cards and all the gold you will have gathered by then. Well done ! An epic card costs 8 wildcards.After so many matches , you can not have the epic card you want.Now imagine what happens if you want to fit 10 or more epic cards in your deck  , which i assure you is the minimum to have a chance at higher elos.
If you do not want to pay for seals , and do not want to spend the ones you get by leveling up , you can use your gold ( the in-game currency ) to get packs. Sadly those packs have a mediocre 40 % chance ( at best ) to have ONE wildcard .And they most likely fill your card collection with dozens of duplicates. I believe you see my point.
And that concludes the bad moneytary system .

- Another probem of MoM is the matchmaking . The tournament mm that is . Are you a low level player that want to participate in a tournament ? Forget it. You will get matched with guys that have spent an eternity in this game , and more often than not have far better decks than yours .

-Finally any help you get on the game stops at the tutorial . There is no library , catalogue , list ,whatever you want to call it that can inform you of the cards each faction has . You must either visti the ( poor) wiki of the game , or suffer again and again as you are bombarded with effects you didn't know they existed , even after 200 games after you started.

To conclude this game is good for a while , but transforms into a cash sink later on.

EDIT 2 : Right now the only way to play with legacy cards is to pay real money . Open duels are officialy broken . Well played Ubo , well played.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
When you first boot up this game for the first time your instantly impressed, the cards are full of beautiful art, the gameplay is fun and you really feel its a well made game. You also get a nice bundle of free in game currency to buy Packs"....atleast YOU will think its alot...its only once you add a few new cards to your starter deck or throw out your cheap shop deck against players  online that you see this is a heavy pay to win game. Your freebie or cheap cards will be torn to pieces against someone who threw money into the game shop and bought all the decks/packs to get those OP cards. Some of the pay factions not optional for the freeble's are so much more powerful too and you will sadly see yourself looking at the shop and tempted to spend just to level the playing field. All in all its a ok game

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
It was good once, now it is just a pay to win.

Once you could buy all cards for ingame currency, now you just can buy the new" packs. All my old decks became worthless

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Definitely better than MTG. Aside from playing without having to pay any money... you still get to enjoy the same feeling when you play cards as those on MTG. Card collection and deck building is so easy. Getting enough play means you get tons of gold in exchange for packs of cards to improve your deck. I can't stop playing this since I started and now I'm having trouble sleeping... :D
Deep game strategy, deck building skills and lots of cards to choose.
Every part of the game is excellent. Thank you Ubisoft for building this game
for cheap players like me!!!

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
If you're looking for a competitive card game, then I'd recommend this to you.

I recommend this because the gameplay is quite innovative and also addivting for a card game. Game mechanics is quite complex, but when you get the hang of it you will discover that this game have a great game mechanic unlike any other card games.
Like other Collectible Card Games, you will have to either invest a lot of money or do some serious grinding if you want to build a decent deck. And of course, like any other card games, luck plays a major role both in game and opening a booster pack.
FYI, I spent 0 amount of real money in this game and I'm already in the top 400 worldwide. All cards are accessible without paying.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
If you are into collectible card games, this one is pretty good.  It is also quite possible to have fun with it without spending a dime, which is always a bonus.

The game play of this CCG is slightly different from others I have played.  The battlefield has a 2x4 grid you place your creatures on.  Melee creatures can only be placed on the front line, and archers on the back line, flying creatures can be placed anywhere.  Most creatures cannot attack outside of their row, nor can they attack the enemy hero if enemy creatures are in the way.  To me, it helps add a bit of the Heroes of Might and Magic feel to the game.

As far as spells go, you have the usual assortment of nukes, removals, buffs and various other deck manipulation tools.  Spells are broken up into their respective element, and each Hero only has access to certain elements.  This combined with the fact that Heroes only have access to neutral troops and the ones from their faction leads to a wide variety in the strategies you can deploy.

If you play through the short single-player campaign, you should get enough seals to buy 'The Box' which has 10 packs of cards to help get you started.  You can also look around on the net for some codes you can redeem for additional packs and rewards.

It should be noted though that this game is almost exclusively PvP once you have completed the campaign.  So if you are not into PvP at all, you might want to skip over this one.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
NOT PAY TO WIN & LOTS OF FUN:

PROS:
- Single player Campaign that takes more than a week to complete as it is hard.
- Lots of GOLD & CARDS earned from single Campaign.
- Deep strategy with LOTS of SPELLS
- Quick matches from 5 minutes to long ones of 20 minutes (that I love)
- AMAZING DARK FANTASY
- Levelling up gives you experience and gold to buy more packs
- It's FREE ( just try and see for your self)

CONS:
- It takes sometimes 2 minutes to get an adversary.
- It takes a few days to understand the mechanics of the game. (as it is complex, and GREAT!)
- Sometimes the randomization of the cards you get in your starting hand is flawed (getting 3 copies of one card 2 of another and 2 of another is strange when it happens a once or twice a day)

My past experience: I used to play MTG (I find it too expensive now days, so I use Work Station for free with friends), currently playing Hearthstone (I have most of the cards, only 4 legendaries to finish the collection)

I have been playing for a week TO DOC and I still have lots of fun!
The solo play is really good, it gives you LOTS OF GOLD to buy packs and some 20 packs. The only problems with the 20 packs is that they are from the old editions, so most of cards are not valid for standard game (only for open - for Pros)

What most of people complain is about the changes that happened from the old edition to the new. For me is ok, as I do not care about most of things they say. For example, you can only buy with seals (mostly real money) packs from old editions with cards that we can not use in the Standard game, so WHAT'S THE POINT!!!

COMPARE TO MTG:

Not as good. MTG is the King. Strategy in not as deep and versatile. But illustrations in DOC are better for my taste.
In MTG you can mix all the cards, in DOC you have classes and some general cards, very few. So it is limited in that aspect. But you can mix spells and there are 7 schools of magic, and many Heroes with abilities and mixes of magic schools that create different strategies.

COMPARE TO HEARTHSTONE:

For the moment I proffer the deepest of DOC and the extensive amount of spells. Hearthstone is great and I love it, but is all about minions and sometimes it feels a bit limited. I have been playing since close Beta and I'm a bit bored now. The brought only 30 new cards with Naraxxramas and the Meta has changed, but is more or less with the same cards, not so interesting.
I also prefer the illustrations and the darker look of DOC, but I miss the animation of the spells of HS.
HS is fast and great for any moment, DOC could be slower but deeper so more planing is requiered to play.
HS has Drafts in the Arena and is amazing, the best of all, maybe that is missing in DOC.

My advice is to try it and decide as it is FREE. If you want all the basic decks to start with, use my code as Referal: 8BKDTC

If you see a bad review of someone that has played more than 40 hours, read it careful, most of people do not like changes and get angry when that happens. There are reviews of people that has played more than 50 hours, even 400 hours and they are bad reviews. Tell me how someone that has played so much has not liked the game? They are angy with changes.
Don't miss the opportunity to try it!

Have FUN!


Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
The game mechanics themselves are enjoyable, but the paywall is much too high. After playing for a few hours, I've come to the conclusion that it is not possible to actually play the game without paying for it. If you want to run a successful pay to win game like this one, the game has to at least be fun and fast paced enough in the beginning to lure people into paying for things later. This game fails to do that as you are immediately faced with a paywall or easily over 20 hours of grinding with the same starter deck to even unlock even the most basic features common in modern 'free to play' card games. I stopped at about hour three. (Note that I started playing this game outside of steam, which is why I only have an hour logged playing on steam.)

It's not that the game mechanics are bad, in fact they are quite interesting. Each deck being bound to certain factions and schools of magic is a promising feature that unfortunately does not come out prominently in the beginning as you are forced to play with the same intro deck (you can make some slight modifications to it with your starting cardpool if you wish) over and over again. The tactical mechanic of positioning your creatures and having area of effect features is also quite enjoyable. This is the meat of the game's structure and it is well executed. The main problem is with the way the paywalls are set up.

There is a simple conundrum in these pay to win games. If you don't want to pay, you have to spend countless hours grinding, which is boring, but at least you are playing the game. If you are willing to pay, you have to realize that you are in effect paying the game company to NOT play their game. It is quite an achievement for game developers to create a game so boring that people are willing to pay to NOT play it. So then what's the point? This is the pit that many of these games fall in.

So what would make this game better? More variation. The game should give every player access to all the starter decks. This way as they continue to grind through the game they are encouraged to try new things which will keep them playing, rather than get bored repetitively grinding with the same low power decks. Also removing the level requirement for the card trade in system is a must. This will allow players to more greatly customize whatever starter deck they like the most which will also encourage them to keep playing and trying new things. As is, the lack of customization available in deck construction to the new player really dampens the exploration of the game. It should be set up so that playing the game intrigues the player into wanting to try new things and then maybe pay to help that along instead of making them have to pay before even the creative spark fires, not knowing what they really want to do. This puts out the fire of imagination before it even starts.

To sum up, this game does not offer the non paying user any encouragement to want to play the game - let alone pay for it. Furthermore, the first few hours of gameplay do not adequately sell the game's features to the user, leading to the user to doubt that the game would be fun even if they put in a few dollars.

For interesting mechanics despite a horrible paywall system and an unfun experience, this game has a lot of potential if a few minor tweaks were made. It shall therefore earn a 1/5 rating. I will not be spending any more time playing this game.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
All these negative reviews are old. Yeah the game had some problems some months ago, but they are working to make it enjoyable, they made so much progress!

- You can get all cards for free only playing, yeah it's grindy but that's normal since you don't pay a dime. If you want to speed up a bit you can buy more cards with real money and just that. There's no real diference between a paying player and a free player, the only benefit is the time spent.
- Lots of achievements that gives you cards, the various types of currency in the game and other fun stuff, another way to get the cards you want.
- 2 formats of dueling: the Open Format, for more experienced players and where you can play with all cards from the game, and the Standard Format, for beginners and where you have a tinier pool of cards that you can play with.
- Also there's a extra format of dueling: the Weekly Format, where every week the game choose some restrictions to put in the decks. Example: You can only play with Spells, or Creatures, or a specific Faction, etc.
- Campaign Mode and Puzzles: This one is great, you can learn a lot of things with it and get good rewards for doing it. Also the Puzzles are extremely challenging.
- Wildcards System: Since the beginning of this game everyone asked for a trade system, but the fact is the trade system would broke the game, so they implemented a way to get the cards you want by colecting Wildcards and trade it for them.
- Infernal Pit: This system help you to get rid of the cards you don't want. You just need a max of 4 cards from the same card in each deck so, if you have 5, 6 or more from that card you can sell" them to the npc and he gives some amount of money for it. Also there's a featured card every 8 hours that you can get by selling a great amount of cards

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
When I'm looking for something more complicated than Hearthstone, this is what I'm going to now.  Wish I knew about it last year..

I found it very confusing at first, but once I figured out that I can right-click a card and it will explain what the key words mean (charge, swift, quick attack, magic resist, etc... there's a lot of them) it made things a lot easier to pick up.  Also, the starter decks are all over the place.. Definitely make your own, simplified deck with a few good spells/fortunes and a lot of creatures, with a good resource-curve.. it'll be much easier to learn from.  Also, I recommend stronghold to start, I'm finding them the easiest to pick up as their minions seem to be really good.

You should definitely use a referral code because you get a free copy of the starter deck for every faction right off the bat.  Then when you beat that faction in quickplay, you get a second copy of the starter deck for that faction.  You can then make a much better deck for that faction with your doubled card-pool.

It doesn't matter who's referral code you use, but here's mine if you're looking for one: TNRMH1
If you do use mine, feel free to ask me questions in the game. I'm happy to help another new player with what I've learned so far and I could use the extra gold :D

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
The game was great in its day but its current status is abandonware. It is currently full of bugs and the devs are doing nothing and plan nothing for the future of the game. It's sad that they are still taking peoples money for a game they have ditched.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
M & M: Duel of Champions is a well-executed digital collectible card game, which is saying a lot -- I've seen abominations in this genre.

Gameplay is unique, inventive and has elements that can only be achieved digitally. The campaign is painfully short, but it does give you enough gold and seals" to buy a decent number of cards with which to expand your collection (I recommend buying "The Box" and avoiding premium packs -- you'd be paying more for shiny cards).

The deckbuilding interface is easy enough to use once you understand the deckbuilding rules. The way your cards can only exist in one deck at a time is a bit of a pain

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
*STAY AWAY AND DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS*

The game was fun and had a great model of f2p giving you 10k gold & 100 seals" /similar to RP in league/ per level which allowed you to buy packs with random cards for 20k gold or 1k to 1.4k seals. - after completing the pve missions and tutorials you were given enough gold & seals to purchase a deck + hero with gold & an expansion pack with a lot of "wild cards" used to craft any card you desired.

After the 3rd or 4th expansion however everything changed - A new "standard" mode was created for the less OP cards & combos.

Right after the update got live with the new expansion however you no longer received gold or seals for leveling /i stopped at 50 and had friends at 450+/ and the only way to get the new cards for the standard mode was to spend real money. Not long after my friend list of 60 online at day diminished to only 3 which made me abandon the game as well.

Few months later I decided to check on what's going on only to see nobody has logged in months and reading the forums full with posts "This game is abandoned" "The game is no longer being supported" "This has turned into a moneygrab" which in my honest opinion felt that way.

Only few players play and the ones that do are either in denial or have spend too much money to just "let go"."

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I love CCGs, and the Might and Magic universe, and I recommend this game, with warnings.

Overall this is a great game with lots of intricate strategies and very versatile card selection.  It's terribly frustrating.  I love the game and collecting as many of the different cards as I can, and there are some problems with the economy as mentioned in other posts.  I have logged over 900 hours, and 1700 duels.  I currently have 914/996 of the different cards.  Whether you like games like this for the sake of collecting the cards or are just trying to get that 4th Arcane Eagle for your deck, than you should expect to fork out some dough or become a total shut in and dedicate your life to grinding.

The game is very Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.  Luck is a significant factor as well as far as who gets the curse of having to go first.  I know that generally the first turn player statistically will more often get to also attack first, but the second player gets a card draw, a bonus card AND the first player doesn't get to boost their hero on the first turn!   Bizarre.

I like how there are separate 'standard' and 'open' game modes.  Open is for old school players that are fortunate enough to already have a good collection of the best legacy cards.  My mistake was spending so much time trying to grind in open.  Some rebalancing was done, and I am optimistic that there is more to come.  A lot of cards were recently rebalanced and introduced into standard mode.  While I would love to say that I want to see more of this in future expansions, this will bring me to my next point.

COLLECTING

I had set out with the crazy goal to try and get a copy of every single card from every set, as any obsessive collector would.  The only way to get the legacy cards now is by paying, aside from the wildcard farming (and infernal pit) or saving all your gold and waiting every 3 months or so for waiting for Emilio's packs to be available for gold.  Doing this presents a small problem though...

With each expansion, newer stronger cards are coming out that naturally players want to get their hands on as soon as they can to maintain an edge over their competitors.  Particularly, Sins of Betrayal and Time of Renewal especially have introduced a lot of powerful new cards.  So if all of the hard, hard, hard earned gold is needed for the newest, and priciest packs, than you need to decide whether your efforts are to work towards staying competitive, or getting really rare legacy epic cards.  (900 hours and i still don't have Eleonore, unfortunately I started not long before Base Set II came out) This wouldn't be an issue if legacy packs or Emilio's packs were always available for gold, or if you could still earn seals.

Regarding my collection, I'm roughly 2000 wildcards away.  About 800 booster packs...

ECONOMY

Overall, getting cards is slow.  Even with daily achievements (which sometimes take hours to finish), it generally takes a few hours just to get a single pack.

Seals are finite.  After your early achievements, I think you end up with a grand total of 1600 or something.  Enough to get a box and a couple of packs.  Seals are the only everyday way to get old cards and they only available for real money.  They recently became even more overpriced.

Ubisoft needs to reintroduce weekly seals in the login bonuses.  Not necessarily a lot, averaging maybe about 100 a week or so just so players can get cards a little quicker.   I'll compare this model to the Pokemon online CCG, which (up until recently at least) gave a booster pack for every 5 login days.  On login bonuses alone, DoC would get you a free pack after logging in every day for roughly 3 to 4 weeks.  Don't even think about skipping a day or you will reset the week and have to wait even longer for the coveted wildcards.

There are a few basic things that Ubisoft can and should do to drastically improve the economics of the game and put it back on top.

- Seals should be available in the weekly login bonuses, or they need to be WAY less stingy on the number of seals provided for $$
- Emilio's packs should be available for gold at all times
- The infernal pit should offer rares, epics, and heroes more often and way less commons from Base Set II and the timer should be 4 hours, instead of 8
- Better achievement rewards (banners?  ... seriously?)

Some economical improvements and continued balancing and this game would put it on top to stay for a long time to come.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I came back after a year, had good memories of the game. Now it has become just another P2W piece of junk....

Literally the ONLY way to get the vast majority of cards is with real money. Even other card games that are P2W give you the option to grind for ridiulous amounts of time to get cards, but this one doesn't even do that anymore......

I don't know what happened but I am sad to have seen this game so ruined....

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Somehow someone took the lane-based DCG concept and actually made a good game. Good solid depth, good interface, a lot of cards. This is a fun one.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I started playing this game not a while ago and fell in love with it in an instant. In depth strategies, advanced card mechanics and a chess-like deployment structure. While i was playing this i wondered why people even bother play other card games (maybe except magic) due to its awesomness.

Then it hit me. Devs stop adding extra content to this game.

Players shout out for the upcoming death of the game.
So little support for new players (aka wiki, more detailed faqs etc. which means u have to figure some things on your own).
Innumerable crashes leading to extreme frustration.
But the thing is that none of that let me down and i kept playing with the hope that one day the game will revive again and i will have a solid collections of cards to be competitive.
Then came death. Sudden and fast. Forever loading screen while logging in, which seems to be a typical (unresolved) issue, out of many, of this game. Ofc i contacted support but none of them gave a single .
So, there it is. If u manage to play the game i would tell you to carry on as it is by far the most complicated and smartly made card game out there, with the hope that one day will be great again (if Ubi decides to do something at last).
If u cannont play it due to constant crashes,errors and  then search for alts.

10/10 for the flawless game content
0/ 10 for its support

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
It started out as a good game
Now its just pay to wn
No more free cards and some cards and boosters can ONLY be unlocked with real money

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game is engineered to be addictive - beware! You start out rather weak and want to get good cards. But there are thousands of them and so you either need to put in a lot of time or spend money. So you decide to play drafts and accumulate daily rewards to finally get enough to buy a box of cards. Then you buy the box and get a ton of junk and maybe one or two good cards that actually make it into your deck. Why did I waste so much time?

And then there's the game itself. It's pretty easy to get to a somewhat decent ranking. But then you get stuck. What happens is that there are several broken" decks that are pretty much impossible to defeat unless you spend hundreds of hours playing or spending a lot of money. And sometimes the outcomes are pretty much random. Depending on what faction you are playing there are several other factions that will beat you nearly every time.

So combine the frustration of losses you can't do anything about with the frustration of putting in lots of effort for little reward and you realise that there are better uses of your time."

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
A friend introduced me to this game two months ago and I'm having a blast!  The art is absolutely spectacular and the mechanics are quite elegant.  The game offers just the right level of complexity and tactical depth; it's more streamlined than Magic: The Gathering and deeper than Hearthstone.  If you like collectible card games you should really give this a try.  I initially signed up just to play the single player campaign, but the game turned out to be so good that I jumped into the multiplayer arena to keep playing after I finished the campaign.

I read some reviews complaining that the game is buggy or pay to win"

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This is by far one of the best tradingcardgames to play. WAAAAY better than Hearthstone.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Really great TCG game. I've been playing a few TCG since I was a kid and this game has it all. It has great artwork, great PvP match making, and the game mechanics require a lot of skill compared to other TCGs such as Yu-Gu-Oh! and Hearthstone. Definitely something to try to get into since it deserves way more attention and hype.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Very great card game so far. The system is great, card's design looks good, BGM is awesome, Free to play, Matchmaking is good too.

However there are some hindrances in the game which make the game imperfect.

1.Some people abuse the system by surrendering intentionally in order to keep their ELO low and farm newbies. You may face very tough players after cross 500 ELO (ELO is the indicator of the skill of player, more ELO = more skill)

2.After playing for a while, if u don't want to spend real money, u will need an effort to obtain new cards but it is doable.

3.Price for using real money is too high.


Therefore, my score for this game is 8.5 out of 10, It's a fun game for a while, but after playing more than 20 hours, it will left only those who really love card game and love competing with other people or can afford real money.However, after 60 hrs so far without spending real money, this game is still much enjoyable for me : )

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game should be pulled from Steam as it is unplayable after the last patch due to game crashes part way through matches or if using certain cards.This is happening 100% of the time for all players. Pull this game as it has been stated on their forum they are not updating it anymore so should therefore be taken off Steam as they are still charging players for ingame items. A new player to this game could easily think this may be a good game, but as it stands it is unplayable so not even a 'game'. IMO there should be some kind of compensation from Steam for players that has had ingame purchases for this particular game as it is their site that is promoting something unusable as though it is something usable/playable.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
There are many extensive reviews down there, but let's make the long story short:
-The game has great and unique mechanics, it requires a lot of attention and a few OP cards won't really guarantee your victory.
-Runs smooth and without many problems. There are a few bugs here and there, but still nothing serious.
-It does take some grinding (or money) to build a decent deck, but grinding DOES teach you stuff and is worth your time. Haven't played too much, but it does not seem pay to win.
-Also a great single-player experience with a fairly large and rewarding campaign that you can go through and get rewarded 6 times (1 for each of the 6 factions) PLUS some neat mind-teasing puzzles, hope they add more soon!
-Music, design and graphics are a plus.
-It does need you to have a Uplay account, but well, so what? You DO NOT need to pay a single coin to play the game and have access to everything.
My opinion: If you like TCGs, give it a shot with no second thought!

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This is a very good card game with a high level of complexity and strategy. Despite what a lot of the reviews say, it is pretty easy to obtain new cards without having to spend any real money in the game- it is not very hard to get at least one pack per day (Increased gold reward from campaign is a huge contributor to that, but gold from dueling, daily quests and leveling is also generally sufficient).
Small complaints are:
Wildcards, the method for specific card acquisition, are a bit too hard to obtain (you can get 1-5 per week for logging in 7 days in a row, and [after you get to at least Champion I ranking] 3-5 per day from daily quests, which can be hard to finish if you get one that doesn't suit your cards. Rares/epics/heroes from the newest set are 15/24/24 wildcards each, respectively, so obtaining specific cards you are missing can take some time.
Infernal pit could give more gold for the cards you are sacrificing

EDIT: Pending the upcoming major update/expansion, wildcards will no longer be obtained from quests, but as an extra reward from sacrificing cards to the Infernal Pit. Quests that gave WC will now give gold. This may or may not be good- it will take 480 commons to get a recent epic/heroic. But if the gold reward scales evenly with current quests, the new quests should reward an equal amount of WC on average from saccing earned cards.

Legacy cards are virtually locked behind a pay wall. This is only a minor complaint though, because they are only usable in Open format, which isn't the officially supported" format and not usable in the main tournament (Road to Paris)

Other notes: Card artwork is beautiful

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Just look at all those people having hundreds and thousands of hours played, and changing their review to negative after what happened with BlueByte abandoning the game.

Don't spend a dime here, if you decide to play this game instead of one that actually has players and developers around.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
dead game

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game is strongly starting to lean towards Pay To Win.. I decided to quit playing this game.
It doesn't have a thing to do wih Heartstone, I'm just unable to constantly keep up with new expansions and updates that completely change the balance; and then you have to spend many hours (and they hope money too) to update your decks to accomodate the changes..
And the changes are IMHO to the worse with every update :(
Six months ago I would probably recommend this game - not anymore, sorry.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Probably the best TCG out there, best f2p one for sure, and i've played MTG when i was a kid. You can build competitive deck in matter of just few days without spending a penny (game is very rewarding in that regard) and reach high ELO" pretty fast if you know what you are doing. Card design is absolutely gorgeous and can really be compared only to the MTG one. Sincere recomendation to any TCG fan

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
A little easier than Magic The Gathering, more challenging than Hearthstone.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This is a good deep CCG. Most of the Complaints are either false or have been fixed in the new patch. I have pretty much all the cards I want in the game and only paid like $0.06 for 2 steam puzzle/decks (100+ cards) in the market place. I think it's more giving than Hearthstone, I have been playing Hearthstone since beta and still have a bunch of cards i need. The campaigns give a ton of gold/packs and can be completed with all factions for more gold/packs! You start off with 1 deck but earn other decks as u beat their factions or start with all 6 faction decks if you start the game through a referral.

There are weekly promotions like this last week for every Wild Card (WC) you spend, you get 50% back after the weekend. WC are used to buy any cards you want in the Altar of wishes. The WC prices are fair. There is a login bonus system where u just need to log in and get free stuff every day. Playing a game earns you gold and exp. win or lose, and there are daily quests to earn more gold. Leveling up gives a nice chunk of gold enough to buy a pack. There is a Infernal pit where u can burn your extra cards for Gold, WC and if u burn enough you also get a card(the card changes about every 8 hr). Another way to earn packs, gold, WC, etc is to earn achievements, and there are many of them! Also be sure to search for some codes online which give free packs/gold.

It's more strategic than Hearthstone since you have 8 placements to put your creature. You can be offensive or defensive. You can only attack the hero if there is no creature blocking your way. There are 3 different formats, Standard (recommended for new players), Open (Every card can be used here but could be chaotic for new players), and Weekly format which changes every week. There is also 2 tournament mode: Jackpot (chance to earn gold) Swiss (tournament of 8 players where 1-2 place get 2 packs of the last to exp set and and random player that plays all 3 games will get a ticket and a bs2 pack)  I think you should stay away from tournaments until you have reached champion 1 level or think you have a good deck and grasp of the game.

The cards consist of Creatures, Magic, and Fortunes. Most cards have a requirement where you can raise 1 per turn for Might (Creatures), Magic. And Destiny (Fortune). It's pretty simple, the tutorial explain everything clearly. Each Hero has magic school(s) attach to them and can only use spells from that school. There is also Neutral Events where both players can use so pick those out carefully. Try to pay attention to the events, cause I forgot about them when starting out and lost some games cause of it.

Oh and the art work in this is great!

If you use this link, you will start with all 6 decks:
https://signup.duelofchampions.com/portal/index/DOC_world_02_0010_06_200_12_0614_00791SBN

So that's 12 decks you will have after beating all the factions once, and will have lots of extra cards to burn in the pit. You can add me too if u like to chat or play a game :)

I love this game in early days...
but unfortunately Blue Byte bought this game from Ubisoft...

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
One of my most played games until Ubi left everything and made it uplayable for now. I hate Ubisoft :(

Great game, but dead now

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I grew up playing card games, I dabbled with a bit of everything from Yu-Gi-Oh to Pokemon to Magic: The Gathering and so on. Naturally this game caught my attention and after playing it for a few hours, I'm hooked.

What I think makes this game so much more interactive and enjoyable to play is firstly the smoothness of the visuals, gameplay and cutscenes.

The asthetics in this game look absolutely gorgeous, right from the card images to the slick painted backgrounds. Heck, even little things like the smoke clouds that vapourize from cards that go to the graveyard look incredible.

The gameplay is as you'd expect, it's strategic and requires you to think three turns ahead of what's actually happening. There's a tutorial to help new players, (such as myself) into the game, and unlike many other card game tutorials, it's actually incredibly easy to follow and understand. The developers obviously wanted to try easing the player into the game, teaching one thing at a time and slowly building up to the more complex duels and they've done a fantastic job.

The cutscenes are another beauty, but the main thing that really appealed to me is there isn't an unesseccary cutscene after every duel, they're only placed at major events. It's a little thing, but it's a trap that many developers fall into in hope it will enrich the story aspect of the game. I've yet to play through the entire game, but so far it's looking absolutely incredible.

Might & Magic Duel of Champions also has some very nice features, simple features, but definietely welcome. The options menu, for example, includes features to stream directly to Twitch at a press of a button. There's customizable options to allow the player to toggle certain aspects of the game on/off, simple, but things like in-game cutscenes, fast dueling etc. It's simple I agree, but little things just make the game richer and more enjoyable to play.

The game also has some very interesting features in terms of how to manage increasing your deck size, or purchasing new cards. You can win the resources to purchase cards/boosters etc from the store from dueling, or you can choose to pay for the resources through microtransactions. Normally I would be highly against this, seeing as players could pour money into buying endless booster packs to build an incredibly powerful deck, but when the resources are as easerily obtainable from in-game playing, the need to purchase content with money seems like it would only be used by those 'hardcore' players who aim to collect every card. The beginners decks and the amount of obtainable resources in-game are generous too, it's not as if the developers have given you a horrible deck, only to go online and be destroyed. This kind of balance makes every duel, regardless of skill level a blast to play.

Games aren't without faults though, and this game has it's own. For one microtransactions to many will seem negative and as much as I'm ok with it in this particular title, I personally would have preffered the game a little more had it not been implemented. I understand why they've included it though and it does seem fair seeing as Might & Magic Duel of Champions is free to play, so that can be argued both ways.

The menu that greets you for first time play is a little daunting. There's buttons and menus everywhere, which after an hour of playing seemed perfectly easy to use and navigate, but for first time play it can through many players off from playing, so just be warned.

The in-game music is very nice as fitting, but after a while can become a little boring and dull. I imagine it probably becomes a little more varied late game, but for the most part I play this game whilst listening to my own music, perhaps a few of you may feel the same way.

I could continue to ramble, there is a tone of things to mention and talk about, but for the most part if you're either a fan of card games or stratgies, I highly recommend you try this out. Heck, just try it out even if you don't like card games. It's a very slick title with some of the smoothest presentations I've seen in a game for a long time.

Do yourself a favour, try this title out. It's an absolute blast to play.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/100. ~ A beautiful strategic card game that's easy enough to learn for beginners, but in-depth enough for veterans.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
excellent ccg, been playing for 10 days straight!

gold and packs are plenty at the start - with all the campaign missions, achievements and quests,
its quite easy to build a good deck without spending money.

the wildcard mechanic is pretty nice as well - you can craft specific cards,
and you get those with daily quests! (as you reach champion level, like i did already)

tournaments are easy to access, balance seems a bit off like in every card game,
especially with editions focused on certain classes, but im having a blast so far!

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I have played various card games since 2004. Although many have been playing longer than I have I still feal as though I have the authority to review this card game based on the endless hours and dedication I've put into card games.

Accessability:

This is the easiest to get started free to play game that I have ever participated in. There are good rewards for a campaign mode that teaches the basics of the game, there is a crafting system, and there are daily rewards for playing. Overall, I have yet to spend money on the game, but I'm happy with my collection and deck I have been able to build. I have played for less than a month. You can use actual money to advance if you wish.

This is also a easy game to learn, Even as an easy game to learn, there are many options during every turn so there is a challenge using the most basic decks against real players and the later computer players in campaign mode.

4.5/5

Only a totally free all cards accessible immediatley type of game would be better in my opinion, but there are drawbacks to having everything at the start of the game. The game can be picked up quickly, but offers a deep sense of strategy.

Flavor:

The artstyle of the game is comparable to that of Magic the Gathering. They are comparable in that this game draws inspiration from a number of fantasy areas; mideival, japanese, and middle eastern are a few of these fantasy realms that are drawn from. Additionally, this particular game doesn't feature art that is as dark and hard to distinguish as Magic the Gathering. If Magic the Gathering was Diablo 1 and Hearthstone was Diablo 3, then this game is in between when concerned with the art assets.

5/5

This is a great aesthetic for a competitive fantasy game that wants to be taken seriously.  The art assets are memorable and work very well with the card effects.

Mechanics:

There are quite a few interesting, mechanically wise, things going on in this game that are not featured in many other games.

First, card zones matter. This is a feature non-existent in many card games, but as creatures may only attack opposing creatures that are directly across from themselves and because creatures can be made less vulnerable to attack by putting them on certain board tile players do best by strategizing how to move and initially position their creatures on the game board.

Second, creatures health totals do not automatically heal every round - creatures keep the damage that they take throughout the game. Creatures are also, as mentioned above, only vulnerable to attack in certain board positions. Together these parts of the game come together to create a lasting investment in the cards that have already been developed onto the board. Players may strategize how to keep their creatures around so that they may stifle a future assault or begin to pressure the opponents life total without engaging the opponent's creatures.

Third, attacking isn't always free. If a creature does not kill an opponent's creature with it's attack, then the attacking creature is vulnerable to retaliation damage. Attacking therefore becomes something more strategic than automatic.

Fourth, there are multiple costs to playing a card. Not only do cards have a mana cost, but they also have a threshold costs. There are three separate resources, other than mana, that players have the option of adding to every turn. Overall, these other resources add another layer of depth to card balance, deck building, and game play. Additionally, card zones and deck size are other limited resources that also may need to be managed during longer and more complicated games.

4.5/5

These are just the mechanics that I find most interesting. These mechanics are rare to find in a good card game, but they all come together well to create a challenging experience in this game. This game also has very good use of key words that facilitate the understanding of what cards do. The room for improvement here is a few rules based questions about not being able to always predict what will happen without having experienced the given situation beforehand.

Playability:

This game has curtailed some of the more annoying occurrences in card games with it's standard format and general card balance. Many times non-interactive combo strategies and rush strategies can be frustrating and impossible to stop in games. Although those types of strategies do exist in this game, they are not game breaking. The amount of damage that a player can deal in one turn, in a long back and forth game, is hardly unexpected. This is not Yu-Gi-Oh! or Hearthstone where players will be able to reliably leverage their card economy into fast and lethal damage.

This game gets deck and card diversity right. All too often do card gamers consider deck diversity to be an automatic good. All too often deck diversity comes with the cost of imperfect knowledge about the opponent's deck and degenerate strategies. As I said in the previous paragraph, most strategies are interactive in this game. There is a real focus on combat and life managmnt in the game. Additionally, players are limited from playing every single card in every single deck and therefore players will be able to reliably predict the threats that an opponent may have - the issue of losing because of the opponent happening to be using a different strategy than expected isn't a problem.

4/5

The point lost here is because of some balance issues. There are times, as in any game, where the opponent has a specific hand of cards that cannot be beaten. This is more of a issue with deck based games than this specific game, but there still will be a few games that will feel bad and that will be out of your control. The most recent set also has some very powerful cards that are difficult to interact with. This game does fall into the trap of allowing rare cards to be overpowered and there are also times when you will have no silver bullet available to use against the opponent, but, again, that only occurs twenty percent or a low amount of the time.

Total:

4.5/5

This game does live up to it's claim of being the best online free to play card game.

There are more things that I could have mentioned, but that would not have changed the score. Stop reading this review and go play the game already.

Play through campaign as quickly as possible as that has the biggest rewards in terms of free cards.

Once you reach a certain rank, then you will be given daily quests that are very generous.

Try to only use your wildcards for crafting heroic, epic, and rare cards. Also always uncheck hide duplicate on the crafting page so that you can find the lowest crafting price for the card you want.

If you get a referral link to play the game you will start with extra cards, but do not ask me for a referral link as that goes against the terms of my posting this review.

occasionally check the online forums for promo codes as they will be occasionally released and grant you free cards.

I still enjoy this game, but it IS pay to win. There is no doubt about that.

How bad IS this game?

I was previously part of the Development Team that created this game, we was previously working on a game called Project Decay. This game basically followed the trend of sh*tty simulator games trying to suck money out of you.

I got this for free from MoWah, a friend of mine who also was on the team. It has no future, no enjoyment and definitely not worth any of your valuable money. Do not buy this game, PLEASE.

Oh su funi and random eks di eks di. Okay, the fun's over. Absolute rock bottom. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind stupid ways to have fun. I even found Goat Simulator (at least slightly) amusing, because - say what you want about it, but it clearly included some work being done, the city was filled with easter eggs, stuff to do, there were achievements, workshop support, etc. The developer is claiming that this is not trying to be Goat Simulator, but I'm absolutely sure this piece of software tried to go the same way while completely missing the point, offering no fun, basically no gameplay and failing at being funny.

The developer of this piece software completely misuderstood the point of Goat Simulator and thought that [insert random word here] Simulators are funny, because they are poorly made and you can't do anything there. Also making this type of simulator" now is not even beating a dead horse

First off i don't know if I am missing something or the plus reviews are fakes.  Could go either way.  I normally NEVER review a game but after running this software (was no playing and definately not a game) and reading what other people say.  I loaded it up in every mode and for one I couldn't kill anything. I brought up the guns and blasted away But at point blank range it didn't hurt or even leave a mark on a cow or on the cutouts in the Shooting Range"
I ran around and it just ended after a few minutes in teh "classic" mode

This game is a piece of . Why was it Greenlit?
All you do as far as I can tell is walk around in the grass and maybe shoot a gun eventually. That's it. Nothing else. You walk around in the grass. It reminds me of an old default Windows screensaver, just walking around in a field. And maybe shooting targets. I don't know, I couldn't even get to that. I get terrible FPS on such a tiny game, but that might just be my computer. But I can run TF2 and DayZ better than this - both games I'd rather be playing.
This game attempts to be funny, and to be a joke, but it fails at even that. It's a complete piece of , not a game, not a joke, NOTHING!
Maybe, MAYBE at some point in the distant future this game will be worth $10, but right now - not at ALL.
0/10 I would never reccomend ever.

What the actual . This game" completely misses the point of simulator games. Surgeon simulator was fun because it was a satire on how serious surgery is.

There is literally nothing to do in this 'game'. Buggy as hell, unoptimized piece of junk. Even getting this for free I feel ripped off.

Please forgive me for helping this crap pass through greenlight for the promise of a free key.

Grass Simulator
The game has seven gameplay modes. They are:
-Wandering through a completely empty grassy field that has NOTHING to do
-A tiny shooting range with no scoring or other mechanics
-Staring at a flat 2-D image of grass that gradually gets bigger
-Standing in a field with cows that spin in place while one dubstep music track plays
-Wandering through a completely empty snowy allley that has NOTHING to do
-Standing in a field with static teleporting cows while one disco" music track plays
-Staring at a "searching for online server" screen that never goes away

If you play the game for any slightly extended period of time the game glitches so that none of the modes work until you exit the game (even the exit game button stops working)

This game is a joke that is not funny. I implore you: do not buy this game and encourage this idiocy. This is just crapping out something that only a cynical man would call a game and selling it as satire. If this game were a real joke

Do you LOVE MEMES?
Do you REFRESH 9GAG EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR FOR THE LATEST MEMES?
Do you BROWSE /HM/ (here are the memes) ALL DAY?
Then you'll still only play this game for a max of 30 minutes because just like all the other  sims it's really boring.
This  even flaunts that it is about grass and there are no features. Why would you spend money on this?
And on top of that, your non-content only works like 1/3 of the time.

This is the perfect example of a game that doesn't belong on steam. A game like this should be free atleast until it is finished, and Grass Simulator is far from finished.

Grass Simulator
This review is split into two sections; the first section lists pros and cons, and the second section features a short review.

Pros and ConsCons:
Extremely badly optimised, if at all.
Very boring gameplay.
Very repetitive gameplay.
Not compatible with all the resolutions it suggests it can use.
Bad menu systems.
Uses the default Unity launcher interface.
Pros:
The icon is cute.
ReviewWhy does this software, that's right I'm calling it software because it's not even remotely like a game, even have the words grass" and "simulator" in the title? It is not a simulation game at all and doesn't even try to be remotely satirical such as other popular simulation games such as Surgeon Simulator. Want to be satirical in your titles? You should have called this A Game rather than the title it was published with.

I dont even understand how this was able to get greenlit nor do I understand why its out of early access. I got this game for free and I still feel cheated.

I was extremely curious as to how this was able to get greenlit and so I did some googling. It turns out that the developer bribed members of a popular game gifting website to vote for his game in exchange for free keys.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ggs7CuUF18

Developers like this should be banned.

This is babys first Unity game and its abysmal.

tl;dr: If you want to play a better game I suggest you try Bad Rats."

It's not a game, it's not a simulator, it's just stupidity. Our? Because we voted for something like this and got it here? Or maybe somebody from Steam? Because they accepted this to their platform?
I remember that people used to release demos like that in internet and ask others what they think about it. Mostly on some tutorial forums, to show some progress that some begginer programmer or somebody else made etc. but this isn't even something that can rated.
Price label says it's 9,99. For what? Early Access with almost nothing. Few shoots, some music that sounds like broken fishing boat and most ugly grass ever. It just takes to add comedy/parody" to make it a whole different experience. Glad I got it like everyone

I really do not know how to feel about this game.

$5 is pretty ridiculous for what this offers and truthfully, it should still be in early access.
There's no real... gameplay. For real. There's no real gameplay.
I'm being serious here. Check this video:

I went through all the game modes and yeah. No proper gameplay.
Of course nothing else than this is really advertised as the game itself... but still...

It doesn't feel like game. It feels like an early, early beta for a survival experience or something.
I'm not meaning to be rude to the developers but it really shouldn't have been released in this state... That or at least the price should be brought down drastically. It's basically an open world made in Unity (or a similar engine) with some simple scripts, models and nothing much else. If the devs are indeed serious about this game and are working to make it better then okay... but if not: then this game doesn't really have a point and you shouldn't buy it right now.

Early Access Review

I mean, sure, it's a joke game but this game shouldn't be in early access, this.... early. You might want to save your money for now: Wait til this game eventually gets more content. That's actually worth.....playing.

Regardless though, I really can't help but wonder what the joke behind this game is. The idea makes no sense and while it sounds funny, it's really just boring.

If the devs really wanted to make this worth a lot of people's times, they should had began development long ago and released the game when it was complete.

As a supporter of the idea of a wacky and insanely strange game akin to Goat Simulator, I am really dissapointed. This could had been handled a bit better.

Lets Start off with posting the Positive things about this game ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ok now thats over and done with lets move onto the negative parts about this game.

You walk around in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do and nothing to achieve
When you decide to shoot a cow it takes about 15 shots to kill it and then it does the obvious thing that a cow would do in any other game when it dies and proceeds to explode.
Im not sure if this was a bug or not when i played the game but my guns would not reload after i used the 1st clip.

I was also part of the development team on their community forums for a number of months. The lead developer of this game promised me a key distributer job a number of months back and just ended up ignoring me even when the distribution was going on and then removed me from my moderator status on the forum for no apparant reason.

So to make a long story short

The Devs suck The Game sucks Dont buy this

Im honestly embarrassed that i was part of the dev team for this game

It also says it all that majority of the positive reviews are reviews saying stuff like: I love it because i like grass

It's stupid, and not the gloriously stupid of Goat Simulator, just regular disappointing stupid.

You walk around in a small area with invisible walls keeping you in the area and there's absolutely nothing to do at all.

The fact it's $10 and not $1 (or less) is . At that price it's genuinely irritating and not even something you should get 'for the lulz'. Spend your money on 10 copies of Bad Rats instead.

Although this game was very entertaining and very fun to play for ten minutes, all in all, based upon the content, it's a waste of money. It doesn't cost much, no, but you do have better games for the same price to spend your money on.

Classic Mode:
Has no objective at all. You walk around in a reasonably small world filled with a single cabin, grass, fences, trees and cows with buggy heads. Shooting the cows makes them explode but once you've seen that once and you've giggled - do you want to see it again?

Grass Mode:
Why would you even put this into a game? You don't spend money on a game to watch grass grow. You can't move or equip anything. All you do is sit in your chair and watch grass grow. Paint-Drying simulator will be the next release.

Dubstep Mode:
I laughed for about six miliseconds. Stingy cow animations with some tacky lighting effects and some terrible dubstep music. Putting two-and-two together, yes, it's just spinning cows dancing to music. Done.

Ranged Mode:
Um, this is meant to be a Grass Simulator"

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Guilty of being an impulsive buyer, this is one of the few games I've bought on a whim that has surprised me greatly. Fun and fast enough and mildly complex enough to keep me intrigued. It's cheap, buy it already!

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Lets start with what I didn't like with the game.
1. Controls:
-The Map interaction really shows that this was made for a touchdevice to begin with, it's a thing to get used to but annoying when you are new to the game.
- Combat is a just watching the game play itself as you will auto attack instantly and consistently as soon as an enemy is comes close. You have your Manual attacks that is an Uppercut or a Slam (downward) attack but they are weak unless you wait long enough for your auto-attack to build up enough rage (skulls on the top) to make them stronger. This is fine for a touchgame when you have a limited amount of buttons" to use to not disturbe you visual of the screen for the gameplay but a huge flaw when you have an actual controller to play with. For me this was a really fun draining aspect of the control.

Otherwise the movement is very solid and responsive and you can get a really good flow (wich is needed with combat mechanics mentioned above.

Graphics

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Before I start this review I'd like to say that I do like the work that Hexage does and have immensely enjoyed some of their mobile apps. I must say however that Reaper: Tale of a Pale Swordsman" looks nice

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Reaper: Tale of a Pale Swordsman has a lot of good things going for it, especially the price. It's an interesting combination of platformer and RPG that's addictive and will keep you hacking and slashing through level after level. There are only a few drawbacks that keep it from achieving a perfect score.

The Great:
1. The graphics are colorful and fun to look at.
2. The pacing keeps you going through the game, hacking your way through level after level.
3. Great sound effects and soundtrack help make the gameplay even better.
4. Excellent Price
5. Action-packed
6. Very easy to pick up and start playing!

The Bad:
The only major bad elements are related to the controls of the game. They're not terrible, but they can seem clunky at times. Every once in awhile you'll find yourself frustrated as a result, but this is a minor drawback to an otherwise excellent game.
I'm recommending Reaper, and look forward to what else the developers have to offer.

It's what you'd expect from a mobile port and then some - The controls are a bit clunky, but you get used to them over time. The plot isn't really there, the fighting is, at times, impossible (Screamer jumps are uninterupttable).

But the gameplay itself is so easy to pick up that I just find myself just... enjoying the experience. The ranking system gives a sense of progress, as do the constant quests.

I'd imagine that if a full-sized dev team were to take Reaper and flesh it into a full game, it would be amazing.

8/10, Slicing through everything in sight is awesome

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Reaper Tale Of A Pale Swordsman was a game made for mobiles. Once again, it shows. The art is beautiful, but the game runs at 30FPS and has that certain 'slow-mo' feeling sometimes. But it's not intentional, let me say that.

I've played it for a couple of hours now and all you're doing is walk from one point to another, while completing quests and defeating enemies. Quests consist of fetch quests and kill quests. Fetch quests have you run to several places on the map to collect stuff. But it's just clicking on the map. Your character doesn't have to do anything here. The kill quests, of course, let you kill enemies. These enemies range from simple to moderately hard. You'll be using your skills (quests grant you XP and allow you to level up resulting in several skills you can unlock) and the combat system to complete these. The skills usually let you have more health, or do more damage so there's not much variety here, but the combat system is a bit unique.

Walk towards an enemy and you'll be auto-attacking it. Auto-attacking gives you skulls and the more skulls you collect the more damage you can dish out if you decide to manually attack. I wouldn't say it's a deep system, but you have to use a bit of strategy to defeat some of the tougher enemies or if there are a lot of enemies spawning. Unfortunately, it's the only positive thing I have to say about this game.

Because it's clearly made for phones and the gameplay is just too shallow to be enjoyed on the PC I just can't recommend this game. Skip.

This is a very well polished and fun game with a lot of content at a low price.  I have a full video review here

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
There are a lot of things to like about this game. The RPG mechanics are wonderful - equips feel unique and useful, and the customization on level-up is very well done. Character design is cute, and the art style overall is quality. It seems to me that this game would have high replay value.

However, actual gameplay, the most important part of the game, feels clunky and unresponsive. The autoattack mechanic is inspired, but not executed well. I found myself using unempowered manual attacks for the most part. The worst part of the combat, for me, was that it rarely felt like it was my fault for getting hit. This is hugely important - when you take damage, it should be because you did something wrong (except special circumstances like trading hits), and you should be able to learn from your mistake and avoid it in the future. When I got hit, it rarely felt deserved. Melee attacks from enemies have wonky hitboxes, most notably, and avoiding them feels more like a battle with the game's design  than with the game itself. Dashing feels extremely clunky. The input (double tap a direction) provides too long a window, and I found myself dashing accidentally when I was only trying to adjust my position precisely. This led to frequent dashes off ledges (falling deals 50 damage, half of your base life) and just as often straight into projectile attacks, as dashing does not provide any invulnerability frames. This was really frustrating to deal with, and the rest of the gameplay just couldn't make up for this and other shortcomings.

I really wanted to like this game, and there were definitely many well-done aspects, but it failed to provide an enjoyable experience overall due to just a few small, consistent problems.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Last month Android and iOS users were treated to Reaper  Tale of a Pale Swordsman, a side-scrolling action rpg akin to Rogue Legacy on the PC. Reaper however plays a lot more like a traditional RPG than the aforementioned, forgoing the rouge-like elements of its inspiration.  While it does effectively utilize many rpg elements well, its definitely not perfect. However, developers Hexage of Radiant Defense notoriety arent kidding themselves and only ask $5 for their PC port. All in all its absolutely worth the time and money.

The core of the title is the combat, a 2d hackfest of the slowest kind. While you would imagine a title like this to warrant flashy moves and twitch gameplay, it has a very slow deliberate pace which can be attributed to its mobile roots. While your movement speed is upgradable as you level up, the game still sports a pacing better suited for a touchscreen than a battlestation. That being said once you get used to the deliberate pacing the game actually tends to open a little.
While we are keeping in mind that this is pretty much a direct port of the mobile title, there were a few gripes we have. First and foremost is the inclusion of an auto attack. For a mobile game this feature makes sense, but the fact that it was not made optional for the PC port hurts this title, especially due to the fact that its the catalyst of the games combat system. As you walk up to enemies without pressing any button whatsoever your character will be begin chopping away...

Played this game on windows store and loved the free version I am so glad this got green lighted

IM SO HAPPY :)

but realy try this game


Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Don't know how this game has mixed reviews. Mobile game in every sense of the word. In the game, you are this character that goes around this world map doing fetch quests and killing people for tribesman and guards. You load a straight little area and kill everyone on it and thats it. The game never changes. I was doing the same thing from the start to the end. You fight the same 10 different unit types. There are no new abilities, power, weapons, etc. The combat is the worst I've ever seen. You auto attack in true mobile fashion. You also have attacks that use rage, but to build that up you have to auto attack. Which means standing in range of the people that can attack you and trade blows. There is no dodging or blocking. You can use your other attacks without rage but not only do they do little damage, they suddenly don't have knockback or stun for some reason. This means you can't stop the enemies from hitting you right back, since they always do, but you can be stunned by them. So basically you have to stand there and get hurt in order to build up rage to hurt them......because you know, mobile game with sh!t design. The game evolves  by just adding more guys on screen to kill, and having them shoot tons of projectiles, and you dodge it like a bullethell. There are spikes and pits and fire and things that keep you from jumping and landing, and aren't there for any particular reason other than to be annoying. The objects in the background don't even make sense. There will be a tall stone pillar, and if you jump up onto the top of it, instead of standing on it, you do a little bounce off it, same with piles of rocks, because the develops were too lazy to program them differently than the weeds and thorns and everything else you bounce off of. There is no healing. You only get items from visiting the 1 blacksmith from time and time again, but the items don't look different and don't ever change, you always use a sword, and no items make a reasl difference other than a minor stat bonus. You level up and get boring upgrades like increased damage and health. My favorite sign of the amature design is the enemy types on the levels. I supposed to be fighting military guards, but for some reason along with them there were bees fighting me; oh yes I forgot the military employs killer bees to work for them *facepalm*. Or another level I was told to kill this evil bear in his lair, yet I was fighting boars most of the level; oh yes I forgot giant bears enlist the service of boars to guard them.....*facepalm*. They were both clearly done by just throwing random enemies on levels to make them longer.

Quests objective locations are purposefully on the other side of the map, so that you have to run there and back, making the long trek more likely to get attacked along the way, so they can pad the game length even more, a cheap tactic. And unlike any other game with random wilderness encounters, there is no option to run or get away or even die to stop from having to fight the random encounter, because you know, that somehow makes sense. Gold drops from people, but for some odd reason when people die it just goes flying to the sides of the screen so you can barely collect any. But no worries, by the end you will be ignoring gold because you'll have way too much and nothing to spend it on.There is no real story. You got around doing random quests that are incoherent in any sort of plot. You have to help locals and the invading men, for some reason. There are diologue options, but they amount to ask for more money" or "say no to quest" but even that is poorly done

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Had this game on kindle fire and loved it. got it on here and love it even more with controller rather then touch control. deffinetly worth the 5 dollors to get it

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game is a bit of a strange experience for me. I WANT to like it, but it constantly decides to be frustrating in exactly he wrong ways. I've seen reviews that say this game required skill, I found the opposite. Skill took the back seat, and instead luck was the ruler of the day. For those who don't want to read the long version, I'd say this: if I'd paid more than the $5 I got it for, I'd feel ripped off. As it is, this game is very flawed execution of a good idea, which still manages to have short stretches of good fun. The fairly unforgiving nature of the game, what with no real defense options makes it somewhat of a strange sell for casual gamers (which seems to be the target audience), but hey, seems to be working for a lot of people according to other reviews. Can't say that I agree with how many people recommend the game.

So it basically seems that Reaper was meant to be a bit like an RPG lite, where you could play a few quests and have a bit of fun, not having to get too bogged down in a really in-depth game. Well, right there I'll say that if you like the kind of complex stories that RPG's are generally known for, this story is gonna feel a bit like Plot

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
For me this is on my cool casual list - games that I play almost every day for a short time.

I'm not usually to write one of these, and that should show how strongly I feel. I'm not going to blindly rag on this game, the developers definitely did some things right and for $5 none of us should be expecting the next Shadows of the Colossus in regard to quality and originality. However, the fact that:

1. I am unable to block in a hack-and-slash RPG where I don't have range attacks
2. There is a too clear recycling of the same enemies for far too long, with very little different between enemy types anyway
3. Stale and repetitive dialogue/quests
4. Repetitive/unimaginative upgrade system and weak gear/items
5. No real immersion or reason that pushes you keep wanting to play

These things really are things that kill enjoyment of the game and seriously affect the gameplay and experience.

For its price I got a couple of solid hours of entertainment out of it before yawning and discarding it into the pile of games that simply weren't good enough to bother finishing, and I guess perhaps that isn't too bad considering its a low priced indie title. Either way, I expected more and was simply so very underwhelmed and disappointed.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Action RPG meets Sidescroller. But don't let that fool you. Simple controls, you can also use a controller if you like, but I doubt that would make much difference.

Single player story mode, and an increasing in difficulty challenge mode. You don't have your story mode gear in the challenge mode. Not sure if I like that separation.

Pros:
+ beautiful graphics and effects
+ very easy controls
+ cute hero :-)
+ auto-attack (it was a mobile game first)
+ real ARPG, don't let the cute graphics fool you

Cons:
- once in a quest, you have to finish it before you can do anything else.
- story is not the best out there, but not the worst either.
- challenge mode has separate gear
- getting the money from killed enemies is a challenge, so you don't always get what you deserve

Recommended for it's price. It's even cheaper now if you get it in the Humble Weekly Bundle: Brawlers" now."

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Anticipated this game since i saw it on greenlight, and i was NOT disapointed. Absolutely love the game!

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Nice fun little action RPG with pretty graphics and a decent story.
It kept me pretty engaged the whole way through with it's simple yet satistfying combat mechanics.
20 hours playing this game went by like nothing.
Plus, it's pretty cheap.
cool little game

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
It is a wonderful game! I never get tired of it... The runing around to turn in quests get boring, and I love how they give you random battles along the way. It really keeps the game fun. You might be thinking, $5.00 that must be some kind of, a trick... It's probably not fully featured. Has to be some flaw. I'm here to say to you, NO, it is a full featured game, wl awesome cartoony  graphics, yet they don't miss out on blood! I'd rate it, 8/8 because my favorite number is eight.(It is perfectly symetric!)

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game to me looks like a mentally limited offspring of Odin Sphere, except that the pacing of combat is boringly slow, and you get stuck in combat phases without the chance of / and because you can't wander off to muscle up.

And of course this is yet another mobile port on PC that seemingly didn't live with the opportunities of a bigger platform. The art is pretty enough but the dev could have walked the extra mile with some amateur voice acting. That only would made a big difference as it may have made the game feel more like a whole PC game.

I'm not hating the game though, I just see its existence more justified on a retro platform. It would have been awesome on 8-16 bit consoles/microcomputers where I expect less.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Picked it up on a whim.  Was not expecting much.  Happily surprised. Out of seemingly nowhere difficulty spikes aside- really am enjoying this little indie jewel. Haven't finished it yet, tho. 7/10

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
It's a mobile phones port, yes. It's not really gripping, yes. The fighting is always the same, yes. However the plot is kinda neat and also the abillities you can get are also interesting.
Well. This game is all the matter of your taste. It's rather a casual game and not everyone might enjoy it. Though I still recommend it.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
The first time I tried this game on my Android phone I was blown away, never before had I seen such a great game with such a colorful and excelent art style.

And naturally after playing the first 10 lvls, that were in the game, before you had to upgrade to one of 3 versions, i chose the 3 star version just to support the devs of the game. To my big surprise it was released on Steam and for me this was an instant purchase, no questions asked. It might just be a straight port, which does not bother me what so ever, because it is an awesome and fun game.

So instant purchase for me, well worth the 5

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
A hack and slash games with beautiful graphics and smooth 2D animations.
There is a story mode and a pure hack & slash mode. You can move around
the map in story mode and visit different locations and fight monsters.
You can by stuff at certain traders and there is a level up system which keeps
the game interesting.

The main core in this game are the randomly generated levels including random enemies.
There are different enemies with different attack pattern that makes the gameplay challenging.

The downside of this game is the lack of different features.
Well, it's a hack & slash game but it gets tiresome and boring
due to the pretty long gamelength.

I don't recommend this game for achievement hunters.
There are achievements where you have to spend a
ridiculous amount of time to get it.

Let's say in 10 hours you are done with the story mode but if you
want all the achievement you better invest +30 hours more :D
You have been warned.

All in all a decent hack & slash game with a reasonable price.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Great game, fun gameplay, amazing story, perfect controls on PC as well as on Mobile devices. I love it. Definitely recommended. Hours of gameplay. Hexage delivered!

old school style, nice art, easy to play but hard to stop playing. Really good game 8/10

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
I had so much fun playing this game! I've played about 10-20 minutes of it and I'm already addicted. It's very simple, but I'm really having a blast with it. I recommend it to any side-scrolling, adventure/fighting lover!

I did a little video on it too, heres an idea of what to expect in the game! (If you want to have a look) :D

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This is quite an entertaining game. For an indie game, it does provide a decent amount of gameplay time. Controls are simple and the difficulty is not too frustrating. Definitely something I would play to relax.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game is incredibly fun. I thouroughly enjoy every aspect of it. Highly recommend.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This is a great game. The artwork is good, gameplay is good (ie the story isnt slow, it doesnt get too repetitive), and the controls are alright. In my opinion, it is a great sidecrolling RPG. I think for a price of $4.99 this is a great game.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Reaper is an absolutely beautiful game in every sense!
I saw this game on greenlight a little while back and I knew right then that this game was gonna be great

I don't even know where to start on praising this game!

For one, right from the start the game is gorgeous. The hand-drawn art is amazing and the soundtrack is even better. The atmosphere of the game is just so cool.

The gameplay is also very entertaining.
One of the things I really dislike about modern side-scrollers is that they're all way too easy - but this isn't at all the case for Reaper. This game has the perfect amount of challenge to it - not so easy that you get bored right away, and not too hard that you hate yourself after dying about a hundred times. The controls are very unique and very easy to get used to.

I cannot stress how great this game is!
Everything this game promises, it delivers.
And it's the perfect prce at $5!

I give this excellent game a 9/10
Must buy

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game can get addicting and it is very simple to play. The game is smooth and everything looks beautiful. This is so worth the 5 bucks i spent. 9/10

This game was an impulse buy for me and OH MY GOD it is so worth the $4.99.  I've only played about an hour and am already hooked.  It's a good fun time waster.  Just buy it already, you know you want to.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman is an interesting take on the action-RPG genre, with elements of 2D brawlers and choice-based narrative thrown into the mix. But how well does it combine all those elements, and can a mobile game really live up to the standard of similar titles for the PC?

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
I wish steam would offer us a rating system rather then a simple; recommend yes or no. As i can't simply give this a yes or no is it worth playing. I guess if you looking for a cheap game to while away the hours of your life...then yes it is worth it. But if you like a bit of substance to you time waster games then i say your in the wrong ball park all together find sir...or madam.

It is a pretty looking game, its art style is very nice and is what drew me to this game in the first place but when we get to the game aspect...well its a little sloppy. If you are using a control pad the two screens that show you whats what is jumbled and makes it a little hard to figure out what to press to do what. As well as the quick tutorial bit seems pointless. At first i though this was going to be a button masher but the joy of button mashing was taken away from me as you simply walk into enemies to kill them.Sure you can jump around like a monkey on crack to get out of the way of the many spamming attacks of the enemy. Or you can spam you very own spinning sword of death move to victory. As i have found be the case of the game.

As for story? well what story. You are a pale swords man who wakes up in a cave (presumably a grim reaper) and the first few dialogues happens and i lost interest. The story does nothing to keep you with it and is dull. The few times i stopped to try and see where this was going. All i saw was the pale swordsman just sounding like he was shouting at everyone, since all his lines are in caps. An no matter what you say, you just sound like an uncaring . Though this could be some witty portrayal that death is cold and uncaring and doesn't chose sides. That or im looking to deep into a game that seem to have no point what so ever....like life one could say.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
If I had to compare this to any other game, I would say it is most similar to Dust. Sidescrolling hack and slash platformer with quests and random encounters on a world map. Haven't explored other game modes, but exploring the wilderness and playing the story is pretty fun. Good art.

This game is lackluster at best, you can see its mobile game roots very fast in the game play.

It's worth the 5 bucks, but don't count on it being worth it for that long.

Worth a try, but don't expect much from it.....


Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
If you want a challenge, here you ing go. Jesus Christ. I wouldn't say the game is too hard for me, I just get stressed very easily and this game is by far one of the most insanely frustrating games with some of the most annoying enemies that I have ever seen. After doing entire fights late in the game and getting whittled down to a few health then just barely dying on a red soldier level and having to do the entire 20min fight over again, I've had enough. One of the most frustrating games I have ever played besides Teleglitch. Probably even more frustrating than that game. Everything is fine until you get to a level of tons of red soldiers and then you get to see the game's wild difficulty spikes. It's getting so frustrating and repetitive that it's not funny. The graphics are good and the controls are good but the problem comes from there being a screen full of projectiles and enemies and your guy is just a damage sponge with no armor or block value. You have block value but it only counts towards melee attacks. So late in the game if you don't have the ability that lets you get 1hp per coin picked up, then good luck on a level that spawns in a ton of the floating blue tribal masks, which are one of the most annoying enemies I have ever seen since they float away from you while doing dmg to you. The levels with the red soldiers would take too long to explain why they are so frustrating so just wait and you will see what I mean.

Tons of unblockable ways to take dmg, incredibly annoying enemies, and mind bendingly repetitive gameplay. What you do in the tutorial is basically what you will be doing for the rest of the game. The game isn't too hard for me, just too annoying. When a game is this repetitive, having to replay the same very long stage with the same incredibly frustrating enemies gets old real fast. It also feels like playing a Mass Effect game because you will do as much reading as actually playing. If I would have read all of the pointless text in the game up to this point I would probably still be back at level 15 instead of 32. The one really cool point for this game which is really brilliant is that it automatically auto attacks when you are close to an enemy, saving a lot of wear and tear on your thumb. Every button masher should do this. Every single ing one of them.

I got it in a bundle for a dollar and got about 8 hours out of it and that is plenty. So it can be fun for a good while, but I don't need any more because frustration aside, it is just way too repetitive. Probably the most repetitive game I've played in years.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This is a brilliant game, so glad I spent my extra $5 on this game! I'm also thinking of doing a giveaway of this game on my Youtube Network. :)

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman

Simple, Fun, not demanding of your pc to be able to handle, and best of all affordable! Totally worth 5 dollars for this title!

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
very good, lacking in some areas but addicting, 9/10

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
this game s incredibly fun, well polished, magnificent art, and a great story. the random ambushes somtimes can be a little annoying but its not that bad. the only thing i ask is that a sequel will be made because the story...man.the pale one must continue.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Umm, does someone wanna go ahead and uh, find the image of the Greed tarot card? Yeah, that'd be great.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Unbiased point of view that has pros and cons.
Pros: A great story line and it is fun for a 5 dollar game
Cons: No options thta most games have, feels more like an app game then an actual pc game which is what the game originally was( an app). Controls are delayed sometimes like the space space combo lags no matter how fastly pressed or if the Reaper is not moving or not.
Overall I rate it a 6/10 it is fun and I enjoy playing it but it should of had better pc controls and options that a pc user wants to use.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game is good for people who loves mmos and rpgs. The controls may be bad but you will get used to it after you played a little of it. The soundtrack is good but the gameplay might get old and boring but I recommend you play this game

The Talos Principle
If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.

I can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.

It takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the main" puzzles.

The graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially "indie"

The Talos Principle
In todays world of microtransactions, games releasing before theyre finished, glitch-ridden open world engines, and games that overall fail to live up to their artistic vision, sometimes there will come a game thats so perfect that its hard to believe it even got made.

The Talos Principle is a single-player puzzle game made with full triple-A production values, arguably leaving Portal 2 in the dust at what it does. I liken it to Dear Esther, but twenty times longer and filled with actual gameplay, while keeping the beauty of the world and the philosophical overtones intact.

The game consists of walking through majestic-looking outdoor areas to find closed-off puzzle areas, then solving puzzles using only a small handful of simple and easy-to-understand machines. The puzzles themselves are eloquent and very well-tested. There are over a hundred of them in all, but each puzzle introduces a new idea or uses old ideas in new ways, so they never feel repetitive or stale. The games environments are simply breathtaking with their huge draw distances and ridiculous detail, while the puzzle areas feel aptly like claustrophobic rat mazes while never losing the areas sense of atmosphere. The puzzles get very challenging near the end, but expert level design makes them all very rewarding to solve. And if youre particularly clever, the games third ending requires you to figure out how to break the level design and take items out of their designated areas to find secrets hidden in closed-away or out-of-bounds places. Its rather mind-blowing and something that Ive never seen incorporated into a game intentionally before.

The icing on the cake is the storytelling. The story is that youre a robot who wakes up in a garden and follows the commands of a god-like figure constantly talking in your head. It quickly becomes apparent that the whole world may or may not be a virtual reality simulation, which may or may not have been programmed by humans for a specific yet unknown purpose, and you are given the choice of blindly following the gods orders or trying to unravel the mystery of who exactly you are and what lies outside of the simulation. The game has three different endings, and you will find whatever answer you seek if you search hard enough.

The game poses a few difficult philosophical questions and studies them from countless different angles. I know that some people will find the philosophy pretentious and trite, and I know its completely up to personal preference, but for me it really, really worked. I was hooked on the story the whole way. I think that even if some of the games lines fail to impress you, theres enough material here that youll find at least something that will strike a chord and challenge the way you think. Besides, if you dont like the story, its easy enough to skip everything by ignoring the computers, but you might miss out on the brilliance of some of the games endings.

I give The Talos Principle a perfect score. Its got sublime puzzle design, mind-blowing secret collectables, gorgeous environments that put Dear Esther to shame, above-average voice acting, a professionally-written and well-presented story, nearly zero glitches, and depths and depths of content. Its truly one of the best games Ive ever played. Go play it if you haven't already; you might come out feeling like a different person.

The Talos Principle
A computer terminal in the game asked me why I wanted so much to prove I'm human. I spent like 10 minutes thinking, unable to answer.
Thought this was just puzzles, ended up on one of the most philosophical rides a game has ever taken me. 10/10

The Talos Principle
HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!

The Talos Principle" is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding gaming experiences I've EVER had and I've been playing video games since the Atari 2600 days.  There is a reason why "The Talos Principle" is a hit among critics and the player reviews are "Overwhelmingly Positve." For me this is a new classic. A game that catches lightning in a bottle.  One of those games that scratches an itch I didn't even know I had.

NOTE: If you think you might get this game

The Talos Principle
A first/third-person puzzle game with beautifully themed environments and captivating original soundtrack.

You solve world puzzles to collect Sigils (Tetris pieces, essentially), and you use those collected Sigils in Sigil puzzle locks (which unlock doors or new puzzle mechanics.) To solve a lock you must arrange the Sigils in a preset rectangular pattern. Along with Sigils there are collectable stars which are used to unlock more difficult content. The stars themselves are often fairly difficult to collect, but are very satisfying.

The game plays at your own pace, as puzzles are solved with theory and execution as opposed to timing and platforming. Due to the design of puzzles being self-contained experiences, you can play casually, only completing a few puzzles during a session without worrying about losing progress and having to redo a bunch of them. You can't manually save in the middle of a puzzle, but progress is saved as events get triggered, and your last puzzle/world location is kept track of, so it's easy to continue where you left off.

The game does not hold your hand as you play... you aren't told how to use puzzle mechanics, but rather you learn how to use them through natural play and experimentation. The learning curve is very gradual but you will find yourself dealing with fairly complex puzzles later on in the game as you become accustomed to the mechanics. The game isn't a linear progression of puzzles so if you get stuck on a puzzle you can skip it and come back to it later (and often solving it after having an epiphany.) The only barriers are Sigil Locks, which do require you to collect at least certain  easy" Sigils before advancing too far.

The story of the game is conveyed through various means... through ELOHIM (the voice in the sky)

The Talos Principle
The puzzles are good, if perhaps very slightly too easy, and it's definitely the most competent treatment of philosophy I've ever seen in a video game* (speaking as someone who 1. has played a lot of video games and 2. has a PhD in philosophy**). Definitely worth buying, if not necessarily at full price.

*If you ARE a philosopher, though, or are philosophically inclined, you might suffer some mild frustration at being limited by multiple choice answers to complicated questions - though again, the options you are presented with are generally better than you might expect from a game.
**Please forgive me if mentioning this makes me seem like a d**k.

The Talos Principle
Comparing The Talos Principle to a game like Portal is unfair, but immediate. The first time I manipulated a gadget to set off a part of a puzzle, I muttered how much it reminded me of the amazing and witty Portal 1 and 2, and that trying to replicate it was unwise. However, I removed my premature opinions and discovered a whole new world of puzzle and story, placed perfectly in what is called The Talos Principle.

The game starts out in ruins, immediately piquing interest and curiosity. This first person interaction makes it impossible to know who you are, or what you are doing in the deserted grounds of what seems like Rome. The land is littered with broken pillars and faulty statues, most of which are missing their heads.

Very shortly after running around, an all powerful voice beams from the skies, introducing himself and welcoming you to his garden. The puzzles ahead are a test to see if you are worthy (of what is unclear) and to strengthen your faith in him, ELOHIM."

Possibly the most existential game I've played. Though it is, at it's core, a puzzler. The puzzles are often complex, a few head-scratchers, but sometimes require a more reductionist approach. What may seem complex at first may turn out to be very straightforward. At times it requires you to question the assumptions it has itself given you. Good exercise for the whole brain, as it doesn't train through repetition but demands both creativity and reason, both abstract thought and technical logic. Along with the puzzles a story gradually unfolds. Concepts of self, place and time begin to dawn while another mystery deepens. I like that the story is only hinted at and alluded to, so that you formulate the idea on your own. It makes it that much more meaningful and powerful. It is likely the most existential and eternally relevant topic one could imagine, and the story itself would make a fascinating novel or film. My only complaint is personal, that the game seems to make assumptions concerning beliefs, more specifically, that having them is a universal quality of humans. But this is not at all the case. At times it seemed as though the authors had an agenda to express their own beliefs, but perhaps this was just my suspicion of beliefs in general. The dialogue trees where multiple choice and never once did I actually agree with any of the choices. So it felt like being pigeon-holed and I ended up arguing for a point I didn't actually think was correct. Other than that minor brow-furrowing frustration, I really enjoyed spending time in the beautifully rendered game world. The music was lovely and atmospheric. Extremely smooth play with a good variety of menu options. It's rare that a puzzle game addresses both hemispheres of the brain as well as the subconscious mind. I strongly consider it a work of genius. Oh, and if you decide to play it, I left some messages for you. ;)

Edit for dlc: While a bit on the pricey side for a dlc, it is well worth it. For those seeking greater challenge, many of the puzzles in RtG are considerably more difficult than in the base game. With greater challenge comes greater satisfaction at solving them. Themes from the base game are carried over, and somewhat expanded upon, in a way that I found both humorous and enlightening. It seems to me nothing short of a mirror held up to human nature itself. My earlier point about feeling pigeon-holed in the interactions is rendered moot by new understandings and realizations. So it goes with real learning, when something this worthwhile makes it's dawn across the mind, all one can do is smile. :)

The Talos Principle
Bought this game during Winter sales because there's a kitty on the cover.

Turns out this game is a masterpiece!

Morality: always trust kitties.

The Talos Principle
OverviewThe Talos Principle is a puzzle indie game developed by Croteam and is in my opinion one of the best puzzle games out there and although not comparable to games such as Portal, it's certainly not too far off. The game is well-polished, with a great storyline that will test your brains even when not completing puzzles.

The Pros: Many Puzzles - Probably the most important aspect of puzzle games, and where, unfortunately, many disappoint, is the length. Not here. This game rocks a whopping 129 puzzle levels, enough to keep you busy for several hours! The trickiest part is the bonus Star Sigils" that are hidden or hard to reach

The Talos Principle
JUST PLAY IT NOW!!! (or read below if you're in doubt, ofc)

I don't use the word lightly, but The Talos Principle is TRULY a masterpiece!

This game is definitely among the top 3 I've played in my life. Actually I can't remember any better game from the top of my head right now, so, yeah, that's a lot.

+ This game is DEEP, mainly in a philosophical way, and that's where this game really shines (don't get me wrong, the puzzles are awesome). Really, not the usual superficial philosophy you usually get on videogames--real philosophy! You'll spend quite some time reading files and listening to records, discussing theories with a computer terminal, proving your point, being contested etc.
+ The story is very rich, and obscure, and starts making sense little by little, not having to resort to plot twists, which tend to be a little too clich.
+ At least 3 endings that I can think of.
+ Will keep you entertained for many,many hours (my first playthrough was like 30h, the second was about 5h).
+ Very nice puzzles (and a lot of them, over 120), and they usually escalate in difficulty very smoothly. But they're all solvable with enough effort. Also, they're probably where you'll spend most of your playtime if you're not checking guides.
+ Tons of side-quests -- easter eggs, secret stars, hidden levels, which will also keep you busy for a long time.
+ Music and graphics are pretty impressive, too.
+ Easily customizable settings and controls for the perfect experience.

WARNING: To fully enjoy the game, you'll have to read a lot. Of course, if you just want to go through the puzzles, you can do that, and ignore all the text files and recordings. But, seriously, don't. =)

I payed about 1/3 of full price, and I have to say it's well worth its full price.

Serious review
This game isn't like other puzzle game wait no, this game isn't like any other games.

Yeah, Portal 2 is phenomenal, but it sticks to the Valve alternate reality. But this game? This Talos-effing-Principle? This is something else. Puzzles are the same awesomeness like Portal games, but it gives you a different perspective. Not to spoil the things in-game, but there are questions that (imo) will get you thinking about the game AND the universe itself. Not the game's universe, but ours. This isn't a fourth-wall-breaking game like The Stanley Parable , but (again imo) it feels like it breaks not just the fourth wall. It breaks reality.

And if anyone asks for scores:
10/10 for those who like first-person puzzle (platformer?) games

The Talos Principle
Due to the fact that The Talos Principle is a science fiction based first person puzzler, its hard not to make comparisons to Portal. However, while Portal is a more lighthearted game, the Talos Principle is more somber and thought-provoking. Drawing inspiration from writers like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. D*i*c*k (Apparently Steam doesn't like his last name), and John Milton, as well as a number of philosophers, it takes a much different approach to the puzzle genre.

With heavy philosophical undertones, you will find yourself thinking beyond the puzzles as the very world around you is questioned. This, in combination with a visually stunning environment, creates one of the most wonderful and unique experiences that I've had in a game.

Playing as an android, you must solve puzzles while at the same time being posed a series of increasingly introspective questions about your existence. I am going to refrain from saying anything more about the story so as not to spoil anything. This is a highlight of this game and is best experienced by going in to it knowing as little as you possibly can.

The puzzles are very unique, with various elements being added throughout to provide for an experience that never once felt repetitive to me. In these puzzles you will collect sigils using boxes, jammers, crystal prisms to connect lights, avoid mines, and float high up in to the air with fans. The most notable tool at your disposal is undoubtedly the ability to record yourself, allowing you to create what is basically a clone of yourself, which will act out your previous actions while you work with it in real time to solve the puzzle at hand.

The puzzles are very scattered in difficulty. Most were able to be solved in very little time, with a select few that I found myself having to really think about. If you want some more difficult puzzles, or youre like me and want to squeeze every second out of this game that you possibly can, then I highly recommend doing the extra puzzles which are marked by the stars. These are not required to finish the game, but I found them to be some of the most enjoyable ones to complete as they can be more challenging and mind-bending, forcing you to really think outside of the box (or designated puzzle areas).

The world is huge, often times even a bit overwhelming. There are quite a few secrets hidden around, so you will be rewarded for exploring. There are also messages and words scattered throughout which provide backstory as well as give you insight to other characters. These can be found on computer terminals, audio logs, and QR code graffiti, and really do add something special to the story. I really enjoyed finding these, and felt that it added a nice touch.

Not only are the graphics superb but the music is lovely and perfectly suited for the various environments as well as puzzle solving.

There is also a huge amount of customization available in the options menu, which is always to be appreciated. This allows you to change the size of the game hub (or remove it entirely), remove cross-hairs, change from first-person view to third-person, etc.

This is a lengthy game, and at my time of completion of the storyline I have clocked about 37 hours of playtime. For this length and the high quality of this game, I feel that the current asking price is more than fair.

10/10 would erase from my memory and play again.

The Talos Principle
Simply wonderful, one of the finest games I've ever played.

Puzzle mechanics are straightforward but brilliantly implemented and iterative, providing just enough challenge. An intruiging story is played out using text snippets and great narration.

If you enjoyed the Portal games even a little, there'll be something here for you to love.

The Talos Principle
A terminal kept making valid arguments against all my beliefs. 10/10 would question my own existence again.

The Talos Principle
*Since this review was getting more attention, I decided to add to my review down at the bottom.*


The best thing, hands down, about The Talos Principle, is that it runs on my piece of junk laptop, and it still looks beautiful. So, if you're worried about your computer not being able to run the game, then fear not. I have a crappy integrated graphics card, and I can still run this game and its silky smooth.

Now, lets get to the gameplay.

As others have said, you are just dropped into the world, and expected to figure things out for your self. There is no 'tutorial' on what objects do what or how you are supposed to solve a puzzle. You just figure it out.

One of my other favorite things about the game is the little QR codes that are strewn about the levels/world. Past 'test subjects' would leave notes for future 'test subjects'. Now, you can point your cursor at the QR code in game and it will display it, but I decided to download a QR code reader on my smart phone and scanned it with my camera and it reads it. Which I find is a really nice touch.

All in all, this is a fantastic and beautiful puzzle game. If you are a portal fan, then you'll deffinitely want to get this game. And remember, it will run smoothly on the crappiest of rigs.

*Addition*

-Since this review is gaining more attention, I decided to add a little more to my origional review of The Talos Principle.

One of the things I failed to mention the first time, is how the game is sort of non-linear.
There are 3 'for the sake of this review, lets call them sections' sections. A, B, and C. in each section, there are multiple worlds. In each world, there are multiple puzzles. If you're stuck on a puzzle, and can't figure it out, then you can just walk away and go to a different puzzle. When you're in the worlds, you can solve the puzzles in any order that you want and at your own pace, which I find really nice.

Make sure to fully explore the worlds as well. There are many hidden QR codes and terminals and secrets to discover.

The Talos Principle
Believe the hype. Believe the 10/10 net reviews. They are the truth.

I hadn't heard of The Talos Principle and frankly can't remember where I heard of it. I think the PC Gamer RSS feed. No matter. I'll be the first to admit that puzzle games aren't in any way my genre of preference - I'm much more likely to be found playing games such as Unreal Tournament, Mechwarrior Online or a hard-core flight sim. Puzzle games, until now, really haven't captured my imagination or interest.

The thing that drew me to the Talos Principle was the notion that it combined a puzzle game, and a beautifully rendered one at that, with notions of the meaning of intelligence, the question of how life" can be defined

The Talos Principle
It's phenomenal. It's a first person puzzler, so naturally there are comparisons to Portal.

Basically it's Portal with some different tools at your disposal and instead of making you laugh, it makes you question your entire existence.

10/10 would quit my job and cry in a corner.

The Talos Principle
This game is awesome.
Great puzzles that are fun to solve.
Love the story
the music is so calming
I am enjoying every minute of it.


The Talos Principle
If you haven't played Portal, go and play it first. Because if you play The Talos Principle first, Portal will then seem much less awesome. ;-)

The Talos Principle
do you like portal? do you wish portal was about 10 times longer and took itself really really seriously? Then this is the game for you!

The Talos Principle
Ive been pleasantly surprised by games before, but never have I been so biased against a game prior to its release then subsequently impressed by every aspect of it upon playing. From the developers of Serious Sam, one of my least favorite franchises. I bet I will really enjoy this, I sarcastically said to myself when the pre-order page went up. I did enjoy it. It is wonderful. It is easily one of the best games Ive played.

The Talos Principle is one giant existential question that can be answered through solving over one hundred smaller, physics-based puzzles under the guidance of your maker, Elohim, whose intimidating voice attempts to influence you from above at every turn. This might seem a strange way to label the games genre, but its accurate and the story manages to never feel at all pretentious despite addressing philosophical subject matter. While the majority of your time is spent solving the smaller puzzles, it always feels as if youre doing it for a higher purpose or to unravel the larger mystery looming overhead, so the game successfully maintains a careful balance where both the story and puzzles are one and equally important.

This journey takes you through several temple-like environments, each containing a number of doorways leading to distinct worlds. In each of these worlds, youll find several self-contained puzzle areas that can also occasionally interact with each other in an advanced way to reveal secrets, and you'll access computer terminals to gradually uncover lore, important context and bits of the story. Completing puzzles rewards you with pieces used to solve tetromino puzzles that unlock doors to new environments, even more puzzles, and new tools used to steadily increase puzzle difficulty and prevent them from becoming stale.

Solving puzzles requires manipulating and avoiding mobile mines, turrets, laser beam connectors, fans and cubes, as well as cooperating with recordings of yourself replaying your actions, but it never gets frantic and youll never feel hurried. Theres no real dexterity or speed requirement here, so you can relax and figure things out at your own pace.

Initially, puzzles arent very challenging but youll come to appreciate how increasingly clever they are. At some point, I thought Id outsmarted the game only to discover later this isnt possible and it was always meant to be so open and unrestrictive. The most difficult puzzles are only required if you want to find all of the secrets within the game and discover as many answers as possible, which is highly recommended and completely worth the effort.

The Talos Principle takes itself seriously and explores concepts like faith, free will, humanity, loyalty and purpose, with your journey unfolding much like that of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden: In the beginning, you don't know or question much and simply follow instructions but, by the time you wander around and have your first taste of knowledge, you may develop a thirst for it and begin to question everything around you. It's easy to become completely engrossed in the setting.

If you don't enjoy reading in games and skip through text, you'll miss out on a lot of what makes The Talos Principle more than just another good game, but it's still worth playing even for the puzzles alone. On a technical level, the game is impeccable: graphics, sound, voice acting, controls and optimization are all top-notch, and there are even settings for proper AA and field of view. The environments are beautiful, as is the soundtrack.

On a final note, QR codes that reveal text are left behind on walls by NPCs and friends who have played the game before you, and you can also leave these pre-written messages for your Steam friends. One of these messages claims youve discovered the most beautiful spot in the game and, as there is a number of beautiful landscapes, I had been trying to decide where to leave that message for quite a while. I had been playing in first-person the entire time and ultimately left the message somewhere I never expected to: next to a mirror I encountered late in the game. Its something that will only make sense if you end up loving the game as much as I do, but it was completely appropriate.

The Talos Principle
The Talos Principle is a puzzle game developed by Croeam and published by Devolver Digital. It was released on Steam in December 2014, before later being released on PS4 in October 2015.

The game play within Talos could be considered very similar to that of Portal. You can play in either first person or third person, as you are presented with tons of puzzles on every stage. Each stage you complete, you unlock a new tool that you will need to use in some form in the following stage. I really liked this way of introducing new mechanics to the game as it lets you get to grips with the previous set very easily before dumping a ton of new stuff on you again. The puzzles start off quite easily as you would expect in the game but they soon take a very high difficulty rise, meaning I was completely stumped for the most of my play through. There is an element of trial and error with a lot of the puzzles as there is a quick reset button to use that takes you right back to the start of the puzzle and you will end up having to do this a lot.

Graphically I was very impressed with The Talos Principle; it looks clean and fresh with extremely high production values. The lighting and weather effects in the game are stellar and really take it to a new level of quality. I was playing at 4k with the majority of the settings turned up to the max, apart from antialiasing. I did however get motion sickness whilst playing in first person view; I think it was a mixture of the speed that the character was traveling at and the motion blur. I had to eventually switch from first person to third person and this solved the problem. The game runs on Serious Engine 4  this is the only game to use it so far, but it is almost identical to serious engine 3 and 3.5 which were used in the latest Serious Sam titles.

I found the plot to be very interesting, having really enjoyed Greek mythology from other games, my interested was peeked from the get go. There are a lot of extra bits of plot and lore to learn about through collectables and computer terminals for you to access as you explore the different levels. I took a lot of time to seek them all out to learn as much as possible.  The game has various different endings as well depending on how you progress throughout your play through.

Like I said above, the difficulty really scales quite highly as you get past the first or second stage of levels. I had to use walkthroughs to even come close to finishing the game and even then I struggled and had to refer to videos as well! Whilst I found the game play to remind me a lot of Portal, the difficulty is certainly on a different scale compared. If you plan on playing this game without the aid of guides or wikis, then you are in for a real brain twister as some of the solutions to puzzles are so far out of the box that they were not even on my radar.

I finished the game in just over twenty hours, so there is a lot of content, even for someone who thought I was completing the puzzles quite quickly with the guides. Not to mention the games various different endings you can explore too. There are a lot of achievements you can unlock in each of the puzzles throughout the game, which may add some replay ability on as well.  Personally I find myself not wanting to go through again purely because I am normally not a massive fan of puzzle games.

I didnt have any technical problems apart from the motion sickness issue as noted above, the game runs very well on 4k resolution at 60+ fps. It looks to be a very well optimized engine that I will be eagerly anticipating what else comes out of it. The game can be played with a controller but given the movement and preciseness of some of the actions you have to take, I would strongly recommend using a keyboard and mouse.

My conclusion on The Talos Principle is quite simple. If you are a fan of mind bending puzzles with really obscure solutions to them, then you are going to absolutely love this game. If you are like me and are only going to manage the first two stages without a guide, you may want to err on the side of caution with your purchase. Whilst I am going to recommend this game, it definitely gets a lot of bonus points from the extremely high productions values on show from the start right until the final scenes. As someone who has the brain like a sieve and finds the puzzle side of the game to be difficult I didnt enjoy it as much as other games.

The Talos Principle
If you told me at the start of the year that a puzzle game with philosophical undertones from the developers of Serious Sam would be one of the years best titles, I probably wouldnt have believed you. However this is very much the case as The Talos Principle is a fascinating and mentally invigorating experience with clever puzzles and a highly intriguing philosophy laden science fiction backdrop. The game slowly generates an atmosphere of mind-bending contemplation unlike anything I have experienced before in games thanks to a potent mixture of clever writing and music that starts to get under your skin. I think only 2001 A Space Odyssey has given me the same feeling before.

The puzzles themselves are the star of the show however with a good difficulty curve and consistently excellent design. Some puzzles which have you dodging floating mines can be annoying, but the vast majority require clever thinking rather than quick reflexes or good timing. The puzzles are short but require you to use existing mechanics in new and surprising ways. The game lets you figure almost everything for yourself, from the story to the mechanics, but the world and puzzles are laid out in such a way that this is generally not a problem. There are loads of secrets/optional challenges that help add further substance to the game after you finish working through the main set of puzzles. I did not spend a lot of time going after these and finished the game in about 15 hours, I would say it is well worth the forty dollar asking price.

If you have even a passing interest in puzzle games and dont mind confronting some heavy philosophical/nihilist ideas (among some more hopeful ones), I cant recommend The Talos Principle highly enough.

The Talos Principle
Game recipe" so far:
--> "Portal 2 memories are back"
--> a lot of great riddles - starting from easy to hardcore
--> different kind of riddle types like the linear ones

The Talos Principle
I don't write reviews for games much.
I don't finish many of my games.
I don't usually go back to games I've finished to get all the endings.
I don't normally get heavily invested into storylines of games too much.

This game changed everything.
This game was awesome.

The Talos Principle
This game is amazing - it's my favourite puzzle game (even above both Portals).

PuzzlesThe puzzles themselves were fantastic - just the right level of challenging for me. Some I breezed through, some required some head scratching, and a couple required coming back a couple times with fresh perspectives - and all felt good and rewarding at the end. Super satisfying.
That's just the normal puzzles, though. The gold star puzzles wrinkled my brain in a good way - I'd say I got maybe 60% unassisted, and the rest kicked my  (most of them in a good way, although there were a couple that I never would have gotten). A fantastic stretch if you really wanna go the extra mile.
And the last layer on top of the puzzles and gold stars is the easter eggs - they're everywhere. Some are easier to find than others, but oh man, they're everywhere, very clever, and stealthily hid. I found three out of I can only assume dozens.

PlotA puzzle game is all well and good, but how is it tied together? Portal did so in a comedic meta way - Portal 1 was pretty much all comedy, where Portal 2 did have a bit of a plot to piece together. The Talos Principle has comedy, but each puzzle draws you closer to piecing together the whole story, which is very compelling. It's a clever premise well executed that absolutely adds to the mechanic.
And I really did love the story here. Plenty of little bits and pieces to keep you interested, building the world as you went. From reading texts to hearing audiologs to reading QR codes left by others, it all merges together to make a fantastic experience.

And yes, I cried at the end. While there are games for which this wouldn't be a surprise, this one did surprise me. It's a puzzle game! But the whole thing was so artfully executed I couldn't help but get drawn in. Beautiful and poignant and sad and hopeful and amazing.

I look forward to playing it again. <3

The Talos Principle
Portal + Myst + Philosophy + Ruins (+ Skyrim???) = The Talos Principle

One of the best puzzle games to hit the market since Portal. Are you a fan of Portal? You'll love it! Are you a fan of puzzle games in general? You'll love it! Are you a fan of anything? You'll love it!

If you liked the Public Test, then you will love the full game! But don't take my word for it, play it yourself :)

9.5/10

The Talos Principle
Its just as good as first Portal. If you like that game - you are going to love Talos.

Lots of secrets and references to other games, movies and sci-fi novels (even Philip D*i*c*k!), lots of puzzles, good music and graphics, as well as deep and meaningful story.

You just have to own it if you are tired of playing dumbed down RPG's, unfinished strategy games or boring shooters.

Finished in 29 hours with every single achievement. GIVE MULTIPLAYER DLC!

The Talos Principle
Easily the most thought-provoking game I've ever played. I enjoyed the story and philosophy much more than the gameplay. Although the core mechanics are solid, it felt like the game was too long. The sheer number of puzzles felt tedious at times.

The story is interesting and does a good job of revealing itself at a good pace, always keeping you curious and trying to figure out your character's purpose, the world itself and the story of why it was created. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending.

The game foreshadows issues and ideas around artificial intelligence that could potentially become very real in the next century or so, and for a game that's very impressive. Ultimately how much you take away from this game depends on how much you know and care about AI and philosophy, but I thought it was awesome.

9/10

The Talos Principle
My favorite game by far in 2014 (and in the last couple years, probably), was The Talos Principle.  It was as if this game was specifically made for me.

The most important things for me in single player games are:

- the quality and inventiveness of the mechanicsand whether or not I can manipulate them in a meaningful way
- immersion (which usually means first-person perspective, excellent sound design, etc..),
- the writing/story

Regarding mechanics, combat-focused games are the majority in the industryespecially on PC and especially in first-person gamesso those that arent centered on combat often must work more creatively to be interestinggames like Myst (1993) and Portal (2007). This is also true of games which have combat, but also offer non-combative methods to play through the game (stealth/sneaking, for example)ie., Deus Ex (2000), Splinter Cell (2002), and Dishonored (2012). These are my favorite types of gamesespecially the latter, perhaps because the avoidance of combat adds a further complication to the mechanics of gameplay. So, I was really excited about the First Person Puzzle design of Talos when I played the demo at PAX Prime 2014. It was love at first sight in the demo booth. I had trouble getting through the last couple demo levels on my first try, but it was still extremely satisfying and fun. As I sat struggling with the connectors and fans and boxes, of the fellows from Croteam warned me the Enforcers were coming to run everyone out of the Indie Megabooth, but told me to come back the next day to finish the demotheyd get me back where Id left off. So I went back the next morning, finished the demo, and gushed to Croteam about how interesting I found the game and how excited I was to play it on release. I tried to explain that it reminded me of playing Deus Ex and System Shock 2. Its hard to articulate exactly how Talos relates to these types of games, but they all give me the same kind of satisfaction upon completing an area, even if the mechanics and design are quite differentthe end feeling as a player is similar, so theres some kind of overlap in how the gameplay works on the player. And the first-person immersion helps with that. (I should note here that you can play the game in third-person and easily switch between first- and third-person. I simply prefer first.)

More on gameplay: the puzzles were great. I found the most satisfying bits to be finding the optional stars because I had to find ways to break the game (or at least The Great Voice in the Skys intentions hehe) to get them. The puzzles in generalsigils, stars, and easter eggshad that kind of excellent satisfaction to themsome of them were teaching the player the possibility of the mechanics, while others encouraged the player to break beyond the narrow way in which puzzle/first-person mechanics usually work. As I mentioned, in some ways Talos really reminded me of experiences playing the original Deus Ex and System Shock 2; there were ways to play those games that literally did break them, just because of the limitations of game development/AI functionality at the time. Thats not to mention that they had multiple routes to play the levels built in already. Talos also achieved the same type of feeling that the Half-Life games produce where it feels like youre breaking the gamepulling one over on the level designers and outsmarting the gamebut in reality that is because levels were designed so well. They were built in a way to teach you to break the limitations and expectations of regular gameplay. I remember the first time I got stuck in Half-Life and after I searched every possible route out of the area, realizing I could climb on the pipes to escape where I waslike, I was so shocked that there was platforming in my FPS! I remember feeling as if I was outsmarting the game, but looking back, of course there really was no other way to get out of the level. Yet it was built in a way that made that fact satisfying instead of frustrating.

Another thing worth mentioning: the QR codes. Without saying much, there is functionality built into the game to leave messages on the walls for other players (people on your Steam friends list) to see later. It might seem like a small thingbut it really was a great little touch and made the game even more immersive.

So I was super hyped for Taloss gameplay, and it still delivered beyond my expectations. But I gotta say that the writing and storyline was on the same level, in really impressive ways. It was subtle but powerful, andwithout saying too muchI liked how it played with the ideas of free will and game-imposed confines of choice. I guess what I mean is, the gamemechanics-wisewere already top notch quality and impressive. But the storythe character development through audio logs, the slow revelation of the story through classical literature and other text artifacts, the QR codes, the interactions with the terminalsmade it even richer. Basically Talos combined all of my favorite aspects about video games in a really fresh, great way. And it also took advantage of some of the best avenues that science fiction opens up for those ever-important literary questions... What is the world like, and what does it mean to be human in that world? Despite the rambling nature of this post, I actually double majored in Literature and History at university. So this game just... I feel like this game was made for me. And I was made to play it! (All that saidif youre not interested in story, you can completely ignore and not investigate any of that and still enjoy the game for its excellent mechanics. But Id still recommend getting into the story!)

All in all, I recommend it 100%. Well designed, highly polished, and super cool devs!

The Talos Principle -      Croteam

The Talos Principle
There are plenty of well-written and thought out reviews for this game already present, and I think you should read them. I just want to quickly tell you why this game is easily the best game I've played in a few years.

-The graphics are astouding
-The environment is built so carefully and thoughtfully that you could spend hours wandering around and enjoying nature.
-There is an unbelievable amount of content in this game, and it will likely take you between 15-20 (or more) hours to do everything.
-Replay value is extremely high
-Puzzles are well crafted, and the learning curve is balanced
-Ultimately you get to choose what you want to do and when
-There is a well made hint system that actually ties in with the game
-Puzzles can interact with each other, and are not always confined within a space
-Voice acting is intoxicating
-Sound in general is well done
-Music is perfect (I'll probably be buying the ost)
-The story is very enoyable and mysterious (A game hasn't pulled me in like this since the early myst games)
-Your thoughts and views on the world and what it means to be human are constantly questioned
-This game in general makes you think (a lot)
-There is a HUGE amount of background information in the form of text and audio logs

I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time, and I have not been disappointed with it at all.

Please please please do yourself a favor and buy this game if you are into puzzles games with a good story. Normaly I really think about whether or not I want to spend the money to buy a game, but I can tell you that this one is worth it, and I have no regrets about getting it.

It really has been nothing but an amazing experience.

10/10

The Talos Principle
We have a winner here people! This is one of the best games i have EVER played. I believe it's a must-have for every fan of the puzzle genre, Croteam did an outstanding job with this one. You can see from the very beginning how much they cared about their game, how much they wanted it to succeed. This is nothing like the uninspired, unoptimized cash-grabbing console ports we are used to nowadays.

But let me correct myself. This is not just a game, it is an experience. The talos principle will make you question your existence, your purpose in life. Even if you aren't really into philosophy, it will make you go look up some quotes of famous philosophers.
Every aspect of it is superb, the riddles, the visuals, the atmosphere, the music, everything works out.
Don't expect it to hold your hand though. The puzzles may seem easy peasy in the beginning but as you progress they will become harder and harder. There are some really difficult ones later in the game, so get ready for the challenge!

In conclusion, i can't recommend it enough. This is a masterpiece. I bought it at full price but it was worth it. No regrets!

The Talos Principle
Very nifty and unique puzzle game, best of its kind I've played since Portal. Definitely worth checking out if you want a smart game that'll actually challenge you to think (outside the box too). It's actually rare to find a game experience like this nowadays that isn't all about linear action or a single goal" but more progressing at your own pace and provoking thoughts about the world you're in. Well optimized with great graphics too.

Difficulty is lenient unlike in many other puzzle games and you're not forced to complete every single puzzle which is a huge plus. Instead

The Talos Principle
One of the smartest puzzle games you will play. This is not a puzzle game where reflexes are important; the placement of items, using all your tools efficiently and remembering previous solutions is crucial. Puzzle devices are excellent, from the laser prisms to the record function. Youll move boxes, deploy jammers, connect laser beams, avoid mines and float into the air before squealing with satisfaction. The record function is worth noting, as it allows you to interact with your previous actions to solve puzzles in real time. Watching your old self falter is thematically perfect and syncing moves with this recording is out of this world.  It is rare to see a game build healthy mechanics and deploy them in such a clever way, but The Talos Principle does it with elegance.

The Talos Principle
This game has everything to become a cult classic. I have never played anything like this.

The story is amazing and beautifully written. Although you seem to be alone with your creator in a mysterious world, you have a lot of characters and stories to follow. It has amazing scenery, beautiful photographic graphics together with a gorgeous fitting soundtrack. Every single detail in the world is perfectly crafted and it feels good just to be there, exploring. And exploration plays a big part in this game, just as big as solving the puzzles. That is why this game is so special: this is not just a solve-puzzles game.

You explore. You find secrets. You play a role. You are an important character. You have choices and consequences. You are part of something mysterious. You are in a story that will, maybe, make you question your own existence.

I wish I hadn't to talk about Portal, but I will say this: the gameplay is only similar to Portal in the fps puzzle genre, altho the puzzles are, I believe, more engaging, challenging and fun to solve than Portal.

Please give this game a chance if you like to be submerged into compelling stories and worlds. This is a very special game.

The Talos Principle
This is a very fun, very engaging puzzle game a la portal.  The puzzles range from just walking around doing them without having to think to complex brainteasers.  luckily you don't need to complete every puzzle to advance so if something is just taking up your time with no progress you can come back later.

The game is about being an android and solving puzzles for god, while questioning if you really are 'alive' or not.  I'm not going to spoil anything about the story except that there are multiple sides.  The game does require a significant amount of reading if you want to understand what is actually going on, and while encouraging exploration through the various mini-hubs there is no actual need to.  Still its got some beautiful environments and I enjoyed just walking along the beach at several points.

While in the puzzles themselves you can see the difficulty rating, the only time that I became frustrated at the game itself was in the hardest difficulty rooms, though stopping and coming back to them after calming down helps fix that.  The green and yellow puzzles are all very intuitive and yet very satisfying to complete, while the red ones atleast for me can become slightly tedious every now and then.

Once you complete the majority of the game and are just left with red puzzles to solve It can be frustrating, though overall the game is a very rewarding experience that I have not had since portal, the game takes a more serious stance while providing a very calm atmosphere and interesting philosophical questions to ask oneself.

DISCLOSURE: I received a review copy of this game,  I do not believe it has affected my judgment of this at all but I like to let my readers know.

The Talos Principle
Most brilliant puzzle game I have ever played, I'm happy Croteam made this before they continued to work on the next Serious Sam because it shows that rather than give everyone what they wanted, they completed a task that THEY wanted to make. If Developers make a game because they WANT to rather than everyone else wants them to, the project will recieve the most love possible. As a result this game has amazing storyline and challenging puzzles to complete. Worth every dollar and I hope everyone who reads this feels that it is worth to purchase this game. 10/10

The Talos Principle
A bit reductive but - the gameplay is very similar to portal, but the story telling is completely different.  Where Portal is hilarious and upbeat, this game is nostalgic and philosophical.

First game I actually take the time to reccomand on Steam.

The Talos Principle
A lot of people are rightfully comparing this to the Portal series.  But, in reality Portal pioneered an entirely new genre mashup that had never been done before.  So, yes, The Talos Principle is in the same genre.  Once you get past that, the overall experience of Talos is unbelieveably entertaining, unique, and frankly mind-blowing.

Some highlights:
+ Puzzle difficuly progression is engineered to perfection.   Just like Portal! :D
+ The graphics and ambiance aren't state of the art, but they are absolutely perfect for the game.  Art direction is Oscar worthy.
+ The story from start to finish is a masterpiece of expectation engineering.  You think you know what the point is.  But you really don't.
+ If you've paid attention to all the details of the various story arcs, you will walk away from the game feeling like you just experienced three distinct but bound stories.  This game is like getting three experiences in one.  It's a hell of a deal.
+ There are fascinating side game mechanics that are really rewarding if you decide to spend the time.
+ You can cheat.  But it's as if the engineers designed the cheating mechanics on purpose.  It's possible to get lost for hours trying to find ways to hack various challenges.  In other words, don't assume there is only one way.
+ It's been a LONG time since I've played a game with refined movement mechanics and keyboard control of this caliber.  It's unbelieveably well thought out.  +5000 to the QA team for working this all out.

Number one reason to play:
If you REALLY take the time to ponder what's being suggested during the game, you will literally walk away from the game experience with an altered perspective on reality.  For the better!  IMO, this type of effect is priceless in a game.  A legit philosophical education wrapped in an unbelievably entertaining package.  Wow.  I wish more design houses would focus on the Portal genre.






The Talos Principle
I believe every single human being on the planet should play this game.

Don't be fooled by other reviews, this game is not Portal. It is far greater.
(Did you know puzzle games existed way before Portal, kids?)

The Talos Principle
Croteam, after their hallmark series Serious Sam managed to create the first puzzler game on the level of Portal 2, which was unexpected, to say the least. After having played through the game, it is definitely my game of the year 2014 for various reasons, which I'll break below into several sections:

PlotAt the start of the game, you awaken as a android which is tasked with solving puzzles, for which Elohim - your maker, promises you eternal life. The story is told mostly through logs found in terminals scattered around the world, but also serve for communication with Milton, a library assistant and an intelligence with which you discuss some intriguing philosophical dilemmas. While Elohim encourages the player to explore it's creations, he explicitly prohibits venturing into the tower, which soars into the sky. As the story progresses, Milton encourages the player to act independently, and motivates him to enter the tower and find out the truth for himself.

GameplayThe game starts slowly by introducing gameplay elements (some of which are unlocked by solving specific puzzles) and the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up pretty fast, but they are never unfair - even if some of them may be excruciatingly hard. If there is a situation where the player may get stuck, it's because some specific mechanics and uses of elements aren't expected or explained beforehand. Example: some puzzles utilize your own body for intentionally blocking lasers, which the player himself might not think for some time. One thing that may get on some player's nerves is the reset ability, which you will use at some point to unstuck yourself from an unsolvable jam. It resets the entire room along with all the progress you might have made, which can be somewhat annoying in longer puzzles which take some time to progress through. Once you do solve a particularly tricky puzzle, you are glad you persisted and managed to solve it on your own. On most puzzles there is a shrine you can use to get a hint if you get stuck (although some hints are too vague and don't help as you might expect), but getting that hint requires solving some hidden puzzles which are not a part of the main story, but are worth exploring any ways as they have the most beautiful locations in the entire game. If you find yourself a bit short on hints, you may want to play Sigils of Elohim, a free companion mini-game in which you may get an additional 3 hints.
There are four worlds in the game, which go as follows:
Mediterranean - ancient Greek/Roman themed world
Egypt - puzzles spread out in the desert, borrowed aesthetics from Serious Sam 3
Medieval - typical medieval style with ruined castles in a forest
Tundra - the main" world in which the tower and the three other hub worlds are located

You start your adventure in the Mediterranean world and gradually unlock the Egypt and medieval worlds with puzzles

The Talos Principle
It is like Portal if Portal asked you what it meant to be a human.

The Talos Principle
I usually don't write reviews on games but I have to say something about this game.
I read a bit about it before I bought it but I never imagined a game could play mind tricks on me.
It's one of those games that have a higher purpose of sort, a game that is made by a developer who thinks of games as an art form.
Can a puzzle game be an art form? they sure try to make it so here.

First of all the game world itself is beautifully rendered and it's pretty big, each area is big and there seems to be a lot of areas in the game - after playing only two hours and opening only 2 areas I realize there are a lot more areas to open...
But, about the size of the areas, it's keep on puzzeling me, why are they so big?
We already know that an FPS puzzle game can work (Portal 1 and 2) and their world wasn't that big, but in this game the areas are way bigger then they should be and it drives me nuts! I feel like I'm missing things in places where I shouldn't" reach.

Second of all

The Talos Principle
Enjoyment = True ; Dissapointment = False

The Talos Principle
This game makes you question everything. I'm not even sure if I'm a person anymore. 10/10

The Talos Principle
Ah, christ... this game, this ing game... I don't think I've ever had such an emotionally exhausting love-hate relationship like this with any other game I've ever played. It was like being in an abusive relationship. The first 10-15 hours of the game were exhilarating, narratively interesting, and created a strong motivation to see what was in each new puzzle room/world, but over the next 10-15 hours it gradually descended into a painfully dull, repetitive, utterly frustrating exercise in endurance. Towards the end I kept going back *just* to complete it, because sometimes it was *still* fun (and I was desperate for narrative closure), but most of the latter half of the game was just mind-numbingly frustrating, like nothing else I've ever played. I almost wanted to cry in frustration during the final levels.

So... at the start, the game sets up the world and teaches you the mechanics of the puzzles extremely well. The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is superb, and the story is slowly unveiled to you through terminals and audio logs found throughout the world, which (initially) gives a strong motivation to explore everywhere in the hope of discovering little secrets about the overarching story. Each few sets of puzzles introduce new tools you can use to solve the puzzles, which keeps the puzzling entertaining and fresh during the first half of the game. I felt a real sense of progression and reward, and was itching to see what was in the next room and on the next terminal.

Problems start to begin somewhere in the second world, about 10 hours in. It becomes clear that there are just WAY too many puzzles with too little variation. There is a very long time where no new puzzle solving mechanic is introduced, where it begins to feel like you're doing the same thing for almost every single puzzle, albeit in a slightly more complicated fashion each time. It's also during this time that the story starts to become stale and predictable. I won't spoil it, but believe me: very little of note is revealed to the player after the first half of the game. The exact same themes are covered over and over again, but the themes aren't exactly *that* complicated to begin with. It starts to feel like a prolonged philosophy 101 seminar debate. What is life? Are robots alive? What is consciousness? Can robots be ethical? Is God real? Should you obey God? Interesting questions the first time they are discussed, but pretty dull after being re-stated over and over (and believe me, they are re-stated so many times with so little variation). Also, the overarching point of the game world and the (main) ending are extremely obvious quite close to the start of the game. By the time I eventually completed it, I wasn't even slightly surprised. It felt like an obvious narrative going through the motions to reach it's obvious conclusion.

All of this is a monumental shame, because the first 10 hours were an absolute joy. I would have given this game a glowing review had I written this 15 hours ago. But now... I just can't. I never want to see another ing connector, another fan, or another jammer again in my life. The developers took a beautiful thing and ran it into the ground.

How to Survive
edit: updating review. evidently its getting some attention, so I figured I might as well expand and clarify.

tl;dr edition: neither good nor fun. do not buy unless its deeply discounted.

I can not refer this game in good faith. There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive.

Firstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me.

The second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible.

How to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games.

Honestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.

How to Survive
Now first lets get the positive out of the way.
The games graphics are fine for what it is.
The story can be funny sometimes.
The co-op challenges can be fun with a friend.

Now lets get to the real review where we look at what they promised and what they delivered.
The game is an ok size however it's extreamly limited in size for it's price.

If you forced yourself to go slow you would take maybe 6 hours to finish this game.

Another problem  is the content  the guns,melee weps, mutants ect is all really limiting.
Some might disagree with me there but think about it theres maybe 8 guns, 3 chainsaws , 6 melee weps and 1 ammoless total op wep.

Now for my Largest disapointment with this game it's promise  experience for zombie game veterans"

There is NOTHING veteran about this game it hands everything to you on a silver platter.
There's sleep areas at night prebuilt impervise to any zombie attack that you only need to clear out once.

Night creatures are as deadly as a new born kitten.
Ammo is WAY too common i had 2

How to Survive
Once Bitten, Twice Shy
A fun, 'Diablo'-esque Third-Person RPG, How to Survive" caught me a little off guard. At $2.25 (Summer Sale 2014)

How to Survive
Don't get tricked into thinming this is a 3rd person zombie survival. It's like dead island but in a 3rd person perspective, giving us a barebones diablo clone with no enemy variety. You talk to NPCs and do quests, you can craft many weapons, but as long as you get the bone shurikens you should have no trouble.

The cutscenes for the how to survive" book are sometimes clever and funny. But it's far from enough to save this game.

If you would have to get it regardless

How to Survive
I get the impression that I don't understand How to Survive.  The number of legitimate looking positive reviews indicates that whilst others have enjoyed the game I haven't.

The survival element from which the game takes it's name seems tacked on with little effect on game-play.  In the hours I've played I've never come close to starving or dehydrating.  A little message pops up telling you that you're becoming thirsty or hungry and that's solved by drinking or eating one of the many things in your inventory.

There are wells and bottles and canisters everywhere; I've haven't felt any tension or had to go on an epic quest to find water.  There are also edible plants everywhere so whilst meat might not always be on the menu starving is not going to happen.

Sleeping is ... strange.  There's no building or reinforcing shelters and no bedrolls or similar.  There is one special shack per island that has a closeable door.  That's the only place where you can sleep.  If you're 51% tired you can't sleep but if you're 49% tired than you must.  There's no wait command so sleeping through the night won't happen unless leave your character to get tired.

As survival games go there's no real element of survival in 'How to Survive'.  Fallout 3 with Primary Needs or State of Decay will give you a much better experience.



How to Survive
This game starts fun. The graphics are decent for the top-down style. Good lighting and water effects. Day and night cycle where night really amps up the challenge by making you watch your back constantly. A diverse crafting system. Decent skill tree options. Some of the voice acting is funny (I think intentionally) and unique.

I liked the survival aspects, which is the point of the game. You have to monitor your hunger, thirst, rest, and health. It's all manageable. You can collect empty bottles to store up water reserves, hunt animals and collect plants to cook at a campfire for food, collect herbs and create bandages to restore health, and secure a bunker to sleep in.

The combat is solid. The controls are easy. You craft increasingly strong weapons as you progress and different weapons have unique advantages. The machete cuts through plants and carves arrows from sticks, the bow is powerful and the arrows recoverable, the gun is rapid fire with plenty of ammo on the islands, the boomerang is very powerful but not as smooth and fast as the bow, etc. Melee combat animations are fluid with just enough variety--more than I expected from a game with this visual style.

While the gameplay mechanics are very solid, the storyline becomes more of a chore than fun unfortunately. It's a series of fetch quests that take you back and forth across the maps. Every time you pass one direction and clear the large amount of zombies, you have to then fight them all over again on the way back due to a fast respawn rate. This turned the game into a slow fetch quest grind for me and I lost interest about halfway through. If you make a wrong turn, it's even worse, because now you're fighting respawns over and over and you're not even in the right spot of the map.

You can't save the game except at story checkpoints and that can take a bit of time. Perhaps, if I could save at will, I could have tolerated the grind in smaller doses.

Maybe it's just me, but I had trouble with the quest early on where I had to collect meat from a deer. I kept wandering the map looking for deer and could never find them. When I finally would spot one, I would have to clear hordes of zombies to clear a path to it and these actions usually scared the deer away, leaving me to wander yet some more. The worst is when you're hunting deer at night and the extra zombies come to chase you down. You need to keep your flashlight on these nighttime zombies to keep them at bay, which makes focusing on the fleeting deer more difficult. The game says you can track the deer once you injure it by following blood on the ground. It's not that easy to do when the ground is already covered in excessive blood from slaying zombies. I eventually caught the deer and made the mistake of cooking the meat, which didn't complete the quest, so I had to repeat it all over again.

I really wanted to like this game. I actually told my friends how much I enjoyed it at the beginning. Then the grind just beat me down.

There is also inventory issues. Some of the crafting recipes call for 5 or 6 items. You're already stocking ammo, weapons, water, food, bandages, quest items, etc and the 25-item inventory fills fast. I don't really consider this a negative, because it more accurately reflects the reality of surviving on these islands. It might frustrate some players though. 25 slots is still considerably more than some games permit.

One small nitpick when it comes to resting: you aren't allowed to unless your rest meter is low enough. One time I was by a shelter at just over 50% fatigue. I couldn't rest before setting out on the next leg of my journey. That's just silly, because you can make adjustments on the other survival factors whenever you please.

As much as I would like to recommend this game for all its positive, interesting concepts, I just can't because the story is a major drag.

How to Survive
I bought this game on sale, thought, what the hell.  What a pleasant surprise.  It's like Diablo 2 gameplay, with zombies/mutants as your enemies, and one of four survivors as your hero.  The gameplay is very fun, although it does get a bit stale with a lack of diversity among the zombies/mutants.  Couple the lack of diversity with a completely OP weapon (cough, triple boomerang) and you've got a recipe for boredom.  If you want the story mode to remain challenging, I highly recommend avoiding any boomerang, as they are fast, powerful, ammo-less, and there's no such thing as durability in this game.  Killing zombies with a shotgun made out of a tube and duct tape is much more rewarding anyway, right?

Still, easily worth $15 and a play through or two.  The challenges are were the challenge is (play on words intended).  You get your character dropped on an island with no equipment, a real out of the freezer into the frying pan" kind of experience.  The challenge is reaching your escape under the allotted time

How to Survive
This review is coming from a stand-point of about 7 hours of solo play.

Do I like this game? It's okay, I mean, it's nothing special, it's a twin-stick zombie survival game with a somewhat interesting crafting system.

The game-play, it's basic and easy to understand as all twin-stick games are. Nothing new. Which is totally fine, I mean it's a tried and tested system.

The story, I haven't finished the story, simply because I hit too many BDN (Board, done now) moments. I just couldn't do another fetch quest. That's all this game is, fetch quest after fetch quest after fetch quest. When did I hit my limit? When the drunk pilot wanted his cargo, where was it? All over the islands... All twenty pieces of the damn stuff. I quit, I was done with the game from then on. The characters were, eh. The only person that interested my in any way was Kovac, mainly because SPOILER ALERT he's apparently the one crashing the boats into the islands SPOILER ALERT OVER. I say apparently because I have no idea if he is or not, though if that was him on the radio at the start of the game it makes sense as he seems to have a radio station at the top of his island. I digress. The characters are cliche to say the least, oh no a mother and daughter that are split up on a terrible island, the friend who was bitten but has the thing you need to get off the island, the crazy old lady, the apparent friend who is actually the villain, the disabled knowledgeable one who spends all their time tinkering with your escape rout and the drunk.

May as well look at this games big point, the crafting. It's okay. I mean you can make things, cool yeah, okay. I never bothered with the potions. The guns? Didn't bother with them either. Melee weapons? Rusty machete all the way. After I built the boomerang I just didn't need anything else. Nothing. And when I upped it with the red stone, nothing else would do. Now when I say I didn't bother with it, I mean I built every combination I could within 7 hours of play. Tested it, and still found the boomerang to be the best thing to use. Chainsaw? Nope. Flamethrower? Nope. Shotgun? Nope. Boomerang. Always.

Survival. Pha. My biggest problem surviving was diverting my attention from my current fetch quest to trek to water holes, or where I knew deer were or to safe houses when I got a little tired. Fuel for bombs was the biggest problem for my survival". I had so much food on my person I could have fed all the survivors I had found with ease. Three jerry cans of water kept me going for days. Ammo was of no concern

How to Survive
I really tried to give this game a fair try.  It simply wasn't as interesting or enjoyable as it appeared to be in the Steam store.  The premise is neat but the execution is lacking.  Crafting could be cool, but most of the time your tiny inventory is full up with junk.  You have no homebase so there's nowhere to store excess stuff.   Also, where you sleep for the night is highly limited and really annoying.  There is usually only one secure bed shack per island.  And for some reason, when you go to try and use it, a red light and alarm goes off every time, alerting tons of zombies to your location for no real reason.   The most entertaining aspect of this game is watching the short Kovac's rules" videos.   Save your money and buy State of Decay instead for a much deeper zombie survival crafting game with a better plot."

How to Survive
Personal Rating: I'm having fun killing zombies and running for my life
Classic Rating: 

Pros:

 Story and characters (main game has 3 but you can add Nina with a DLC): You have to escape alive from some zombies' infested Islands. Every character has their onw skills, perks and final attack blows.
 Gameplay: very well implemented twin stick shooter from a top-down perspective.
 Crafting system: one of the best aspect of this game, you get many different ways to craft items, stuff and food.
 Weapons: lots of weapons. My favourites are bow and boomerang - you can fire feathered and fire arrows with the bow, while the boomerang is very useful with a few enemies (it hits when coming back too and you don't waste bullets").
 Graphics: I find this game to be very detailed and aestetically pleasant.
 Sound effects are a bit reapeating over the time but they help a lot to understand incoming enemies.

Cons:

 Lots of quests require you to go searching for some missing "part" and go back once you get it - I'm not really complaining though.
 It's a bit hard to find items scattered on the ground if you don't walk over them (that's how a popup appears and tells you what you found).
 Saves are a bit tricky because you only get one slot

How to Survive
Well i really enjoyed this game and have just finished it,all the time i have added up is actual in game time and i enjoyed every moment of this well made and entertaining game.
Ok you start by picking a character so i choose ABBY (thought she would be faster and have more stamina) and of you go,the graphic's in game are good and the ZOMBIE'S (if thats what they are) come in variou's form's from you standard walk and run and chase (and they really do leg it after you) to other varietie's thet i will let you discover for yourself (allway's best to find thing's out for yourself so no spoiler's here),i will say this there are about 6-7 different type's and i wish there had been more.
The music in game is good and you really do know when something is coming as the tone change's and then LOOK OUT as its usually something you havent seen before.

The script is really well written and my most memorable character is KOVAC,he has been stuck on the island (island's i should say) for some time now and his HOW TO SURVIVE GUIDE" is probablly the funniest thing in the game and the animation that goes with it had me laughing out loud a few time's.
Now dont get me wrong the game isnt a "comedy survival game" at certain points its more "survival horror" as in you have to manage resource's and keep an eye on what you have but KOVAC'S ranting's add a real comedy overtone at certain point's in the game (usually when you find one of the aforementioned "how to survive" pages from his book)
As the game progress'es you come across path's that are blocked and shed's that wont give to your weapon or anything else you are carrying

How to Survive
TL;DR  - This game is boring and repetitive, but a couple of the DLCs will make the game a lot more fun. The Kovac's Way DLC is a MUST HAVE! Without this, the base game is trash. If the difficulty is too hard for you, get Hello my name is... Nina. DLC, her skills make the hardest difficulty more manageable. El Diablo Islands DLC will adds a lot more content if you liked the base game.


DISCLAIMER: I bought all the DLCs, and all my playthru and review is based on my experience of having all the DLCs activated.

WARNING when buying DLCs, the Heat Wave DLC - x 3 pack is the same as Heat Wave DLC - Kenji's pack, Heat Wave DLC - Abby's pack and Heat Wave DLC - Jack's pack combined! DO NOT REPEAT PURCHASE!


The game is quite interesting at first, but it gets boring and repetitive very soon. The game consists of fetch quests from start to finish. While fetching items, you got to take care of your other needs other than health.

During the early game, you might need to spend some time gathering food and resources, but once you venture into 2nd island, food water and sleep are just things that take up some of your limited inventory space. And if you are playing solo, inventory space is VERY LIMITED! I play co-op with my friend, and yet we are still struggling on holding all the quest items and crafting ingredients.

Crafting might seem complicated at first, but in fact there are only a handful of recipes to do.

Playing co-op have their pros and cons.
- Co-op have a very lousy camera. Both players share the same camera, therefore when both players wander too far away from each other, off-screen zombies become very dangerous.
- The connection is quite crappy, it will de-sync every couple of minutes, ruining a lot of fun. Also, the desync will cause the joining player to take a lot of damage sometimes.
- Quest rewards will only be given to the host player, so if the reward is a good gun, only one of you will get to use it.
- Food and drinks must be shared.
+ You have double the inventory slot.
+ You have double the health, so when one is dead the other can try to survive and revive the dead player without having to reload checkpoint.

The other game modes are a waste of time.

If you collect 100% achievements, you will need Kovac's Way DLC, Barricade! DLC, One Shot Escape DLC, and El Diablo Islands. You will also need a lot of patience and luck.

How to Survive
I picked this game up full price, from it's description it sounded like the type of zombie survival game I always wanted to play. Sadly it was a major disappointment, it's survival aspects in name only. All the elements are sort of there, the open" map

How to Survive
An incredibly boring, unbalanced game, that fails to deliver anything meaningful.

First, the crafting: This is the game's only true strength, but it's still lacking. There's only a handful of weapons and minor upgrades to them for you to create. A weak machine gun, an average machine gun, a strong machine gun. A rifle. A wooden bow, a metal bow, two upgrades to add onto them. Everything boils down to a couple of tiers of equipment that do the same thing.

Second, balance: The difficulty curve is all over the place. At the start of the game, you will get mauled, guaranteed, by all the zombies. You'll only have a stick to defend yourself with, which is slow, weak and inefficient against the sheer number of zombies. Then you can finally get a ranged weapon and the game becomes yawn inducing, followed by the second island, where helmeted zombies might actually land a hit on you if there's several of them.

Then you get to the third island and, despite further upgrading your bow AND gun, find that neither are all that effective against the zombies there. How ineffective are they? It takes two perfect head shots to take them down, assuming they don't have a helmet. They also come at you in droves and your movement is slowed by the swamp.

Then you find the recipe for an upgraded boomerang. This weapon outperforms bows and guns quite easily, in terms of speed, damage and lack of ammo consumption. It's only weakness is that you have to wait for the weapon to come back before you can throw it again, but this didn't cause me problems at all. Between the long effective range, high damage and hitting twice, it's often able to take out multiple zombies per throw and the delay is actually pretty low.

Third, the enemies: There is nothing remotely interesting about any of them. There's regular zombies, progressively faster and stronger zombies, fat (explosive) zombies, head crabs and giant zombies. Nothing new to report. Oh, and there's also zombie deer and what I believe are emus. The birds just zerg rush, so they're also boring. The deer attack by charging and can stun you, which makes them one of the more interesting enemies, if only because their speed means they'll actually hit you.

Fourth, the plot and characters: The plot is bland. You're marooned on an island and have to survive. The characters are all varying degrees of insane and unlikable. I'd guess that the game was aiming to be parody, but it's just so unfunny and overall dull that I honestly can't tell if it's being sincere or not.

Fifth, the quests: Every single one is a fetch quest. If it's not a fetch quest at first, it will become one soon enough. Also, get used to failure, because it's guaranteed. Unless it involves getting to another zombie infested island, you're not  actually accomplishing anything.

And then there's the monkeys. With pet parrots. Who give optional fetch quests, because clearly we didn't have enough of them already, right? These are what make me wonder if the game is meant as parody, because they so clearly break the bleak mood of the game. Unfortunately, all they accomplish is changing my mood from apathy to annoyance. The squawking really gets old.

Sixth, bugs and nitpicking: One bug I keep running into is that, after I took the skill that showed certain plants on the map, some of the plant icons would remain after harvesting while others wouldn't. A similar problem I kept running into with the skill to see animals on the map was sometimes the icons for them didn't show up, despite the deer being close enough for me to see its antlers.

Also, there's a sound bug with the boomerang. Sometimes after throwing it, the sound continues even after it returns, which gets annoying very fast. Usually it happens when I open the inventory menu while it's still airborne, but sometimes it just happens.

And one last, little annoyance, of no real significance: The voice acting doesn't match up with the dialog boxes, like they were using two different versions of the same script. The ideas are all the same, but the words are different.

How to Survive
How to Survive... Hmmm. This game has much to be said. JOIN ME BELOW *swooooosh*

PROS
- Nice graphics (doesn't require a beast computer)
- Cool finishing moves when killing zombies
- Really nice crafting system (simple yet complex)
- Good sounds (althought it could use some different zombie sounds)
- Nice camera view (in the sky" view like league of legends

How to Survive
+ Crisp, minimalist UI
+ Excellent tutorial; fun, interactive, and does a good job of displaying some of the charm of the title
+ Voice-acting was of about average quality
+ Minimap is functional and easy to read; objectives and points of interest are clearly marked and hard to miss
+ Very detailed environment; the design and amount of inclusion is meticulous
+ Foraging is wonderfully implemented; by doing away with bold POI markers in the overworld, you find yourself constantly searching for familiar leaves, shapes, etc.
+ Except for a few small qualms I had with the crafting system (noted below), it is largely excellent; there are a refreshingly large variety of combinations
+ You have the option to 'uncombine' items that you've crafted, thus freeing up the materials for re-use; this little quality of life feature is incredibly useful, and I feel that many crafting systems throughout the gaming world would have benefitted from it
+ An appropriately moderate variety in creatures
+ Some crafting recipes are only available for certain characters, thus increasing incentive to replay
+ Exploration is both rewarding, and very much encouraged throughout the title
+ The story did a suberb job of managing to not take itself too seriously, without falling into the classic pitfall of being cringey and annoying
+ While the hunger and thirst meters fit well into the game, it was the fatigue meter that really stood out as a breath of fresh air; this added a bit more challenge and a greater feeling of urgency to the game
+ Hunting was very fun and challenging; tracking wild game through a monster-infested island could be quite the rewarding challenge
+ Nighttime operations were very well-handled, in that a setting sun very much puts you on edge if you're out in the open and far from a campfire
+ Melee combat was solid and satisfying

- Zombies are largely generic copies of only a handful of models
- During daytime, inventory is slightly too transparent; this results in a fair bit of squinting, but wasn't an experience-killer
- You cannot craft stacks of items
- Aiming (I used mouse and keyboard), while for the most part excellently designed, could occasionally prove frustrating and unreliable; picking specific targets out of an oncoming horde (something you will NEED to do) is difficult when you're cursor is constantly jumping between several front-rank targets
- Could have benefitted from a larger, more comprehensive skill tree

How to Survive
I tried to get into this game and like it, but the myriad of negatives overshadowed the few positives in the game. More often than not, I felt like I was fighting the clunky movement, mechanics and horribly designed UI more than I was the zombies. Not even the saving grace of co-op could make the horrid combat worth my time.

I've been told once the game pacing picks up and you begin gearing up the game becomes more bearable, but I'm not one to slog through several hours of bad gameplay to do so.

How to Survive
This game is actually very good, and I'll be buggered if I know why it wasn't more popular.  After all, neither the zombie" or "survival crafting" genres seem in much threat of extinction at this very moment

How to Survive
This game is fun, albeit short. It may be fun to play in a group, however i played it for the campaign and it only took me about 2 days to complete. If there was more to the game i would heartily recommend it, i still wouldnt give it a bad score, it just seems like it needs more content. Also there was some issues with throwing molotov cocktails in the game, the aim was really wonky and a few other bugs that were sort of annoying. With that being said though its not a terrible game, just not a truly amazing one.

Im going to vote no on recommending this particular title because of the lack of content. The building your own weapons was an interesting component but it still wasnt enough to save the game imo.

How to Survive
-Quick Review-
Atratzu's Rules: Chapter 1, this game is excellent.
How to Survive is a zombie-survival game developed by EKO Software and released October 2013.


-Detailed breakdown review-
Story: As with any zombie apocalypse story there's only so much you can deviate from the status quo. You wake up after a shipwreck, find you're on an island with zombies, need to go do a number of fetch quests while all the wimps hide and you bring the carnage!

Gameplay: This is where the game impressed me, but before I jump the gun and explain what I like... the controls are very basic, use mouse buttons to aim and fire/swing, ASDW to move, the game is played from the third person fixed above view camera.
(Atratzu did some research and learned that this view is known as Isometric view. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's the term you're supposed to use. Isometric-fixed-camera?)
Now to explain the fun part, like most survival games these days, How to Survive has a Crafting system. I'm a sucker for crafting, I feel like it gives me one of the strongest sense of progression...But I'm also biased and desensitized to it (translation: if you don't like crafting, don't touch this game). You need to scavenge various materials to make weapons, tools, and food. There are different types of herbs, sticks, animals, various junk items that become useful later, and more.
The other main feature I would like to point out is the leveling system, mostly everyone is familiar with this concept by now, in this game when you level, you get skill points that you can spend to get different perks and abilities.

Achievements: How to Survive has a total of 43 achievements. There are four categories: 1) Completed while playing through the game on you first play through (about 7-12+ achievements, depends on how thorough you are when you play). 2) Complete these special abilities/conditions. 3) Difficulty related achievements... These are always the roughest achievements to get in the game because it requires Mastery and stubborn determination. 4) Lastly, there are DLC achievements so if you want to go for 100%, you'll need the DLC (about 6 achievements).

Price: How to survive is priced at $14.99 This game will definitely earn it's value from gameplay, My personal preference is that I always want a game to last one hour for every dollar. If you'd like a better deal I recommend waiting for a steam sale; be it summer or winter.
I also need to mention that I didn't actually buy this game, it was gifted to me by Eyriana (other names: Decimaeya and Unreal), so thank you for the gift!

Conclusion: There is one more feature that should be mentioned before I wrap up my review; there is multiplier and local co-op, but I haven't played those modes yet.
To quickly recap, the story was stereotypical, the gameplay was crafting + looting * Zombies, the Achievements are generally hard earned + DLC, and the price is fair because of how long you'll play the game.
I recommend this game to anyone who likes the following genres: Zombie, Survival, Crafting. Thanks for reading my review!

How to Survive
A neat little game, short but entertaining.

Best thing about it is the easily accessible crafting system. Gather stuff that you find all over the islands and combine them to powerful items. Manage your character and limited inventory space, find water and food so you don't starve, find shelter to sleep when you are exhausted and protect yourself from the creatures on the island.
Kill hordes of Zombies with your ever improving crafted weaponary and armor and find a way off the island.

This game is not hardorce survival horror. More a top-down shooter.

How to Survive
NOTE that for the record I use a Xbox 360 Controller for this game 100% of the time. There will also be a bullet point Pros/Cons review near the bottom of this.

How to Survive is in my opinion a well done game to say the least. The game has a simple yet elegant combat system that I found satisfying, it takes patience to truly master zombie slaying as you must take time to zero in your aim for those rewarding headshots. This is better then many other games as it adds a touch of needed skill to it. The game also contains a decent variety of zombies to slaughter including some undead animals that prove to be quite scary when encountered. Many zombie types also require you to change up your strategy as a nice bonus, while you normal zombies can be dispatched with melee weapons, zombies such as Fatties require a ranged approach as they will otherwise blow up in your face upon death.

One issue I had here though was running zombies tend to get spastic when right on you and I found it hard to aim at them as they attacked while running circles around me. The island settings also do nicely, between varied terrain and well done lighting the game's presentation is both beautiful and terrifying. One of the game's strongest points is its well done crafting system, playing the game I constantly found myself wanting to find new items to combine to produce more deadly weapons and armor. This is further expanded by crafting and adding attachments such as scopes for homemade guns to decrease aim time or pulleys to give your bow more damage. Another nice mechanic the game has is a day and night cycle where at night an abundant number of more mutated and aggressive zombie type foe come out to play, what really sets this apart from other games is your ability to fight these off by simply staying in the light. With a campfire your safe and to travel you can simply grab a torch from the fire, however you will drop the torch to the ground if you need to use any other weapon, and while you can use a flashlight with a weapon it is a directional light, so if your not careful these creatures can come up from behind you and attack. The game also sports a decent Hunger/Thirst/Sleep system that adds just a little more spice to the difficulty, however if you acquire both skill perks to double these meters you'll find yourself rarely having to maintain them.

The game contains a few different character to play as each with different stats and available skills to acquire. A couple of which have a unique ability to craft a specific item only as them. As said the game does contain a leveling system in which each level grants a skill point of your choosing, however out of the 12 or so skills I had playing Jack I only found 4 or 5 of them to actually be worth something. While the story isnt the best it was still rather entertaining and when taken the time to scavenge and keep yourself properly equipped the main story ran about 15 hours for me across 2 days of constant play. Now though the game lacks any sort of structure building mechanic the game does allow you to drop items anywhere and will never disappear which really came in handy as I tended to have a hording problem in this game. I have a friend that I got to also get the game and together we found the multiplayer gameplay just as fun, you can either to a simple challenge which is essentially an island with a single goal such as finding a plane to escape. You can Co-Op the story, this part was especially cool as while my friend was just starting his story I was well into mine and I retained both my stats and all the items on me allowing me to easily aid him in his story. All in all I'd say this game is worth trying especially for any fan of zombie and/or survival game, to those of you I'd say you wont be disappointed.

So in a nutshell:
Pros:
-Satisfying combat system
-Addictive crafting system
-Well done setting
-A decent story both in quality and length
-Enemy variety
-Day/Night cycle
-Hunger/Thirst/Sleep systems
-Level and skill progression
-Multiple playable character
-Rebindable Controls

Cons:
-Zombie AI can be a little wonky but rare
-Camera style made some areas extremely difficult to navigate
-Some what low variety of melee weapons
-Controls for aiming seemed to be off at times (Xbox 360 Controller)

One final note is that I found that getting information on more advanced stuff was hard, especially seeing how typing How to Survive..." in an internet search engine usually found unwanted results.

My finally score for this game as a long time zombie and survival game lover is a solid 8/10

How to Survive
Disapointing Co-op. Console Influence shows with the 2 players stuck on the same screen which is really clunky and frustrating.

The game gives you the impression of being full sandbox open world at first sight, but really you're stuck on relatively small Islands the whole time. The Islands themselves are quite cagey, mostly a succession of narrow spaces.

Crafting is simplistic. Suriviving isn't really hard and playing story mode feels almost entirely linear.

Lackluster option menu, especially as far as graphics are concerned.

Wasted money and Waste of good potential. There are too much decent zombie games out there who do what this game tried to achieve, but better.

How to Survive
I tried to like it.. but I just can't. It doesn't looks/feels bad, but why do I feel taste of s..t  in mouth after playing this? Here is why:

- UI is terrible, full controller support game, means: no hotkey for windows, some ugly scroll skill/use skill" buttons. 90% of my deaths in game is because of panic and inability to switch weapon.
- inventory is crap

How to Survive
Gameplay: 7/10

How to Survive
You are shipwrecked on an isolated island, a desperate castaway in a total freakshow world.

How will you survive?

Yes, how will you survive this mediocre action-survival" game

How to Survive
Updated on 26.10.14


I really don't know why the game How to Survive managed to get that low MC score.
It's really beyond me .If I would believe in conspiracy theory I would have said
that competition was involved in helping to put How To Survive on the very bottom...

Let's get back to the game itself.

The graphic is really cool .The terrain ,swapms ,trees ,wreckages and characters are
design beautifuly ,and there is no one bad thing to be said about gameplay either.
Everything works smoothly as it should.Even sounds and other special effects
are created with precision and they sound...real!

Two things that strike me while I was playing How to Survive was :

Very interesting crafting system allowing you to craft almost anything by combinig
items you have found or salvage from surroundings .
Example :if you combine Rusty Helmet and bones you will get spiky helmet ,
or combine a bottle of water and lemon and you will get quess what...? A lemonade!!!
You may find car tires ,metal sticks ,or piece of hard rock and create some very
usefull stuff.
There is another interesting aspect to your quest for survival I forgot to mention :
some items such as raw meat or fish ,need to be cooked first ,otherwise you will get sick.

The second thing that need to be mention here is guy named Kovac (such a character!!!)
who appears here and there giving you best advices called Kovac's Rules" to help you
survive your mayhem .
Kovac is smart and very funny in his simplistic way and he is superb additinon to How To Survive.

So...maitain you health 

How to Survive
I've played this game for six hours so far, for $3 its a great game. This game is a 3rd person shooter type of game, the only thing I felt the game lacked so far is that you can't pan the camera around your guy; this makes it a little hard to see how many zombies are going to come running after you next.

The game has still been allot of fun to play through so far, I think I am probably about half way through the game at this point and I have not gotten bored of playing it yet. You start out with a stick as a weapon, then you find better weapons or craft better weapons by finding Bluprints to create them.

I think they could have done it a little differently in terms of sending the player out to fetch things, so far there is this one guy who asks you to do all kinds of things and I just get this feeling that the guy is a lazy bum; who doesn't lift a finger to help you out in the least.

They could have really improved that aspect of the game allot, the game is already pretty good; if they would have done something a little different with the quest line the game could have been exceptional.

That plus the inability to pan around your character take something away from this game. Its still worth playing so far, more so than some of the games that are allot more polished and higher priced.

How to Survive
Don't let the low metascore fool you.  This game might not be the best zombie/crafting/survival game ever made, but it has a lot to offer when playing co-op.  Even if the game feels as though it could have been bigger.  The idea of keeping your character fed, hydrated, and rested while exploring zombie infested islands and crafting useful items from scraps is a fun idea that is implemented well with this game -- the world, items, and crafting options just seem a little lack luster.

The survival aspects of the game, eating, drinking and resting, are presented simply.  Safe houses must be discovered and cleared out for the character to have a safe place to rest.  This part of the game works well.  The safe houses get progressively more difficult to clear, and they are spaced appropriately throughout the game.  It would have been nice if the islands were larger.  The player must search for wild edibles or hunt for food.  Foods can be cooked and combined, but a lot of the times there is little to no reason to do it.  While it's fun to make a dish a Fish 'n' Chips, there is no difference from that and just a cooked fish.  This part feels as though it could have used more work.  Maintaining good hydration is another survival aspect that is done simply and effectively.  Fresh water can be found around the island, and the player can store water in different containers.  These containers can be re-used for water again, or for storing other liquids.  Various fruits and items can be mixed with water to make mix drinks."  This part of the survival felt as though it got more attention.  Every new drink that was discovered had different effects

How to Survive
How to survive  more like how to not get frustrated :D

-Before a friend and I could even play the game we needed to restart the game 3 times and even during the game it would freeze and a restart was needed. For example talking to character made the whole game freeze so we didnt try to talk to the character again :D
- Another thing that really annoyed me was that you are not able to save the game in the Main Menu. You need to wait till you get to a checkpoint or something similar. If you die before the checkpointyep playing everything again. Frustrating.
-The looting system in the coop mode is horrible. If one person picks an item up only one of the player has the weapon so on. Also if you get a reward, my friend and I had the problem that only he gets the rewards and I get nothing. And that at the beginning of the game. Frustrating.
-Your character has 4 needs: Health, hunger, thirst and exhaustion. So you always need to make sure you have food and something to drink. But if you play as a pair its not easy to have always enough food for both. Having these needs gives the game a realistic touch but I found it frustrating :D

But even if the game is having some bugs and so on I had fun playing it.

+The crafting system is nice and easy to understand.
+I liked the bird's eye view of the game. Its something different from what you normally play.
+ The game is about Zombies. So yeah.fighting zombies is fun :D
+The animations looked sometimes really weird but I still like them. For example the character has different finisher moves.

If you dont have high expectations the game can make a lot of fun,especially if you play the coop mode. And I think if the developers take they their time and erase those bugs the game will be even better :)


How to Survive
Game runs smoothly, I didn't encounter any bugs and after you're done with story mode (I obviously am not), you can try to play in local co-op, co-op and multiplayer. There are several modes included and hardcore difficulty will make you cry (even normal one has its tough moments). Incredibly deep crafting system makes you craft something completely useless and this is the first time I saw something like this in any kind of crafting games.

How To Survive is an indie gem that looks cheap, feels cheap and plays lovely. Basically, this is one of those games you've dared to love before huge web portals and trend-fueled magazines told you it's not OK to love these kind of games because of I don't know what reason.

I recomend to all my friends...so get it now and embrace the zombie survival :D hooooooooooo yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa

How to Survive
pros
Great game for local coop
Nice gameplay
Nice graphic and sound design
It often goes on sale @90% (for ~1) it's REALLY worth it
Kovac's tutorial (well you must play to know what I mean)
cons
How to DLC (imho it's not really worth to buy them, I bought the Storm Warning Edition during sale for a few cents extra)
Apparently while player2 (joypad) is moving, player1 (keyboard) can't use the menu

How to Survive
How to Survive is one of the Best Survival games I have played so far [24/3/2015]. It is about surviving [Duh] and finding many ways to Escape off the Island/Place that you are at. You can either play online, offline [local co op] and co op with a friend [counted as online].
There are alot of weapons you can design and make, to fight your way through. There are zombies that are weak, boomers and Mutant Giant zombies that have like zillion health.
You can meet survivors all across the map, and they are asking for your assistance.

This is a very fun game, I recommend and really consider you to buy it.

Rate: 10/10

How to Survive
How to Survive is a game you can easily sink hours in if you like the genre.

The controls feel fluid and are easy to remember with Gamepad.
Combat doesn't feel clunky(even have finishers). There's a simple yet solid crafting system.
You actually have to drink, eat & rest in this game(Some ppl may or may not like that)

The story has some humor in it, but mostly found myself mashing 'A'.
Skills are a bit bland (eg.''+X% exp at night''), but the different weapon combinations
more than make up for it.

7.5/10

The price is a little steep, but it's a must-have when it goes on sale.

How to Survive
There is plenty of truth to what people are saying about the story mode / vanilla game being incredibly dry, fetch quest ridden, and poorly designed both from a character growth and survival mechanics standpoint; as well as the complaints about buggy online mode and the general lack of difficulty.

*however*

The Challenge and One Shot Escape modes are fair challenging and reasonably engaging, and imo make better use of the survival mechanics.

My advice is not to get the vanilla game and to go for the DLC package when it's on sale and enjoy a some play time with a roomie or significant other (basically someone that you see every day that you can just like, casually pick up and play games with) and to not take the game too seriously.

Must-play if you like quirky, stupid, and broken games.
The ragdoll physic glitches will have you in stitches ~

How to Survive
How To Survive is a very decent action game with pretty graphics and a nice, extensive crafting system. But after a few hours it's just that; pretty graphics and crafting, in addition to killing zombies. The killing feels satisfying by the way, but you basically go from one point to another, all across an island, doing basic quests. And if you're done on one island, it's on to the next one, which is basically the same as the previous one only bigger. If it were only more interesting. Giving the player more to do would've definitely helped this game out, especially since there's so much stuff to craft.
In the end it's just ok-ish, but still worth a look.

[Rating: 70/100]

How to Survive
Very boring and tedious game, gets repetitive very easily. The islands are really small, the monkey quests are a pain in the  and just stupid, the survival features like thirst and hunger are unique but annoying. Combat is mediocre, if you play as melee you struggle a lot, play with ranged weapons and wreck everything. The level system is just pathetic and there are less than 20 skills to level up, some of them just being completely passive and not helpfull at all. On top of that, the game wasn't really designed for mouse and keyboard. Paid like $1 for this game so not too much to worry about but I wouldn't recommend it anyway, it's just boring.

How to Survive
Frustrating and just too bland. Crafting is limited and the game play is amateur. This has been my opinion, if you do not like it, form your own.

How to Survive
I had a fun time with How to Survive up until the final battle. Then I had to rage quit about 10 times before I finally lived through it.

-The narrative by Kovac keeps the mood fun and entertaining.
-There are a cool variety of monster types and weapons to build.
-The crafting system isn't overly burdensome although the few number of inventory slots made it a chore at times.
-I found the aiming to be a little inconsistent with a controller, especially for the boomerang which happened to be my favorite weapon.
-The story does end up to be a lot of fetch questing, which gets old fast.

Fun? Yes. Does it make me want to buy the sequel? No.

How to Survive
Pros:

+Interesting crafting system
+Funny Dialog
+Comical Tutorial
+Local and online co-op
+Nice, but simple looking top down graphics
+Kovac (NPC)

Cons:

-Skill tree bland
-Semi-Linear gameplay
-Extremely limited inventory


You have ship wrecked and when you awake you find yourself surrounded by zombies and you quickly pick up a stick and the carnage begins.

How To Survive is a twin stick shooter of sorts with survival elements thrown into the mix.  The survival aspects in this are like you'd expect.  You will need to find and drink water, find shelter (and rid zombies of it) to sleep and kill the local wildlife to eat their meat so you don't starve to death.  You can even make fishing rods to fish as well.

There is a crafting system and it was somewhat unique and fun in my opinion.  You gather up resources you find throughout the island(s) and you can craft things like axes, bows, body armor, guns and explosive devices.  You will also be finding plants scattered about and you can combine them and make healing items.

Herbalism ranges from making healing items, tonics for shields, better aiming and so forth.  For the most part all I ever used were the healing items.  Making shields and what not only lasted you 15-30 secs and it's gone.  There wasn't much threat throughout the game unless you neglected to upgrade your weapons.

Threats on these islands range from your normal zombies to zombies in full tactical gear to giant Resident Evil Nemesis creatures.  Even the wildlife can turn and cause more problems than the zombies do.  Zombie deer?  You bet'cha!  If you happen to die you end up leaving a tombstone on the ground.  There's nothing for you to retrieve, but once your friends log in they can see where you've parished.  I saw plenty of people I recognize dead all over the place.

There is a story throughout your adventure and your goal is to get off the island.  There are other people stranded which act as quest givers.  Quests are mostly just fetching items or off to see your next NPC that always comes with funny dialog.

The DLC consists of challenge modes, the barricade mode and an extra story line that takes place on El Diablo Islands.  The challenge modes are just that.  Complete certain game functions without dying and nothing in your inventory.  Barricade mode is you build a base and keep the zombies out of the base to protect a wounded friend.  You run around and pick up wood and make barricades".

The base games story mode took me around 14 hours to beat and El Diablo Islands takes 3-4 more hours.  Max level is 15 and you can respec the skill tree 4 times.  The full game runs around $20 (including all DLC)

How to Survive
This is a fun small game to play. I bought this on a really good sale and for the price this is a very entertaining zombie-killing hack-n-slash. Skill trees are not very complex, but the game has a variety of weapons and items you can craft. I think this game will be even more fun playing it co-op, which you can do even locally

How to Survive
Pretty good game, but camera work ruins whole gameplay in a cooperative mode. It's just annoying. It really bothers me and many other players too (i have seen a few posts about it, players actually begged developers to fix this). However, single mode is interesting and provides fun for couple of hours and i think that if you like zombie survival type games (and playing alone also) you will like this game. Is it worth buying? For single playing only, yes.

How to Survive
So, I played 3 hours of this.

It is a nice game. I bought it in sale for 2.19 the whole pack which was worth 21.99.
I think I got more then what I payed for. 2 first hours I discovered the game. Good mechanics. The fights are interresting. One of the best part for me is the crafting side" and as I've not even been through more than two hours

How to Survive
Addicting. Stayed up all night playing this with my husband. We lost track of time, so he got 3 hours of sleep for a 12 hour day of work.

10/10

How to Survive
I wanted to like this, I really did. I really TRIED to like it, but it was really a disappointment.

This game is simply mediocre in so many ways. Don't expect a deep survival experience here. Don't expect much at all. Even the humor feels forced at many points.  (Though once or twice will make you smile a bit)

There are a lot worse games out there, but this game just really doesn't deliver on what it hints at in the trailers and previews.
If you want it, do yourself a favor and pick it up on sale.

(I also don't understand why it keeps popping up on the new releases list.)

How to Survive
After so many hours of playing this game I can only recommend buying this when on sale or if you have some extra money you want to spend and have good friends on skype or teamspeak to play this with.
It really is fun and all but some bugs can be pretty annoying for some people. Achievement bugs, two cursors, zombie bugs, item bugs etc. Look into the forums to see what I mean. But their are also a few game breaking bugs which make you restart (Sanchez Packages not stocking).

Anyway I break it down to this

Pros:
- lovely mixture of survival, zombies and crafting
- the koop is the best way to play this!
- El Diablo, Barrikade are lovely additions to this game even tho I prefer El Diablo over the other because new island, new items, new extra storyline
- different zombie types
- lots of BOOOOM
- looting and collecting while abusing the A Button... just give me all the stuff
- crafting all kinds of different weapons and figuring out what does what
- Bumerang <- best weapon ever followed by burning stick
- different characters with different abilities and weaknesses
- animals, plants the whole environment looks lovely but the fog is a pain in the butt
- KOVAC! this ing character has a lovely voice actor and beats everyone else. His guides and rules are also pretty fun.



Cons:
- The game contains some game breaking bugs which can't be fixed and need you to restart from the beginning.
- bugs, funny bugs, helpfull bugs but yes some bugs like standing zombies, stillwalking when dead zombies, stuck zombies
- some pretty much unbeatable achievements
- weird target system

As I said, if it wouldnt be fun I wouldnt have played it for almost 75hours by now.
If you love killing thousands of zombies with axe, bow, gun or just a ing stick, collecting items, solving quests, looting and crafting, you cant do anything wrong with this game.


How to Survive
Thanks Kovac, you taught me a lot.

This game prepared me for the apocalypse!
Now I know that lightning can struck me at least 5 times before I die.

How to Survive
Sometimes my biggest fear is that I will end alone...

Nope...
I don't mean alone because I'm not able to find the love of my life
I don't mean alone because all my friends will leave me
I don't mean alone because there will be no more ingredients to make a nice carbonara again

I mean that I will woke up, I will do my things, I will go out and I will find the total absolute nothing.
And the moment when, with all my fears coming true, I will go round the corner...suddenly...the light...

A russian guy that will approach me and he will tell me No worry my friend...I will teach you how to survive"....

Because this is what will happen in this game

You was planning to spend your summer on a small lonely island full of amazing wonderful girls (if you are a boy) / boys (if you are a girl) / sheeps (if you...well...nevermind) but suddenly a huge octopus will push your ship to hit some rocks and you will end into the luna park of zombies.

But the thing that will really creep you out is not the fact that every step you will do there will be a group of zombies trying to eat you...is the fact that you will find a russian...A SOBER RUSSIAN.
That is a thing that you should really be scared...in fact even the zombies tries to avoid him...remember...if you get bitten by a zombie you become a zombie...if you get bitten or bite a russian...you become a russian.

But apart for this...this is a really really really really underrated game.
Yes I know you will say "IT WAS REALLY CHEAP SO IT IS CRAP!"...no it isn't. Developers put a lot of passion inside this game and you can clearly see that after the last patches.
The game itself is not only improved but they have added some quite good stuff...from weapons to game modes to achievements...all stuff that will make this game more enjoyable day after day.

The gameplay is quite simple and original. It is a mix between a crafting game a survival horror and a RPG.
Crafting because all your weapons

How to Survive
Very competent isometric zombie survival aRPG with a lot of depth and challenge. Its by no means perfect, for me the biggest issue was the excessive level of padding. For instance why cant I just use this one boat to travel to all the other islands and instead need to move to different locations throughout zombie infested islands to reach different boats in order to get to other islands? Padding that's why. Where HtS really shines though, is in the crafting department. There's a lot of stuff you can craft and improve as you discover new recipes books or just by experimenting with the stuff you have in your inventory.

The combat system won't turn any heads around, but its not too shabby at all IMO, especially the ranged combat mechanic. Now, the lackluster skills tree and the clown mobile safe houses mechanic was a little weird and slightly detracted from the experience, but not by much. I'm definitely looking forward to completing the Story(which was surprisingly cool with a nice twist at the end) mode on the highest difficulty and playing some more coop(which is pretty sweet btw) with my buds.


Better Than DayZ/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
I love Spiderman. He was the first superhero comic I ever picked up as a kid. I own more Spiderman comic books than any other series in my collection and have been reading them for eighteen years (5 yrs-23 yrs). I've also played every single Spiderman video game since back in the early 90's and i'm here to tell you...

I went out on launch day to buy this game for PS3.  I beat it with my brother in law after only two sessions of playing - about 8 hours total. Mind you I was playing around a lot of that time and just exploring the city. I thought maybe I was just too hype on the game and it didn't meet my expectations...So I decided to give it another go on the PC.

Now keep in mind this is an open world game, but there is little to nothing to do! The city just doesn't feel like a real complete city. I still play the older titles and compared to this they all have way more to do and a lot more diversity in their levels, which is sad considering you're supposed to progress. Almost every single main mission takes place somewhere underground. Which at first is real cool...until you realize all of the missed potential that's just sitting there above you. Laughing at you. Mocking you. There are a few missions above ground but they are seldom.

There are plenty of side missions - Like crimes to solve which are inanely repetitive and overtly mundane, nothing like they used to be. I'm not even trying to be that guy that's just stuck on the past nostalgia, but if i'm still playing those games today (which I am) over the new titles they're dishing out...somethin' ain't right. Sure the missions in those games were all repetitive too, but at least more diverse and way more fun than Stop that car!" "Catch that runner!" "Stop that gang!" "Now stop that getaway car!" "Catch that mugger!" "There's a gang on the loose!"

No matter how you clothe a sheep it is still a sheep.

This is my review of The Amazing Spider-Man. I found this game to be <<CRASH>>

This is my review of The Amazi<<CRASH>>

This is my review of The Amazing Spider-Man. I found t<<CRASH>>

Annoying, right?

The Amazing Spider-Man
This game was so terrible I beat it very shortly that includes getting all 700 comics.. Only a person who is really bad at gaming. ...who isn't a real gamer.... has low expectations would love this game. Their is no challenge to it that is the very definition of what a game is the challenge. Since it didn't have a challenge I don't consider this to be a true game. The game is also broken on a technical level. It has glitches, bugs, and will have you restarting your pc or it will just flash out and close itself. Notice the people below who try to discredit me. Some of these people wrote reviews only one hr of playing a game and not completing them. I'm sorry kiddies I was born in the era of NES and Atari and been gaming way longer than you peons. My experience makes me better than you new generation spoonfed gamers where every task is given to you. The AI in this game is dumb. The bosses are all the same and offer no challenge what so ever. They don't learn or do any new strategy from the next.

When you look at this game it seems to have potential but looks are decieving. Lets start off with the kick they did to pc gamers as a punishment to not buying the game on console, and waiting for pc. So instead of snapping 7 spider signals to get the suits you are made to collect 700 comics, and complete tasks. You get most of the new suits when beating the game. Its like why after that.
The suits also offer no stat differences or powers.

Technical issues. Aside from webbing through the city, running up walls, and climbing them is a glitchfest, the webbing doesn't feel as fun as in past spiderman games. It also feels inorganic and articficial as you can just hold bottom R trigger to keep webbing. You'll be using the first r1 button because its more responsive and accurate. This also has its flaw as the indicator to where your travelling is only slightly more golden or yellowish.

The game constantly crashes on you. No bug fixes or patched have yet to be released. Making the game even more painful to play through its glitchness and instability.  People with rigs like mine that are up to date, and high end memory, and gpu's have had the similar painstaking problems, I have had. If I wasn't a power user I swear the ordinary user must have a real bad day troubleshooting this piece of hellborn spawn. The lack of support for this game, and no more added content, plus all the problems make it a no buy. Until they fix all the problems and make it playable I do not recommend buying this game.
Its a shame Marvel let this bad pc port over like this without testing it fully, and fixing it up.

All of us Spiderman fans are waiting for all the other games to come to PC. Marvel you're losing money not investing, and properly investing in us.

Again it looks decent, but no because it doesn't function properly. My biggest complaint comes with they came out with dlc fast but not with the patches the games needs so drastically.

Just look at these Steam Forums
http://steamcommunity.com/app/212580/discussions/0/864951657868730063/

Thoughts after finishing the game. It still is a mess. The controls are bad, the story is lack luster,
and the boss battles are repetitive, and feel like a cluster of organized randomness. They did not port this at all well for pc, and never fixed any bogs, released patches. It could have been a great game, but all of these combined make it a fail of a choice. You won't regret buying this particular spiderman game trust me. The games combat system is super easy, and you will get to it too quickly. People who have no gaming skill will love this very easy game filled with glitches.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I had fun but it's not worth the regular price.  PROS- Looks cool, nice unlockables, and an okay story. CONS- Repetitive gameplay, awkward camera (stealth), crashing, and lag for ATI/AMD users (I'm not the only one).

THE REPETITIVE PARTS:
The missions have the same formula: beating up generic thugs/guards, going through vents, and using stealth. All bosses (except the Rhino) can be just defeated by spamming the combat button and dodging. New York does not have many things to do except chasing the same cars and fighting the same crime scenarios. All thugs dissappear after you defeat them all.

Only get it on sale, if you really want it.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I'd like to begin with a little song.

 Crash again, Crash again,
It crashes to desktop whenever it can.
Loads a cutscene, or just a level part.
Doesn't like it, it's too hard
Look Out!
Here comes a crash again. 

At its best, Amazing 1 is a game that reminds me a lot of the Arkham games. Spider-man controls smoothly and combat can feel very satisfying with striking from behind, retreating to the ceiling, and then quickly moving to a new spot to strike again.
The open world (Manhattan) is nicely detailed and is filled with collectables so you always have something to do while web-slinging from mission to next mission or random crime event.

Unfortunately there are a lot of points where Amazing 1 stops being fun. Despite Spider-Man's strengths lying in jumping away and being able to use high ceilings to his advantage a lot of the missions put you in a tiny, enclosed space where this is not possible so you have to rely on the combat. The combat tries to be Arkham with combos and smooth flowing from one enemy to the next, but this doesn't always work.

The web-slinging isn't as nice as it could be either, which I think is mainly due to the game's locked FOV. You simply lose track of where you are headed. When I first started playing this and got to Manhattan, I actually got a bit nauseous at first until I got more used to it. Fortunately there is an alternative by web-rushing using the R2 bumper everywhere, which basically automatically picks a good spot to get to.

And then there's the absolute biggest issue... the game is horribly optimised. It crashes at least once each half hour for no good reason, and while the game does autosave, you can get unlucky enough to have this occur during a boss fight so you have to redo a part of the level and the fight again.

Voice acting is okay, not good but not cringe-worthy either, and graphics are passable.

If you can pick this up for less than /$ 10, I'd recommend it. Skip the DLC though, that's all based on more combat and therefore not really fun.
It does NOT get a recommendation at its current full price of %/$ 30 or even the 50% discount which is still up as I write this.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Ok, I do recommend that you buy this game but I would say only buy it if it is on sale for about 7.99/$9.99. I really do not think it is worth more than that and I will tell you why.

First the bad...

This game crashes a lot. This is well known at this point and all of the fixes" that have been discussed simply did not work for me. I am a Windows 10 user

The Amazing Spider-Man
Kinda feels like cheap Batman-Arkham-games imitation, but:
a) it has it's charm
b) it's Activision, so it won't be cheap.

While I recommend it for being playable and fun, Batman feels like better game.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Swing and crawl above and beyond Manhattan sounds like fun, right?Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.

----------------------------------------------------------------

[ REVIEW]
The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 action adventure video game, that revolves around the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. Developed by Beenox and published through Activision, it found its way on Windows, X-Box 360, Playstation 3, Nintendo DS & 3DS, Wii & Wii U, iOS and Android.

The story is based a few months after the events from The Amazing Spider-Man movie and can be hold as an alternate epilogue to it. Yet, it is not necessary to watch the film, in order to follow the story from the game.
It starts with Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, who sneak into the restricted areas of Oscorp. Gwen has suspicions that the company still works on so-called Cross-Species, virus-mutated humans with special powers, after Dr. Curt Connors became The Lizard, who sits now in a mental facility. Both get caught eventually by Alastairs Smythe, who does not deny the work on the cross-species, just for a little longer until they all will be destroyed, as he says. Since Peter Paker is a cross-species himself, all of the other still contained species react to him, become insane in their behavior and manage to break out of Oscorp. The virus, which these species carry inside, is highly infectious when bitten and so the virus spreads around Manhattan. It is up to Spider-Man to rescue the whole inhabitants of Manhattan, bring justice to Oscorp and of course to find an Antidote. Dr. Connors could be a help to develop an Antidote and so Spider-Man has no choice but giving him assistance to break out the facility. With Connors on his back, Spider-Man is on his way into his apartment and so a race against time begins.

Gameplaywise, The Amazing Spider-Man has to offer a lot, as expected from an open world game. From RPG elements to endless swinging, everyone will get their money worth. While being outside Peter's apartment, the player can either continue with his main missions or help the citizens of Manhattan. For this purpose Spider-Man owns an Osphone, which he obtained from Gwen in Oscorp. The map of Manhattan is accessible through this device, where also main and side missions can be found. If one of the points is selected on the map, a red beam appears somewhere in the city, showing up the accurate location. Side missions can be for example beating down thiefs/bullies, helping the police to catch criminals, locate and investigate hidden places and so on. If the player is not tired after completing all of them, he can go on a comic collection hunt; 700 pages in number have to be found. Some of them are placed in the city, some of them in each main level. They can easily be spotted through their golden shine and sparkling sound. After progress in the game, Spider-Man will get a camera, with which he has to take pictures about suspicious events. However, all of these side missions are optional and contain additional experience points.
Speaking of which, experience points are used to strengthen Spider-Man's Skills. A hurricane made with webs or being able to stealth kill two enemies at once sounds like fun, right? And damn, it is. With every new skill -11 in number-, Spider-Man is even more fun to play and offers new ways to battle against the foes. And as if this is not enough, there are also so-called Tech-Upgrades, mechanical tweaks for his web shooters. Unlike the normal skills, the player needs to collect scrap pieces in order to upgrade them. Rapid fire will teach the enemies the meaning of fear, wall blast sticks them at the nearest wall and much more.
Main missions are the common threads. The game is segmented in 12 different, but connected chapters, including a 13th chapter to roam around or finish bypassed side quests. Inside the apartment from Spider-Man the player has the choice to replay any mission he wants. A special feature that might be worth mentioning is the possibility to change the Spider-Man outfit. They can be unlocked by different tasks inside the missions, such as Find all comic papers or Finish the game on the highest difficulty. A list which skins are available and how to unlock them can be found here.
That being said, The Amazing Spider-Man contains so much additional side missions that players can easily fill around 20 or more hours.

The controls have their ups and downs and show shamelessly straight, that this game is a console port. It is highly recommended to play with a controller, since keyboard and mouse feel very clunky and unfinished. However, when played with a controller, Spider-Man's skill to swing, jump and crawl all over the place turns out to be very enjoyable.

When it comes to the graphics, The Amazing Spider-Man shows its prettiness. Manhattan's streets, sewers and interior of buildings look very detailed and the day and night cycle with the varying ambient lighting effects are truly well made and even after around 4 years pleasant to look at. The different suits do look stunning on the highest graphic options, including even minor details such as small pimples all over the suits and in-depth shadows to show of Spider-Man's muscles. Definitely nothing to sneeze at, considered its age.

Unfortunately, this shiny coin is not as golden as the player might think by now. The Amazing Spider-Man suffers from a tremendous game breaking bug: Random Crashes. There is no known source why these crashes appear and with that no known fix for everyone. Some found a downloadable fix, some reported that turning off Anti-Aliasing helped. There are a lot of tweaks around the internet but none of them are the very one everyone is searching for. A huge letdown for an amazing game like this.

The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the better games that contains a famous hero and connects itself to the end of a movie. The huge content spiked with RPG elements and an interesting combat system known from the Batman games, fills hours of hours with fun, if it would not crash so frequently. Still, for those who can stand this problem will find themselves slinging and crawling around in The Amazing Spider-Man!

Recommended when on sale.

For this review I played through the game a second time and did not get tired of it. RPG elements are always something I love to see in games and the spider-like acrobatic skills from Spider-Man made the game even more enjoyable. I caught myself very often, that I just swung around Manhattan without any objective or mission selected. Purchase on sale and have a lot of fun!

[ TL;DR]
[] Highly detailed graphics
[] Great storyline with many side quests
[] RPG elements (leveling up, upgrading skills, unlockable suits)

[] Crashes often, nVidia & AMD likewise (no prober fix for everyone available)
[] Crawling on walls from time to time disorienting
[] Controls clunky, when played with keyboard and mouse (controller recommended)

The Amazing Spider-Man
A fun game for every spidey loving gamers out there. This game will get you flying through the streets of Manhattan with cool acrobatics which Spider-Man is mostly about for me. You can unlock different costumes after a while, but after completing the game I had only unlocked about 3 out of 6 or so.

It also has a good story but reveals something that most likely will come in the new movie.

After the story is completed you can still swing around in the city and save citizens from small crime, or just swing around for fun and listen to the epic Spider-Man music.

However there are some things that I did not like about this game.
When you swing around in the city, it doesn't seem like the web is hitting any of the buildings, it goes straight up into the air. Which I think is really sad and lazy beacause I remember a Spider-Man game back in the day on PS2 where the web actually hit the buildings and you had to swing in a different way because of the way the web hit the building. This game kind of goes back to PS1 where the web just goes straight up, but you still gotta swing where there are buildings close to you of course.

Most of the combat and missions happen inside sewers and buildings, which doesn't give you such a great feeling of being Spider-Man, very few missions are outside. Most of the game is spent inside something.

But even though I got some negative things to say about this game, I would still recommend it (although it's pretty easy).
It gives you the feeling of being The Amazing Spider-Man. I had fun completing this game, and I would play it again if I had forgotten the whole story.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I have always been a Marvel fan, and when I saw The Amazing Spider-Man I just had to get it.  First, the good news.  It has some fun moments, good voice acting, and pretty good spider powers.
Now for the bad news.  The game crashes, and it does it somewhat frequently.  I can almost handle the checkpoint save system (typical console port), but to combine it with crashes is unforgiveable.  Also, as you will read on the forums, the game suffers from poor performance.  It's not a matter of how good your hardware is, it's a matter of how poorly the optimizations were done in the port.  In fact, the performance problems are so bad that it takes a fast reaction scenario and turns it into an unplayable mess.  If it were not for Spider-Man's ability to slow time, some of the fights would be frustratingly unwinnable.  Not because it was necessary to use the power, but because you can't keep up when you are dropping frames.
If you want a better alternative, play Batman Arkham Assylum or Arkham City.

The Amazing Spider-Man
The open world is a hub for the main missions, and the random" crimes have a limit and are not random. The story is OK but the combat is not as smooth as they were hoping for when making it. The swinging is by far the worst in any open world Spider-Man game and is just pathetic. The graphics look great

The Amazing Spider-Man
I think this is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played, still, as Spiderman fan I enjoyed it.
It's really bugged, it's almost unplayable if you have Antialising and some high" settings enabled :/ And after messing with the config still crashes often. I think the only time I quit the game because I wanted to was when I finished it.

I only recommend this if you like Spiderman and you get it really cheap

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man takes place directly after the movie. After the events of the movie, Alistair Smythe takes over the cross-species experiments when Curt Connors is taken to a mental hospital. Things eventually go wrong and cross-species creatures such as Vermin, Scorpion and Rhino break out of OsCorp and into the city. The cross-species contaminate the city and it becomes Spider-Man's mission to find a cure with the help of Connors.
The game does an amazing job of making the player really feel like Spider-Man. Swinging around Manhattan looks gorgeous, despite the fact that there is no Spider-Man 2 style web swinging, the web lines just sort of stick to nothing.
The combat in this game is very good. It is a more basic version of Batman Arkham series' combat system. There is a designated attack button, jump and web moves are available. Once your combo reaches a certain number and an enemy is in a dazed state, you can do a signature move which automatically KO's them and usually involves some acrobatics and webbing.
A problem is that it is quite repetitive at times. Quite a lot of the time, it is much easier to stealth take down any enemies than to get into an actual fight, and if youre spotted, you can web rush around a little until the enemies lose sight of you and then try again.
The levels in the game are fun. However the game suffers from a lack of different environments. The main missions take place in a few areas that look a lot alike. All the major missions take place indoors. Almost all side missions take outdoors. Side missions include beating up muggers, challenges, car chases and photo missions. The boss battles are ok.
Overall, the graphics look good. Some of the character models look strange, but it is only noticeable if you are talking to them. Enemies look good. The city looks great especially in the night. Spidey's different costumes all look very nice.
The Amazing Spider-Man is a slightly above average attempt at taking a movie and making a game adaptation. The free roam, which should be a staple feature in a Spider-Man game is fun and can be quite addictive when getting down to collectibles and the camera angle used makes for some breathtaking web swinging moments.
The Amazing Spider-Man would be amazing if the game would be a little less repetitive and would have real web-swinging.

Sounds 8/10
Graphics 8/10
Gameplay 7/10
Atmosphere 8/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
NOTE:: I'd give this game a neutral" review

The Amazing Spider-Man
At first look, this game looks like a cheap cash grab into the currently shining Super-Hero games industry, and that's because it is.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Personal Rating: 3 of 10

NOTE: The low rating given was due to bugs which causes the game to be unplayable.

This game is awesome, when it works flawlessly. It is everything you expect it should be being Spider-Man and being such a hard-hitting, action and open world game, it really manages to differs from all of it peers at a level on its own.

The game starts slow and I did thought is that all the game has to offer at first; mindless mouse mashing. Several chapters into the game, it actually expand the content and also combat capabilities. Levels are replayable so you can take your time to explore and complete the collectibles. No pressure there.

You may need to get used to the camera and mouse and keyboard input capture at first but as you proceed with the game, you will slowly take your mind off them. All in all, this game is really awesome and not just some money-grab to follow the Spider-Man trend.

However, all these only applies without the bad hardware support and constant crashes. The game jerks horribly specially in the open world. This is not due to hardware performances. If you just do some research, you will know this game is not compatible with RADEON cards. I tried to resolve the problem without avail since none of the solution does not promise a 100% success rate. The game also constantly crash at random times. Fans has been discussing this issue that seems to occurs to RADEON and NVIDIA users. Most of the solutions provided are again not confirmed as I have tried them all.

If you really enjoy such open world games, I do highly recommend this title. You will definitely not be disappointed. But it comes with a huge gamble if the game actually worked or not.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I have been a HUGE spidey fan since i was a young boy. This game is one of my top favorite ones to play, if you are a spidey fan even in the slightest i recommend buying this game.

The Amazing Spider-Man
This game... wow. I wasn't sure when I picked it up at first, as Spiderman seems to have an inconsistent track record when it comes to games, but this game really hooked me. It tends to have a technical issue now and again that may have booted me from the game a couple times, but I always went back for more. Not only are the combat and swing mechanics fun and easy to pick up, but the story gets f-ing crazy as well, taking Spiderman to what felt like an apocalypse scenario by the end of it. I can definitely recommend this one as a pick-up if you're jonesing for a Spidey fix. (Also, turn up those speakers. The robotic worm fight worked my bass quite a bit. :))

The Amazing Spider-Man
**First off. I write this review not using the AMD GPU.


This was my first Spider-man game I've played since the PS1 and PS2 versions. I saw this on sale and said why the hell not. I haven't indulged in a Spider-man game for awhile, and I always remember enjoying them.

Right from the start this game brought back all the fun and excitement that I remember from the old. Same simple commands and fast paced third person fighting action.

Pros:

-fast paced fighting action with smooth movements and very responsive inputs(very useful while dodging!)
-simple open-world, not too big, not too small
-long play time(even on easiest setting)
-very user friendly phone/map interface
-enjoyed the Web-Dash

The Amazing Spider-Man
The whole time I was playing this I was convinced I would feel like writing about it afterwords. I did write some things in my head. Now that I am here I kind of don't have anything to say. Let me just list some things see if it sparks something.

First things first. I really like Spiderman. So now you know I'm biased but lets get into it.

What I didn't like
- Manhattan is boring. At least in this game it is. It looks boring and it feels boring.
- Everything looks feels old. The UI looks dated, the city even with the game running at maximum 1080p usually 60fps (the game seems to bog down for seemingly no reason a lot) the city looks dated and the draw distance seems to favor fogginess. Also the button prompts are ridiculous.
- It launches twice sometimes and crashes because of that (happened like 7 times)
-There is very little variety in the side missions
- There are too many collectibles

What I did like
-You get to be Spiderman


Okay, I'll say more.
Traversing around feels great. Now given that Spidy swings on his web that attaches to things thats not always the case here. HOWEVER, in reality the mechanics of that and having to react to that in addition to fighting would be overbearing. The swinging feels great. You are Spiderman. Not, figure out the best trajectory while fighting a giant robot.. man. The fighting feels pretty decent. Its a little over animated but again, you're Spiderman you still need to fight accordingly. Its very responsive and in no way out of your control.

Stealth is very fun, you can look through your mask while time is slowed and choose a location to zipline to and prey on your foes very tactical like. You know he can stick to walls and ceilings right? Think about it.

Even though there is not much in the way of side mission variety the things here are fun. Races, petty crimes, helping the police by going behind enemy lines or ending a car chase. Of course there is also taking pictures of crap. I mean, its not like he works at the Daily Bugle or anything. And all of these activities repeat with some variation between the main missions. There is also picking people up (escaped mental patients and infected people) and taking them to the appropriate place. Which is fun because swinging around is friggin awesome.

There are comic books EVERYWHERE and grabbing them out of the sky is super fun because again getting around very liberating and fluid. Its an absolute joy to snag a collectible and proceed to fall and then swing in between two cars at ground level.

The voice acting is actually very good which surprised me, then I recognized and looked up to confirm that Nolan North (Nathan Drake and every other male character not voiced by Troy Baker) and Ali Hillis (Liara T'Soni and Lightning from FFXIII) are in the game.

If you like Spiderman you'll like this game, if you don't, this game won't change your mind. I guess I had more to say than I thought.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Massive optimisation issues, doesn't even launch properly :(

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man (ASM) is set after the events of Columbia Pictures' film and like most movie-based video games, ASM falls short in technical support and voice acting. The game in its current state has random crashes, but it is still is an outright blast. If you're in the mood for some web slinging acrobats and an open world to explore, ASM should provide some satisfaction.

The Amazing Spider-Man
There is only one word for this game: Amazing! First of all the graphics are amazing in this game. I played a lot of open world games mimicking New York City like Grand Theft Auto IV, Prototype 2 or the previous Spiderman game Web of Shadows and this looks by far the best! Swinging around in the city is absolutely fun but when it comes to fights in the air with robots i.e. this becomes pure awesome action. The boss fights are well made and among the best I have seen. What I like too is the cool patter by Peter Parker. When listening to it you get the feeling he's a really nice guy. Very good game and everyone who enjoyed the comics or movies (BTW: this game has nothing to do with the latest movie ;) ) should get this game!

The Amazing Spider-Man
Simply amazing game,as the titles already says,good graphics,well contured characters,but somehow thes story is a bit unsatisfying.Overall a very good Activion game.

The Amazing Spider-Man
i enjoyed this game the camera sensitivity is to high so make sure to change that it the options before
starting the game. when given the launch screen make sure to put everything on high except your shadowing
that should go on medium so no matter what computer the game will run pretty smooth
so the game play is a little hard to figure out at the begining but they do sink in after a while.
the storyline is fun but its alot better just to swing around and collect items

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man - (PC)Final Grade: C+
(Decent, but has significant flaws)

The Need To Know
Graphics options cover the basics, but not much more than that. You can adjust them in a launcher that opens prior to the game starting up.
It took me about 20 hours to complete the game (With All Side Missions done and most of the collectibles found If you're powering through the story missions, you're likely looking at around 8 hours of gameplay or so.
This is a movie tie-in game with The Amazing Spider-Man reboot movie that came out in 2012. It will spoil signficant plot elements of the first movie if you haven't seen it. However, it does NOT tie-in to the events of the second movie.
Reportedly crashes often; Check out this thread for more information.
Capped at 60 FPS.
Not optimized for ATI or AMD Radeon cards. Expect significant stuttering if you have one.
Has a Stan Lee cameo and optional Stan Lee DLCSo, The Amazing Spider-Man tie-in game is a decent little action-adventure that's fun to play, especially if you haven't had a Spider-Man fix in a while. There's a lot to it, and most of it is handled pretty competently, but in my opinion, it's still not quite as good as the now famous Spider-Man 2 tie-in video game. Still, it's a decent amount of fun, and worth the 10 dollars I spent on it.

Narrative

The video game follows almost immediately after the events of the first movie, throwing you in the role of the titular Peter Parker,  helping Gwen Stacy inside of Oscorp and watching as teams are dismantling and disposing of Curt Connors' cross-species research. Unfortunately, the mere prescence of Peter causes the mutated cross-species monsters to react extremely violently, eventually breaking out of containment and spreading a lethal, contagious virus among the scientists, and eventually New York.

It's not a bad premise, and I like the idea of building up on the premise of the previous movie and using it to fuel new ideas. The cross species contamination has resulted into familiar animal-themed villains, such as Scorpion, Rhino, Vermin, Nattie,  and a few more familiar faces show themselves as well. The development for a cure even ties into Peter Parker's own nature as Spider-Man, which I found to be pretty clever.

The characters are all reasonably well-rounded and interesting. Gwen Stacy is a major player in this one, although those who saw her in the movie may be disappointed that Emma Stone does not reprise her role in the game, instead opting to use... well, some other girl. In fact, none of the movie actors show up here, and the voice actors they chose aren't really trying to act like their movie counter-parts. (Oh, well. I understand. Have to save money somewhere.)
The characters themselves are probably the best part of the story. Connor's is a man striving for redemption by destroying the monsters he has created. Smythe is egotistical, but not unsympathetic. Even Peter himself seems exhausted by the constant weight concomitant with being a superhero.

Some minor complaints; the introduction of uber-powerful robots and Mass Effect levels of technology, stretches my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. Apparently Oscorp's idea of dealing with the beginning stages of a viral outbreak is to send out a Reaper. I'm not kidding, it's a Mass Effect Reaper. It's like the first boss, too. I don't mind some science fiction, but given the relatively grounded first movie, I think it's silly that we can go from Modern Day New York" to "Giant Robots" without even a pause for breath. And they never stop coming

The Amazing Spider-Man
I once also read reviews about this game, and what I found was mostly negative.
But I still decided to get the game and I didn't regret it. Sure it has some flaws and it crashes quite often, but despite that I had a lot of fun. The story sets after the first Amazing Spiderman Movie, but it doesn't really matter if you didn't watch it. You start of by doing your first mission and after that you can choose between swinging around in the city or continuing the storyline.  The sidequest makes you earn special features like concept arts etc. Although they are repetitive, it's fun just to swing around the city and finishing them. I played this with a 360 controller and the controls are something you need to get used to.

The story itself isn't mountain moving, but it isn't completely bad either. There aren't a lot of reasons to replay it after one playthrough, expect going for achievements (beating the game on different difficulties). The graphics could have been better, too. 5/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
If I was rating this game based on Spider-Man's toned butt and chiseled abs, I would give this game a 10/10.

But sadly that is not the case. This game isn't the worst I've ever played, but it certainly isn't the best either. And this is coming from a diehard Spider-Man fan. I was so excited for this game. I wanted to love it! But truthfully, this game is just not fun. There are a lot of reasons for this, but ultimately what makes it fail is its repetiveness. Everything about this game is repetitive. The side quests are all exactly the same. Every single one. The main quests are all also the same. You're almost always either in the sewers or Oscorp, and each location basically plays out the same way. Even the boss battles are all the same. You are either fighting a cross-species or a giant robot. Sure, swinging around the city, stopping crime, and trying to save New York is fun in the beginning. But it gets old fast. It got to the point where I had to force myself to finish the game because I wasn't having fun anymore.

There are some good points. The storyline in general was okay. Was it a little repetitive too? Yes. But at least it brought some intrigue to the game. The voice acting was excellent. There were quite a few one-liners in there that had me laughing. I definitely have to give them props for bringing in a Stan Lee cameo. The graphics were pretty good too.

Once again, is the game horrible? No. But it certainly isn't worth $40. Luckily I got it on sale, so I don't feel like I wasted my money. Ultimately I can't recommend this game for the price it's listed. So my advice to you? Wait for it to go on sale. It's worth it if you don't spend too much for it. But don't buy it for $40. You will only find yourself disappointed.

The Amazing Spider-Man
The primary problem is the port from console was not error free. Almost...unplayable. I could not build up continious play time, experiencing crashes no less than every every 15 min. Wait til it's cheaper to check if it works with your rig.

The game itself, plays well, cutscene heavy with button presses during and the rest of the time fighting bosses or in an open world. The world is a decent size, typical collectables but the series events were enjoyable, like some of the powers they give you to play. However, the world events seemed sparse, you have to wait for the next event to unlock.

Common battles are not too tough, but some boss battles take a sec to see the strategy. Then again of course, be ready for your button presses during the cutscenes. Reminds me of Batman playstyle, different world, powers, and events.

Decent game overall, just a little derivative, not that there is anything wrong with it. It is a good formula and it executes minus the almost unplayable errors for the PC/Steam version. Worse off, I check back a bit and no updates.

The Amazing Spider-Man
THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN REVIEW .
+ Nice story
+ Fun web-swinging
+ Gr8 combat

- Boring side missions
- Missions are repitative

OVERALL - 7.5/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
When it first appeared, i loved this reboot of the Spiderman games. And I still love it now. There was one major game breaking inconvinient: Every 2 hours or so, the game crash, independent of what you do, and you have to restart it. However, during my playtime, no saves were corrupted, so don't worry. On with the review then:

Graphics: The Graphics are nice for a 2012 game, Spiderman's character model being the prettiest looking thing in the game, as well as the other Spiderman Suits.

Audio: The Voice acting is really nice, and the music is perfect for each situation. When you are in combat, the music is adequate, and a big plus is the free roam music (8 different tracks which all feel fresh).

Story: While the story is predictable, it is very well tied in and doesn't feel bland and boring. The Ending is also nice and the intro is also fine. All the different cross-species and robots you fight feel very suited for the mission.

Gameplay: The Combat is basically punch - dodge - evade - retreat, taken from the Batman games, but it is nice, and the acrobatic moves which Spidey does keep the battle satisfying and it doesn't get boring very fast. The Free Roam is very nice, the new Web-Rush ability lets you go from point to point very easy and fast, making you in control of Spidey's every move. The Web-Swing, some complain that Spidey ''swings from the sky'' which is true, but if you're not a perfectionist, you won't mind it too much. You also have different web abilities, like web shoot, web grab, the standard spidey moves. There is also a menu where you can customize Spiderman, or his web abilites, which is kind of rewarding. The Boss Battles are pattern-like, every boss has around 3 type of attacks which you will learn REALLY fast. This is a minus from me. By doing several activites (like collecting comic books, finishing the game) you will unlock 5 to 10 Spiderman Suits which are surprisingly eye-appealing and nice. A complain from me would be that most of the main mission take place in Oscorp, or the Sewers, only 2-3 taking place in New York. This was a minus from me. At street level, there isn't much to do, but once you get in the air, the fun begins (because swinging in New York is fun).

Last Impression: I recommend this game to everybody. While it isn't a game changer or some sort of Game of The Year, it is nonetheless a nice experience, and i would play this game again at any time. So, what are you waiting Web-Heads? New York is your playground!

The Amazing Spider-Man
Fun swingin' and beatin' up , but the since it's ported it needs to be better optimized.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Had to delete a file just so I could click launch game from the graphics settings.

Resolution wouldn't change. Looked for fix, found 5 different ways to try, none worked.

If I wanted to play this game on the resolution of a calculator screen, I'd turn it upside down and spell out boobs" with numbers instead.

nvidia users beware.

[TL;DR]
Spend your money on a calculator."

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider Man.  Not exactly amazing, yet it is lighthearted and easy to play.  Addictive although riddled with crashes.   Repetitive indoor scenes that make you yearn to swing around the city again.  It lacks the depth and story telling that the Batman series has despite the amount of attention this superhero has had over the last decade.  I would put this as slightly better than average game with a reasonable amount of content for a sale price.  Don't expect it to have much in the way for replay value even if you're trying to earn the achievements.  The annoying crashes and ridiculous amount of comic book pages strewn throughout the city and indoor maps won't have you drinking your favorite energy/caffeinated beverage and threatening to miss an important event.  I give it a 6.5/10 for fun with flair despite obvious shortcomings.

Update:  The story does seem a little less hokey once complete, but I still feel empty for having finished the normal difficulty.  The achievements on Steam only update when the game decides you can finish a certain number of achievements.  It's not a fully open & live world.  Things become available for you to do as chapters unlock so in a sense it's really a forced linear progression with optional challenges.  There aren't random wandering villains doing things on their own for you to take a break from the story.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I wish I could play this game but it crashes to desktop everytime I try to run it on a setting higher than low". I would have tried playing it on the low setting but it chugs like I'm trying to play this on a wimpy computer. From what I've read it's an issue with AMD cards. So I guess avoid this game if you have an AMD."

The Amazing Spider-Man
This game is wicked fun! I am and always have been a huge marvel fan spidey being my favorite. I have played every imaginable game possible that includes spider-man. I dunno about the bad reviews, I guess not a game for them. I like the story, the voice acting is great and I quite enjoyed the missions. Some state the game crashes all the time... get a new computer or something, cause it never crashes for me. And I mean never!

The free roaming is awesome, but like ANY free roaming game it will get boring, just normal. The graphics are great in my opinion and this does not feel like a bad port at all, I have seen much much worse. I think it handles the Keys and Mouse very well, if not the controller will work too.

My only disappointment was some of the DLCs. I like the Stan Lee pack (king of cameo). But The other ones were meh! SImple chanllenges and can'T really do anything more than that.

Anyways AMAZING GAME! 8/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
I have an AMD processor, and this game was nearly unplayable. If you have an AMD processor, make very sure that Amazing Spider Man will run on your processor before you buy

The Amazing Spider-Man
NOW IT IS MISSING EXECUTABLE, WHAT IS THAT? WHY IS THIS HAPPENING, IT IS SO STUPID I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! >:(

The Amazing Spider-Man
Kind of interesting game, but optimization ruins all fun you can get from it. Regular crashes approximately every 30 minutes make game almost impossible to play. Typical for Activision, try to sell a game without even testing it. Of course

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man?  More like the Amazing Spider-TURD.  This game is bad.  I wasted so much on this and it's insulting, too.  You literally go around beating up mental patients.  They aren't even demon possessed or anything.  They are just people with mental illness that you beat up with a sort of Batman Arkham action gameplay, but much less smooth.  I was excited for this game because the boss battles looked great and I thought that it was going to be like the great Batman games only with Spider-Man.  Nope.  Game is frustating and somewhat buggy.  It's crashed on me so many times during the game.  There is no style to it and the plot is very stock.  I guess it would be alright if it was like 5-10 bucks but it's overpriced and lame.

Stay away from this game.  Save your money and buy much cheaper and much better games.  You could get 4 games that are far superior to this for the same price.

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing" part: You get to play as Spider-Man!

The "Awful" part: Virtually everything else!

Seriously

The Amazing Spider-Man
the launch game button doesnt work after the stupid graphics setup, so i cant even play it!!

The Amazing Spider-Man
there is fix that worked in the past but now it no longer does for me and some others link below. I have an HD7970ghz 3GB amd fx-8350, and 16gb of ram. And now the The Amazing Spiderman 2" is out but there still has been no patch to fix this..... considering that I'm not the only one that this game doesn't work for and it would seem to be centered around ATI GPU. There really should be a warning on the games page at the least that this game is not supported on ATI cards not a "Hey it works on those cards" ie "Recommended: Graphics: NVidia 8800GT / AMD ATI Radeon HD4830" . yeah you will lose some money I get that but this is false advertisement the game doesn't work. I have half a mind to submit a class action lawsuit for this issue it's pure negligence. even if it's to show game developers that you can't just release a game that doesn't function I mean even games in alpha and beta on steam warn you and are like "hey were not promising anything". I shouldn't have to use a third party work around to just get the game running. (that now doesn't even work for my card and others I see.) considering now the game simply crashes the instant I click to start the game. I mean seriously that game has been out since 6/26/2012 and it's now 5/7/2014 that almost two years that it's been broken even going to activision for support gets you nothing. they just tell me to do things I though and did a dozen times before ever contacting them about this in attempt to fix it to no avail.

Lags like hell on AMD cards, unplayable. You may have better luck if you're not using one, however.

The Amazing Spider-Man
CAUTION!The game is broken and unplayable.

Couldn't play the game when it came out because of bad optimisation. My last PC used to be crap but it was able to run Battlefield 3 and even Witcher 2.
The PC was crap but it should have been powerful enough to run THIS game on medium settings at the very least.
But bad optimisation is the least of it problems.

The following is 100% true for Windows 8/8.1/10

Fast forward to 2016. I have a new PC now and I finally decided to give The Amazing" Spider-Man a go.
As a first surprise the launcher told me that I don't have enough memory to play this game. This is of course a filthy lie. I have more memory than I need.
After looking around for a bit I found a solution: Delete the VideoDetection.dll file and you're good to go.
I did that

Better than The Amazing Spider-Man 2 thats for sure

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Well, I will start with the good things first. This game is fun, its very easy to pick up and its interface is fairly user friendly. Its tutorial could be a bit more in depth, but all in all if your looking to enjoy a game for a few hours and it is free this is a good way to go. I say a few hours and I dont recommend this game because thats all it takes to get from tier 1 to 4 in the ships... then at tier 4 is where the problems begin and i mean serious problems. Like world of tanks this game uses a tier system for ships with relatively weak ships at low tier and strong ships at high tier, At tier 4 you will start to see tier 9 to 11 ships, this basically ends the game. These ships have double your hp, do double your damage and have double your view range. Prepare to be destroyed over and over again.

As this game has a small community 95% of games will be like this, every so often you get a rare gem of same tier ships in a game and for me this simple but engaging game is great at times like that. But having to work your way thru game after game of no contest destruction by ships much higher level is tedious at best. This then brings me onto the second problem with this game, and for me the more important issue. The people in the tier 9 to 11 ships, the games veterans. There is two sides to this and I can see both, there appears to be very few people reach these high tiers so without being placed in games against low tiers they would never be able to play these top tier monsters. But this has the knock on affect of no one will reach high tier because of what i said above.

The other side is the attitude of these veterans, they are toxic and rude people. If you dare to point out the inbalance of this matchmaking their attitude is disgusting, and so I am sad to say that for once a game is ruined by the people who play it. They are rude, offer no assistance and generally a nasty group of people. So let them have their high tiers thats fine, and hopefully people will read this and heed my warning to not play this game, so eventually they'll  be left with a ghost game and maybe then they'll see the consquences of there actions.

In short a decent fun game thats easy to play. But awful matchmaking and TOXIC COMMUNITY VETERANS.



UPDATE FOR IN RESPONSE TO STYLER27

Styler27 how am I an angry ragequitter, I clearly state on multiple occasions the game is good it just has flaws. I dont understand your aggression towards a player who has played the game at entry level as everyone has to and had a torrid time, To help clarify as well my WR is 51%, so it has nothing to do with what I won and what I lost it was my experience while playing. Pay to Win doen't bother me either I never even mentioned that system in my review. Finally Styler27 just to make it abundantly clear in my 20 hours I reached Tier 6 destroyer, tier 5 Cruiser, Tier 6 Battleship, Tier 5 Heavy Cruiser and Tier 5 Aircraft Carrier. So yes I did experience the game, and anyone who has read our little exchange can see what the NF2 community is like, you represent them perfectly. I have offered constructive and objective criticism, I have even expressed areas I enjoyed. Then you wade in with your personal attack, NF2 community please welcome Styler27 to prove us all wrong. Thank you styler27.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Great concept of a game, terrible game company, terrible administration, terrible execution.

No team play, no balance, no end game goals, terrible support, poor game dynamics.

Navyfield was able to run for 10 years, despite their managers (Game Developers and Company Management) doing everything they could in order to make it fail. Up to this day they make the worse decisions ever and out of the blue they are nuking their most loyal players from the game without any sort of explanation.

You just have to check what is going on with Navyfield to get a feeling of what you will go through with Navyfield 2. Players who have purchased subscription and items are being removed from the game without breaking any rules and are losing all what they have invested. This fabulous concept has turned into a scam to lure people into giving money only to be removed from the game days later without any possibility of getting their hard earned money back.


It is a South Korean company run by North Korean mentality. I suggest you stay far far far away from all this. The game is not worth the drama and terrible customer support you will undoubtedly go through while playing with this game company.

Seriously, don't even think about playing this game. NF2 is just a money scam.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I have played both Navyfield 1 (started mid 2009) and Navyfield 2 since launch. I have 3 level 50+ captains in NF2 so ignore what steam says about me not playing for very long.

I'll try to be as in-depth but at the same time I'll give you the straight truth on what's going on with this game...

Box art description: Navy Field is a game about WW2 naval battles where you choose a nation, decide which ship line to go down, then play out sea warfare in glorius 2006-era graphics. Where the game lacks in graphics, it makes up for in strategic combat that can actually be quite thrilling if you're into this sort of game.


THE GRIND:Now let me get this out of the way first: This will be the make or break the game for most of you out there.

There is a term for what this game puts you through and that term is Grind". This game will require days of your life in order for you to play ANY ship beyond Tier VII. There are 11 tiers.

The good news is that the first 6 tiers are fairly easy to get to by playing normally without any sort of booster or Premium(More on this later). The better news is you can get to every single ship class by Tier IV so you can try all different playstyles before you uninstall this game because of the crazy grind to Tier X.

THE P2W:All in all

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I was a fan of Navyfield, i've passed a lot of time on it when i was young.
I hoped that Navyfield 2 could be that cool, but i was wrong.
They basically made navyfield in 3d, and simplify it to the bone.

Progression like world of tank, no more shop with different cannons with different stat, now you progress throught 2-3 cannons that are barely the same.

No more armor add like it was, now you buy the slot in the ship and than you can buy armor buff token that last 7 days.

Pay to win, try to stop a full buff shopper, all the team need to focus him, and he will oneshot everything.

No more officer trading.

Cant name the ship.

They speed up every ship like twice of Navyfield1. Smaller ship are like speedboat that drift throught the ocean, also even the torpedo are twice the speed.

The matchmaking is fu**ed, when i hit tier 4 i faced tier 7 ships in every match.



Sorry nexon, but you made a flop, this game is comparable to a tablet game. All you had to do is to udpate the graphics, not to change it to a super simply pay to win game.
Stick with navyfield 1 guys.


Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I was a big fan of NF1, and I'm dissapointed by how much less depth the replacement has.

In NF1, ships had weapon mounts of a certain size and you could put any gun that would fit onto them. Deciding if you were going to specialize in anti-ship, anti-air, or anti-sub meant physically re-fitting your ship with the appropriate equipment you preferred. Now, ships are un-moddable objects with a couple unlockable upgrades for slightly more accuracy or speed.

In NF1, games were custom lobbies. Hosts could choose game-types and maps, as well as auto ballancing or manual. Now, there's only a matchmaking button. CO-OP games against AI have been removed too. That makes practicing manual firing mode tough.

There are many more aspects of NF1 that are removed or dumbed down for NF2, those are just the biggest two that stood out in my first few games.

Finially, and this is just my opinion, but I liked the high detail 2D graphics of NF1 more than the low detail 3D graphics of NF2.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
What could have been a good game, has turned into a piece of garbage.  It is deffinatly a PAY TO WIN game, that non wallet warriors have little chance of success. It seems like it is following every other cash grab games plan.

The game play is interesting enough, but the science fiction that it incorporates is VERY dissapointing...I still cant get over how games can scew up HISTORY....This one is no different......a few examples.

1. teleporting of ships....REALLY???
2. Desrtoyers (wallet warrior) that can take 8 Long lance torpedo hits (most Destroyers could not survive 1 LOL)
3. Landing Craft that can outrun a Light Cruiser with armor to rival a Cruiser (they look like PT boats they are so fast)

Then we can get into the downtime of the game as of late...not good, with them changing their minds like their underwear on issues they are trying to fix"....ends up WORSE!

I gave it 3 weeks of play before writing this review to be fair....Just fyi.

I had really hoped for it to be better."

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Wasnt sure at first if this would be better than NF1 though I highly doubt it.

Thing is, it just doesnt matter. The game has P2W elements. I dont know why the other reviews say no P2W. (they obviously didn't check the shop/they think no sane person would purchase them when thats not true for people with jobs)

Few examples: %5 less reload time with ingame credits. %10 less reload time with real money. Theirs different types of this like repair rate ect. On top of that they all weigh less on your ship as well. (less decreased speed on gold purchased upgrades) PLUS: They stack up as well on your ship.

Morale boosts with real money so you can make sure you are having close to 100% of your sailor stats or you can easily go negative or just not reach there without a grind of wins.

Also you can get gold officers which start with +31 of a specific stat. Ingame credit officers start with all 1 stats and will most likely cap out without the 31 bonus that gold officers get only.

Theres just no excuse for having this type of monetization. Should of kept it to skins and premium time. Do you really want to support P2W features and have it snowball back to style like in previous Korean games?

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
If you want good Naval game don't bother with this one. A little history behind this game and mine statement:

I have played this game few years ago when it had been released by Nexon and it was bad. Game was closed after few months because it did not have player base and why? Because it was unbelievable Pay To Win - just few examples: premium captain, premium crew members, premium ships, premium account, premium armour, premium upgrades and what had been the best? Everything had been time limited for 1 week or 1 month EVEN PREMIUM SHIPS!

So as I mentioned it have been closed. But then the original developer of NavyField 1 and Navyfield 2 decided Hey

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Okay, I thought this game was bad because of steam reviews. But the game isnt bad at all. Sure the graphics are a bit outdated, but graphics dont make the game. And it really is a free to play. I didnt have to go to my wallet for any boosts or buying ships.

The game has factions of WW2: USA, Japan, England, and Germany. It has all kinds of ships. battleships, destroyers, aircraft carriers, light and heavy cruisers. Even heroic ships, the USS Nevada, Duke of Wellington i think it was,  and the legendary Bismark. Now this game is very easy to learn and get into really quickly. You can work your way to your first battleship in less than a hour.

Now the gameplay itself focuses on two sides:alpha and bravo. Each side has a flagship, so losing the flagship is like losing the queen piece in chess. And once you die, you die. So there is a ton of strategy depending on your role.

On the bad side, ugh took too long to make an account, and if you're new, you will die a lot, but least you get good points and xp. And when it rains, totally screws up your LoS sometimes. And the submarines will take sometime to master.

Overall, it's not bad as the people say it was, you should check it out. Good luck and have fun.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I'll keep this short and simple, this is a game that comes on from a great legacy in Navy Field. Navy Field was a game which rewarded skill and practice, learning angles, timing torpedo runs, hiding from the enemy fleet as a submarine. It was a truly fun if a time consuming game. Each ship had a role and they all worked as a combined unit

Navy field 2 is none of that, its too arcadey. Ships are far too agile with Battleships easily turning and slotting through torpedo runs when turning in them should be a large effort, they act more like Destroyers in Navy Field than Battleships. On top of this you have Carriers, all ways fun in Navy Field as they were strong but any ship which could slip in could kill them easy and submarines were there bane but in this they are pretty much freexp, torpedo planes can drop and arm torpedo's from 2 meters and this makes Dive Bombers pointless and fighters are not worth the time as they cannot kill Torpedo planes before they drop there Torp run.

Overall if you want an Arcade warship game then turn to World of Warships or Battlestations: Pacific, if you want a fun Sim type navy game then try Navy Field but this tries to be both and succeeds at neither

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I really wanted to like this game. I had my own fleet in NF1 and I was really hoping that this would be as good. Sadly it isn't.

It feels clunkier, and manouevrering seems unrealistic.

Increasing the ships' speed is unnaturally fast, I mean if a ship accelerated at this speed, you'd have to scrape the crew from the inside of the stern.

The interface on NF1 was built using sprites but even though this is an outdated way of developing games it somehow worked. The upgrade to the new graphics has done nothing to make the game feel better than previous versions.

Like another reviewer says, I don't want to compare this to WoWS but the developers or NF2 could get a better idea of how to improve this game by looking at one or two things from those games.

I'll try this again in a few months and see if things have improved.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Ive played this game alot, the only thing worse than the matchmaking is the lack of teamwork that leads to spending 15 minutes in a battle to literally get nothing but a repair bill.

Its an interesting game that i did actually enjoy a bit until the player base expanded more. The community is becoming very toxic with little to no moderation and as others have said, it is extremely easy to win with your wallet.

the tutorials and menus are terrible but once you get the figured out its not so bad, alot of the text and tooltips are severly lacking and sometimes are just an outright lie (some ship add ons say you cant have miltiple and others say nothing about it until you try to use it and then can only sell it back for half price).

I was using this as a relaxing time waster but now its just a lesson in futility.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
best uninstaling sumilator EVER.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Go play World of Warships.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Fun game, arcade style combat isn't what I like but, overall I approve. Tons of ships to play, nice game design with base capturing, seems very balanced. The balance part is good and bad I think, My first game I sunk a BB with the starter dinghy, which seemed like it should be impossible, but was fun.

Plenty of P2W items, but limited item slots so P2W gets a small bonus that others cannot get, this is the games biggest negative. All the p2w items have double the bonus of the ingame currency version. Elite $ crew get 30% bonus compared to currency version.

The 2nd biggest negative, no tooltips or some other mechanic explaining what everything does, and the menu is poorly designed; it can be hard to figure out what exactly items do , how to equip them etc. Without testing you don't know if there are caps in place for crew skills etc (does it help to have 3 max lvl repairers, or does it cap at 1 repairer? who knows...)

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
First, I am not going to compare this game to what will (or might be) WoWS, or the WT version of naval battles, as those are different games with a different aproach. I will try to give an objective review of the game and not its competition.
Second, I won't review balance, or what I think are temporary issues. The developer is fairly reactive and each weekly patch brings a lot to the game in my opinion. There are still issues, but I judge a game by its fun and its potential.

Pros:
- Gameplay is fun. Very fun. It is fast paced, team-based, strategic, and skill and positioning are a huge part of the game. You'll never get bored during a game. Guaranteed. Too much to do and think about.
- Gameplay is varied. Playing a BB (Battleship), a DD (Destroyer), a CV (Aircraft Carrier) or a SS (Submarine) is very different, so that you can add variety to your gameplay from one game to the other or just find your playstyle. Each ship has its role (even 2 CLs can have very different roles depending on their loadout). You constantly switch between weapons (guns, torps, planes, mines, depth charges, AA, ...) and try to make the most out of it while navigating your ship. Significantly different maps. Game is surprisingly deep.
- Beginning progression is very fast so you can get any class of ship within hours, and then you have to invest your time to get the top tiers. They just boosted permanently XP and credit gain by 2 and 1.5 respectively, for everyone.
- Game makes it in a way that a tier I can take out a tier VII if played correctly/smartly. Very rewarding.
- NOT Pay 2 Win. Premium account gives you the usual XP and Credit boost for faster progression. Some real money items give increased (temporary) stats in game but to the order of 10% max; which is definitely overcome by skill and teamplay. It is more P2W than games with a pure cosmetic cash shop, but I strongly believe the advantages are not significant.
- Developer is its own publisher/editor, on this instance of the game, which means faster development cycle and patches.
- Easy game to get into (simple basic controls, basic goals, immediate action, ...) ...

Cons:
- ... but difficult to actually understand. Poor documentation and tutorials forces you to discover things by yourself, or ask the community, to understand better how to play. Community is decent and people will answer your questions. This problem sometimes leads to frustration, but it is rewarding to get to know the game better. Lots of Eureka" moments.
- Linked to the above

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I've played this game a few months and have about 900 games under my belt.  If you're looking for a free-to-play naval game with arcade like gameplay then you should give this game a shot.  I only recommend it as such though, do not expect 100% realistic gameplay or you will be dissapointed.

Pros:

1)  Ship types are not only useful but neccessary for a team to win.  A team with 10 Battle Ships will lose to a mixed force that plays the map properly.

2)  Similar to World of Tanks there are smaller vessels that exist in high tiers.  Think of it as light tanks or medium tanks at high tiers except with ships.  They all have their role on the battlefield.

4)  Personal skill means a lot.  You cannot simply stomp someone just because you have a higher tier ship.  If you rush in without care then you will see lower tier ships mop the floor with you.

5)  Rock-Paper-Scissors balance.  As stated above you need a mixed force however you can get hard countered by certain ships.  Submarines are able to take out Battle Ships and Aircraft Carriers with ease if the Destroyers and Light Cruisers do not hunt them down.


Cons:

1)  As in World of Tanks or War Thunder there will be games you just cannot win due to having a team that does silly things.  Personal performance can only carry you so far and some games are just unwinnable.

2)  Aircraft have no fuel gauge so if you plan to roll up the CV line you better have good micromanagement skills.

3)  Some people say the game is insanely grindy.  In the past that has been true however the XP gains have been adjusted to reasonable levels.  This makes it possible for anyone to get into ships earlier than they probably need to be.  It only took 400 games to reach Tier 9 in the CV line but then again most people would say that's too much for an arcade like game.  XP has been doubled since then so hopefully that issue isn't around anymore for newer players.

4)  No physics for ships.  You can stack all the ships together and have them occupy the same space.  If anyone shoots they'll hit the others which leads to people never crossing" eachother to avoid accidentally blowing up the ally who cut across them.  A very cheesy tactic is to move your ship into the same space as the enemy ship so that their team cannot help them without blowing up their ally.  Meanwhile you can just pound away at their ship from within their footprint in the water.  Some ships have no way to lower their guns and cannot hit targets that close... all they can do is hope the smaller ship inside them runs out of ammo as they die a slow painful death.



Is this game good?  I think so.  I'd pay $20.00 for this game if they asked since it's on par with the quality you would expect from a $20.00 game.  The matches do not last very long

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Like going to the finest restaurant in town and finding your water is served in styrofoam cups, the flaws in this game do make you roll your eyes, but always over something that doesn't really matter. The core naval combat game seriously rocks. Zaggat rated 5 stars.

Battles are 15 minutes long, if you survive that long or decide to stick around and watch the end after you are sunk. Ship on ship combat is nearly perfect, though the boats move a bit too fast for my taste, but you do get used to that. Graphics are nice except for anything written. They use some font that doesn't work well on my PC. Legible when tweaked, but not great.

The pay-to-win elements are truly kept in check, unlike most games. To me, this speaks volumes about the devs. They actually understand that a well-balanced game will bring in more money. Every P2W element gives a slight advantage, but this game is so heavily skill-based that those slight advantages can be easily overcome by superior skill.

There are 2 main gaming areas: the Battlefield and the Shipyard. The Shipyard is where you get new ships, put equipment on your ship, train your officers, etc. The major flaws in this game have nothing to do with battle. Battle is great. I mean it. Great. The flaws are with peripheral things like: It is hard to register to get the game started, there is no steam overlay (at least for some users currently), when I started the game, I couldn't read anything. Their FAQ page said to make your GUI bigger in Game Options if you can't read the font. The real solution was to turn down my screen resolution one level. Everywhere you look in the Shipyard will be phrases that were obviously translated into English by a computer translator, and then never proofread by a person who actually speaks English. Much of the instructions are tragically non-sensical. Fortunately the wiki is getting bigger everyday, and the forums and guides are good. And players in chat are helpful (which is another nice change of pace). So the Shipyard can be a bit difficult to figure out, but nothing there is real-time. You can always stop and ask for help when confused in the Shipyard. But that's it for flaws. Minor flaws that make you roll your eyes, but nothing that affects the core gaming experience, which is happily rock solid.

Lots of newbies think this game is too hard, but it's usually because they don't understand that their small fast low-level ships can get to the enemies' big ships quicker than their own big ships can get there. Then they try to fight the big enemies without the back-up of their own big ships who won't arrive for another minute. This is a thinking-person's game. This game relies on understanding your role in a complex team, which few people seem to get. Then they complain that matches are made that put them up against top tier ships. Well guess what? You have the option to run away! Just at the start of battle, look to see the names of the players in high tier ships and avoid them, noob! It is a fun challenge if you don't play it like a boxing match where if you see an enemy you attack without thinking! There are things for low level players to do besides fight, like capture npc bases to give your team an airfield or something. Sheesh!

8.6/10 Would sink while desperately trying to dodge depth charges in my sub again.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Terrible game. No team play, no balance.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Navy Field 2 is a good game in the sense that you're never bored.  Sure, the grind to the highest tier of ships can be boring at times, but not every game is the same.

Let me break the game down really quick and justify why I can recommend this game.  Each game takes 15 minutes to play and every class has a use.  Destroyers can take down Battleships with good torpedo placement and kill subs, Light Cruisers can hunt down Destroyers and aircraft, Heavy Cruisers are very much pocket Battleships and Battleships, well, deals tons of damage from afar but have limited maneuverability and sigh.  Carriers are just as important because you're constantly fighting off enemy aircraft, providing your fleet with line of sight, and bombing other ships.  Sometimes the matchmaking will get a little wonky and put you in games with higher level ships, but I've had games where my lower tier Destroyer will be able to drop a high-tier Battleship so I'm not complaining.  Not too much anyway.

The game is not as Pay to Win as most people make it out to be.  It's more of a grindfest more than anything, and the Premium account will make it easier to grind.  It's as simple as that, since there's nothing that's actually limiting gameplay.  Sure, you can spend gold and buy a few Officers and whatnot to edge out on higher-level opponents, but for the most part they are not necessary for the game.

So let me go back to the 15 minutes per game part.  Even if you lose because you got blown out of the water, you can quit the game with some reward and begin your next game immediately.  The combat game itself is fantastic for this regard because there's always something to do.  Every second I'm managing my ship's speeds, dodging torpedoes, shooting off torpedoes of my own, training my guns for an effective angle and lead, and being aware of the map at the same time.  Having played RTS and MOBAs competitively, I would say this definitely ranks up there in terms of active things you can do to improve your game.  This is where the skill of the player comes in, and comes in in a big way.  A player that can take full advantage of his ship will be able to come up in a big way vs. a player who doesn't, regardless of tier.

Overall, I definitely recommend players give this game a try.  It's fast-paced and can be unforgiving at times, but that's what I look for in a game that's designed around leveling up and tiers.  You need the combat to be highly engaging so the grind doesn't seem endless and that's what Navy Field 2 does very well.  The one thing that the developers needed in the game was proper documentation.  I feel that the game right now is a lot of bro-science.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Tons of issues. For one, your income is fixed per game.

You earn same exp and credit if you do 50000 damage or 500000 damage,

or if you spend 5 min on a game or 20 min on it.

Do not bother with this game it becomes a match of hide in the dark and shoot quickly. You can never have fun because of this and its extremely unrealistic and unbalanced. It makes carriers the number 1 ship because of this.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Question #1: is Navy Field 2 a fun game? Absolutely.

Question #2: is Navy Field 2 as good as World of Warships? Not in a million years.

That really is the truth of the matter. World of Warships beats NF2 in pretty much every category. It has superior historical accuracy, it's more immersive, it has a larger player base, it has better support, more map and game mode variety, and overall is a better game. NF2 is a top down shooter with arcade models; WoWs is a graphically beautiful simulator with serious ships. There really is no contest. If you have a good enough machine and graphics card to play WoWs, stop reading this and go download it.

...aw hell, that would be too easy. Okay then: here are four things that NF2 does better.

1) NF2 has more ships. A LOT more ships. The US Navy, Royal Navy, IJN and Kreigsmarine are all featured, whereas WoWs is still in open beta and only has the US Navy and IJN. With the occasional exception (no King George V-class battleships), all of the notable ships are there-and yes, that includes the Yamato. And yes, those 18 inch guns hurt like hell.

2) NF2 has subs. WoWs does not. While some destroyers in WoWs can be savage little ninjas, you only get true stealth in NF2. It is actually fairly well balanced to boot. It's not easy to use a sub well, but when you do, the rewards are spectacular. Equally, it takes time for destroyer drivers to learn how to hunt a sub. When an experienced sub and an experienced destroyer meet, it leads to a tense game of cat-and-mouse.

3) Unlike WoWs, which puts similar tiers against each other, there is no such limitation in NF2. It is entirely possible to play your first game in a massive 15v15 match, with a Yamato and an Iowa blazing away at each other which you whizz about in your pokey little beginner destroyer. You really do have no idea what you'll run into when you hit the Battle button, and the possibilities for emergent game experiences are substantial. While that can lead to some difficult games as you fight against higher-tier ships and more experienced players, it can also be quite fun.

4) NF2 has decent community, overall. It is absolutely advisable to join a Fleet; like all multiplayer games, it's best played with friends. Doing damage to a Yamato in your tier 1 destroyer is great; distracting a Yamato while your two friends in their battleships sink the monster is even better.

I hope that helps. NF2 is fun-just don't expect it to be as good as WoWs.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Navy Field 2 is on Steam now, its pretty neat really. it looks nice visually (at least in comparison to the first game), the gameplay feels a bit different from the first Navy Field game. Otherwise its clearly a Navy field game.  I honestly dont have tons of experience with the series, and I know it mostly through friends who play, and have played it. I was glad this came to steam though so I could give it a try. I should say through there are still some kinks to be worked out, that for sure. Mostly 'quality of life fixes. Really though if you like "navy" games then you should try Navy Field 2

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Well, simply I just love warship games. I would like to play World Of Warships, but I dont have invitation code ;( . Kantai Collection is unreachable for me too. Only Battlestations left (but it's not on multi anyway), so for me only avaiable MMO warship game is Navy Field. I've played NF 1 long time ago, so now it's time to test number '2'. After first hours of gameplay I must admit that second NF is somehow odd for me. I mean game looks better in matter of animations and 3D view, unfortunately ships details are really badly drawed. Very poor compared to NF 1. Another thing is that game is more simplified than NF 1, by saying this I mean, there are much less modifications and items for ships unlike in NF 1, where was plenty of it. Well... automatic aiming is somehow better in version 2. Generally game is average, but for warship fan like me it looks quite more interesting. Anyway, I recommend for try. It's kinda funny.

Just more of the same free-to-play shovelware with microtransactions, to better separate idiots from their money. Just another glorified mobile game ported to the PC. Skip it.

the first on was better. now the match making sucks because no one plays and no one plays becasue the match making sucks. has less content  but looks alot better. the skill system is genaric so no more amazingly planed out crews. if you want a boat game go to the original navy Field

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
There's a low play time on my account because it just got released on steam.  That being said I have been playing this since December and have several high tier captains along most all of the branches.

This game is fun, and frustrating at times. For example when it rains your accuracy goes to nil in the bigger ships, and it rains a lot so it's very annoying to not be able to hit anything while you are this big ship that's nearly impossible to miss.

The items in the store are much too expensive, though they seem to be balancing that. For example when the game first released a premium sailor was somewhere near 1200 gold, now it's better at 300 so I think they are working on that.

The game is easy enough to pick up and learn, but a little more difficult to master, especially carrier game play.

All in all, the game has it's flaws but it's a fun game to play now and again.


3 stars out of 5 could be better, could be worse, it's all about where they take the game from here.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
That game had so big potential and what they did? Tier system like in WarThunder or Wargaming's games, removed all ship customization options and gave ships with useless upgrade tree, no possibility to make your own ship and play it you own way. They removed feature which made this game so special and interesting, feature which force players to think about their ships and crews. You had to plan your progress to reach well developed ship in later game.


PROS:
- now its clicker for players who want to play easy game and kill some time
- matchmaker which makes finding games easier
- interesting base capture system

CONS:
- tiers and upgrade tree killed true NavyFields spirit
- lack of armor customization - you had to buy armor increase for 7 days, really?! :D
- lack of engine customization
- lack of armament customization
- lack of ammo customization
- lack of crew customization
- lack of ANY DAMNED CUSTOMIZATION - just follow stupid schemas and have brainless fun

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Where to start...

The game is free-to-play, which also means there's a pay2win aspect somewhere in the game. However, unlike most others, you don't pay to get ships, you need to earn them. The only thing you're paying for (or at least want to pay for), would be the premium 50% boost that helps in the grind through ship tiers later, the officers for an extra boost, and/or extra ship slots to keep more ships (honestly, you don't need more than 5 if you plan on sticking with one or two classes). Otherwise, everything is obtainable through just playing normally.

Now, the matchmaking. Yes, it needs some tweaking. You're not always going to be placed against people of your tier level, but I believe there's a good reason behind this, being that you get to experience fighting against different types of ship classes. And remember that the matchmaking puts you against a fleet (not clan fleet, just a fleet) equal to yours, meaning if they have Tier 9, you have buddies who are Tier 9 as well (or Tier 9 equivalent). The downside? You get wrecked if you're not careful.

Best advice for new players is to capture islands, sub detect and provide AA, while trying to support your team from behind and survive. Everyone starts out as a Destroyer so you don't get to do much unless you're really good with your torpedoes and shelling first hand (I've sunk Battleships, just saiyan), it's pretty easy. Heck, you might even manage to land a kill steal and get that huge amount of XP.

Eventually you'll reach Tier 3 in a few battles if you try to power through all the upgrades and not invest in any of your ship equipment. My friend did it in less than 30 minutes. You CAN face against stronger enemies even at low levels, but that relies on teamwork, not charging into everything.

The community. I haven't really talked to many, so I can't really say, but I've had battles won with teamwork where we were outnumbered, some cooperative, some not. It happens.

The grind. I'm a fairly new player myself although I've played since February (before dropping it for a while cause gemes), so I have yet to reach that part of the game. I'm still at Tier 5, using Destroyers, and I can tell you the amount of XP and credits you accumulate increase based on the ship tier you're using, so you might get like 300 or 400 at say, Tier 2, before getting 2000 to 3000 at Tier 5. Then again if you think the game's fun and all, it might not be so bad to invest time to grind, but if you're not that kind of person, better decide now whether you want to drop it.

Graphics? Ship docks look good. Actual game? Not so much. What, were you expecting some WoW or WT tier graphics?

My opinion? The game isn't nearly as close to frustrating me. I just like naval games and try to have fun. :v

Should you play it? Well I mean, just because there's a lot of mixed reviews doesn't mean you shouldn't try it out and see for yourself.

(NOT SPONSORED BY NAVYFIELD 2)

EDIT: So after countless battles, I am now at Tier 7, with ships of different classes also at Tier 7. To be honest, the game isn't really that frustrating once you get used to it, since you win and lose (although you lose more and that's kind of a good thing since XP gain is much faster with losing compared to winning).

The grind, however, becomes increasingly harder. And it's more around the amount of XP required for each upgrade before you get to the next ship than the XP gain itself. For me though, it's not a problem, since I enjoy playing the game either way. It gets a bit repetitive here and there, but eventually I managed. With 4 ships at Tier 7 equivalent (under 2 weeks of grinding; 1-3 hours a day), what's to not get bored of?

Psst, the maps.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Login, forums, support, and even creating an account are all f***ed. Despite my countless tries to fix my issues. Such as unable to retrieve a password because my email has not been registered, well it would be great if i could register an email to send my password to. But no, I have to know my password first! Tried creating a brand new, non-steam account but there was no Create Account" button to be found!

DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME!

They released this game and the website prematurely. These devs are the worst at linking Steam with a website. I tried and decided to stop wasting my time to figure this sh*t out. Oh and don't bother trying to make a new account VIA steam... Unless of course you want to make a brand new steam account!

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
The game as a MMO offers good team-working gameplay.
As a  historical simulation game set in certain period of our history it excellently simulates 2WW-Era naval battles,
giving real difference among certain ship classes and their role in battle.

There are ofc real cash paid items, as in every freemium games, but they are giving you only a slight advantage.
What matters the most is player skills - both tactical, and manual. This scecond plays the bigest role, when you decide
to use - in my opinion  the best feature of the game - manual keyboard ship gun aiming control. (in WW2 there were none point&click aiming systems!)

The game has some disadvantages, nothing and nobody is perfect,
but the devs had shown, that they are really listening the community, making changes that goes straight along players wishes.

Fun game until you get to the end of tier 4.  At that time, it goes to 31/32 times more grinder for each new ship.  Fun for a few days, worth downloading till tier 5

An action/tactical shoot-out with the big inch guns of the Naval fleets.

Has four different countries with mutiple classes of ships, giving a big variety of gameplay.

Matches are generally large with good sized maps to contain the players within.

Highly recommend giving it a chance.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
The game isnt that bad, they could have done much better though. Many NF veteran rather play the old NF over this, i do like them both, but it seem alittle off with realism and balance. Here you have women on board, so many torpedoes for small ships, there no telling what will happen with women on board that sailors (men) get distracted and sank the boat itself.

If you liked Navy Field 1 you will probably like this.

End of the day its a pretty fun game and its free so your really not losing much to try it out.
I think as long as you enjoy things like world of tanks / war thunder then you will probably enjoy it.  If you hate those games still give it a go unless you have download limits your just losing your time if you hate it.

I played the first version in the early years and it was good.
They improved the graphics, made the customization easier and added some new functions.
I prefered the waiting room like the first version instead of waiting matchmakings in the dock though.
The game is good but I'm losing every game because lack of teamwork.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I personally enjoy this game MUCH more than the first in the series because it simplifies it mcuh more. Where in the last one i would have to look up lot's of tutorials on how to even start off, this tells you pretty much everything you need to know at first. The ships are also much easier to see what exatcly you're putting onto it like guns and specific ammo. One gripe I have is that the Guns don't have an all" fire group maiking it hard to do full on broadsides in Battleships."

This game is really good, do not look at the negative reviews and think its a bad game, instead try it first and you'll be surprised!!!

A.K.A a poorly made Meat Boy. Controls are clunky, the so called Bob slips off playfroms while standing, bad angle, momentum and gameplay made this game look soo bad.

Brilliant Bob  A Steam Review
[Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes]

The good

Cartoony graphics
Short levels
The not so good:
The jumps are mostly guesses, since you dont have a shadow under you to see where youll land
There is way too much momentum for the player and the moving platforms, youll never know when youll fall from them because they changed directions or smth. This is even a problem when youre trying to select a level, most of the time youll overshoot your target.
It feels like the menus were made 20 minutes before the game was released. In the first cinematic you can see the tops of the trees from the menu.
The conclusion:
This is an example of a game that wouldve had a lot to gain from doing a beta or early access release. All the problems wouldve been observed and maybe fixed before the release. As it is now, its pretty unplayable. On top of that, the high price should make everyone steer away from this.

Brilliant Bob, isn't as brilliant as it could have been. The camera is static, while the side scrolling is in 3D, making some of the movements awkward, especially when trying to jump on ledges or boxes. The puzzles are pretty simple, not a lot of depth to the game. There doesn't seem to be a story of any kind, no reason you are put through puzzle after puzzle. I wish I could find something positive to say about the game, but it felt like a big let down when I played it.

Idiotic Bob Review

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is cancer, it's barely playable... here are the pros and cons

Pros:
the music is nice
(that's it)

Cons:
Slippery controls
Horrible cutscenes (the 1st cutscene you see looks like CGI meatboy ripoffs on an MS paint built background)
No loading screen yet it stops responding when it loads... so you just see a freeze frame of what last happened
Broken level select (you have to walk into a portal thing of the level you want to go to... and I could only get to level 2 when I wanted to go to level 3)
Bad double jump physics (if you walk off an edge you get 1 jump to save yourself and that isn't enough)
the game lags when around enemies (and my computer is great and runs on the brilliant" graphics just fine)
Bob looks like a super meatboy ripoff character...
"powered with Unity" 'nuff said there
and many more cons

This game gets a 0.0000000000010/10 (aka don't get it)

I wanted to find it fun because it's simple and easy, but I can't because of it's graphic, poor Camera Angle and the controller won't function well, also game crashes ~.~

Brilliant Bob
This game feels like someone's  university project. There's little to no reward for completing any part of the game (unlockable skins don't really do it for me), annoying, repetitive music, an uninteresting and very unoriginal story which includes dull characters and rounds off with generic and poorly executed gameplay mechanics. This game unfortunately, did not reach its potential to be a fun and quirky little platformer. However, the developers only have themselves to blame as basic game testing from an external source could have easily pointed out some of the game's biggest flaws (e.g. camera obscuring your view, poor shadows to make jumping inconsistent and difficult to assess, momentum effecting Bob's placement etc.).

Conclusion: Tries to be Super Meat Boy 3D ends up as Pointless Purple Block of Turd 3D. Do not purchase.

Brilliant Bob
This is one of the most ridiculous game on Steam and should be removed from this platform ASAP. Incredibly bugged, glitchy and user-NOT-friendly jumping simulator. Your biggest enemy is... camera! YES! Movement around puzzles is one of the hardest things that I've seen in last few months in games industry. I thought that I will break down something every time when I rotate the camera. I don't know why games like this costs 10... I simply can't understand the level of stupidness, it's worth maybe 1-2. Guys, please. You gave me a key for this game... but it's just so stupid and overpriced that I've decided to ATTACK you for making this game! SRSLY!

Your feet are slippery, easy to slide off the platforms. Cameras are bad. Adjustable but still not quite what's needed sometimes.

The graphics style in this game gives you a nostalgic Wii-like feeling, the music is nice and calming for
all the times you will inevitably die. The story, however, is complete crap, basically you're a cube who is happy and an
alien tries to take away you and your family's happiness, but instead you just wreck his ship and your parents get stolen,
leading into the concept that you have to save your parents. Apparently that calls for jumping on a lot of vanishing platforms that the dev simply couldn't get enough of, but whatever. Overall, I recommend this game when its on sale, but don't waste $10 on it.

Brilliant Bob
Product received for free

i wouldn't recommend this game.

i can give you many reasons for it but the most important one is how you control the camera. you can only control it with Q/E to make it pan to the left/right. this gets annoying very quickly because it takes away the speed you want when playing a game like this. if you were able to control the camera with you mouse it would already be a lot better.

Not enough vanishing platforms -3/10

I never had so mcuh fun trowing boxes for 7 min.

Much of the game is heavily based on jump timing, and it's responsiveness is a bit random.
The camera movement is also quite awkward...
All in all, it's close to being decent, but far from great.

I'm certainly glad I got it on sale for just a few cents.

I don't want to write an entire review, so I will just paste a chat I had with my friend while playing the game, which basically covers what you can expect in the very first few minutes of the game.

I can't figure out why this game has so many bad reviews. Granted, I haven't put that much time into this yet, but with over 1300 games in steam it will take a while before most of my games have respectable playtime. The controls feel pretty good to me, and the environments are nice to look at. This game has a simplistic feel to it that reminds me of some of the n64 games of my childhood.  I only have 2 issues with this game, but with the $1 I spent on it I can't complain.  The first issue is the music, which is repetitive and restarts with each level. The second issue is the story. I figure this game would be better without a story than the one showcased when you launch the game. Some might call this a quick cash grab with unity assets, but the gameplay is fun for a few bucks. Its one of those games that I goof around with on one monitor while watching TV on the other. -PR0XIDIAN

It is a good thing that I got this on sale for $0.29. Otherwise, I would've gone into a deep depression knowing that I had spent $10 on this.

Brilliant Bob/Not so Brilliant Bob - we won't grapple over the title.

What we will grapple with, however;

- Level Depth

There does not appear to be any actual story once you begin the game, nor purpose to any of the levels.

- Camera Controls

Ever played the original PS1 games  where you pan the camera with the joystick? and it waves around like a hula girls hips? Yep.

The camera controls are terrible, to be found here, and due to being presented in 3D, the frustration levels may cause you to bust many holes in your wall.


+ Soundtrack

The soundtrack is the only positive point that I would allow, the only reason I almost spent a full hour playing.


Overall, I do not recommended Brilliant Bob to anyone. It takes a lot for me to say it, but this game is awful.

The unplayability overall makes it virtually impossible to progress. It feels incomplete and could definitely use a few tweaks here and there.

Brilliant Bob
Well, I guess they found a cure to cancer.
It's called the refund button"."

Brilliant Bob
feeling suicidal? play this game to finish yourself off

Brilliant Bob
This Game has the same Assets as Woodle Tree Adventures so typically Free Unity but other than Woodle Tree this Game is no Fun, because all what you do is jumping from little Plattforms to little Plattforms, that move or vanish. You never explore the other bigger Landscapes, they are only for Decoration. And listening to the same boring Music is also not fun too.

Then also Game Mechanic suxx, the Double Jump sometimes work sometimes not and the vanishing Plattforms are not visibly different then normal Plattforms, so no way to anticipate. Also it's even worse, they vanish even if you touch them from below or from the side and not if you actually land on them, which is simply buggy.

And if you are standing on those moving Plattform they slip away under your  and Air Control also lacks Control. And the Camera is awful, should be mapped to right Stick but is mapped in LB/RB and not a real Camera, it's more a turn left, turn right, no free Cam so not really useful for 3D.

This Game could have been fun, but seems execution was messed up and it also looks unfinished, perhaps a glimpse at Woodle Tree Adventures would help, it's not an ultra great Game either, but use the same Assets and at least offers some fun.

This Game is only frustrating and boring, so i'm sorry but i'm forced to move it to the Scrapyard.

Brilliant Bob
Brilliant Bob? More like Cancer Carl.

Brilliant Bob
There is nothing brilliant about this.

Stay away at all costs. A complete waste of your time.


Brilliant Bob
This game is awesome. The character is called Bob. It's a purple cube. It has sunglasses. It's parents were taken by an evil alien with a gun. You need to save your parents. I guess so. I bought this game for cards, played it for a while, then I said  this "

Brilliant Bob
it's terrible. Not even a so-bad-its-good bad game. It controls like slippery poopies and it's just so cheaply made.

it's not worth 50 cents, I know it seems like a good joke game, but it just isn't. You'll play for about 10+ minutes and laugh maybe once how dumb/bad it is then just be like wow nothing changes ever and there's nothing new to make fun of even.

SORRY THANKS BYE

Brilliant Bob
This is a 3D platformer in which you can't move the camera with your mouse. You have to use the Q and E keys instead of them, so you can only turn your camera at one specific speed which is too slow for this game, not only this but you can't look up or down so it's difficult to tell the distance of the platforms, when you turn your camera it is not centred on the character but offset so if you turn your camera whilst jumping it will ruin your jump.

The main challenge in this game is being able to jump off the timed platforms whilst your camera is facing the wrong direction because you are not given enough time to adjust it with the Q and E keys. There are also more things I don't like.

1.Disappearing Platforms start to dissapear before you have even landed on them, you only have to be near them. - If you clip the edge or the bottom of a platform it will begin to vanish.
2. When moving platforms change direction they knock you about and can even knock you off the platform without you pressing anything, this feels pretty clunky in my opinion.
4. The game sometimes doesn't let you double jump making you die. More Frequent on the Spinning platforms and disappearing Platforms
5. There are far too many disappearing Platforms

I don't understand why the game doesn't allow you to turn the camera with a mouse, or automatically adjust it for you.

Brilliant Bob
Brilliant Bob you say? Not so brilliant at all actually. So story is, some mad scientist from the other end of the galaxy stealing happiness, he also stole your parents and you go after them... By jumping on odd platforms. Story aside, the gameplay is just brilliant! Just kidding, it's very bad. You have to jump from platform to platform. The thing is that you don't know where you'll land due to the very crappy camera angle which you can change with Q and E only. Oh and the turning is so slow that one some levels it's impossible to get all of those cubes. So no point of even playing it, just frustration.

Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

Just get postal 2

Postal III
Postal and Postal 2 taught me to regret nothing, and I took that to heart.

Then I tried playing Postal 3, and now I know nothing but regret.

Postal III
It's a great torture device! The american agent told me everything after I forced him to play this.

Postal III
Get Postal 2 instead.

Postal III
This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.

1. A broken melee system: Postal, true to the franchise, offers many different tools of the trade to dispose of your enemies. And some of the tools include a sledgehammer, machete, fire axe, and something else I can't remember. But none of that matters because the only one that works is the ing machete. It is extremely difficult to land your blow on enemies with other weapons, including your kick, but it doesn't matter because the fire axe and sledgehammer don't even do any damage.

2. Abysmal Gunplay: Would you be surprised if I told you this is the strongest gameplay element? Cuz it is. Is it because it's fun? No. Is it because there's cool weapons? No. It's because guns are pretty much the only gameplay element that functions. A headshot kills any enemy instantly. So, if you don't want to deal with the awfulness of every other tool of the trade, guns are the way to go. And don't bother with the shotgun or the MG. They're both garbage.

3. Awful Humor: Postal 2 got it's humor from satirizing both social issues and video game tropes and controversies. Postal 3 doesn't do this at all. Instead, it goes for stupid humor and shock value. Like terrorists dressing up in giant novelty moustaches and sombreros and sneaking across the US Border. Or firing man juice soaked tissue clumps at Sarah Palin in a porn shop full of men jerking it to monitors. And I'll admit, I laughed a few times, but it wasn't because I thought it was clever. Quite the opposite, in fact. I laughed because it was so utterly stupid and random that it just brought out the inner caveman. And that's the problem; Postal 3 is offensive for all the wrong reasons. There are a few times when the developers want to get tongue and cheeky with you. But it's hard to find it funny when the game keeps kicking your  every chance it gets. Sorry Postal 3, but you can't kick me in the nads and then give me a piece of cake. It doesn't work that way.

4. What-The- Scale Performance: Do you have a decent gaming rig? Do you have an ultra powerful rig? Well neither matter because Postal 3 is terribly built and optimized. I can run mostly anything on max settings, and yet this game chugs when things get going. And even setting it to low didn't change the performance one bit. It's amazing how you can mess up so bad on an engine designed specifically for non-high end machines.

5. It's Linear & Catharsis Sucks: The entire game has you follow a very narrow path of the dude going about his day just trying to earn some money. And, as you continue, you get to make moral choices that alter which missions you do. This would be fine, if it wasn't Postal. Or, you know, at least done properly. I wanna be free to explore the city and do what I want and attack the story at my own pace. When you beat the game, you unlock the entire city to go around and play in. But when you start it you see just how bad the direction really is. They basically took what they made of the city, and then stitched together the other set pieces from missions into the mix. There's no sense of where you're going at all. It's apparent they did not design a city and split it accordingly. They just made random crap, stitched it together with duct tape, and said, Here this is Catharsis." You know it's bad when you walk up to a highway offramp and end up at the gay rodeo. Oh

Postal III
Postal III is a perfect example of what happenes when you let drug-addled russian mod designers handle your beloved franchise. Avoid like the plague.

I got this game for free from RWS, but i think they only did that because they wanted to violate me somehow.

How to play Postal 3

step 1. Never buy it
step 2. Never play it
step 3. Never ING play it EVER

My god. MY ING GOODNESS GRACIOUS, what a waste of money, even on sale. not even worth $1.99. This game is absolutely horrendous! The sounds are rancid, the controls are broken, the glitches are nasty, the camera has tourette's, the story is ing stupid, the new postal dude style is so ing ginger, the new voice is something to frown upon, the music is garbage and random, the cast is meh, the menus are bland as , the weapon choice is so , the frame rate is worse than the Xbox one; need i say more? Not only is this a failure of a Postal game, but this is one of the worst games i have honestly ever played in my entire life. I never in my entire life uninstalled a game 1 hour in. There is not single positive thing about this game at all. It does not deserve the title of Postal and now i can see why Urinating on the Postal 3 case in Postal 2 gets you an achievement. Even Running With Scissors acknowledges that it's a   game, and that's why they continue to update Postal 2 and pretend Postal 3 is just some spin off.

Do not buy this piece of  unless you either
A. Want to play a game that is the equivalent to Foodfight! on Heroin.
B. Want to play a game to torture yourself from start to finish.
C. Want to buy it for someone else to make them contemplate suicide.
(that's actually how i got this game)

So please, don't ing waste your time with this piece of  ed from another piece of .

Postal III
I spent actual money on this, because I am not a very bright man.






It's actually really quite awful, and that's saying something. Forced third person, glitchier than hell, none of the  charm of Postal 2.

Postal III
Okay, after finally playing the first and second Postal games, I finally decided to give the third installment another shot. Even after learning the backstory of the game (RWS Inc. hired an underfunded and tyrannical game developer company from Russia to code the game), I decided to give it a second chance. Sure, I wouldn't get all the extra little achievements like I did with the first two Postals, but I'd at least beat the game and give it a fair judgment from that, right?

Wrong. I had completely forgotten what it was that had kept me from playing this game in the first place. It wasn't the linear levels (Postal 1 had linear levels). It wasn't the stupid jokes or the weird weapons and minigames (Postal 2 had stupid jokes and weird weapons and minigames). It was the gameplay. Yes, Akeela Software (or whatever they call themselves) had suffered through a Russian economic crash and in suffering fired their competent, cooperative developers and assigned this project to a group of Prima Donnas who not only couldn't correctly string a game together even if it was coming out of their own , but also deliberately altered the structure of the game against the wishes of RWS Inc. (you know, the people who wrote the game series and own the rights to them and CONTRACTED Akeela TO DO MAKE THE GAME THAT RWS had envisioned!!!). Not only that, but Akeela also refused to release the code to the general public because they didn't want those loyal gamers to make MODs or anything, even though RWS Inc. wanted them to. As a result, the gameplay is sticky, jagged, the graphics go photo-negative after 15 minutes of gameplay and glitches flood this game. For example, I had to restart a level because the game wouldn't let me open a door that was integral to the plot, and the escort mission with the segways was almost impossible. All in all, it kept me from enjoying this game not once but twice, which is a shame, because otherwise, I thought it could have been an enjoyable game.

*SPOILER ALERT* For those still interested in knowing, the game pickups where the second one left off: after detonating Paradise, Arizona with a nuke, the Postal dude drove to the next closest fictional town in Arizona, Catharsis. There, a wealthy Ron Jeremy owns and runs everything with a pretty open mind. The problem is that he's constantly being undermined or even flat out attacked by Eco-terrorists, Al Queda, God-fearing hockey moms (led by Sarah Palin...wait...why is she in Arizona?!) and other satirical and colorful characters. The Postal Dude, just trying to make a buck, is given constant choices as to whose side he is on, or at least which side he wants to flip flop to and from. While the levels are linear, your actions do choose the course of the game.   Unlike the last game, the third Postal gives you a Max Payne type of third person layout and aiming system, and you get most of the weapons from the previous game, plus a few new ones like beehives, a shopvac (filled with questionably stained tissues) and the badgersaw.

Like I said, it could have an enjoyable installment to the series, but the Russian contractors completely ruined it to the point that RWS Inc. even tells people to stay away from it.

Postal III
This is the Adam Sandler of Postal titles.
You know how Adam Sandler has talent and doesn't use it?
This game kind of works like that.

It had potential to be great, but it didn't bother.
Blame the guys in Russia who had done most of the work and decided that it was okay to publish the Bubsy 3D of 2011.

Postal III
There are no words to describe how awful this one is. So I just want you to imagine a depressed 47 year old man with a massive drinking problem hanging himself by the sunroof inside of his trailer, only to have it break causing him to fall and then start crying until he dehydrates his whole body to death over a course of three days.

Postal III
Installed it  to uninstall it.

Basically just avoid this page entirely and go buy Postal 2 instead. It's for your own good.

Postal III
I got this game for free, and I still suffer buyer's remorse.

Postal III
Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.

The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.

This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.

While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.

To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.

Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.

Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.

Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't  as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.

Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?" Well

Postal III
This game is so bad the devs needed to make DLC for the old game to make up for this catastrophe.

Postal III
I wouldn't even poke this game with a stick.

Postal III
Its not fair to say that the darkness consumed me, for it was I who enveloped myself in it, there was no coercion involved, only my own maddened curiosity. Another Postal game was released? Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose?
Sometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked Add to Cart. Its more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.

I wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as acrid, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome Nobody Will Ever Love You. I cant though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didnt even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know thats exactly what its meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.

In the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.

Postal III
Terribad.

Nothing like Postal 2, the controls are clunky as , and there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS. Seriously, there is one stage where its just you in a room waiting to push a button, be prepared for many many one off scenes like this. There is no real explorable world to mess with, its just isolated scenes you do a single mission per scene.

The combat, holy ing christ the combat, how do you mess something like that up ? Theres a scene where you fight these crazy soccer moms, but making them leave" is almost impossible as they seem to take 10 fully charged stun gun shots and NOTHING HAPPENS. The vagueness in the combat system and missions are laughable at best and after so long get annoying as hell. This is also the first game I have encountered where the crosshairs are completely useless

Postal III
This game is about as good as you could expect for a game that was coded in a weekend

Postal III
Sack of . It's one of those games where you constantly have to babysit NPC's who are so  they can't even follow you to the objective (meaning you can't win.)

Waste of money, and I paid $5 for it.

Postal III
Postal 3, a third sequel to the cult classic, POSTAL franchise. This game, developed by Akella, NOT Running With Scissors - sees the Postal Dude rigth after a Nuclear Bomb goes off in the previous city, crosses a zombie infested bridge and is now forced to find a job in a new city, Catharsis, where a matter of chaotic events occur.

The game features a branching Storyline System ala Mass Effect's Paragon system, but more black and white with it's execution, it does make the game differ greatly with it's content and is a highly welcome addition imo - the rest of the game however... is terrible. It is a third person shooter that barely plays at all, it was built on Valve's Source Engine way back in the day, this game pretty much controls terribly and loosely,  has music falling out of loops, AI bugging out occasionally and much more that just scream unfinished.

I should mention I do enjoy this game for what it is (a fan of the POSTAL franchise and the kind of macabre humor it uses) but from extremely buggy set pieces (Doors closing on you halting chapter progress.), horrible performance issues (Game is NOT enabled to properly run on Multi Core PCs and PhysX feature do a LOT more harm than good), spotty AI and just overall terrible loose mechanics, the game is most definately a skip to those whom are not willing to put up with the game;s shortcoming - those being dang near everything else - considering the game is buggy to the point of it being borderline unplayable.

Postal III
Postal 2 was great, but Postal III is just awful.

Postal III
I like this game but nobody else does so its possible i'm just completly mad.

Postal III
If it weren't for the fact that this game is an unstable piece of  that crashes if you so much as look at it funny, I might have recommended it anyways in spite of its design problems. The game itself is just the right kind of awful to mock and poke fun at, it's just a shame that getting it to work requires no less than sorcery and blood sacrifices.

Not even for free would I recommend this.

Postal III
Broken, broken, broken. I'll admit that I had fun for a little while, I laughed a couple times, but in the end, the bugs get in the way of this one. Load times are irritatingly long, animations are broken, and it's just not something you'd expect after the better half of a decade of waiting.

If you catch it under $4.99, go for it; it's worth five dollars of fun. Otherwise, keep looking.

Postal III
I bought this for $59.99

Postal III
Rather than repeating every other review on here (either saying it's a laggy, buggy pile of , or sticking up for it without any support), I'm just gonna point put the pros and cons of POSTAL III. I personally enjoy this game, but I can see why others don't. Many people ask if it's really *that* bad, and if they should pass on it or not... I think you should TRY it, especially if you're a fan of the previous games. But don't fart around, try rushing through as much as you can - that way you can still qualify for a refund, which you may want.

Pros:
+A good amount of weapons. Not as many as Postal 2, but more than most games.
+Though generally very cheesy, it has plenty of comedic moments.
+Goofy brand name refrences. A video game store with a game called Left 4 Bread, a coffee shop called Lotsofbucks or some , etc.
+Sticks to the usual Postal story. The Dude is broke, has troubles holding a job, and doesn't get his hard earned cash.
+Ability to choose whether you're good or bad (or neutral). This changes both gameplay and story, and gives you different missions.
+Pee simulator - part two?
+Neat soundtrack. And it suites the game.
+Boss fights are pretty solid, and can provide a challenge.
+Tons of ing blood and gibs, as well as vulgarity and some dark humor.
+Tons of replayabiliy, as usual.
+Fun gameplay, though for some people it may get boring.

Neutral points (some might see as pros, while others see as cons):
N) Not in first-person as POSTAL 2 was
But then again, let's not forget POSTAL 1 was a top-down shooter.
N) Bizarre weapons, such as AIDS infested cats, a badger that acts as a chainsaw, and a vacuum that sucks up small items and shoots them out (non-leathal, and barely ethical to use).
N) You have to unlock Free-roam by completing the game.


Cons:
-Not made by RWS. Hell, they don't even make money from this game!
-Bugs. Big bugs! We're talking tarantulas and genetically-altered cockroaches! You and other people will get stuck in certain spots, game crashes (I've rarely had this, though other people seem to have major issues with that), freezes from time to time, and many more. Some are smaller, and some... not so small.
-Lag can be a  at times, and the frame-rate can drop to -10 FPS.
-Repetitive story. You start your job, you and/or your employer get attacked, you defend the area, the boss doesn't like that, you don't get paid, and on to the next one.
-No trading cards.
-Since it's developed by a Russian company, the English isn't very good. Poor grammar and what not.
-No Rick Hunter, but the new Dude repeats gameplay phrases used in P2.
-Physics are all over the place. Sometimes when you shot someone in the head with a pistol, their head will pop off. Other times you'll use a ing machine gun, and they'll just drop dead with no gibs. If you tase somebody then pour gasoline on them, they occasionally set on fire. See what I mean? The physics aren't consistent.
-Achievements are glitched. Which ones, you ask? Depends on how unlucky you are. I've heard some people have issues with certain achievements I don't have issues with, and vice versa. Sometimes an achievement is apparently locked, sometimes doing the necessary tasks won't add up. I've spent half hour lighting people on fire, killing dozens of people, but my achievement progress was only 4/50. No, I don't mean 4 out of the 50 remaining.

Postal III
What a piece of . I bought this game out of morbid curiousity, and now I regret it. Postal 3, or the Russian Postal, was a game developed by a Russian publisher called Akella, after they told Running With Scissors that they would fund and develop a third Postal game. Development was going good for the most part, until Russia was hit with a recession, forcing Akella to fire the A-Team, and get some less-experienced programmers who would work for cheaper. Akella had to change a lot from RWS's original plans to compensate for the new programmers lack of skill (like removing mulitplayer, switching the game to third-person, and switching from Unreal to Source (mainly due to budget, however)). What came from this development mess was a buggy-as-hell game that tried to be POSTAL 2, but failed miserably. Even if the incredible amount of bugs were patched, the game still falls flat due to boring level design. Almost every level is nothing but a kill-a-thon. Just kill X amount of enemies, and that's it. There's the occasional unique mission, like the Theigway level or the patrol missions, but there's just not enough variety. They also tried to implement a cover system, which fails dramatically when the enemies you're trying to take cover from just walk up behind you. One of the biggest issues of the game is that it's just not optimised. The game runs on the Source engine, but if I set all the video settings to max, the frame rate will go straight to . Compare with Portal 2, released the same year, on the same engine. If I set everything to max, it'll run great. How did they manage to screw up something like that on the Source engine, easily the most optimised engine out there? The only really good things I can say about the game is that the graphics are pretty good (at least compared to POSTAL 2), and the soundtrack is absolutely eargasmic, but that's really it.

Also, if you're running Windows 8.1, don't even bother buying this game. The DRM won't let you play for some reason. RWS doesn't have the source code for the game, so they can't patch it out. There might be an unofficial patch, but you should probably look into that BEFORE buying this game.

Postal III
It has SO much missing potential, but unfortunately, it's a bit of a letdown.
Doesn't stop me from modding it, though. It's pretty flexible in that department.

Postal III
As a part of the Postal series this is a failure.

Apart from that, this is a reasonable game.
Yes, it's short, poorly optimised and bugged. But it's still fun.
Got this one on a sale.

I regret nothing.


Postal III
If you liked Postal 2 don't buy this game, it's terrible and nothing like Postal 2.

Postal III
the postal game that RWS technicaly dousen't own

I'm a RWS fan, and I respect Vince Desi, so it pains me to say - don't buy this game. if you have to find out what its like, find someone who has it and play their copy for 15 minuets. find a lets-play, do something, just don't buy this game. this is a train wreck and everyone knows it.

Unless something changed in the past two years RWS is not even making money off this because of the shady coding house they did business with to produce this. that company gutted the script, gutted the features and hurried the alpha out the door as a final game and screwed Running With Sissors out of the rights to the code.

this is an official game but one that RWS can't support and likely a game that they are not making a dime off of. wait for the next chapter of the game because I'm sure the postal dude will dismiss this one as the nightmare it is. Like mario's dream that was Super Mario Bros 2, Postal III might as well not exist in the catalog of this franchise.

I do no exagerate in saying that this game is completely broken, unbalenced and not fun. a total waste of $20

buyer be ware- This is a steaming pile!

Postal III
This game is not good

Postal III
Horrible, horrible game. I like Postal 1 and really enjoy Postal 2. The open endedness is what I especially enjoy and it's totally missing in Postal 3. I played for a short while, to the part where I'm supposed to pick up used" tissues. It was at this point I realized the entire game was going to be like this; they stick you in an area with a specific goal and can't do anything else. It's more like a bunch of mini-games. Totally dissappointed and regret spending money for this game."

Postal III
Just when I tought nothing could possibly be worse than the movie (Uwe Boll? Seriously? As if he didnt slaughter enough franchises already...), along came part three.

Plain and simple: This is a very, very, very bad game. Oh boy, is it bad...

If you wonder how bad, just bear in mind that even the original devs (P3 was made by... I dont know, some studio I never heard of) mocked and retconned it in the latest Postal 2 addon. Thats how bad it is.

Go play Postal 2 instead.

Postal III
Play Postal 2 instead of this garbage

Postal III
Poorly optimised, and doesn't live up to the glory of Postal 2.

Postal III
After so many years, Postal 3 is released... BUT... by the aptly named Trashmasters. The game, while it has an awesome themesong you can hear in the trailer, has agonizing load times, insufferable missions, awkward controls, and forcing you to sit through all this for the sandbox option, make this worse than a disappointment.

Running With Scissors has completely disowned with installment" and with good reason. Stay far away from this. This is not a "game

Postal III
I'm a huge fan of the Postal series. I have been for a long time. The last game I came across in the series was Postal 3... not even developed by RWS. Confused, but enticed by the Postal" title

Postal III
Get Postal 2, stay away from this game. The devs act like this game didnt exist, thats why they made paridise lost to make up for this  game.

Postal III
I love the postal series don't get me wrong but I just think they did a horrible job on this one it just felt slow and the game got you scratching your head. I recommend you buy postal 1 and 2 not this one sorry.

Postal III
No... just no.
Poor performance, third person postal, no cool weapons and missions

Postal III
0/10

One of the clunkiest, ugliest, and most senseless sacks of garbage that I have ever come across. I am absolutely ashamed and embarrassed to own this piece of ! I would pay money for Steam to remove this off my history forever so that I never have to be reminded of its existence.  you Postal III!

Postal III
I got this game for free, but I cant shake the feeling that I got ripped off somehow...

Postal III
why god why did this happen oh god no

Postal III
I'm gonna get a lot of hate mail for saying this, but, I really enjoyed Postal III. It still had the RWS spirit even if it was mostly touched by another developer. There were the big flaws such as being buggy, wasn't as Open World, and yes, I wish there was some way Rick Hunter could've voiced Postal Dude (he did in the beta Postal III interestingly enough). However, the game did offer some interesting gameplay mechanics, its crude humor did get a chuckle or two out of me, and it did (for me) feel like a Postal game. In the end, its definitely not as great as Postal II, but still a decent game that I would play again. Too bad we'll (probably) never see any Mac/Linux ports...

Postal III
13 hours pain 13 hours screaming and beating my keyboard 13 hours of nightmare
+ I think i got ebola and cancer from this.

JumpJet Rex is a very challenging  2D platformer that stays true to video game classics with its music, gameplay, and visuals. You are the Earth's first Dinonaut and you recieve an urgent call telling you that a meteor is heading to Earth. You must go back home to save your planet.

Gameplay
Through my playthrough I have used a controller. The levels are well designed. However, I have run into a few bugs that ruined my experience. The bug I found was on the first boss fight where I would glitch into the boss and be stuck, or glitch under the map and be stuck.
The levels are challenging and fun and the music is amazing. After I beat the first boss, I saw a difficulty curve appear as levels get much harder to beat.
Through the game you can collect $$$ to buy customization items for your dinosaur. You will be able to play the game for hours upon hours. This game is one that will cause rage in certain levels. Throughout the game there are collectibles hidden throughout the map which you can find and they will be added to your room.

Consider buying this/ not buying this if
Consider buying this if:
- you like the classic feel with videogames
- you like 2D platformers
- you like a challenge

Consider not buying this if:
- you do not like rage games
- you hate dying (most likely you will die a lot)
- you hate pixelated games or 2D platformers

Rating
Pros
+ many hours of gameplay
+ customization
+ music is very well done
+ gives an authentic classic feel
+ difficult and a challenge
+ many collectibles
+ dino basketball

Cons
- may glitch
- may have random lag spikes ( it did for me at random moments within this game)
- huge difficulty curve
- may become slightly repetitive
- only local co-op

Final Thoughts
JumpJet Rex is an amazing game with a magnificent soundtrack and a perfect old-school feel. The huge difficulty curve is annoying and you sometimes will run into bumps. However, overall as a game I am impressed with JumpJet Rex and am happy to have played it.

Early Access Review

This game is RAD.
I'm not the kind of person that likes to play platformers - I usually get bored and frustrated by them really quickly.  This, however, is GREAT.  It's like Super Meat Boy met Flappy Bird and gave birth to a dinosaur with jetpacks on his feet.  Eww

JumpJet Rex
Introduction            	JumpJet Rex is a fast-paced and retro styled platformer. You can play the game just for the story, or you can be the perfectionist by beating the time and not dying at all. The story is not to be taken serious, but it is very funny and cute. The gameplay is tons of fun and it can be very challenging when you are trying to get all the stars throughout the game. I had a blast playing JumpJet Rex; from the audio/visuals to the gameplay, JumpJet Rex is a nearly perfect game. Im sure if you have the chance to play JumpJet Rex, you will have a blast throughout the whole experience.
Pros
Amazing gameplay
High replay value
Really cool hub-world
Perfect audio
Cool retro style
Funny and cute story
Great mechanics
Controller support
Gfx options and rebinding support
Cons
Fairly short story.
Nothing else wrong it (I couldnt think of anything of else wrong)
Conclusion
JumpJet Rex is a nearly perfect retro platformer. It has basically everything you would want in a Retro Platformer for PC (Amazing gameplay, High replay value, really cool hub-world, Funny and cute story, Great mechanics, Controller support, and Gfx options and rebinding support). It was very hard to find anything wrong with JumpJet Rex and it really deserves more attention. I would highly suggest you to pick up JumpJet Rex as soon as you can.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

A really fun platformer.  The unlimited air jumps and dashes feel really great to control.  If you're only trying to beat the game, you can do so very quickly since the levels are short with multiple checkpoints.  But if you want to collect all the coins, all the hidden items, make the best time on any given stage?  You'll be replaying and practicing quite a bit.

Speed run versus against friends seems like it'll be a lot of fun too once more people start playing.

JumpJet Rex
I think this game is a piece of art.

very simplistic controls but still very fun to use.
every level is perfect to speedrun and fun to do so if you are in speedrunning.
even a casual playhrough its a blast.

I do reccomend this game if you are in to platforming/speedrunning.

Still needs some smoothing out but this early release game is looking real nice,

Fast-paced, simple, and addictive. IL friendly with tight controls and suitable for both casual gamers and speedrunners. Looking forward to the final product

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

Ever since I was a kid, I loved trying to clear levels as fast as possible. This is what drew me to racing games, I would try and beat my friend's highscores by trying to perfect every corner.
That's what JumpJet Rex feels like to me. It can be enjoyed as a regular oldschool platform game, or you can really sink your teeth into it and try and beat your own or your friend's scores.
Great games need to have both depth and solid gameplay. JJR aces both.
I'll be playing this one for a long time!!

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

As an avid platforming fan, I am often very cynical/analytical when it comes to playing new ones. I'm stuck in the past, rarely do I find a platformer that I feel can stand up to the SNES era.

JumpJet Rex though, took me totally by surprise. I didn't expect to fall so hard and fast for this game.

I always look for specific things in a platformer, a formula for perfection if you might:

Difficulty - Is the game challenging? Will it make me shout profanities but still make me eager to go back for more? Check. JumpJet Rex is no easy ride, though the difficulty curve put in place is sublime. Not too fast, not too slow, excellent pacing.

Controls - I can get really wound up about clunky controls in platformers. There is a certain feel" that needs to be reached. I have no qualms about the controls for JJR

JumpJet Rex
Just picked this up, insta-buy for me. Graphics are spot on, music and sound effects are awesome, game play is fast based, casual. But it's the type of casual that you can invest hours into and really lose the hours.

Awesome! Keep up the solid work, Indie dev power!

JumpJet Rex
Very high quality platformer, you can tell they poured their hearts into this title.

Every little mechanic and animation is very well done, other platformer developers can learn a lot from this game.

The steam release is excellent as there are a lot of additions which you do not see every day, like choosing a member on your friends and try to compete against them for a high score and even see their ghost in-game to race against.  It takes the normal super high quality platformer and adds in tons of replay value.

JumpJet Rex
Since this game has many reviews relating to how it is as a casual game, I would like to look at it from a speedrunner's perspective, since much of this game seems to revolve around that part. I've spent almost all of my time on this game speedrunning it rather than trying to go through and 100% the game, so I feel like this would help people looking for something fast to play.

To begin, this is basically platformer, except you get to fly around so there's no actual platforming involved. Much of the challenge comes from a few enemies and obstacles scattered around. The amount may vary from no enemies and only a couple thorny bushes to 50 lasers shooting at you at once. Each map is a course where you must go through rings to complete the level.

This game offers fairly simple movement in the form of flight that is nice for casual runs, but it can be very fun to utilize to its full potential in speedrunning. This is obviously subjective, but the movement is extremely fluid, making it so the only reason why a person would fail would be due to their own ability.

Once you move into the actual level design, that's when things get a bit murky. I don't want to talk badly about the levels since anything can be speedran if you put effort into it, but some are extremely difficult and require a great deal of time and patience to do at the speed of top runners. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to think about if you're just looking for a fun and easy game to run. This game focuses quite a bit on ILs, so getting top times on each level could take quite awhile. I would say there is massive variety in the levels so I would also let that be known.

This game offers a ton of things to collect in each level if anyone ever wanted to attempt to speedrun 100%, so that's a plus for dedicated people looking for some replay value. I wouldn't say it's to the point of obnoxiousness, but some of the levels are fairly difficult to 100% complete, which is where the speedrunning part becomes a lot more challenging to master.

Overall, I think this is an excellent game with an active community and plenty of room to improve on. It has simple mechanics that take time to master and a hefty amount of content to explore, which is great for people looking for a lot of replay value.

JumpJet Rex
I enjoyed this game thoroughly.
It is cute and simple 2d platformer.
The graphics are nice
The music is good.
The level design is interesting.

I would advise this to anyone who is looking for a short platformer that is relaxing.
(Except for the very last level)

JumpJet Rex
A ton of fun! Very fast paced with great obstacles and almost perfect controls.

Pros- T-rex with jet boots.

Cons- There isn't more of these kinds of games.

JumpJet Rex
To claim this game is shovelware is to lack understanding of what that term even means.  It might not be the style of game you personally enjoy but it's extremely obvious that it has had a ton of care put into development.  Very refreshing well executed nostalgia trip.

Soooooo if your looking at this game wondering huh this looks kinda cool. Well thats because its made by the cooliest people ive had the pleasure of knowing and just imagine a world wear u can customize a dinosaur.

Early Access Review

Lots of references to the old platforming games of the SNES. The music and graphics are amazing and fit the gameplay very well.

Very easy to pick up, but very difficult to master.

It's a great game to pick up and play and put some time in.

JumpJet Rex
An excellent platformer that gives you more degrees of freedom in regards to movement than you'd expect from a game of this type. It had a focus on speaking, but it's by no means necessary to progress, but it is quite precision based as one hit will send you back to the last checkpoint.
Great pixel art, a fun physics system and a snappy soundtrack otherwise punctuate a great little 2D platformer that stands out from the crowd

JumpJet Rex
love the game, sunk so much time into it the moment I got it, and I plan on speedrunning it more when I have the time.

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is a 2D retro platformer with NES-style pixel art graphics. You control Rex, a tyrannosaur astronaut whose job it is to save Earth from an incoming asteroid. The gameplay consists of navigating your way through a number of 2D levels  40 to be exact  plus four boss stages.

The core gameplay is fairly simple  the central premise is that you have a pair of rocket boots, meaning you can jump an infinite amount of times in the air, boost yourself straight up at a high rate, boost yourself sideways at a high rate (which launches a mid-range projectile in the opposite direction), or do a butt stomp to deal damage to something below you. You also have a bicycle kick which deals damage in all directions around you.

There are a number of enemies. Some of them can be killed with some of your attacks, while others can be temporarily stunned. More interestingly, most projectiles can also be destroyed by your attacks, allowing you to defend yourself from them.

The bosses all have large numbers of hit points; three of them are fairly standard large hit point gauge bosses, though each of them has a way to be killed much more quickly. The final boss has two phases, and the first phase regenerates, making it easily the hardest boss in the game.

The primary goal is of the game is the three stars you get for completing each stage; you need a certain number of stars to unlock more stages, and getting the proper ending requires you to get almost all of the stars in the game. One star is awarded automatically for completing each stage; this is generally not a terribly difficult task, as there are checkpoints in the levels and most of the stages are pretty generous with them. A second star is awarded for completing a stage without dying, and a third star is awarded for completing a stage within a certain time limit. You dont need to accomplish both optional tasks in one run to get all three stars, but on many of the stages, the time limits are tight enough that you cannot afford to die, or can only die once, to get the time. Because the stages are persistent after your death, there are times when dying and respawning closer to where you need to go can cut down on the time needed to beat a level, and a few levels require you to do so.

There are optional bonus levels and collectibles in almost every stage which unlock cosmetic improvements to Rexs home base. In addition, each stage contains a large number of coins and gems which can be collected in order to purchase cosmetic items; collecting all the coins gives a coin bonus, and eventually, an achievement for doing it in every stage.



Only the very final stage in the game does not have checkpoints, and it is a borderline platform hell level, making it pretty annoying.

Overall, the game is pretty tough as far as such games go; it took me about 7 hours and 40 minutes to 100% the game according to the in-game timer. It is nowhere near the difficulty level of, say, a game like Super Meat Boy, but it is still fairly tough. The real challenge mostly lies in the speed runs, though in a few levels, not dying is the more difficult challenge.

By and large, the levels are decent enough, but it is hard to shake the feeling that, for the first 3/4ths of the game, there isnt much to denote your progress. The stages get gradually harder, but only the final nine stages really feel all that different from what came before. The game never gets too difficult (save for the final, checkpointless stage which is a borderline platform hell level, which is a bit frustrating) but apart from the final area there is little sense of progression.

The game mechanics and level designs are decent enough, but the stages arent terribly pretty and are pretty bare-bones functional, as is typical in such retro games.

In the end, I cant really recommend this game, but not because it is bad. It is not bad. It is decent enough and I didnt feel bored while playing it. What the game suffers from is being mediocre. Theres nothing wrong with it, but it is pretty much exactly enjoyable enough to keep the player from getting bored, never so good that you get actively excited about it. You just arent missing anything by never playing this game. And if you arent missing anything by playing a game, why give up eight hours of your life to do so?

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

Very promising oldschool 2D platformer with interesting, challenging and varied level design, which also allows for quick burst game play. Always pleased to see one of these games that's happy to tailor itself to all sorts of ability levels and not just limit itself to hardcore gamers. Being someone whose considers themselves as a fan of this genre, but as a midrange gamer skillwise, I feel it's the kind of thing that will challenge me, and even if some of its speedrun/perfectionist objectives may be out of reach for me, I'd be happy to play it until I get as much out of the game as possible. Nailing some of those early speed challenges is incredibly satisfying! A pretty decent soundtrack to boot.

JumpJet Rex
Great game for the young ones.

Bought for my 4 year old and he loves it. Controls are simple and limited, though the game can still get pretty challenging at times... I can say that it was a little to hard to resist giving him a hand on some of the harder sections when he asked and I actually had a lot of fun with it too.

I also liked how you got awards for completing levels quicker, which can be tricky and dying can even be a strategy for speed at times. My son liked changing the avatar up by buying new heads and stuff - and there are A LOT.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

I love this game! It's fun, challenging, and awesome! The soundtrack and artstyle lead this tough but rewarding platformer, where you control a small, customizable T-Rex. If you enjoyed games such as Super Time Force, Super Meat Boy, and other tough platformers, then you'll love this game! You will keep replaying every level to beat your high score and to find the screts within the level. Anyways, this game is a steal for $10.00, and I really recomend it if you want something to play something that you'll have fun with. Rage, laugh, and enjoy: JumpJet Rex!

JumpJet Rex
I really like JumpJet Rex,  there is a lot to do and unlock, and the controls are tight

JumpJet Rex
I love this game! It reminds me so much of old gameboy/GBC games I used to play as kid but with smoother, less clunky controls. I was happily surprised to find the game mechanics and feel were nothing like flappy bird although the game's controls were inspired from it. I'm glad I did not pass off this game like I initially did with Hotline Miami and Papers, Please.

JumpJet Rex
If you like to beat leaderboard times and/or speedrunning, you might like this game. The game has an interesting 'speedrun' mode with the objective to achieve the fastest time possible. Though the game is fun playing casually, I found more enjoyment in beating people's times on the leaderboard.

If you are looking to play the game casually, it's a very fun platformer where you are speeding through levels as a T-Rex with booster shoes! It also has a nice soundtrack that matches the game's nice 16-bit graphics. But it IS a short game(2-3+ hrs) and depending on how loose your wallet is, $15 might be a steep price to pay. I recommend this game and if it ever receives goes on a discount it would definitely be worth it.

TL;DR

Great but short platformer. T-Rex in space, Chris Pratt would be proud.

JumpJet Rex is a 2D platformer that puts you in control of a rocket boot wearing T-Rex on a mission to save the world from an incoming asteroid. The game consist of racing against the clock while navigating through increasingly difficult levels while collecting the power rings that unlock the gate at the end of the level. All the while youll be dodging spikes, missiles, robots, and zombie like plants from a variety of settings such as space, ice, and jungle worlds. Upon completion of the level you will be awarded stars that are required to progress the game further and unlock the next batch of levels; you are awarded one star for simply completing the level, one star for completing the level without dying, and a third star for finishing the level within the given challenge time limit. Along the way you will be able to collect numerous coins that can be used to purchase adorable cosmetic items for your tiny dino hero.

The game boasts a gorgeous hand-drawn 16 bit retro art style that harkens back to the old days of the Sega Genesis. The game thrives on its fast paced race against the clock and one hit heart system that combine for at times, quite the punishing experience. The controls are fluid and responsive, whether you are jumping, dashing, or rolling, if you happen to die you wont feel cheated because the controls were at fault, something that is crucial for a 2D platformer of this speed and difficulty. If you get frustrated easily or hate repetition then this is not the game for you, as you will quickly learn the ins and outs of each level as you repeatedly die over and over again. This game does not hold your hand and mistakes are not forgiven, the satisfaction of finally overcoming the challenge of racing the clock and completing the level without taking a single hit is a very rewarding feeling.

All in all the game offers a fun, fast paced, 2D platforming experience that that provides a high level of challenge as well as a high level of replayablity.

If you're looking for a great platforming" game in the mix of all the new space age shooters

JumpJet Rex
Lots of fun for both coop and solo. I'd recommend skipping straight to normal mode since the difference between easy and normal is that in easy you get 2 hitd before you die.

This game is also lots of fun for speed running. To really optimize you may have to change your control scheme.

One helpful thing I didn't realize one could do is to cancel your horizontal dash with your drop" (b button on xbox controller). This is useful when jump-cancelling would kill you."

JumpJet Rex
Nice little game with old-timey feel. It is not hard to learn the basics, but hard to master and beat levels in fast pace. If you enjoy old platform action games, this might be a good choice.

JumpJet Rex
Fun little speed-run oriented platformer.  Easier than something like Super  Meat Boy, more of a time waster/personal best focused sort of game?  I dig it.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

I think someone sumed it better then I could have calling it a cross between flappy bird and super meat boy, the graphics and soundtrack are wonderful, the levels are fun and short so beating them is relatively easy but mastering them can be challenging. a nice little game.

Early Access Review

JumpJet Rex is a fun and challenging game. The game controls smoothly, and the difficulty level is just about right so that you know that when mess up, it's your own fault. The main method for success in each stage requires you to learn a fairly simple pattern to maintain fluid movement.

For anyone looking for an enjoyable platformer, I'd recommend this game.

Glad for infinite continues this game is tough, Game seems pull a bit of influence off Sega's knights and Capcom Megman. I'd reccomend to anyone who wants a throwback to a retro platformer or any of speed running community in genral. The controls are very resposive leaving you abilty make split hair manuevers for completion of level. You'll be finding yourself casualy running level till ultimatly memeorize lay out in hopes achieving the high score.

JumpJet Rex
this is a great game. I was expecting level design to be repetative, but each level felt fresh. cool character, cool game, keep up the good work treeforest games.

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is a solid casual jump and run.
Unfortunately with a few flaws.

Pros:

- Nice retro setting.
- Nice retro music.
- Good control concept with the jumping jet boots (although it feels like flappy bird sometimes).
- A lot of secrets.
- Weird but nice and supershort story.
- Super Mario Style" amount of coins. Which you can use to buy skins. Nice!

Cons:

- Engine: One main problem is its performance. I play it on an i7 quadcore with an ok gaming video card.
In a ridiculous resolution (1280x720). And the game lags in huge levels. I even got the feeling

Dying in this game doesn't even matter.

Oh my god I love this game.

It's like the megaman X dash/jump boost was turned into a game with cool dinosaur art and music.

Had to configure the gamepad manually despite the Steam Store claiming full controller support, and the game's website claiming my controller to be compatible. But other than this minor inconvenience, heck yes. This game is awesome.

100% Historically accurate

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

First review hype aside, I think Jump Jet Rex is an already decent game with great potential.  It was updated recently (showing that it's not yet abandoned) with the last set of levels and clear plans for the forth (and seemingly final) boss so has much of the game completely built therefore.  The new update also included one of the most crucial things required by all games, a.k.a. an extensive settings menu that (finally) allows players to escape full screen mode and alter sound within the game engine.  The settings themselves are rather basic, but that is passable in this case due to the basic nature of the game.  Despite being basic, this game WILL kick your bum time and time again if you are a casual player.  It is because of this that I recommend the game only to cautionary players who are aware of it's potential difficulty.  It is one game which is hard but in fair ways, so pros at games like Dark Souls may not be phased, but normal players can expect a challenging game with much to find and more awaiting for those patient enough to wait for each update.
*****That said, THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE and therefore I advise extreme hesitation as you may not get your money's worth if the project fails.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

Update [Spoiler Alert... Skip to Early Access section to avoid]: I beat the game in speedrun mode, took over two hours straight for me to do. I was behind in the race I was doing at first, but I quickly took a lead in the earlygame as I went through all the levels I knew beforehand in a flash, giving be this big star lead over my friend.  But when I finally did get to the home stretch, my friend took the lead and ended up getting to the asteroid before me. I managed to catch up within 10-20 minutes, and I actually found the path before him, but I gave up on the path as I assumed it was the wrong one... Then he ended up just telling me because we were both taking so long on the level.  We both took a snack break, pausing our games at the same time, and after we continued, I lost.  I kept going though, as I wanted to see how long it would take me to finish my run.  Yeah... I actually liked the experience, but the fact that a single mistake would cost me anywhere between fifteen seconds and nearly a minute really added up.  (Anyone else just kept jumping into spikes? I know I did. Alot.)  I'll be playing through the regular mode 100% before I modify this to be a full review.

Before we go to early access section, just remember this.  IF YOU GET THIS GAME, IT WILL BE TOUGH.

[Below was in Early Access, before the first boss was moved and some modifications to levels were made.]

Jump! Dash! Jump! Dash! Die! Repeat until level is complete!

Yes, this is a 2D classic-style platformer with a lot of hidden references.  I'll warn you this, it gives you infinite jumps.  Now you may think that's overpowered, but remember, the obstacles get pretty hard, and your afterburners are your only way of dealing damage other than ramming your head into some of the enemies.  One hit and you die.

This game is EASILY speedrunner friendly, and unique.  Heck, they even let you test out the controls on the title screen!  I love it when games let me do that.  Gives me a convenient way to warm-up pre-run.

You can customize the T-Rex you play as. (Spoiler alert: Mine already has a Megaman helmet!)  From colors, heads/helmets, boots, heck even to your boots' trails, it's all customizable.  The shop mixes up every 15 minutes of playtime after you leave the Dinonaut Base, so be ready to rush to the store and check it out if you have 2000 coins or so already!  (This timer includes time used resetting the level, from what I can tell, only time spent in the shop seems to not count.)

The difficulty? Oh, yeah, it's quite unforgiving, but only if you want that no death star...  Otherwise you respawn at checkpoints... UNLESS you play on the harder mode--it even has rage quit in its name... Listen, that mode gives you 3 lives and no checkpoints for the ENTIRE game if I understand it correctly.  I've only played up to the first boss so far, though, so I don't know exactly how hard it'll get.

From what I can tell, it gives you 3 singleplayer save files, so you atleast don't have to delete all progress files every time you restart the game.  Not sure if the files are seperate in Coop or not yet.  The controls are VERY accurate.  Once you input a control, it feels basically instant responses, atleast with the Xbox 360 Controller that I was using.  Oh yeah, did I mention?  It supports controllers directly!

The soundtrack is excellent, infact if the soundtrack doesn't come with the game, I'll probably go ahead and pick up the soundtrack if it's cheap enough.  It's not often that I actually listen to the game's music/sounds if I'm not streaming my run, excluding certain games of course...  But this game easily passes to a point where I'll probably barely ever not listen to it.  Infact, this is probably one of the first platformers to make it on that list of mine.

You can directly challenge the WR IL times if you wish, thus if you just want to try to hit a IL record, you can easily get ready to do so through that.  You also can challenge your PB--infact it does so on its own if you already have beaten the stage before apparently.  It took approximately 1.2 hours for me to get through the first set of levels and the first boss in total, if you include trying to get the 3 stars in most of the levels and the time spent shopping/adjusting to the controls. (Which I got in all of them except the boss!)

I'll likely come back and update the review if possible after I have more gameplay.  But seriously, it's 20% off until the 30th, and you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free if you get it during early access?  It's easily worth the price tag for how much you can do in the game.  See you when I update this review, and if I end up not updating it, in the next review I do!

(Rating of the game that I consider as of reviewing: 10/10, as I can't see any flaws so far, aside from the fact that there's a few things not in the game just yet, but should be in the game soon considering full release is upcoming!)

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is a fantastic new take on the precision platformer genre. The first few levels aren't fantastic but they let you get to grips with the controls and prepare you for the faster paced, more dangerous levels to come.
The main focus of the game is to use Rex's foot mounted jets to stay off the ground and keep a solid momentum while jumping, flying and propelling forward through each level; collecting coins and jumping through rings along the way. Level design is very creative and although the levels are short the game encourages replaying them by offering rewards for no death runs as well as speederuns. Those are optional however so more casual players can still enjoy the game.

JumpJet Rex isn't perfect, however. The soundtrack is quite good but a bit repetitive and the controls could be just a little tighter. There are upgrades to be unlocked as well but they're all entirely cosmetic. I think it would've been nice to be able to buy a few upgrades to jump higher or move faster.

Overall I'd say it's worth the low price as the gameplay manages to be both unique and familiar at the same time, not to mention an absolute blast to play.

Early Access Review

At the time of this review I am appoximatly 1.5hrs in and I really like this game.  It has all the correct elements for speed running, the level designs are fun and so far are very different. After completeing the first set of stages and FINALLY beating the first boss I can see my time on this game only increasing.

Early Access Review

Do you enjoy Dinosaurs, going fast, kicking rad music, clever secrets and playing dressup? Then this is the perfect game for you! The levels are well designed, the progression is fair and frustrating, and the speed is real. Seriously it feels amazing getting the par time on a level that has been destroying you for 15 minutes.

TL;DR I was able to dress my dinosaur up like MegaMan and run him into spikes. REX/10.

BEST GAME EVER!!!

JumpJet Rex
If you like the classic Mega Man games then this game is worth all your money then more. Actually, just throw your wallet at the devs, they deserve it.

JumpJet Rex
fun, cute and snappy game.

gameplay is tight.

humor is cute and fun.

i got this on the humble bundle monthly and would have bought if i knew about it before hand.

plays like a great 16 bit platformer if you are looking for one. love the music graphics and animations. good job.

JumpJet Rex
Such a fun and at times frustrating game, but that's what makes it so fun!
Great controls, and even though i'm not into speedrunning, i find myself trying to beat my best times.
and who doesn't like a cute dinosaur in rocket boots?
If you get the chance to play this game please do! You won't be disappointed!
I've only just started but I can't wait to keep playing when i get the time this summer.

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is an absolute gem of a game, a speed runners dream.

The game runs superb, have seen no control issues or frame rate issues which is perfect for a game like this. You know if you dont beat a time it was on you not a glitch or bug in the game.

The levels are varied and graphics hit the mark. There is a challenge there for everyone and being able to load up ghost runs of other playes works like a charm.

The amount dedication the developers have put into the game really shows in the end product.

Must buy if you like platformers

Heres my original review for RRDDD:
Disco Dodgeball is a game that grabs you by surprise. You first try it out and don't expect to like it all that much but then you look and it's been nearly 30 minutes of you throwing glowing balls at robots with moustaches. Seriously addicting and I cannot wait to see this game come out of early access."

~Version 1.0 Review.~
Holy hell the game has changed a lot.

Early Access Review

Disco Dodgeball is an awesome example of Early Access done right--every update brings huge, beneficial changes, the game is STABLE and remains fun as heck.

Highly recommended!

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This game is like if Tron, Unreal/Quake, and Dodgeball Advance had a child.

+ Game is super fun
+ Soundtrack is great
+ A good variety of game modes to make sure it doesn't get stale
+ You can even customize your robot a bit with mustaches and sunglasses!

- A lot of flashing neon lights which can be annoying for some
- Game can get frustrating while trying to adjust to the controls/physics

Definitely worth the buy if you're looking to play a game that's just fun, no DLC required. 9.5/10

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Arena shooters is not a genre that has received much love in the recent years. 1999 spawned the best two games of that category, Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament, and since then there have been little to no changes to the formula. Unambitious games with little tweaks on Quake 3 and new coats of paint on Unreal Tournament.

Strangely, the most unique spin on the arena shooter formula comes from this game with a ridiculous title: Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. Instead of weapons there are insta-kill balls to throw (they can be caught), and the movements are on wheels which give some momentum, fluidity and... skill. Predicting trajectories and movements while aiming and moving leaves room for a lot of exciting action, rewarded by a commentator naming the specific skill shot (flying squirrel!""zombie!" "quick draw!").

The fluidity of the game itself ties in with the atmosphere. There is some cool electro/techno music playing while panels and lights on the levels change color according to the beat and the movement of players. Really enthralling.

Even if the game has a huge skill ceiling

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Early Access Review

I've been following this game since it's beta, long before it got greenlit.

RRDDD (or just Disco Dodgeball) is an easy to learn, hard to master multiplayer game (or singleplayer, against bots) that I loved since the first time I've played it.
The game basically consist of silly robots playing deadly dodgeball in several arenas. Different game modes add a lot of variety. For instance: classic deathmatch, FFA modes, hoops (think dodgeball mixed with basketball), elimination, and more.
There are also different skill shots"

**Key was donated from the developer to review**

Introduction            Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball may give the idea of a cheap indie game thats goal is to just take your money, but this is not the case. I didnt expect much going into this game and was incredibly surprised with the amount of polish and depth in this game. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has nearly every feature I like to see in games like this and more. (See pros list for a more list of the cool features) The first thing you will notice once you open Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is the amazing soundtrack, and if the techno dance music isnt your thing you can add your own music. Along with the soundtrack the visual style goes perfectly with this type of music and will get nearly anyone hyped up to play. While playing solo I had tons of fun and the challenges were great, but I did have some problems with connections on the online multiplayer. People were teleporting around, but I do think this was due to those players connections. Overall, I would highly suggest everyone to check this game out.

Pros
Awesome Music and You Are Able To Load Your Own Tracks
Several Game Modes
Well Made Crafting

Unique Graphics Style


Cons
Connectivity Issues. (I Had A Few Problems with People Glitching Around While Playing Online, May Not Apply To Everyone)
The Crazy Colors May Be Too Much For Some People
(There is nearly nothing wrong with this game and I am pleasantly surprised with the amount of polish this game has. AMAZING Developers, I would love to see more from them)

Well here I am, my 80th birthday and my wife has seen fit in our budget for me to afford one of those nice new indie games on Steam. Well here I am on Steam and I come across a colorful lookin' game on sale. My eye doctor said that vivid colors would be good for my vision. So my wife said what the heck is that?" and I said it's "dodgeball" and so she said alright.

I thought I'd ask the man that made the game his opinion on it and he seemed like a pretty nice guy.

Early Access Review

The best multiplayer game I have ever played. Gameplay is really fun (like Unreal or Quake), soundtrack[82apps.bandcamp.com] is AMAZING. Buy it. Play it with friends, friendly community, or just with bots. You will enjoy this game.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
I have always been a fan of fast paced physics based shooters but I haven't found one that wasn't too high of a learning curve or just plain bad. I saw this game from a youtuber a while ago and I thought it looked great so I decided to buy it. If you can't tell by my hours on the game I have been enjoying it ever since.

It has a very unique feel and having to actually pick up each shot you fire is a small thing that makes it very different from other shooters. There are also many skillshots you can preform which give you more to do once you get better at the game. As of writing this review the game has one of the best communities I can think of, I currently run a group that organizes events for the game and am having a blast. The developer is a great guy who clearly cares about and works hard on the game and its community.

The games multiplayer is very entertaining with a good amount of gamemodes and maps and the singleplayer has a lot of good content too. As of writing this review an arcade mode was just added to the singleplayer that is a great timewaster for when I don't want to deal with other people.

I would definitely reccomend this game and I think you can easily get your 15 dollars out of it. You probably won't play it as much as me but everyone I know that picks it up says it was worth their hard earned money.

UPDATE FOR OFFICIAL RELEASE: *happy screaming*
This is everything anyone would want for a release. The arcade mode, as a highlight, is pleasantly addictive and the updated levelling system makes my inner completionist squeal its head off. There's even a bunch of steam cards now which, for me, was a happy surprise when I checked the announcements. This game is just great. Buy it already.

Onto actual review:

Whenever someone asks me what my favourite games are, I always smile and then start blurting off about the Portal series, how Stanley Parable is like the best thing ever, why they should start playing SCP Containment Breach like right now and how Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is possibly my favourite game of all time. When my mates and I get past the whole, Wait

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Pros:
- Great Multiplayer Component with countless gamemodes.
- Great Singleplayer Component with gamemodes such as horde, arcade and more.
- Fun gameplay.
- Strong replayability.
- Good amount of customization.
- Upbeat and fun soundtrack.
- Nice colorful graphics.
- Developer is super cool, dedicated, and listens to feedback.
- Bots are pretty strong.

Cons:
- None

Final Verdict:
This has to be one of the best games to come out of Steam Greenlight and Early Access! Everything about the game is fantastic. If you enjoy multiplayer you'll love this game, if you enjoy high replayability singleplayer games you'll enjoy the game aswell. This game is well worth more then the $15, for a indie game this game surpasses most multiplayer FPS games. Overall I cannot recommend this game more. Well worth the money.
10/10.

I Have nothing to say to you, in order for you to decide whether or not to buy this game.

Instead, look at the amount of hours I have on record on this game to see just how good I think it is, and how good you might like it

Flashy Arcade-Style Fun!An Early Access game that graduated with flying colours.

Let me start this review off by saying I've got 97 games on Steam and this is my most played game.  If that doesn't peak your interest, feel free to read on.

Intro:

This game is special.  When I say special" I don't mean mentally handicapped

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This is a fast-paced first-person dodgeball game from the future complete with robots, an (amazing) voiced announcer, and synced visualizers for the music.

At its core this is a game I *highly* recommend for those that enjoy the FPS (especially instagib) genre, but want something a bit different... yet still familiar. I won't be so bold as to say a digital dodgeball game has never been made before, but this is the first I've ever played to really go all out with it. It's so brilliantly simple, yet took this long until someone decided to make it... AAA marketing departments: fire yourselves.

NOTE: THIS GAME HAS A DEMO YOU CAN TRY! So... try it! (I don't know if it's up to date... but the gameplay is the same regardless)

Graphics:
I love them! The best way to describe them is a minimalist TRON-themed rave". The music plays a big part as the level coloring/brightness/etc. is hooked up to a visualizer system. Different music will give you a different feel

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Early Access Review

Definately one of the better examples of Early Access done right. Regular updates, a very involved dev are what the game has going for it on the outside. Inside the game, you have maps and gameplay that may evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of old arena FPS games.

RRDDD sports a kickass soundtrack that brings with it both pumping beats to get you into a fugue of awareness and dodge ready, and softer tracks to wind you down when you need a breather. The Gameplay is fast and so are your armaments, dodgeballs. All hits are one hit kills, no health, no second winds. Catches, Long Distances, Flying Squirrel are just a few of the trick shots you can pull off. Perhaps you could even become God-like in the good variety of gamemodes.

For a low price you can have a lot of fun bashing in your fellow mustachioed robots's chasis in with discoball dodgeballs online. Is it silly? Perhaps. Is it fun? Definately.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Incredibly fun, satisfying yet lighthearted multiplayer game. Variety of diverse game modes whether it be your classic team deathmatch or capture the flag/cube or more zany ones like Hoops.
Sweet sountrack and aethestics.

Great game to just jump in and have some good old simple fun.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Early Access Review

This game is one of those rare gems that comes along and puts everyone on a level playing field.  The concept is so humorous alone that the game just oozes good vibes.  You can really see how much the developer loves both his game and the game's community in this one.  It's perfect for both casual play and competitive sport.  In fact I have not met or seen a person yet who has played this game and has not had a good time.

The graphics on this game are simple but they suit it.  The designs of the different arenas really compliment the fact that you're a robot with one wheel rolling around.  The pulsing and moving lights really sell the idea that you're a night-club arena and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard to a game.  Visually the game gives you what you need, and none of the fluff.  This is why Super Mario Bros. was so popular.  Visually it was nothing like we have today but it was fun to play!

The game does have an experience points system, but it's geared towards getting cosmetic upgrades, not towards making you more powerful.  I like this because it means new players have chances to improved without constantly getting slaughtered.  Also like many multiplayer games, there's sometimes lag, but with 4 to 12 people throwing dodgeballs around in every direction imaginable, it's so much fun and so chaotic that nobody really seems to mind!

You know a game is fun when you're laughing and yelling at your friends over voice chat, having a great time even when you're losing!  It's definitely one of my favorite games of all time; I highly recommend it for one of the best times you will have with your friends, ever, online.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This is another hidden gem on steam that would give Ricochet a run for it's money. Robot Roller Dodgeball is dodgeball that knows no boundaries and puts everyone playing at risk. Such an extremely simple FPS" game made with care and precision.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
I was quite skeptical seeing all the positive reviews while seeing the mediocre gameplay.  All the lights and effects seemed like goofy attempt at covering up the junk underneath.

But after getting the 4-pack during a sale and playing with some buddies, I came right back and bought a few more.  For those that enjoy arena shooters, this is an arena shooter done right.  Every shot that hits feels so satisfying, I crave to play more.

The only major downside is the steps it takes to actually set up a LAN party.  Due to the limited experience of the lonely dev, he resorted to 3rd party technology, thus the requirement to download a server program from an external website and a bit of tweaking before one can play with friends, even if everyone is on the same router.

After having done so, I see it is relatively easy despite the daunting number of steps on the wiki, so don't be afraid to give it a shot.

Also surprisingly, playing solo with bots is actually pretty darn fun too.  Don't let the flashing lights blind you, this game delivers a very solid package.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys arena shooters.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Seriously, this is one of the best multiplayer arena games to come along in a long time.  You will see that I own many of these types of multiplayer games, and this has esports written all over it.  I cannot believe there are not 5,000 people playing this right now.  I bought this thinking it would be OK for a couple of hours, but wow....everyone in game is saying the same.

Honestly, this is the kind of game that could benefit tremendously from a free weekend of sorts.  Once you play it, you will see that it is pure skill.  It has tons of game modes that are all fun.  I never really write reviews on Steam, but with this one, I just had to to try and get the word out.  I urge everyone to stream this game and pass the word along to friends to keep this one alive.  It has sooo much potential and....well, stop reading this, just buy it now.  better yet, but a four pack for your friends as well!!

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
I havn't played a game that got me this excited for many years.  It's so energetic and exciting and kinda rekindles how games used to feel for me when I was younger.  It's a lot of fun and definitely worth picking up.

You and everyone else are robots that zip around various different rooms and try and blow each other up with dodgeballs.  It's fast paced, and me and some friends have been playing it together lately.  Me and one other in particular pull some crazy stunts against each other, it's great.  The level designs are great, there are quite a few game modes to choose from.  The soundtrack is really good.  There are powerups you can pick up around the room as well that will effect your movement or the dodgeball.  You can play with real people and/or bots.

It's just pure awesome.  Really refreshing title here.  Worth every penny, if I spent a penny on it (it was gifted to me).

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Upon reading the title, three things can be learnt about this game.

1) It has robots.
2) It involves disco.
3) It's about dodgeball.

And if there's anything this game is guilty of, living up to expectations is not one of them. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a competitve primarily multiplayer first person shooter filling the fairly empty and unexplored niche of a dodgeball game, one I'm frankly suprised nobody thought of before.

GAMEPLAY
Gameplay is easy to learn; find a dodgeball, hold the mouse to shoot (Oh

Early Access Review

I was fortunate enough to win a copy of this game in a giveaway, and I was very happy to have had a chance to experience the awesomeness found within this crazy, intense game.

If you like first-person competitive gameplay, dodgeball, electronic dance music (EDM), and vibrant, colorful battlefields, then you will really enjoy this game.

The aesthetics are fantastic - each level is basically a light-show-heavy rave, further enhanced by a very good electronic dance music tracklist. I especially loved the fact that the track playing in the menu screen would continue as the in-game music (something that I really appreciate because I don't have to desynch to the music when a new track suddenly interrupts the one you had been initially listening to). You can customize your robot character's appearance a fair amount, with the option to unlock more pieces as you level up your account. The announcer's praise for unique moves you do (ex: air hits, bounce hits, denials, etc) adds to the intensity of the game, which is reminiscent of the fast-paced action typically experienced in games like the Unreal and Quake series'.

The controls are easy to grasp and helpful pop-up tutorials remind you of your keybindings for things like e-braking, boosting, etc. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with first-person combat. Even against easy bots in singleplayer, you will have a very fun and challenging time familiarizing yourself with the game. During combat, you truly need to appreciate battlefield awareness because it is extremely easy to be hit from behind by a dodgeball. Furthermore, carelessly throwing your ball at an opponent may result in a catch, with auto-kills you and (even worse) brings back a downed opponent. You cannot catch twice in a row (you must throw a ball to reset your catch allotment), and this helps ensure that people do not simply camp and wait for their opponents to throw the first ball.

There are a variety of different levels, each with their own distinct layout that may result in you changing up your strategy (for example, one level consists of many pillars, so weaving in and out to dodge/juke your opponents attacks is a much more viable strategy here than, say, a level with large, open ground.

Pickups also litter the battlefield, adding advantages like homing dodgeballs, a temporary jetpack, fast/tighter maneuverability, or even laser (straight) shots. The powerups are random (much like Mario Kart's mystery powerups), so you may have to pick several up before you end up acquiring your favorite one. My personal favorite is the jetpack, since it really helps you achieve those beautiful death from above" hits.

this is the only good game

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
These days it seems like developers, especially the giant AAA companies, have forgotten why we play video games to begin with:  TO HAVE FUN!

THIS GAME NAILS IT.  This game is just pure fun.  It is definitely a throwback. The engine is simple, the physics are fantastic, and... I mean come on its DODGEBALL WITH DANCE MUSIC AND LASER LIGHTS!!!  How the hell can you not enjoy that?

I highly recommend buying this, you won't be disappointed.

For 11.99 this game is a steal.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Wow. I was not expecting this gem.

Where do I begin? I got it last night when my friend finally paid me back, and after a 5-minute install, I booted it up. After tweaking the settings so it'd run smoother, I started the tutorial. No surprise, I sucked. Really, really badly. So, what did I do? I joined a random multiplayer game. And I got wrecked. But I also fluked my way into getting a few kills. Not skillshots, mind you, but kills. Anyways, after about 30 minutes since starting the game I get off to eat dinner.

Except, it hadn't been 30 minutes. As I stood up, I glanced at the words next to the 'Play' button. 'YOU'VE PLAYED: 90 minutes'

I spent an hour and a half getting blue and/or red dodgeballs thrown at my face by mustachioed, unicycling robots while rocking out to the badass music, and didn't even realise it.

And I have to say:

11/10

Would get balls thrown at my face by robots with mustaches again.

If there was a 'Highly Recommended' button instead of a 'Recommend' and 'Don't Recommend', I would use it.

Easily game of the year. This game has so much more to it than meets the eye. I began playing this game in beta, and it was amazing! It has easy mechanics, easy objectives, and unfathomable entertainment. There are so many things that I love about this game.

First off, unlike most other fps games, it's balanced. All players are equal, and when you die, there's no excuses. The other player was either better than you, or was able to use the map and powerups better than you. It's straight forward hit or miss gameplay. Also, the powerups are balanced. The big balls will help you hit more robots, but they are so much easier to see, and unlike the homing and laser, you can't hide having the powerup. When you're holding a ball, it's always big and noticable. The homing is amazing against bots at long range, but is so much harder to use close up. Also, when you lose it, you're so used to seeing the tracker that it disorientates you for a moment. Laser is fast and great for ricochets, but it messes up the way you're used to playing, being the ball has no drop. Jetpack is great for capturing points or swooping in like an eagle, but you can lose vertical momentum, making yourself an easy target. Pogo is good for navigation, but if you fumble, you're an easy midair target. Super boost is great for hit and runs, but really hurts your finger pressing shift. I find that when you use superboost, you start going in a lap pattern, which makes you a predictable target. You also get disorientated in close combat. The balance in this game makes it such a more entertaining game because you're just as capable as the rest of your team to achieve the objectives.

Second, the soundtrack. Where do I even start. It's amazing, and really is. The game wouldn't be the same without it. Hell, I'm a person that doesn't even like dubstep, and I can't play this without the music. It just gets you in the mood to kick , or just stop and listen to it. Best soundtrack of any game I've seen (or heard).

Third, the simplicity. At first glance, you may think you'll just be getting into some futuristic, complicated sports shotter with a ton of exposition. The title alone is complicated! But when you start playing, you realize just how simple it is. There's some balls. Go get a ball. Take that ball and hit that jerk over there in the face with it. Oh, by the way, keep killing those guys so your team wins. Or be fancy about smashing their smug toaster of a head open, because you're getting points for that. It's easy to learn, easy to master. I've never played a multiplayer game like that before. THe only real thing that separates experts from beginners is knowing your keys and mouse.

Finally, my favorite thing about this game is the development. It's ridiculous. Like I said, I started this in beta, and now it's ready for launch in a little under a year. Erik's the hardest working dev I think there is. Here's some new maps you can try out. Some more gamemodes. Here, a ton of more graphics options! Fixed some bugs that were reported 2 hours ago. Want singleplayer? Here's singleplayer! Hell, when 3.2 came out, I remember joking about 3.7 coming out. And it's now here! After a few short months, you've made 5 milestones in the development of Disco Dodgeball! Congratulations! Not only have you evolved, re-evolved, and revolutionized the game itself over and over again, but you've done something which is what all devs should do. You listen to your community. You actively engage with us to find what we want to see in your game. Is this causing lag? Fixed. Want more gamemodes? There you go. Catching too easy? No problem. You've even made a demo for players to try it out for free! I've gotta say, this wouldn't be nearly as fun of a game if Erik wasn't such a great developer.

So what are you waiting for? Get the game! You will not regret it. It will probably make you a better person, and help with stress. Better hurry, friday's only once a week! In case you don't know, we have game nights and tournaments every week! You'll quickly get a good group of friends from the community. You'll meet new people, and have a ton of fun hitting them in the face with an exploding dodgeball! What's not to like? Doesn't matter, Erik will fix it!

This is an amazing game. Its fun, its differnt, and most of all, your tripping while listening to dubstep and disco.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This game is THE . Very fun, bots are fun to play against if you're having trouble finding online games, it has customizable game modes, simple mechanics, the physics based movement is fun to play with, and the game is aestheticelly pleasing. Definitely worth the money.

I have very few minor complaints about it:
- The UI could use a little polishing
- The game is a bit stingy when it comes to customization unlocks. Drop rated for crafting parts is pretty low, but thankfully you can buy parts in the communnity market for cheap.
- The sliding mechanic is a little weird; it doesn't seem to offer anything in terms of advanced movement outside of recharging your boost (whch is all I use it for)

pro/con - You can save replays, and they are directly saved as .gif files, which is really nice. The bad thing is, the gifs are short, so it's hard to capture cool moments perfectly. I reccommend binding the replay capture button to the 'q' key (Default F5)

Please don't let these few downsides turn you away from this game. It's quite an experience.
