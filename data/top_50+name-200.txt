Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This review is dedicated to my friend Gary who died of cancer.

He introduced me to this game and I have a big soft spot for its simple mechanics. Its easy to pick up and difficult to put down.

This game only came on Steam a year or so ago. We played the retail release. This new version adds Twitch support and is a lot more friendly to modern systems and resolutions. I've not clocked long on it mainly due to the bitter sweet memories. I like the units in this game. My only complaint with this has been that there could have been more nations to choose from. But that is minor. Its right up there with Age of Empires et al.

Goodnight Gary. I'll keep winning for you.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
One of the best game revivals.

RoN became very fast my favorite strategy games once it got released at 2003 and later with its expasion at 2004. I love it as it consists of gameplay of all eras. Starting with your slignshots and swords, and improving until you get missiles and stealth bombers.

It's story is quite good and reminds you of the glory days with some great battle. Multiplayer is one of its best elements. Playing with your friends co-op versus with AI or just an all out battle! Customise the teams as you want and also the battle's options like map size, technologies and winning methods.

Now let's talk about Extended Edition. <---Skip here if you just want to learn the differences.
The game graphics look quite similar but definitelly smoother. You can feel the overall gameplay and animations of the charaters being so smooth while moving and fighting.

Multiplayer is here once again with leaderboards! As gamespy is dying the game now has multiplayer once again and better than ever! I am hoping to see an ever bigger map though and more units instead of just 200/300. I bet it wouldn't be much of a problem nowadays with the new updated and powerful computers.

Twitch! Do you like streaming and showing off your gameplay? This will be very handy for you. Log in, hit the record button and show your fans all your strategy tactics on how you beat your opponent!

The only downside for me is that the game looks quite similar, yet some small very handy improvements will make it quite better.

Bigger maps, yes bigger than Big Huge. People using the editor can remake their countries and some of their battles with a proper big terrain.

More units! Setting the unit price to lower and having more units in battle will totally increase the fun of the game.

More players? With bigger maps, more players can be added as well. 12 or something like that.

Overall?
If you liked the original, you are gonna like this one as well.
If you haven't played the original, then if you like real time strategy games, you are gonna love it too!

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
These nations are extremely balanced:

-Russia has increased attrition within ALL borders.
-Egypt has EXPONENTIAL food/wonder bonuses
-Bantu have an AMAZING population perk.
-Chinese can create citizens INSTANTLY.

-Romans save 25% on a fort.

10/25%off Would play as Romans again.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
It's like Civilization and Age of Empires had a baby and Steam just now got around to sending out cigars, even though the kid's like 10 now.

Cool kid though, great game!

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This is my favorite game of all-time. This was one of the first games that I bought back in 2004 (Gold Edition) and still played it before the release of the Extended Edition. Every RTS lover should play this game. 

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
One of best strategy games ever.
+ Multiple Nations
+ Multiple army (foot, water, air, rockets!)
+ Great economic system
+ Ages (ancient, medieval, age of gunpowder, industrial (like WW1), modern (WW2), information (Don't worry no cosmonauts or futuristic ts just you can research very good things like immediately spawn soldiers and so)
+ Extended Edition
+ Graphic
It's like Age of Mythology (well at least authors are same) but very different. Here you can be in age of Enlightenment as Japan or Russian or Mongol (it's upt you)

- Can't defeat my brother, whatever I do

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise of Nations has been my go to" game for many years when I wanted a challenge
without a lot of story line investment. It's great to kill an hour or an afternoon

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is just as good as I remember it

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
So.  Back in 2003 I played this game.  My brother and I managed to hook up a dial up internet connection, and would spend quality time annoying each other or fighting alongside each other. (Often in the same match) and would build these massive empires and crush the opposition.

With the slow death of GFWL, and the modern computer making older games hard to play I lost track of this game.

Enter the modern age.  Some wonderful person decided to rip the GFWL garbage out and make it play nice with Steam.  Once again my urge to drop nukes on my brother took over.  Once again I watched in horror as my brother dropped nukes on his own cities just to wipe out my army.

10/10 would create the holocost again.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Realised I was losing. Nuked the world into armageddon rendering everyone a loser.

10/10 Would lose again

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
+ Border lines help to navigate differing territories, plan new settlements with a more informed approach, and investigate spheres of control; the restrictive aspect of this feature also serves to deter early rush tactics and general griefing
+ Zoom feature helps to navigate terrain and keep track of movement over large swathes of territory
+ The diplomacy options play out as more than a gimmicky feature, and are both simple on paper and functional in practice
+ Time restrictions during campaigns add to the challenge in a way that is rewarding if successful
+ Have seen some before and after stills, it's clear that the visuals and textures are noticeably improved; this should further appeal to veterans of the franchise
+ The re-release now supports Twitch integration; I don't use the feature myself, but this is still a significant boon for the streaming community
+ Features a satisfying variety of playable cultures, each with their own defining traits
+ The trategic overview map is a nice feature, and consists of a simple, turn-based Risk-style map; some notable features include: bonus cards you can apply, resource bonuses, diplomacy, and varying types of battles that hinge on several factors
+ Impressive array of options and game-modes available for multiplayer, many of them quite novel for an RTS game (although they're not quite as alien for other strategy sub-genres)
+ Attrition and supply features are a nice addition, and do well to keep one prepared and on their toes during offensive engagements
+ Excellent sense of balance in all aspects
+ Special units are presented well in the game and don't feel overpowered or cheap in their use

- The overworld strategy part of the game feels a bit watered down compared to other staples of the genre; it isn't necessarily bad, but it's also clear that this feature was never meant to be the bread-and-butter of the franchise
- The AI feels a bit underwhelming, and I had expected more of an improvement for the re-release

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Aww yeah, it's finally out on Steam, RoN was, and still is one of the best RTS games made.  Highly recommended for RTS fans, it still holds up very well, and has gotten some extra polish. :)

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I love this game because its perfect for sore losers.
losing? just build 15 nuke silos and make everyone lose

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Me and my mate thought it would be smart to build our docks around the back of our islnds, because the AI, like the Age of Empires II AI, wouldn't be smart enough to look back there.

They were swftly demolished.

9/10 Verdic: You must stop him

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
When I played RoN for the first time on around 2004/5 I was really impressed with the number of upgrades that this game offered to me. I was doing building of many types of units which have their own abilities and specialties. The number of research that I could do was mind boggling and are very effective while winning a game. This game , to me, redefined the genre RTS. So without any further delay let me review this game quickly....

Game Play :
As anyone can understand the game play is fairly complex due to number of different units , number of different resources and the number of different buildings with different research items. But RTS is all about complexity. You build up your game slowly and nicely (the way you see it fit the objective) and then in a single master stroke your complete your objective(s). Most of the missions are timed which means that you have to achieve victory within a stipulated amount of  real time (say 90 minutes). Usually I find this time to be more than enough but at time to time (specially with rising difficulties) you may find it a bit more challenging.

In SINGLE PLAYER Campaign you can play different scenarios (more in number in extended edition) or you can play the age old classical world domination. MP is also there and somewhat active in nature - but you must play good and I mean REAL GOOD to win MPs. The statistics from the game engine that comes out after the game is pretty impressive, you could even get a stats about your right and left clicks in the entire game as well....

Graphics:
Even if the game is from 2004 the graphics is stunningly detailed. If you zoom a bit you can see - the seas are having waves , the crops in the farms are swinging with the wind current and what not. From RTS perspective the details is very high (some people may not say its good but I actually liked it). The different models have their different behaviors.

Over all this detailed graphics adds a nice touch to the entire gaming experience.

Controls:

Controls are fairly easy to understand and its better to have the shortcut keys known to yourself - they will help you greatly in the MPs. mouse clicks are pretty consistent but in my slower GPU the scroll rate for the map was a bit jaggy.

For a comprehensive basic guide I recommend   this. .

Misc:

In other features - the game now have integrated Steamplay, Twitch,  Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards to increase the game experience even more. The Extended Edition also includes the Thrones and Patriots expansion , the HD models.
Overall the game gets a thumbs up from me.

Hope you will enjoy the game as I did.

//I killed them all anyways.

No regrets.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
One of the better RTS games out there.It comes with tons of nations(each one has some unique national powers and units) and many different gameplay mods so that anyone can enjoy it.
Only thing I dislike about this steam port is that the game was a bit rushed and its multiplayer suffered slightly from a few annoying bugs(most of them were eventually patched out but a few still remained...), rather than these few remaining bugs I fully recommend the game to everyone.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition

Hiroshima/10

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
A solid, enjoyable, and accessible RTS with equal playability for combat and econ/tech.

RON is a multifaceted real-time game with well-implemented resource gathering and tech dimensions, in addition to the industry-standard combat elements. It's customizable enough so that a newcomer or veteran who would rather not worry about tech, econ, or combat can disable those elements in the starting menus.

There are six economic resources in the game (three of which appear after appropriate research). Most combat units, buildings, tech, and upgrades cost one or two types of resources. They also tend to increase in cost the more of the same unit/building you have already built, which encourages players to diversify their buildings and units rather than just rebuild one type over and over.

Combat units usually adhere to a rock/paper/scissors balance mechanic, although at later ages there are a decent range of specialized units that accomplish unique functions in warfare. Controlling a battle group is relatively intuitive - command buttons on the console also show shortcuts for the more-familiar player, and extra modifiers such as facing, General craft powers, and terrain also allow modest benefits for the detail-oriented player.

Each nation has its own special powers, which lead to interesting matchups (although at higher levels of play, certain nation powers mandate a narrower choice of strategy than others).

Those already experienced with RTSes can expect to jump right in and get playing against the AI competitively, and then jump online to test their skills against humans. This game may be a steeper learning curve for newcomers to the RTS genre because of its breadth of econ, tech, and military.

Players who like modding their games will also find this game rewarding and versatile, including the ability to mod entire campaigns and to create new units in the game's .xml files.

An excellent balance of accessibility and complexity. My favorite RTS game.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This game is better than sex.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I love Rise of Nations, it's one of my all time favorite games.
I would recommend this to anyone, it really is an awesome game! Don't hesitate buying it!

UPDATE: After spending so many hours playing this Extended Edition, the only bug I've encountered was the lack of audio after alt-tabbing in the first day. But a patch was already released on the second day and I haven't had any issues with the game since.

This is a must own for any strategy fans out there. Especially if you like a bit of historic visual art which you can manipulate in real time. Steam Workshop is coming soon, too.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This will forever be one of my favorite RTS games of all time.  I've played Age of Empires, Starcraft, and Warcraft III, but out of those, this game is still better in my opinion.  There are so many ways to set yourself up, and so much micro-managing to constantly keep you focusing on your resources while also controlling your expansive army.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a real-time strategy game from SkyBox Labs and previously Big Huge Games, published by no other than Microsoft Studios. It's a perfected version of Rise of Nations and Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, all with new Steam features like achievements, cloud saving and more.

Like many Microsoft games remake, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition retain exactly the very same gameplay and features from the previous 2 games, everything combined into a single game. If only like Age of Empires 2: HD Edition, the population limit is increased, this game might worth more. At least we get to see the old Conquer the World campaign along with the Thrones and Patriots new campaign such as the Cold War. For you who haven't play Rise of Nations before, the gameplay of this game is very good, start with a single city, build a library, college, market and expand your city, then build more cities and expand your empire into a great nation. Victory can be achieved through conquest, science or in this game called tech race, building wonders and there are more win condition for custom play.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition graphics are, well, it's said that the water and textures has been improved, and there is a new anti-aliasing effect, but me personally didn't see that great differences from the previous Rise of Nations, or maybe it's just been far too long. The graphics are classic, but good, very good, I'm not saying it's bad, it's just kinda still old. The performances are good, no lags or any kind of problems.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition however, have many room for improvements, if Microsoft really care. Maybe a DLC? Bad idea for most but at least there is an addition, maybe new unique units, new unique unit models for each nation (seriously, Russian launching F-18 Hornet from their carrier?), new campaign maybe the Roman campaign or something, even maybe new nation? Expansion Packs?

Like many other too, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition has the Steam workshop support for community made custom content like maps, scenarios, even mods.

But overall, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a great game, very fun and with the new Steam features, even better. I recommend this.

Rating 9/10

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I THOUGHT WE AGREED NO NUKES

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
10/10 - Best $5 Spent In My Life this game is taking over my life, help me

This game was worth every. single. penny. I debated on if I should get it or not for a while, I watched some gameplay and talked to some people that owned the game since I've never actually played any RTS games. (well one, Nemesis of the Roman Empire, but that was way back then)

I've played Civilization V and probably some other Civilization when I was younger but I forgot which one it was. :P Anyways, this game is almost PERFECT for me. Almost because they could add some small features here and there, but it's not a big deal. The only bad thing that has yet to happen was my laptop shutting down mid-game, but I think it over heated haha.

What is this game like? If RIsk and Civilization were to become RTS games and have a potato, this would be that potato. If Windows 95 became a RTS I would eat that potato. Potatos are good for your health. Thank you based potato. Great game don't see why you shouldn't buy it. Multiplayer has ranked matches, even a lobby chat on the game browser. It's pretty active if you're a multiplayer type of person.

Thank you based Microsoft.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
A fun and challenging RTS with a very good price while on sale. It offers challenging play, gameplay that differs from other RTS, loads of civs to play, nukes, and amazing soundtrack (seriousky, I would buy this game just for the music, it's that good), multiplayer, streaming for all you streamers, a wide tech tree, a 'risk-like' world domination mode, campaigns, quick and useful tutorials, a huge amount of game setting customization, wonders, huge battles and many, many more features. Also it comes in a huge bundle pack so you can get other great games like AOE2 and AOE3 with it!

BOTTOM LINE:
Buy it f you enjoyed other RTS games like AOE2, preferably when on sale (because who doesn't like a great game for 5 bucks), get your friends to buy and nuke them to awesome music

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
The question on most of the minds of people who played this game:

Does it hold up?

Yes.

Unlike Age of Empires II which, in my opinion, sadly doesn't stand the test of time, Rise of Nations is every bit as fun and engaging as it was more than ten years ago. It's also still a bit of a mess in its late game moments, which I'll address a bit later.

First off, for any new players donning their commander cap for the first time, what is Rise of Nations? It's best described, I think, as a cross between Age of Empires and Civilization. It is a real-time strategy game, first and foremost - worker units are recruited and instructed to gather the expected resources in food, wood, gold, iron, and later oil. They'll also construct military barracks, universities for gaining knowledge (which you'll spend to research technologies and advance through the ages), castles and forts for locking down territory, and perhaps most importantly of all - cities.

You'll begin the match with one city. Structures like temples and forts will push your borders out a bit for you, but the only way to really expand your territory effectively is to build new cities. You can then recruit from your new city more villagers, which will proceed to build all the same farms, temples, lumber mills and schools you constructed at your first city - and eventually, you'll start the whole process over again. There's a great sense of satisfaction in watching each of your cities grow from a humble huddle of townhouses to its full sprawl of market, temple, barracks, school and more.

Cities, as I mentioned, expand your borders, which are important primarily due to unit attrition. You can move your workers and military units within your own territory unfettered... but set foot on enemy lands, and you'll notice a red glow pulsing at their feet and a health bar that will slowly begin to dwindle. Supply wagons can be built, and as long as your units are within its effective range, they can pass into enemy lands without fear of damage. Should your wagon(s) be destroyed by the enemy, your units will immediately begin taking damage over time. In this sytem of attrition and supply, Rise of Nations creates a very unique combat game that can force the retreat of a march larger force or encourage players to slug it out along borders where they can effectively fight without fear of attrition.

As stated above, you'll progress from the sticks and stones of the ancient world on through the crossbows and knights of the middle ages - the tanks and bombers of the World War II-era modern age, ending finally in the information age, where stealth bombers and ICBMs run amok. It's exciting and interesting to see what units will open up to you in each era, and every civilization has several unique units available to it throughout time that inject enough variety to encourance players to give them all a try.

As I also stated above, the end-game of Rise of Nations is definitely its greatest weakness. One would expect the introduction of fighter jets, bombers, nuclear warheads and rocket artillery to be pretty exciting, right? Well, it mostly ends up creating a huge mess of a battlefield where's it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on, who's killing who, or what's best effective against what. As nuclear warheads begin to drop and level cities, and certain technologies completely remove the wait time for recruitment (meaning you can keep clicking the Rocket Artillery" icon and it will keep building them click after click after click instantly)

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
I played this game when I was very young, so I undoubtly am biased to the game due to nostalgia. The gameplay itself is still very challenging and complex, especially managing the resources and multi-tasking armies, like most other RTS games.

Rise of Nations won many awards and presents execellent gameplay strategy and tactics due to it's realistic resource/market system. There's not many things that bring me more satisfaction than managing to get my resources going really well, and building up huge armies to invade enemy lands. The game itself is very complex, and with higher difficulties vsing the computer, it becomes very hard to win. The online in this game isn't very great, so I'd suggest playing 2v2 with bots when playing this game. Although you might think you'd feel like a loner, you definetely won't when you're managing an entire country, negotiating with your ally and crushing the enemies.

The five main campaigns in this game is also superb. You could play as Napoleon, conquering europe by playing very fun and interesting scenarios, such as when you gain a few armies to invade a whole heavily guarded Egypt (10/10 historical). The graphics aren't that bad either, considering that I'm very picky on graphics. There are over 40~ countries to play as in Rise of Nations, each of them with their own set of unique powers and units.

Overall, this game still remains a great RTS, with challenging and rewarding gameplay. There's no better feeling than managing to take over two countries via a huge campaign of sieging while the AI on your team does nothing but take the brunt of the enemy's force.

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Rise Of Nation is like an old friend who I might not see for half a year, but when we hang out, it's like nothing changed.

Oh hey RoN

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Let me tell you my story about this beautiful game. One day as I was browsing through the store of steam I was thinking to myself about life and the meaning of it when all of the sudden I saw this game. An unknown force took control of me as I clicked to purchase this game, and procceded to type my debit card information and part of my soul into the computer. Once the sacrifice had been completed I joyfully clicked the library button to download my new game, but I stared in tremendous horror as the download button was missing. I searched through the darkest points of the internet to find a cause to this nightmare to find that the game was to come out later this month. Throughout the month I've been preparing for the coming of this game, by sacrificing goats to the Microsoft gods, so when the game came out they would already be pleased with my actions. My parents took notice of this and sent me to therapy, saying I had a problem and that I needed Help" but I knew that they were blind to the greatness this game would bring. Finally the day came for me to finally download the game I awoke at 4 A.M. to download the masterpiece Microsoft presented

I played it when I was 13 years old, I still play it (i'm 25 now)
That's how good this game is. Its the highlight of RTS!

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
You're looking at a game which I've had the fortune to play since it was released in 2003, and which has never lost it's capacity to create superb gameplay. It is, naturally, better with friends - as most things are, except perhaps murder. Multiplayer on this game, especially with a tight group of close friends with whom you can have plenty of banter, just about beats every other RTS hands down. The thrill of armed combat across an enormous map (or Big Huge map as the game calls it) is gripping, and the delicate but simple mechanics of the Rise of Nations economy, and the associated feeling of a build up towards greater things" (the Modern Age

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
This game is basically the child of Age of Empires and Civilization.
The nations are all very unqiue, and I particularly like how they don't have just standard skins in late game. If a faction historically died out before a certain age, they design the units to fit how the creators thought the faction's troops would have looked.
This game has everything I loved about the Age of Empires series, and throws in Air combat and missiles. What's not to love?

Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
Old but gold. One of my favorite strategy games of all times.

Pony Island
So I bought this game because I don't really have anything better to do. Sure, it is a kids' game, and sure, it is five dollars for what would normally be five dimes, but it's actually a really solid game. I mean, come on, you get to play as a pixelated pony! How cool is that! And the controls are really tight, too- the mouse-only take on jumping and blowing away butterflies is great if you're in the same boat as me and sacrificed your keyboard and soul to the glorious Lord Satan. A really enjoyable experience, definitely a ten out of tSOMEBODY HELP ME BEFO





















Pony Island
Pony Island is an interesting game.
Levels are a bit repetitive at first.
Eventually you get powerups.
After that, it gets more interesting.
Some of the levels get pretty tricky.
Early on, all you can do is jump.
Hovering is added a bit later.
Enemies come at you every few seconds.
Left mouse button to jump over obstacles.
Push enemies away with right mouse button.
Make it to the flagpole and you can advance.
Every so often you get a Puzzle Break"
It's kind of like a programming puzzle.
A butterfly is trying to get to its house.
Moving arrows around defines a route.
The butterfly follows the arrows.
Reach the house to advance.
Anybody can learn this game.
Please give it a try.
Play it right now.
E  verybody.

If you're reading this review; stop, scroll up, don't read any more reviews, don't watch the trailer or read about the game, just buy it and play it and don't stop playing until you finish the game. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.

Pony Island
The one game I uninstalled out of sympathy.

10/10

Pony Island
Ignore all of the hype and play this game because it looks intriguing. That's exactly what I did and I loved this game. The scares in it are never really enough to classify it as a 'horror' game, but damn it is creepy. The way that the game uses fourth wall breaks to spook you is excellent, and there's a certain scare late in to the game that completely blew me away.

Seriously, check this game out if it looks even a little interesting. Chances are you'll probably see the 'twist' (if you can call it that) coming a mile away, but that doesn't ruin the experience one bit.

Music is pretty good too

Pony Island
Come along you won't regret.
Going to Pony Island yet.
Take my hand it's a wild ride.
On this game which you should buy.

Pony Island
The best Christian game for kids 8 and under.

10/10 - will uninstall again.

Pony Island
This game is amazing! It has a retro feel and very challenging if your not so great at puzzles. This game I rate:

10/10 - Making you think it's a Cheerful game!
10/10 - Satanic Ritural
9/10  - Taking over your friends list and having a friend comment about your word choices!

Overall 10/10 would worship satan with ponies again!

i can't believe satan is a ing brony

Pony Island
***Warning*** Minor spoilers!

It has been a while since a game has had me 'wtf'ing' all over the place, but Pony Island brought it back to life. This game is genius.

Storyline: Basic breakdown is that you are trapped within some funky arcade machine that has gone vicious thanks to the devil himself deciding to be a programmer. Take the cover of the game.. Take what you expect the game to be and throw them out the window. Already as you begin, it's clear that something isn't right - Having to fix a broken and glicthy menu from the get go before you're able to commence the gameplay is a sign that the devil may not be as good of a programmer as he likes to think.

As the cursed player of this hellish demon-game, you get whisked around from a chaotic, glitchy, broken world to a cutesey, diabetes-inducing pastel nightmare, with random logic puzzles thrown in, to fix Satan's buggy code. As you guide your pony through the devil's glitchy game, you can catch brief glimpses of who your character used to be before they were killed and trapped in the game. The story is gritty, blurred and as twisty as the day is long. Basically, it's fantastic.

Gameplay: I feels as though I had to make an extra section *just* for gameplay because it's honestly that damn good. The ingenuity of the puzzles, the level designs and the text communication alone make it note worthy. Pony Island as a whole is magnificent and shows incredibly unique ideas put together insanely well. When something like this, running on such simple mechanics can set an atmosphere so well, it raises the bar for many other games to do the same.

Also! Passcodes to keep tucked away until needed; Baphomet and 2023

Graphics: The look of it makes it feel like a genuine ported arcade game. It's pixely, it's box-like, it's all kinds of good while been fairly simplistic.

Menus: Broken because of Satan.

Soundtrack: This goes from being an eerie and abrasive glitchy, retro, electronic style base for the tension and horror-ish atmosphere and then completely flips a coin to be colorful, cute and innocent with its uncomfortably cheerful electronic notes. The changes in this set the scene and is yet another thing that makes this game so unique, it's unlike anything you've heard before.

Final Conclusion: Get this. Seriously. It's rare that games can really spice things up with something new. With that been said, unique ideas are one thing, but it's the fact that they are brought together well that makes Pony Island stand above the rest. It keeps you thinking, provides great atmosphere, keeps you on your toes and has so much hidden content perfect for those willing to look for it.

Pony Island
> It is not a game about ponies

Well DUH, it's about unicorns. Should've just call it Unicorn Island or whatever.

Still a good game, though.


Pony Island
Pony Island is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible, just know the game is about a couple hours long to beat normally, there's hidden collectibles that unlock the true ending, the base gameplay is a Runner-type of game with a few twists, and it plays with the idea of game development.

Now slight spoilers ahead, but I'll try to avoid any major spoilers, just things you could figure out from the first 30 minutes of play.

The idea of a 'corrupted' video game is not an original idea at this point, but this may be the best it's been executed thus far. Pony Island has you playing a corrupted Runner-type game starring a Pony, and the game at various points wants you to stop to Insert Your Soul

Pony Island
This game is really quite a gem.

I picked it up on a whim at full price because it looked mildly interesting from the screenshots. However, what I discovered underneath the poorly-coded pony facade was something else. Something sinister.

The atmosphere that this game creates is definitley uneasy. The music is top notch and reminiscent of the games of old and the attention to detail really stands out.

The developer did a superb job making the machine feel like its own independent entity. I found myself staring blankly into the computer screen at times just watching, waiting for it to reach out to me.

Would sell soul for 3d graphics. 666/10

Don't read anything about Pony Island. Just buy Pony Island and have a fun evening.

Pony Island
TL;DR: 4/5 score. Neat story, interesting puzzles and elements. Great music. Got $5? Worth.

You start up the game and immediately are confused by the title screen. So you took action and begin playing the game. You play as a happy little pony, where you are galloping across the field and jump past the fences, in hopes to beat the game, only to find out that something is wrong with this game called 'Pony Island'.

It's hard to give a good review of this game without spoiling what it really is about. That being said, I would advise to go in blind (no playthroughs/walkthroughs), as you will find to be more satisfied of the game but I'll try my best to make it short and sweet while not including spoilers in here.

The game isn't really scary (except maybe for some that were really looking for a 'pony adventure' game) but the 'psychological horror genre fits, as it does makes you think. The game isn't very long, I would say that the average one would need to complete the game would be around 2 hours. However, it makes up for it by introducing neat new elements as you progress, like 4th wall breaking interactions, new puzzle elements, and more interesting secrets to discover.

All in all, I think this is one of those indie games that stands out and for the right reasons. Good story, interesting gameplay, good music (at least I personally think so), and cool game elements. The game doesn't cost very much, so I would say that it's very much worth for the price.

Pony Island
A unique experience. You don't play Pony Island, Pony Island plays you.

I don't want to say too much about it, but this game absolutely blew me away. Full of constant surprises, very atmospheric, and left me unsettled even after finishing it. It's only $5, and that's $5 well spent. Just buy it and play it. The experience is well worth the price.

4th wall breaking simulator

Pony Island
When the devil comes to gaming, it will not be under the banner of pentagrams, demons and blood. It will be in the guise... of a pony.

After repeatedly having to fix the arcade machine that houses PONY ISLAND's game-within-a-game by re-routing code and battling mysteriously uncooperative menus, you will be faced with a monochrome fence jumping simulator designed by the Devil himself to keep you in a Matrix-style state of placidity while he attempts to harvest your soul.

If that opening spiel seems simultaneously baffling, disturbing and blackly humorous then I have succeeded in communicating the beautiful madness of Pony Island's struggle to escape an almost perfect trap; as soon as you start to succeed at the game, your unholy adversary changes the rules by bombarding you with unkillable demons, reinventing his tedious jumping simulator as a full-fledged adventure game or unleashing his vicious lieutenants upon you, at least one of which is genuinely unnerving.

While it has a tendency to overplay a few of its puzzles, the astonishing imagination, wit and variety you'll encounter in Pony Island make it nothing short of an essential part of 2016's library.

Pony Island is a unique and eerie experience.

The game starts off with you trying to play Pony Island". The start button doesn't work

Pony Island
I won't get into too much details, because this game is more about exploring and finding things out for yourself than anything else. It is indeed a puzzle game in disguise, with some arcade/action parts.

Long story short:
* Saw it on Steam, thought Meh

Pony Island
Best $5 game I have played

666/10

Pony Island
I've just finished this, and I'm still questioning what's real and what's not - that's not meant to be a funny joke, it really messed with my head. Buy it!

Pony Island
I literally cannot write a good enough review for this game.
Words cannot fathom the enjoyment I received from it. I finished it in a little over 2 hours and have been waiting to go back and play. I really just wanted to create a positive recommendation for this for anyone who hasn't experienced it. Don't watch and game play videos, or read anything about it...it'll all just spoil the fun.

Just buy it, and play it.
I can't recommend this enough.

I wish the ending were a bit more enjoyable, but the game is great overall especially when NO I'M NOT GOING TO SPOIL IT FOR YOU. JUST GO PLAY IT! :-)

Pony Island
Has anyone seen my soul? I lost it somewhere and can't find it.

Not what I was expecting at all. And that's great feeling! Like you suddenly entered a good trap.

UPD: I'm still not sure if I really closed the game. I even uninstalled it, but still not sure.

Need for Speed: Shift
An excellent balancing act between arcade racing and simulated driving, with shudderingly fast cars. I'm addicted to it!

Need for Speed: Shift
daily reminder that matte black paint and bronze rims will make your car go faster no matter what

Need for Speed: Shift
Pros :
-Nice graphics
-Cars are detailed af
-Tons of car choice
-British guy in tutioral and later
-Tries to be a a real racing game but with finally a good handling and succeds
-Soundtrack


Cons :
-NFS never should have been a real racing game
-NPCs are 
- line
-If you alt tab or something puts the game down there, the whole game closes itself



This game is an actual lie, I have a brand new BMW and can't get a girlfriend -1/10

Need for Speed: Shift
A good balance between a racing sim and arcade. Need for Speed Shift is all about racing on a racetrack, and fighting through the pack to place in the Top 3. There is also drift mode, where you score the most combined points in three rounds to win. The driving physics are decent, not too bad, but not great either. There are a good selection of cars that you can own (although it sucks that you can only buy 1 unit of each car) and a range of real world tracks (Nurburgring, Spa, Silverstone, etc.). Those make a pretty good legal racing game.

The annoying thing is cheap AI in car battle mode, especially in Autopolis GP. They can just tackle a tight hairpin (turn 4) at 100+ km/h without understeering... Also, there are some unfair car battle matchups, when 1 car is a lot faster than the other (Audi R8 vs Aston Martin V8 Vantage for example) and no matter how good your driving is, you'll still lose in the slower car (unless you play dirty).

Overall, it is still a good racing game to play if you are looking for a mixture of simulation and arcadey style of racing.

Need for Speed: Shift
Awesome graphics and visuals, detailed 3D cockpits, a bunch of cars and amazing car and engine sounds.

Need for Speed: Shift
This isn't really necessarily a review, but more of a comment between Shift 1 and Shift 2.

I honestly prefer this other than Shift 2 probably because they don't try so hard to be a racing simulator. This game is a mixture of a racing arcade/simulator. Shift 2's racing and flow was just not up to par with this. The racing in this game it actually FEELS really good. The cars look beautiful. The cockpit even more beautiful. If you're not satisfied with a car or part you've just bought you can just SELL it and get every single cent you've put in that car. UNLIKE Shift 2. Oh yeah, that reminds me too, money in this game isn't hard to get. You can get a nice amount each race if you know what you're doing. They even give you cash for custom/free races that you setup yourself. And the fact that you can get a 100% refund for your fully customized car feels good. I don't have to worry about wasting my time putting blood and sweat into a car that I probably can't use 60% of the time due to tiers and specialized events. The engines, transmission, skidding etc all sound amazing in this game.

The customization is pretty in-depth giving you the option to go up a tier if you have all of your tiers vehicle enhancements. Which is AMAZING because you get to bring your favorite vehicle to more races. What saddens me is that the game doesn't have any night races or courses. Well, at least from what I've seen. This game also encourages ramming and playing clean. You get points which gives you bonus money and experience for playing either aggressive or clean. Yeah, pretty ing ironic mainly because in Shift 2 they try to act like the game also encourages ramming with their spectacular Shift 2 announcement trailer. (No really. I really loved Shift 2's trailer. It was amazing.) But really you couldn't do none of that ramming  in Shift 2 without crashing your  into a guard rail. I'm not a Shift 2 hater at all. I actually do like it and think Slightly Mad Studios did a good job with it. Especially with the head-cam which I wish this game had, but it's just that this game is better in many other aspects and ways than Shift 2. I also like the in-game trailers showing off each type of race event in this game. The music in this game is good  too.

The AI in this game aren't really that hard to handle. I haven't really tried max difficulty to know though. Also the replay camera in this game is INCREDIBLE. It really gets you into the spot when you see yourself in a TV like position racing across the screen. I think this game has the best replay camera for any racing game I've seen.....Well, maybe not better than Assetto Corsa's replay camera. I think it's because the sense of speed on camera is set perfectly to make you feel like you're actually watching someone race. But yeah, overall. The game is totally worth it. You won't regret it. Also, don't think I was talking down Shift 2. I just think this game is just superior to its sequel in many ways.

Need for Speed: Shift
Physics is very questionable.  The cars bounce like low riders for no particular reason.  The steering is also very twitchy.  I have gone through all the adjustments to try and fix this but it just can't be dialed in quite as good as Codemaster games.

You can say that the AI cheats.  Cheating is when you don't play by the rules for the purpose of winning.  That is what I noticed.  You have to follow a very specific driving line in order for you to make it through a corner.  The tighter and faster you go, obviously you would understeer and slam into the wall.  Well the AI does not do that.  The AI will also swerve left and right while making a tight turn to block you from passing.  Then there is the collision system.  The AI can slam into you and you are then taken off the road and it would take you quite a while to get back on the road.  You would have lost several seconds and would probably cost you the race.  Now if you decide to pit the AI cars, it won't have any effect on them.  They will not slow down.  In fact they would retain the same speed and jump back on track half a second later.  It is such bull crap.

I'm not really that bitter since the game only cost me what a nice sandwich would.

If you want realism, stick with Codemaster racing games.  This is a minimally decent attempt at simulation.  But the Need For Speed series should just stick to arcade style racing.

Need for Speed: Shift
Fun arcade racing game with tiny dabs of realism. I have no idea why it's marketed as a racing sim because it's really not. The physics are a little wonky and the bloodthirsty AI are liable to  the bed and turn any race into some Wacky Races t. I've played Namco racers more realistic than this.

Buy a god machine GT-R and win all the races to make Nakamura proud.

Need for Speed: Shift
A Need for Speed game set on circuits rather than streets.

Need for Speed: Shift is a somewhat okay racing game aimed mostly at the people who prefer sitting back with a controller just driving some fast cars around fast tracks with all assists turned on. I can imagine it does a pretty good job at that.

But if you jump into it expecting something more, you're in for a big disappointment. I wouldn't even go as far as calling it a mix of an arcade and a simulator because it's a pure arcade which stays true to the Need for Speed name. The game revolves around ramming into each other, the AI is bad and so are the physics, the controls are poor all the way from the menu to the game itself and the unnecessary blurry speed effects and the deep voice-over about how you're a totally cool driver now don't really save this title - only make it more cringeworthy.

Now I'm not trying to make it look as bad as possible. The game is all good as an arcade, is pretty nice to look at, there's a lot of cars to pick from and you can customise them to a certain degree. And obviously I would be stupid to expect realism from a Need for Speed title. I just don't think it deserves to be promoted as a simulation experience.

Need for Speed: Shift
I bought this, on sale, as i enjoy racing games though i didnt have any on PC. I Chose this one for a number of reasons. First of all, i used to play some sort of Need For Speed on PlayStation 2 and it was my favorite game. I also bought it for the system requirements. It runs flawlessly on my laptop (A10, 8GB) and im yet to test it on my media PC (A4, 4GB).

The game is fun; it makes you want to keep on playing. It's just one of them games you could play for hours. The graphics are great especially for a game this age. Of corse it's not the most recent Forsa but in my oppinion the graphics are perfectly fine. There is plenty to do in the story mode, i have yet to try multi-player.

One minor complaint: the controles on keyboard and mouse are just not that good. This is the case for ALL racing games, not just this one. I would reccomend picking up a controller if you dont already have one, it makes a huge difference!

Need for Speed: Shift
Need For Speed Shift is one of my favorite racing simulators.
Pretty Graphics
Many Cars
Good Driving
Fine-Tuning
Nice Soundtrack
Leveling

This game is amazing!

Need for Speed: Shift
By far, this is one of the most realistic racing games I have ever played.

Although the physics at drifting events are weird, this game overall presents itself in the best shape with a good amount of cars, awesome graphics, good sound quality and solid physics.

With a controller, this game is much more fun than playing it with the keyboard, and definitely gives you the feeling of actually driving the car! It's definitely an experience to be done.


Or tl;dr:
CRASH BANG BOOM WON THE RACE

Need for Speed: Shift
nice game.
nice griphics, LOTS of cars, lots of tracks, nice effects... I like this game

there are some annoying UI things, annoying intros" but that is minor.
I have some problems with drifting (at G25 wheel) which was easier on keyboard.

thing is

Need for Speed: Shift
I didn't think I'd like this since i'm such a fan of the street racing in the first 2 NFS games specifically 2, But this was incredibly fun, ran fine, looks great, plays great *with a controller since that's what i used*. 9/10 would bang

Need for Speed: Shift
For a 2009 title Shift holds up incredibly well. It both runs and looks fantastic on Windows 10. It offers up quite a lot of gameplay for the price, with a nice array of cars and tracks, all constructed to the highest level of detail possible at the time. Gameplay is fun and fast-paced, but don't believe the marketing. It is an arcade racer through and through, not a sim. Career mode progression also relies on an inferior and clunky arcade style unlock system, where you are forced to earn stars to unlock future events with some fairly ridiculous side objectives (spin-out 4 opponents) forced upon the player. Overall Shift is a really solid arcade racer, if you accept it as such, you'll have a good time, but if you expect this to be a sim, you will be sorely disappointed.

Here is my full in-depth review
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnR7ftTzHuU

Need for Speed: Shift
Easier to play than GRID but still a pretty difficult game. Probably the only NFS series that isn't arcade style racing and also one of the hardest NFS games there is. I have a lot of difficulty getting anywhere in this game but I'm not used to controls that arent arcade-like. THe customization of your car in this game is pretty good and it's deffinately a fun game to play.

Need for Speed: Shift
i misbought this game. installed it with the lowest expectation there ever was. and then when i played it (again,with the lowest expectation), i found this game is great. not perfect,but great. graphics are great. the cars are great. and i love the sounds in this game. loud. that's what i want in a racing game. i played it with a gamepad,which is a great way to play this game. so anyhoo,7/10.

Need for Speed: Shift
Summary.
A bad balance between realism and arcade.

The Good.
Great graphics.
Fun for the first few hours.


The Bad.

Menu with a controller is extremely clunky.
Because, unlike other NFS games, SHIFT doesn't bother to change menu buttons, like 7"

Need for Speed: Shift
Need For Speed is one of my favorite Need For Speeds. It has the customization that we all love. You may be able to only use body kits of 2 or 3, but the custom vinyls make up for it. You can buy custom performance packages for your car, and rims you probably have never even heard of! The tuning is amazing. You can turn your 425 HP 1969 Dodge Charger R/T into a 625 HP Charger that can drift with traction control on without the drift gamemode on. It has multiple controllers that this game supports. Everything from Logitech Wheels from a few years ago, to wheels from over 10 years ago. The graphics are amazing for the game, even though it was made in 2008 or 9. The sounds for the cars are not that bad for the year this game was made too ! Its not as bad as need for speed hot pursuit. I guess you can say this is the best need for speed that was made before criterion came in and decided to screw up everything with need for speed. Buy this game, and you wont regret it.

Need for Speed: Shift
Pretty nice game, tunning wasn't that nice but races are really great!

Need for Speed: Shift
not a fan miss the days of nfs underground


Need for Speed: Shift
Slightly Mad Studios ! Enought ?!

Need for Speed: Shift
I don't know why they call it shift, I can't figure out how to get a car with standard transmission.

Need for Speed: Shift
Different to any other NFS that I have ever played, more like Forza or GT.

Need for Speed: Shift
Awesome :3 very fun game

Need for Speed: Shift
Are you a forza fan who has sold lost lent or broken their xbox, look no further.
need for speed thift is the perfect alternative to the popular franchise forza motor sport considering the need for speed franchisehas become stale this was a more that welcome sight to our sore eyes need for speed shift adds alot of fun and interesting play mechanics to the game with simulated head movement as you drive makeing you feel evey turn bump and skip as you go this game is truly worth playing
i give this game a confident rating of 7.1

Need for Speed: Shift
Super addictive RPG style with awesome gameplay, physics and beautiful visuals ... 2nd installment is great as well :)

Need for Speed: Shift
This is a wonderful racing simulation for all ages. You can make it about as easy or hard as you want. well worth picking up.

Need for Speed: Shift
Shift is in my opinion the best racing simulation on the market. The original still looks good, and holds up well as an addition to Shift 2. I actually think I prefer Shift 1 to 2, but if you've played one you know the other. Both have very similar physics engines and feels. I love the integration of corner mastering too. The works upgrades make your favorite Tier 1 & 2 cars into powerhouses which lets you compete even an RX-8 well into the game - it's a well-balanced idea. Drift mode initially struck me as virtually impossible, but returning to the game a second time, it's actually quite a lot of fun (I recommend a Works'd RX-7 or, of course, the AE86). The game, in my opinion, has a greater depth than Forza, for example, and I'd even recommend Shift highly to someone with a 360/PS3.

Need for Speed: Shift
Great game, a lot more realistic than previous need for speed titles. Maybe thats why it didnt do as well with their fanbase?

Need for Speed: Shift
This game is great. The car handling, the visuals, the difficulty are spectacular. The opponents are not nearly as retrded as they tend to be in most racing games and actually provide a challenge. However, it has one major flaw. The NFS World tour (final tour) is unlocked midway through the game. With only 8 hours on the game I beat the tour, with half the events were still not done. But after the final tour is beat the temptation to grind the rest of the races is just not there. So I only got 9 hours out of this game. Still, it was very enjoyable. The unlocking system is flaud, but only a minor issue. If you're gonna get it - play all events first :)

Need for Speed: Shift
Best Need for speed game out there, excluding of course the good old days of Hot Pursuit 2, Carbon etc. Great combination of sim and arcade, buy this over SHIFT 2 if you have the choice!

Need for Speed: Shift
Great game! Realistic and fun to play! Much better than shift 2 in both graphics and gameplay!

Need for Speed: Shift
this is a pretty good game. the graphics are impressive and the game runs amazingly smooth even with my slower PC. the game also seems to be very responsive with the key board (which i have to resort to sence my steering set up is curently not functional at the moment.). the game has a fairly unique system for the Ai (at least at the time) and the enviroments, sounds, and so on really throw you into the racing expirience. the game does have a bit of issues like all the cars look like they are on ice in the 3rd peson view or chase cam and the Ai in the later teirs will end up hiting your car quite a bit. this game hasn't aged in the graphics or anything for that matter. this is just an amazingly uniqe game and i recomend you at least give it a go.

Need for Speed: Shift
it has cars and stuff.
it's pretty fun.
buy it I guess.

Need for Speed: Shift
My first racing game I have ever owned. I hugely recommend this. The handling is great, sounds are realistic and AI will give you hell sometimes. Solid 8/10.

Need for Speed: Shift
If you like having a huge dead spot in your steering, that you can't get rid of, this game is for you. Personally, I like a nice tight wheel. Like all of the rest of this series, this one is also next to impossible to control. Especially with a force feedback wheel. The only one in the series, that was half way decent, was the original. Every one since has had a lacklustre handling profile that takes any actual fun that might be had, and makes it a chore just to keep your vehicle going straight, or turning into corners, when you turn your wheel.

My suggestion is to save your money and buy something that IS NOT produced by EA Games. Remembering how responsive the original NFS was, this is a huge disappointment.

Need for Speed: Shift
Need For Speed: Shift is one of my favorite Need For Speeds. It has the customization that we all love. You may be able to only use body kits of 2 or 3, but the custom vinyls make up for it. You can buy custom performance packages for your car, and rims you probably have never even heard of! The tuning is amazing. You can turn your 425 HP 1969 Dodge Charger R/T into a 625 HP Charger that can drift with traction control on without the drift gamemode on, you can try to race in Bugatti Veyron or Zonda Pagani R, which are one of the best and expensive cars. The graphics are amazing for the game, even though it was made in 2008 or 9. The sounds for the cars are not that bad for the year this game was made too ! Its not as bad as need for speed hot pursuit. I guess you can say this is the best need for speed that was made before criterion came in and decided to screw up everything with Need for Speed. Buy this game, and you wont regret it.

Need for Speed: Shift
I honestly can't recommend this game. In the beginning I was enjoying it but the time exposes the weak gameplay and campaign.

Starting with the principal, I didn't like the gameplay, cars behave strangely and even by customizing options of difficulty and assistance I couldn't find a better way to get used to the drive mechanics and physics. The campaign started promising but became frustrating, there are a few extra goals that are impossible or don't make sense, and thus those who like to leave the game complete is frustrating, win races isn't enough, by the time I gave up and I just collect the stars needed to get to the last level and beat the game.

I positively highlight the licenses, there is a wide variety of vehicles and good circuits, although because of the gameplay and frustration with the campaign I could not fully enjoy this aspect.

I also emphasize that it's impossible to play on the keyboard, joystick or steering wheel is highly required.

6/10

Need for Speed: Shift
Better than GT 5.

Need for Speed: Shift
One of the only Need for Speed games that is still playable to date.

Need for Speed: Shift
This game blows my mind! Totally amazing and I have only just started playing it. Addicted.

Recommend it to anyone that wants a car racing simulator for PC, you can't go past this.

5 Stars!

Need for Speed: Shift
Better than GT 5.

Need for Speed: Shift
Pretty good if you want something realistic with nice cars, pretty bad if you want to wreck other cars or customize your own cars.

Need for Speed: Shift
Some of the worst physics I have ever experienced in a racing game. The series turned to garbage as soon as EA turned it over to new developers. There are much better racing games available for the same price or less.

Need for Speed: Shift
This is not your typical arcade racing NFS game, as it's about Circuit Racing.  It does not involve carnage across a city map, while being pursued by the Police, or jumping ten city blocks literally and making it without even a scratch.   With all the Driving Assists turned off, it is a real challenge to keep your car on the road.  This game is a brutal and solid racing car simulator. It will either make you throw your steering wheel in frustration, or you will never have this much fun again  once you get it right!  Most who play this game though, will probably be the former and not the latter  it's challenging.  NFS Shift is something special and is definitely worth having.

Need for Speed: Shift
I can recommend this game for anyone who enjoys:
* Amazingly  music!
* Headache inducing cutscenes that's unskippable! (Yes, they are loading screens, but they don't have to be so annoying, now do they?)
* Boring maps and gameplay!
* Griefing and cheating random gamers if you decide to go public!
Blown away by such aspects? Be my guest ;)

Need for Speed: Shift
This Game is freaking amazing, reminds me of forza motorsport of the xbox 360 & some gran turismo qualities.
This is NOT a TRUE racing sim YET"

Need for Speed: Shift
It is a lot of fun. Wish more people would play it!!!

Need for Speed: Shift
This is EA's attempt to copy grid basically.

Early Access Review

UPDATE:

Adding random generated dungeon did not saved this game.

The controls are still a pain in the , and most of the time, the maps are ridiculous. And since most of the time you will die for stupid reason, the absence of checkpoints makes the game even more frustrating then it was before.

This game is just a mess. I don't see how can somebody save it.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:

I wish I could Imagine a better game..

Imagine me is just one simple platformer. The concept looks nice I guess, but there aren't any interesting new gameplay elements. This makes the game flat.

The art style probably is the only good thing from this game. It's not new or mind-blowing, but looks neat at least.

Everything else is a huge mess: the controls are super weird, you never understand when you're gonna jump high or when you're gonna jump IN THE HEIGHT YOU WANT.
The levels are super easy. Really, no effort. Looks like a flash game from the early 2000s.

9 for this is a scam. I only have it 'cause I got a free steam key for it. And I beat all the levels in less than 20 minutes.
For now, don't bother spending on it even on a big sale. Wait to see if the game gets any better with the time.

Final Rating: 3/10

It has nothing to offer. Literally nothing. Except tons of achievement for just opening the game.

Imagine Me
Honestly, not much to see here. Run of the mill graphics, one weapon, 2 enemies. Random level generation, which in this case was a bad idea. PIts that lead to no where, locked doors leading to dead ends, and areas where suicide is the only way out.

Not worth it at full price. If you see it at 75% or 90% off however, its an easy game to 100%.

Its a shame too, as the dev seems cheery, responsive, and they do fix the bugs. Problem is, the game just isnt that good.

Imagine Me
From a somewhat decent little platformer, Imagine Me fell to a plain mediocre game.
Back one year ago, this game had pre-defined levels that were fun to play just to pass time. Now it has some badly designed generated levels. I often found myself playing the same level and it gets boring very easily.
I'd suggest the devs go back to the previous stage of the game and improve it.

Pros:+ The Challenge levels are pre-defined and were fun to play; it took me a short while to complete them all, but they weren't that bad;

Cons:- Generated repetitive levels, gets boring in a short while;
-Lacks initiative, there are only 2 types of enemies, 2 types of traps and 1 weapon;
-Boss levels are random aswell, many people complained that they had to play dozens of stages to finally reach a boss area;
-More soundtracks were welcome..

Conclusion:
I would recommend Imagine Me only if you really can't afford any other platformer out there. Even then, you would probably put it away soon. The gameplay lacks many features and I see no real reason to replay the game after you have finished it.

Personal rating: 30/100 - Awful

Imagine Me
It's probably the worst game I have ever played. I'm not talking about graphics and so on. The worst part is gameplay and levels' design. Challenges did not improve this game. They made it even worse.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

This isn't a game. It's a game engine test at best and the game engine is not good. The 'physics' are horrible making the very basic controls feel really off. The level design is absolutely generic with nothing that holds your attention. Same goes for the graphical presentation. This is what gives early access a bad name. Exactly this. Please do yourself a favour and avoid this 'game'.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I highly recommend avoiding this game. I got it for free from Alienware Arena and 100%-ed it in about 15 minutes or so. I spent another 5 minutes recording a video about why you shouldn't buy it. I'm actually a little annoyed that it will now show up forever in my game library. The ONLY reason I can see buying this game is at 95% off to get an easy 100% completed game. That's it.

Imagine Me
Imagine Me is agitated by its own existence. It cant decide where to commit, patching on modes of play like a bad worker trying to explain their way out of a botched job by showing you all the little, trivial tasks theyve completed instead. Right out of the gate Imagine Me tries its hand at procedurally generated level designs (it cant be that hard, right? Everyones doing it). But once the algorithms start rolling and the levels actually come into existence, its immediately clear Imagine Me hasnt the slightest clue what its doing.

Chunks of familiar levels become hastily adjoined to one another into an unplayable mess of broken hitboxes and impenetrable block mazes. Its chaos of the highest degree, silent caverns filled only with the cries of my broken soul as I beat myself against a metaphorical wall trying to beat a game which is quite literally impossible to complete. Somewhere along the development pipeline it must have been clear that something had gone horrible wrong, but rather than rework the disastrous level generator into something functional, Imagine Me instead decides to abandon it altogether and starts building levels by hand (it worked for Mario, didnt it?).

But much to my dismay Imagine Me hasnt much of a knack for level designs, random or otherwise. At numerous points it almost appears as if whoever actually designed these levels fell asleep and never completed them, or otherwise became so bored with their own creation that they decided enough was enough and shipped whatever they had in front of them at the time. And thus we are left with 30 or so astoundingly dull and simplistic levels which play very much like the afterthought they were.

I might feel worse about the depths of Imagine Mes failure if it didnt seem so apathetic toward aspiring to even moderate quality (or functionality). Everything feels empty and tedious, leading you in circles until either the game breaks or you stop playing. Imagine Me is sloppy and dysfunctional, but I couldnt say it seems to actually care.

You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Imagine Me
I really wanted to like this game, because the dev seems like such a great person, but the game itself isn't very good.

The game is constantly updating, which shows that the dev is working on making this a better game, but there are some bugs that make this not so much a great game. Controls feel generally bad, since there is a lot of random generation there are some poorly placed blocks (For example, a lock on a wall that leads to nowhere) Also, the campaign doesn't save, so when I Alt+Tabbed, the game crashed and I couldn't be bothered to start again from the beginning. Only 2 kinds of enemies and the boss is incredibly easy.

On the plus side, the game is an easy 100% if you're an achievement hunter.

Since the dev is working on the game a lot, I hope that I'll be able to switch this to a reccommended eventually, but for now I can't reccommend it.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I sincerely hope the creators of this game are at 10% completion, because that was really REALLY underwhelming. This is basically an easy-mode platformer with spikes and trampolines. That's basically it. I was excited to see portals and crates... but they didn't add any mechanic to the game worth mentioning. The boxes are pushable. Woohoo. I beat the entire game in about 10 minutes, and spent another 10 trying to figure out if there were any secrets or achievements hidden somehow, somewhere. Nope.

Be sure to read the memories, they add a story" to the game. [SPOILERS: You were a kid

Imagine Me
Imagine Me not having wasted my time.

This WAS good. Before the revamp, it was a fun little game with awesome devs. Now with it finally being released with a massive overhaul, it sadly stinks.
-Iffy controls
-Buggy hitboxes
-Random level generation (to the point that it is not completable)

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

This is not a good game.  Like many people, I got it in a bundle, so no real loss there, but if you are considering paying ten dollars for this, don't.  It's an amazing game for maybe a grade school student to make in their spare time, but has no business asking for money on Steam.  I really don't feel moved to rate games that often, only if I really enjoyed the game, or if it was so bad I feel the need to warn people, as if I'm being thoughtful or noble, but really, I just want help prevent games this bad from making money, so that people stop making games this bad.  Maybe it's hypocritical of me, being one of those people who buy bundles of crap just so my library looks swollen and engorged with gaming goodness, verily dripping fun, but two bucks for ten games at least gives me a fighting chance of finding something cool I never would have seen otherwise, whereas ten bucks for one game with a slew of negative reviews would be madness.  Madness, I say, and you are not mad are you?  I thought not.

Imagine Me
UPDATE:Wow. Decided to give this another try now that it's been released and somehow it got worse. The d-pad still doesn't work, which only exacerbates the problems with the new level design. The levels are extremely frustrating with lots of tight death traps to maneuver, and the imprecision of your movement makes this almost impossible. Try to do the same thing and you'll get a different outcome. It's almost like it's a response to the dearth of content in the original Early Access offering, by just stretching out the gameplay. I don't know how much content is there yet, but it's worse than what was there before.

It's also more about exploring than platforming skill, featuring large levels with items to pick up, but it doesn't really give you much incentive to do so. You can pick up keys to unlock boxes that don't hold anything or get in your way. Arrows can destroy some blocks, but usually you don't need to do that to progress. There's just no point to it, none of the platforming is fun, and I gave up after 20 minutes. I might give it another go later and try to blaze through it and update this review again or even rewrite it entirely, but wow, was not expecting to come away this underwhelmed at the full release. At least the price came down.

Original review:This is one Early Access game you should avoid, at least for the time being. The content in the game currently lasts all of 15 minutes, and none of it is any good. There are far better platformers out there with far fewer flaws.

First of all, one of my pet peeves surfaces in this game: it doesn't recognize the d-pad. For a platformer that specifically tells you to use a controller every time the game loads, this is borderline unforgivable. The platforming itself feels boring and uninspired, consisting of short levels with not much to do in them. Sometimes the jump decides it isn't going to jump today. The timing on getting a boosted jump from springs feels similarly capricious. The random level generator usually spits out unplayable garbage, and the actually developer-designed levels are so sparse as to barely be worth mentioning. The level select resets to the first level every time instead of automatically moving to the newly unlocked level, which is a minor annoyance.

In its current state, there is nothing that should compel you to spend $10 on this game. In fact, if you wait you'll actually get a better price, unlike most Early Access games which offer you a discount to encourage you to buy an incomplete product:
The price will be lower outside of Early Access. The game is currently priced higher. This is so no one buys the game without reading a little bit about it."

Don't spend money on this game right now

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I got this game through a bundle, otherwise I don't recommend spending money on it, yet.
What you see is what you get. Looks and feels like programmed in an 48h programming contest.
The music is nice, true... and a nice story.

But from the game mechanics perspective it's just a copy of a copy ... With a level design like this you can browse steam and will find lots of quality platformer much more worth the dime.
So far no fun :(

Imagine Me
The moment I started playing this game, I knew something was wrong. I went to look at the controls, and the screen came up behind the level I was on. THIS GAME IS CANCER. DO NOT BUY/PLAY.

Everything about this game screams 'baby's first programming attempt'. The game relies solely on randomly generated levels, which often contain impossible jumps and walled-off spikes, and offers little more gameplay than jumping (of which you can double-jump, but ONLY if you jump first - no fall-jumping) and shooting blocks to get to the end of a map. Enemies are little more than moving dangers - one hit of which will send you back to the beginning. Becareful of projectiles too, as hitting one (which kills you) will cause it to remain floating in the air, making some maps impossible to complete (as the stationary object will still kill you on touch).

I say this not out of spite - I know everybody has to start somewhere - but you can find better games for free on flash sites. Paying for this game would be a waste of any money. I can't remember how this came to be in my library - possibly by a Humble Bundle - but be assured that after this single sitting, I have no reason to ever come back to this poor excuse of a game.

EDIT 1: I finally made it to a level that was literally impossible to reach the end of. Luckily the developer foresaw this and gives you a 'regenerate' button on the menu. Known your generation system is that flaw to put a failsafe in is quite something. Oh, and I hope you like the first three bosses, because you'll be seeing them again.

EDIT 2: Having played two hours and 8 bosses worth of levels, the story (a scentence between levels) just loops, with no ending or purpose. They might as well be blank loading screens, as there is no payoff, no cohesive story, and NO END TO THE GAME. This is nothing but a worseless, waste of time. Yes there are challenge levels, they're nearly impossible to do.

This game is randomly generated. Infinitely long. Handles like . Campaign is too easy. Challenges are too hard. There are three enemy-types, which all might as well just be moving spikes. I have seen better games for free on Newgrounds, so do yourself a favour and give this a wide berth.

According to Steam, I have only played the game for 15 minutes. That sounds about right. During that 15 minutes I have played through the entirety of the game. I then quit, while scratching my head and asking myself What am I missing? There has to be something I'm overlooking here." After a little investigating it is clear that I did not miss anything

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

It's bad enough to come off as a lame way for someone to trick people into giving them money for something that is very broken. How hard it is to screw up basic platformer controls? I can't make games but I've managed to get righter controls from doing a tutorial for Game Maker that I never finished becuase I got lost from version differences.

I'll add some reasons why this is bad.

I've played a lot of platformers since the NES days. I love platformers. I'm not sure what this qualifies as. It seems extremely broken. Slightly touch the Right direction and you slide extremely fast to the right...right into a block...which kills you because there is a spike above it. Yes, above it. The hit boxes are so off. You die from spikes when you haven't even come into contact with them. You touch a block that has a spike above it, dead.

Something seems terribly wrong with the friction settings too. You completely stop moving when you come into contact with a wall. One might try to hide this problem by calling it a wall grab or something similar. A feature? LIsten, I know wall grabs from the many games that pull it off. This is not a wall grab.

Dev, if you used Game Maker for this, at least finish the tutorials on how to make a simple platformer.

I really hate to use such harsh judgements on a game, especially early access. But This game does not even seem to have the basic foundational mechanics working enough to be fun. That would seem to me to be much more important that getting a random level generator working, or spooky sound design, or story. Get the dang game working at least up to par with some oldschool Atari titles before passing it along to public.

I will gladly change my opinion of this game if the changes between now and completion are drastic enough in a good way. RIght now they would need to be extremely drastic at best.

I would never discourage one from getting into game dev and creating something fun to play. By all means make it fun. Have fun doing it. But when you get it released on Steam as Early Access for $9.99 in the currect state it is in it kind of feels like a slap in the face. I cannot recommend this unless I was trying to prank someone out of $10. (which I would never do)

P.S. It's really late and I haven't slept in ages. It's possible I'm over reacting and lacking in my ability to filter the harshness. But please put some effort into making this game actually playable and fun.

P.S.S. At least this game has a pretty title screen.

Imagine Me
The title screen and pleasant soundtrack were quite misleading. Incomplete looking graphics, controls that are barely functional, random dungeons that are completely illogical, unforgiving glitchy hit detection. This was all within 10 minutes. I don't know how this was considered finished.

Twelve minutes of playtime on this game and I've finished the ridiculously easy 'challenge' levels, played with the random dungeon feature which needs a lot of work, and created a 'memory' which isn't explained in the game but could be built into something interesting in the future.

As of right now, even for an early-access game, this isn't worth anyone's time.

- That's about it.

The baddies:
- This may not be correct, but the singleplayer had 9 levels, I think, and they're all too easy.
- In the store page, it says something about beat the levels any way you want". It's true but it's not right. At all.

Early Access Review

So I got this game for free from Alienware. The game in its current state is not worth 9.99 USD in 0.3 hours I completed all the challenge maps and got all the achievements. There are only 8 achievements and I got 2 within the first 30 sec of playing. There is random dungeon mode where as the name says, it will generate a random dungeon but really the game just feels lacking for it to hold your interest. It has potential to be a decent platformer and it is still early access but as it currently stands, the game is not worth the price. I'm only giving a thumbs down due to lack of content, really easy achievements, and the 9.99 price tag.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

This is probably the blandest platformer I have ever played. All levels fit on one screen, and objects are limited to blocks, spikes, springs, and occasionally a key. Gameplay does not vary at all between levels, and there aren't very many of them. The game also features a random level generator which spits out garbage that often is either impossible, or can be won by running to the right and jumping over one pit. The controls are bad, with it being difficult to guage the time you need to jump to bounce high off a spring, especially after they start sinking into the ground after you bounce on them a few times. The stats are completely broken, with the game awarding my the 50 deaths and 100 deaths achievements the first time I died, and the 1000 deaths achievement a few deaths, and less than a minute later. The game requires you to upload something to the workshop for one of the achievements, so expect the workshop to be flooded with garbage from people who just want the achievement.

I can't possibly recommend this unless you get it as part of a bundle, or it is less than $1, and you want easy achievements.

Imagine Me
So...I wanted to go through my Steam library to play games I had yet to play.
Well, I'm glad I went to this game first because I'm no longer going to play this game again.

I've made a few games for fun back in the days, self-taught. They were far better than this game. My games were simple, yet was fun. This game is boring.

There's not much of a reason to play this game. This game is too repetitive. The levels are randomized but practically all the same. There's no variety in this game really. Even my first platforming game I had ever made had more than two enemies and they had different qualities. The enemies here poses no threat. If you die, you restart the level. $2.99 is too much to ask. Bad Rats is a much better deal. I actually did have fun with that game. I would had actually spent money on Bad Rats, I would never spend money on this game. I got it for free from...somewhere. I have regrets of getting this for free, but I could sell the card I just got from this game. Yay!

Things I liked:
-I can make a little profit from that card (you won't get profit if you buy this game. According to Enhanced Steam extension, this game lowest price has been $2.24. Get it only if you can sell the cards for more than you've spent.)
-One boss somewhat made me startled I guess...
-The text after every level were somewhat interesting I suppose.

Things I disliked:
-Everything.
-There's a dedicated button for showing the controls which looks ugly because it goes behinds the platforms and such. You can't even see it. The controls however, are easy to learn, but not precise at all. I found my character still running even without pressing any buttons. Not too sure what the look button was for either...
-Two enemies, boring, no threat.
-Bosses were pretty boring too. Much more improved than the regular enemies, but these bosses can easily become regular enemies.
-The boxes...I'm not too sure why I can move them when I jump on them.
-Sometimes I can't double jump. I'm not entirely sure why I can't do it at certain moments but I'm not playing more to figure it out.
-Repetitive. All levels are basically the same just randomly arranged. (Have yet to see an impossible level.)
-Nothing really to look at.

Oh, I can provide another positive. I can cross this off my Steam Games in my Library I haven't Yet Played" list."

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Less than 30 minutes of gameplay for 10 dollars. Can't make your own dungeons, but can make your own memories for some reason.
If you have a 10-dollar bill that caught you touching yourself and you need to make sure he's never seen again, spend him on this.

-EDIT-
It updated and took away the ability to make your own memories. It also made the controls funky and added trading cards. I tried to get all 3 but nearly died after getting the 2nd one. So I decided  it.""

Imagine Me
The controls, the levels (randomly generated, which led me to get stuck on several occasions), the gameplay in general, is very crude.
The developers might have run out of funds, or their level, game and interface designer weren't really up to the task, or maybe there were time constraints that made them rush the shipping.
Either way, this game is clearly not finished. Art-wise, it is mostly pretty, but the arrow animations are still amateur, for example.
Interface navigation also has some poor choices: options menu is not accessible from in-game. Control mapping is not accessible from the 'esc' menu (maybe there is a shortcut, but one thing should not preclude the other).
At least, the game let me play it in a window with a resolution of my choosing. That, bafflingly, many games still refuse to do.

Imagine Me
Imagine Me playing a better game!

Imagine Me
Imagine Me is a side-scrolling randomly generated action platformer.

It features a campaign and challenge levels, as well as a workshop. The campaign is randomly generated but sadly, the level design is broken and offers too little variation, making it repetitive and boring. The challenge while interesting is somewhat easy and can be completed in less than one hour. In the end I'd say there are other platformers that surpass Imagine Me in every single aspect, making it not worth the money or time.

For anyone out there studying to be a game designer, this game is the perfect case study for the difference between 'randomly' and 'procedurally' generated content.

This uninspired platformer immediately thrusts the player into randomly generated levels that are not always completable and almost certainly not fun.

The protagonist controls stiffly and the hitboxes for hazards are inaccurate leading to very frustrating play.  Enemy design include: Fire Particle effect, spikes the shoot spikes and a black box.

Imagine Me
this is by far the worst game i have in my steam library. there's no challenge, no gameplay and the controls aren't tight enough. all you do is jump spikes and kill 2 different types of enemies. it's the kind of game you'd expect that someone would make while learning about how to make games, and then they'd just move on to a better project: not put it up on steam for actual money. i played through the game with this morbid curiosity that it would suddenly change or get better; it didn't.

Imagine Me
First it seems to be a good platformer, but it's not.
Annoying, frustrating, and have no point to continue.
Randomize thing: doesn't seems to work well.
The only good side that I can think of is the level editor with Workshop support

Just can't recommend. Not that bad, but not good either.


Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I got it in a random bundle, but it's definentely not worth the 10 dollar asking price at the moment.  I will re-review later if it changes.  Right now I wouldnt spend more than 5 dollars.

Imagine Me
Imagine Me would be considered plain even if it had came out back in the early 90s, and yet, its astonishing how such a simple game manages to do so many things wrong.
Every level looks the same, you just go from point A to point B, avoiding spikes and  enemies that barely move, by the end of each level you get a memory, that grants you further passage to the next one.
Developers like to show theyre still working on this game, but:
-The exit is always located either on the bottom right or bottom left corner.
-Every time you die you get the same dead screen, it gets really annoying.
-controls aren't tight.
- i wouldn't mind the art-style but there's a severe lack of animations.
- the game is too repetitive and has a very poor level design,  it would be more interesting if there were some  Non randomly generated levels.
- the hit boxes are bigger than the objects that are supposed to kill you, its an easy game and i could adjust to that, but it just shows how little work was put in this game.
- The Broken level generator more often than not leads to impossible levels, i've played for 10 min until i came across an impossible level. Levels don't even change when you die, the only option is to start the game all over again.
-the options menu is pretty lousy and cannot even be accessed while in game, instead you just get this really annoying            screen that appears every time you start a new game showing you the pre mapped controls and some instructions on how to play, there's even a special key just to open the instructions again. I dont get it, of all things that are missing, why do the developers want to force this on players, the game couldn't be simpler, children games are harder to understand than this, it serves no purpose.

If devs were ever involved in Imagine Me they would have fixed some of this problems by now, they seem to take into account everyone's bad feedback and yet no changes have been made. How difficult could it be to generate new levels every time you die just so it was at least possible to continue playing without having to start from the beginning every time you get stuck.

As is, Imagine Me is not even worth its current price. Its one of the worst games ive played and deserves every negative review it got. At Least most indie developers try something different and creative even if they happen to fail

Early Access Review

Probably the worst game i ever played. Don't buy it. 0$ are too expensive. Only get it in a bundle if you want to complete a game in under 10 minutes.

Imagine Me
If you are looking for an easy game for 100% achivements. Might be worth the time. I enjoyed Bad Rats 10x more then this game. If you buy it, you are garenteed to be dissapointed.

Imagine Me
Finicky controls and poor design lends to an unmemorable, mediocre platformer. 4.2/10.

Imagine Me
I'm a little confused, why would you use random level generation in a campaign mode.  A lot of the time, I think that random level generation is more of a lazy excuse to not put time and effort into level design than a way to have the game be Spontaneous and different every time".  In addition

Imagine Me
Oddly unpolished. Poor execution. Imagine Me feels like someone's project in a beginner's game design course. Perhaps there's a decent story in there somewhere but the level design, movement, and hit detection make it a mess. Sadly game design toolkits like GameMaker make far more polished games than this. For $3 it's not a major hit to the wallet but I can't see why anyone would buy this game outside of a bundle deal with something they do want.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Make sure you dont buy this game for $10. I completed this game 7/8 achievements (8th one seems bugged) in 10 mintutes.

What you should know about imagine me is it as nothing special about it. No special gameplay or mechanic to make it stand out. It's simply run and jump.

It has a random level generator for when you beat the game, but with all the much better platformers out there this isn't worth it. I personally got this game from  for the equivilent to $0.19 and im still upset. Yes this is Early Access, but I see no potential what so ever.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Not only it feels extremely unfinished, it also is extremely short. In 10 minutes - ten - I finished the game, did everything I could and obtained 10 achievements out of 11. How can this be worth 8.99 euro on the store as of writing? Luckily I got a free key for this during a giveaway.

Imagine Me
Got this game for free. I want my free back.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I got it by buying bundle and still i regret. Its like '90 dos games but without story or anything just go and finish level. 9$ IS TOO MUCH this game should worth like 99 cents or less. If you want another perfect game i fully recommend coz it can be done 100% in 15 minutes.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

My first impression is that this game is challenging, but fair. Controls are responsive and the dozen or so story levels I played through were laid out well, so any resulting deaths always felt like they were my own fault. Its a great feeling to accomplish a previously-failed task through practice and reliable game mechanics.

Game : 6.5/10
Graphic : 5.5/10

100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard

Imagine Me
+ Decent soundtrack, spooky bossfights.

- Repetitive, no change in gameplay, uninspired random generated levels.

Imagine Me
Worst POS I have ever seen on PC or Steam. Avoid at all cost.

Imagine Me
This is the most cancerous and frustrating game i've played so far, played like 5 min and i'm ready to commit suicide by bashing my head through the monitor. (hopefully that will work)

Don't bother buying this, it's not even worth the 3 euros that it cost.

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

Lol @ this game!
Gameplay sucks and is very bad! Game is buggy, no menu, no options to change command/binds. Control sucks. Nice way to waste 10$ ...

Game itself isn't funny at all. Don't waste your money but rather invest in Super Meat Boy" or "VVVVVV" which are real platformer."

Imagine Me
Early Access Review

I got this game for free, but I couldn't imagine anyone ever spending money on it. It comes off as a crappy flash platformer, with a confusing level select screen. This game is bland, and terrible.

Outland
This is an excellent, well polished action platformer. Highly recommended.

 Beautiful graphics, mesmerizing backgrounds and sceneries
 Very good sound design and soundtracks
 Excellent animations
 Solid combat system
 Good level design
 Online co-op multiplayer!
 Runs surprisingly well on very low-end specs computers!
 Linux support! :)

 Keyboard bindings have to be set outside the game, but it works fine anyway.

Outland
What I've experienced (purely the single player) so far is a beautiful game, with interesting mechanics and engaging boss fights. I guess what I would sum it up as would be Old school platformers meet Metroid meet Ikaruga." It doesn't really bring anything new and innovative to the table mechanic wise

Outland
I don't like Steam's reviewing system. There are so many cases in which I don't wanna choose between recommending a game or not. Sometimes there are certain aspects of a game I like and others that I don't. How can I, the reviewer *always* have the right answer for you, the reader? Someone I don't even know personally? Someone I have no idea what they want and expect from a game? Sometimes I just wanna post my own analysis without a sentence" attached to it. Anyway

Outland
I played this game back when it first released on the xbox 360 and it was great back then. I bought this game *twice* if that doesn't show how much I recommend this game, nothing will.

Outland
An excellent PC port of a pretty decent Playstation Store game. Works fine at high resolutions at smooth 60+ fps.

Play with a controller for best experience.

Outland
Pros:
+great animations that bring the 2d platformer to life
+color mechanics that will amplify the challenge
+decent soundtrack
+artstyle is unique

Cons:
-combat feels clumsy, it makes the fluid running/jumping mechanics slow down
-checkpoints are bad in the sense that they won't refill your life, many times after a checkpoint I went to suicide just to replenish my health (there are health pickups but they either drop or don't)
-few environments (they just add snow effects to the same ruins or add a forest or some other boring replacement as a background)

Sidenote:
The game might have a huge difficulty spike at the end boss, they throw alot of things at you that you have to avoid.
There are coop missions that can only be done if you play with someone. Haven't had the chance to try it so can't comment on that.
Some people might have issues with the story, truthfully it's not the most elaborate.

Overall it's a great 2D platformer that will test your reflexes.

Outland
Introduction
Outland is a unique 2d platformer with some very unique gameplay elements. Outland brings a unique color switching mechanic throughout every part of the game. By switching between red and blue you can prevent damage, fight enemies more effectively, and open more pathways throughout the game world. I loved how the game constantly kept adding more elements to the levels. I didn't personally care for the story at all, but I found myself getting lost in the amazing backgrounds and soundtrack.

Pros
Art style
Gameplay
Difficulty
Great Port
Insanely fun
Level design



Cons
keyboard/mouse controls are not great
story

Conclusion
Outland is an amazing platformer with really cool and unique gameplay elements. From the gameplay to art style this platformer is an overlooked gem in this genre. This game is 100% worth a buy, even at full retail.

Outland
Outland is one of my favorite downloadable games from the last console generation, and I'm extremely happy that it was ported to PC. The only strange thing about the port is that achievements unlock after you close the game. Weird, but it's okay. (Edit: this has been addressed in patches)

Outland is something of a simple metroidvania with an Ikaruga color-changing mechanic. Players can change between light and dark after an early section of the game and use these forms to attack opposite aligned enemies, harmlessly absorb same-colored bullets and beams, and interact with the environment. There's a somewhat large world to explore and plenty of bosses to take down. The game features an arcade mode with leaderboards, and a coop mode that has a few specific levels. There is also some cooperative stuff in the game - some specific coop challenges and the main campaign allows coop (though due to the nature of the game, only the host progresses).

The player's main weapon is a sword, and combat is very quick and simple. There are some upgrades to the player's abilities, but no alternate weapons, armor, etc (the game doesn't really need them).

The game is absolutely gorgeous, especially at high resolutions and it's pretty to see in motion. The story is very much something of an origin/creation story for a different world, and it's kind of neat, but don't expect a ton of character development, spoken dialog, etc. If there's a reason to buy this game, it's delicious eye-candy and solid gameplay.

Outland
Outland, the action-platformer by Housemarque, originally came out on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 over three years ago. It was a good game then, it's still a good game today.

First off let's discuss the port. It's decent, but could be better. For whatever reason the vsync locks at 30 fps, which causes frame-rate judders. The alternative is to turn off in-game vsync and then force it on via your videocard's control panel. I tried this but somehow I still got screen-tearing. Maybe I just suck at computers. Also there's no option to turn off vibration if you're using a 360 pad. Never been a fan of force feedback, so needless to say I didn't like this. The image-quality is a bit too soft as well. It supports resolutions at and above 1920x1080 but I dunno, it feels like it could use some AA, that would make the art-direction really stand out.

Usually when people talk about this game they mention a shump called Ika...ikar...? Oh right. Kid Icarus. Yep that old Nintendo game about Greek Mythology and Eggplant Wizards. Seriously though, the world the hero explores is governed by light and dark(or blue bullets and red bullets). Early on you're given a sword and not long after that, the ability to switch between light & dark(blue & red). When you want to absorb bullets or lasers you should be the same color, when you want to attack enemies you have to be the opposite color. Your color can also affect objects such as floating platforms or spikes. Expect numerous situations to crop up where you have to switch between colors constantly to proceed. This isn't a puzzle game but you will have to think every now and then, at least for a moment.

Switching colors isn't always an option. For example, you might run into a red enemy while area is filled with red bullets. The trick here is to use one of your special attacks. These can include a power strike, a laser, and flashy explosion. Next up are the exploratory powers. Certain powers can be attained to make getting around easier. In typical fashion, previous areas can be explored to find more cash, life/energy upgrades, and concept art unlocks. Fair warning, this is the full extent of the exploration in this game.

Main reason I enjoy this game is it's just so fluid. Back when it came out in 2011 I started the demo thinking Well...whatever..I guess I gotta try it." I immediately fell in love with its smooth controls

Outland
Very solid Action platformer, great art style with nice soundtrack and great platforming. don't expect deep fighting mechanics or combos, for me i don't mind and i had a really great time beating it. higher difficulty levels and some collectibles also stretch the game's length, Recommended for sure.

Outland
This game is so friggin pretty. Now if you have read my other reviews I often like making comparisons to other games to start so this for most intents and purposes, is any open world 2D platformer mixed with the likes of the Bullet Hell Ikaruga. I want to avoid using the term Metroidvania because I don't like it as well as from what I see this game does not fully represent that.

The Ikaruga nod is for obvious reasons. However combining it with a platformer makes it a rather unique endeavor.

The art, the animation is gorgeous. In addition to this the combat and traversal feels smooth and agile. For me personally, it reminded me of Marvel's Black Panther. The combat has slides, lift attacks, aerial combo's that make combat albeit a bit (for want of a better word) 'simplistic' version of Devil May Cry.

You gain energy that can be used for special abilities which I will leave for you to discover yourself. But I will say their attacks represent a neutral color that affects enemies of either of the main colors.

The bullet hell aspect becomes something of an art piece if you just stared at the patterns, in true kaleidoscope fashion, however it becomes rather interesting when something that seems completely impassable can be overcome by switching color and jumping through the top and over the other color before switching back to fall through a laser of the opposite. Its makes for a very satisfying experience when a successfully navigated jumping puzzle is solved. At times, not only do you feel you've solved the correct path but you feel like you've bested it. And you can feel your skills grow and your knowledge of how the bullet hell aspect can used to your advantage.

I did have some problems, there are 5 bosses in total. The first three can be beaten rather easily with a couple attempts without much fuss but the last two demand EVERYTHING from your skill set.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=488687867

They are incredibly satisfying to conquer. But the only way (I feel) that you have a fighting chance is go to almost all the shrines, they are hidden and cost I forget what the currency is called but usually all the money you have upon finding them. I won't say what exact ability and what its used for but its absolutely required to have multiple uses of it to even have a realistic chance of defeating one or both of these two bosses. But despite that small frustration it does not take away from the fantastic experience. The art, animation, combat, traversal, mixed with a fantastic soundtrack makes me wish I had pulled this out of my backlog much sooner and that I could write this with 2 play-thoughs to tell you about.

Outland
This game is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite Metroidvania-inspiried platformer/hack n' slash game of all time. Don't let my limited amount of time spent with the PC version fool you; I spent a considerable amount of time with this game on gen. 7 consoles before I upgraded  everything to gen. 8.

Everything about this game, from the music, to the atmosphere, story, characters, platforming, action, and voice acting is completely polished. I love the art design and get lost in the world every single time I play. The game is not particularly difficult, but it is challenging in certain places and overcoming those challenges feels very rewarding. Combat is also very tight and has that extra little something that all the best hack n' slash games possess. I can't really define that something"

Outland
An ancient force has awoken from a 30,000 year slumber and you are all that stands in the way of absolute chaos. Well you would be if you play this game.

This game is like stepping into a dream. Gorgeous imagery, mystical magic and psychedelic bullet hells await all who dare step into outland. Using both the forces of light and dark you are tasked with ridding the land of evil where ever it lives and returning the world to the peace it once knew.

The combat and platforming in this title are executed amazingly, controls are almost perfect and the snappy reactions they give make this a pleasure to play. That topped off with cleaver metroidvania level design, a vast world to explore, a huge array of puzzles to best, bullet hells to beat and an army of enemies to overcome will lead to hours of excitement.

The visuals as mentioned are outstanding; the psychedelic lands you traverse really do submerge you into something akin to dream. The art style is unique and interesting, although all the characters and enemies are cast in an almost silhouette of light they have a life to them that is just hard to explain.

The music is a great accompaniment to your journey with deep orchestral tones with every boss battle to soft melodic songs like wind whistling through the trees. I found every part of this world thrilling and delightful. The story is as bare bones as it comes, you are a hero go forth and do hero stuff. Sure there is a big bad evil in the world corrupting and twisting everything to its whim, but you dont have to worry about that, just enjoy the ride.

This game is a masterpiece and will keep you busy for a while too, especially if you are going after every collectable. The soundtrack and artbook are great too; they really add to the experience and help you get a look into this amazing world that the game only scratches the surface of.  Head out and buy a copy today, youll be glad you did.

Have Fun ^_^


Outland
I've only put a couple hours into this game so far, but already I'm in love with it. Classic platform style gameplay with beautiful art, dynamic enemies, enough combat skills to keep it interesting, and the storytelling is pretty decent for a platformer. The ability to switch from light to dark mode really does it for me. It adds a dynamic to the game and keeps it interesting and fast paced enough to keep you going and going. Highly recommended to anyone who loves platformers of any kind.

Outland
I had a lot of fun playing co-op in it with a friend online. Maybe not the best Metroidvania platformer, but endless amounts of highs and lows to experience with a friend. Some bullet-hell difficulty in places, some fantastic boss fights, and pretty good music and stylistic choice. I'd say give it a go, and find someone else to play with.

Outland
A platform game with some heavy metroidvania influences, it takes a few cues from games like Giana Sisters with the dual gameplay of red vs. blue (youll see when you watch the video, promise), and even taking some cues from bullet hell shooters, surprisingly effectively used in this platformer.

This is first impression review, I'll update after I dig deeper into the game.

This game is awesome, it has badlands graphics with guacamelee control of realm. It's does feel like old school platfomer but  casual" where you respawn at previous checkpoint when you die. Beating the enemy when your hp is 1 also give you extra life point. First hour impression

Outland
First of all, im not really into a platforms genre game, but outland makes my girlfriend happy, she loves it, she playing it over and over again even when she always died a lot. so sometimes i playing it with her, and its kinda rewarding when i am passed the hard area with so many obstacles (its like playing skyforce or 1942, canon bullets everywhere)
For me outland is a decent platforms game, its a great game with stunning visual style, great powers and abilities, challenging puzzle and it has a boss battle too (and its huge).

I bought this game just for $2,  so im not asking anything from it, overall its a good game. 7/10.

Outland
Right CTRL is a key that is used in this game. If anybody... ANYBODY at this dev had played the game on keyboard they would've realized right away that the controls SUCK.

Well. Off of that little thing, let's get to why this game isn't very good.

Art- Don't get me wrong, the game does look quite nice. Sadly levels all blend together and nothing is very distinict or memorable. Pretty, yes. Functional? It's streamlined, but it needs to be far less-so.

Music/sound- The music is alright but pretty forgetable whereas the sound design is rather atmospheric and nice.

Gameplay- This is where we really start to run into issues. The description says fast paced? I would put it in the mild" category. It's repetitive. Simple. Slow. Nothing new or innovative. And all of the environments look EXACTLY the same so I never once cared where I was going or why I was going there. The next area will just be a slightly different but still boring as heck platforming section.

Granted- I didn't get the red powerup

Outland
It looks cool but plays kinda boring.

Outland
Outland is an absolutely beautiful game with crisp controls, challenging levels, and novel gameplay mechanics.

If you're a fan of Metroidvania games, this is a must-buy, especially for the price.

Outland
I think Outland is remarkable in it's mechanics and artwork. Typically, I detest playing side-scrollers, though I was 1st inaugriated into gaming in the eighties. I guess, seeing the progression that gaming has made, I just don't like going backwards in time on tech. But, Outland is one of those lovely exceptions. The fluidity of the character's movments, the quality of the sound & graphics, and the atmospheric effects of the game all draw you back for more. That said, skill-type games that require dexterity and speed are not my strong point, so I probably won't progress very far in the game. Since I bought it primarily for the artbook and music, I'm fine with that. And, after my first time looking through the artbook, I have to say I was not disappointed there. Getting the huge discount for the Christmas sale was just an added bonus that succeeded in moving the title from my wishlist to my library. I recommend this game to anyone, really... whether you are into side-scrollers, artwork, or great audio soundtracks.

Outland
I'm a huge fan of Metroidvania games, in fact it's only thanks to Metroid that i started playing videogames.
I got this game because after reading some reviews i thought i could give it a try, plus it was on sale (90%).
The game is not bad, it just doesn't feel like a Metroidvania due to the fact that there's no backtracking and you're guided throughout the whole game. The game also never got me interested in its story, it was just a boring walk 'n slash 2D time killer with some platform. The artstyle is not bad, but there's almost no variation between areas..as somebody already said, you could see a screenshot and not recognize which zone is which.

You may want to give it a try on a sale, i'd say a 50/75% is enough.

Have an awesome day!

Let's do a test:

- Do you like metroidvania games?
Yes? Next one.
No? Then leave.

- Have you played to Ori and the blind forest?
Yes? Next one.
No? Then don't buy this one and try it, it's better than this in everything.

- It's on sale? Then buy it right now.

Story is: good guy against evil mixed with some chaman ideas.
Music is good.
Gameplay is funny but not to complex. There's an achievement: kill 20 monsters with only 1 life... it's not hard because the monsters, it's hard because they always drop +1 life and you have to avoid to get it...

Definitely is a good game to have fun.

Games like this are the reason we need to support indie developers more often

Outland
The best $1 ever spent. Thus game is extreme fun while playing with friends. There were a few moments when we kept on falling from ledges and me n my friends couldn't stop laughing. I love this game. Highly recommended.

Outland
I know this game came out a couple of years ago because i own it on the PS3 it was a great game at the time as it is now .
I serious recommend this game for those who like adventure/platform games .
The gameplay is rader basic and simple which makes the game fun and enjoyable , and the story line there is not much to tell is one man trying to save all of creation against the gods .
But on my book this game it was as it still is 9/10.

Outland
Bad netcode makes online multiplayer unplayable

Outland
Outland is a great platformer that I can easily recommend to the fans of the genre.

It is an interesting mix of a Metroidvania gameplay and the attribute-changing mechanic from Ikaruga. The controls are fast and responsive, the art style is unique and has some breathtaking scenes, and the music fits well to the atmosphere. The game has this magical and eerie feeling to it and everything flows so well together that I had no doubts about completing all the coop challenges and even getting all the achievements which is quite rare for me.

However, there are a couple of things that could have easily elevated Outland from a very good game into a unforgettable title. As I mentioned above, the game has this great art style and there are some truly breathtaking moments when the player is shown the grand scale of the architecture and some of the enemies. More of these moments could have been appreciated!

There also could have been more areas without any enemies in order to vary up the gameplay a bit. I feel that the opportunity was there many times where the developers could have shown more of the story without the voice narration.

The coop challenges are quite fun, though their number is quite low. It is a shame because for that one hour, my coop partner and I had great fun completing them!

But overall then, this is a very positive recommendation and I am looking forward to the next game by Housemarque (and ported by Knockout Games).

Outland
The keyboard controls are absolutely abysmal, and it makes it really hard to want to play. I do not recommend.

Outland
its a pretty platformer. and thats it.
the combat is dull and forgetfull.
the music and ambience is ok, nothing more.
the platforming is sometimes clunsy, sometimes more of the same.

it feels void. it needs something that brings it apart from other platformers, and it just doesnt have it.

buy trine or trine 2, instead. much more interesting.

Outland
Got a few hours into it with a co-op partner and was enjoying the game, but then it deleted my save file.

Attempts to play a new game fail: error creating save file.

Another promising game farked up by inadequate QA.

Outland
Too many platform games on Steam are basically what I call 'Pixel s', games where the novelty is in the difficulty (looking at you,  Super Meat Boy). Outland manages to be tricky without being punishing, rewarding learning from your mistakes rather than killing you for trivial errors. The novelty is in the mechanics, learning new techniques and using the 'light/dark' system to get past enemies and traps. Story is nothing special, but the graphics are smooth and the controls are responsive, which is all you want from a platformer.

Outland
Outland is basically a 2D platformerr. It has a metrovania component, means sometimes you go back and forth to previos levels.  However the going back and forth is minimal and you have target indicator of where you should go next, which is good. The game itself is actually pretry linear unless you want to go baxk to some previos levels to get powerups. And you might want to as the levels are rally getting harder later.

I have yet to tey the coop missions, so not sure about that. But the single player experience is good. Levels are getting harder and harder. Near end levels are actually hard, although it is not insanely hard yhat you wanna throw your controller/keyboard across the room. But you are guaranteed that you will die quite a lot at near end levels.

Checkpoints are not many but they are mostly well placed

I played it with an XBOX360 wireless controller and it is great.

You'll get additinal abilities during the game that will unlock new areas.

Summary. It is a great 2d platformer game. It is from UbiSoft but you don't need UPlay for this game. It is a hidden gem.

Outland
While the story isn't very special, the gameplay is as good as a 2d platformer can get, smooth controls and simple attacks. And the difficulty is perfect, it gets harder as you play, it introduces you to new skills slowly but allows you to master all skills before the final level.

Definitely recommended for a couch weekend.

Outland
Yes, yes and yes.  Beautiful, fun to play and worth every penny :D  An underrated gem

Outland
Relaxing platformer. Great Theme.
A Tribal warrior that gains abilities has the game goes on. The soundtracks are great, especially the boss ones.
For those who enjoy, the achievements are actually average/hard" to get. I wish this had a difficulty setting

Outland
After having picked up the game some time ago, I finally took the time to play it and it took some serious self-control for me in order to close it and write this review. This game is not only very beautiful, it is lots of fun. For most of the enemy types, there are certain abilities or attack patterns that allow you to defeat them without loosing health. Finding these out alone is fun. Now, I will go back to playing - the second boss is waiting for me :D.

Enjoy the game, folks. I would definitely recommend it.

Outland
Huuge fun! I really like the art style. It's pretty clean and controls are solid. The puzzles are generally well-designed and there are very few moments when I feel cheated out of progress.

Outland
at first it controls like a pregnant yakk and it send you through a co-op difficulty like its trying to help dicaprio win an award but so far its great in co-op.

Outland
the only reason i don't recommend this game is for the controls
they just SUCK (https://steamcommunity.com/app/305050/discussions/0/613937306837760462/)

Outland
The good:
Background visuals are appealing.

The bad:
Animation is clunky
No real story
Controls are poor
Bullet hell parts, being the only challange, are not enjoyable


Basically it's a cheap bullet hell game platformer - a strange combination - with nice art but poor gameplay.

Outland
Very impressive visually, smooth gameplay, no crashes so far.
It's obviously been made to be played both on console and pc,. so the game should (imo) detect it's current platform and not show the console controls as they are making the tutorial more confusing,. but that's the only downside I've seen so far.

Update:
- Game crashes when you switch to windowed mode. T_T

Outland
A quick review about this game :

Beautiful artstyle and visual design, coupled with a nice atmosphere.
Engaging singleplayer and online co-op with smooth gameplay that should be enjoyable through and through.
The story is not too original or deep, but it's charming in a way.
Level design and difficulty are both solid.
Summary :
Nice little platformer with cool graphic design, appealing atmosphere, fluid gameplay and interesting mechanic (If you know Ikaruga, you probably get the whole concept).

Outland
N+ meets Prince of Persia with a few bullet-hell situations all mixed up in the jimmyjams for good measure? Sure, I'll give it a shot. The stylized levels and artwork is very pretty. Native controller support that works like you'd expect it to!

I'm really enjoying it so far.

Outland
This is a refined little beauty. From the store page, I expected a good looking but short and flat indie title with all the usual problems those come with. Instead I got an incredibly well put together, lengthy and polished title, the likes of which I'd expect from a triple A studio. The gorgeous animations, backgrounds, and other visual elements are definitely icing on the cake, but what makes this a great title is the masterful weave of mechanics and abilities with enemy interactions and platforming sections that always makes you feel like you're getting better while progressing through the game.

Highlights
Outlands learning curve, for me, flowed in a natural progressive way. As a player I found myself constantly wanting to go further and progress just to see what was next. The unlocking of abilities on the way, and the interesting and fun boss fights were like the Golden Stars you got at school when you'd studied well, and really helped up the level of engagement.

The little details have all clearly had time and effort spent on them making sure they turned out right. Everything from the ability to destroy heart drops to turn them into excess gold when you don't need life, to the placement of new enemies after a platforming section has been thought about by the developer and works together to compliment the players progress.

The art style and sound deserve special mention, all sticking to various influences from Aztec, Incan, Mayan and even Olmec civilizations and all helping to promote a feeling of the spiritual and the historical and embolden the narrative, they work really well. Outland also has some of the best title screen narration I've heard in any game.

Mistakes and Annoyances
I expected a lot more frustration and annoyance than I found in this game, and the only things worth complaining about for me were little things that could've been fixed like the option of alternative pre-set control mappings, though even this has been addressed in a recent developer update. I only ran into one bug in my entire 8-hour playthrough which forced me to restart a boss fight. Other than that the only time I ever got frustrated in this game was when I screwed up a platforming section or didn't think through an enemy engagement before charging ahead. These annoyances set to show me I wasn't as good as I thought I was and needed to learn something before proceeding, as many of the good old-school games used to.

Recommendations
Currently selling on Steam at 6.99/9.99/$9.99 and clocking in with an average playtime of 7-8 hours and close to double that for completionists, and with co-op and plenty of replay value, Outland is plain and simple good value for money if it's the genre of game you enjoy. There's even a Two-Pack option where you can save an extra 15-20% if you have someone to go in with.

There's also a Special Edition at (locally) an extra 33% which includes the soundtrack and an artbook with some development history and plenty of screenshots. While the soundtrack is unarguably good, it's fairly bland and unexciting, and the art is gorgeous, it's still essentially a collection of things in a pdf which are already mostly unlocked in game. In short, the Special Edition is cheap, but doesn't add much value.

Unedited review notes 02/09/2015 for Outland:

+Pretty as hell, the sizes/resolutions are also larger and nicer than usual
-Map legends/icons and controls are pretty weird and annoying to get used to
+Awesome narrator, this guy should narrate love books and GPS
-Game too hard to exit (6 menu selections?)
+Those boss fights are challenging, interesting, encouraging and always leave me with just 1 heart left
+Tons of smart little things like attacking hearts 3 times gives you gold instead all add ingenuity

Outland
Very nice platformer so far. Interesting mechanics, nice visuals, the music is good (a little repetitive maybe), difficulty is alright, complexity is slowly increasing... very polished. The savepoints could be a little more frequent, but I guess that's due to the world being somewhat open and something I'll get used to.

Update: Ok, so after ~10 hours I have almost completed the game, I have yet to beat the final boss. Yes, there are not enough savepoints in the game, and what's even more annoying is that when you exit the game the savepoint is reset and you have to restart the level. Outland is still a very nice game, and I can recommend it, but some parts can be a little frustrating (not enough savepoints).

Update 2: Alright. So the boss I had to kill wasn't the final boss. There's apparently one more super boss hiding after three more levels, and those levels are just infuriating. They aren't really hard, but the lack of save points makes getting through them a real chore. Still a very good game up to that point.

Outland
Outland was a fun platformer that reminded me of Metroid with a sword. The story of the game is not terribly long, taking me order 10 hours to finish. The game builds in challenge nicely without getting too hard too quickly or ever becoming too easy. The collectibles and upgrades were spaced out nicely and didn't feel like a long grind. While the game is pretty much linear, it is clear right away that upgrades from later in the game will be necessary to finish clearing earlier areas, which I consider a plus.
Positives:
The gameplay was great. I thought that the movement by the player and camera were polished weil. The game adds a mechanic of switching between a light and dark orientation, changing what some platforms do and whether some environmental obstacles are harmful or benign. This provides a nice tactic to add depth to what can otherwise be a tired genre. 10/10
Bosses were difficult, but not overly frustrating or complicated. They provided a good challenge, and defeating each one provided a sense of accomplishment. 10/10
Most of the achievements were non-grindy. (I have 8/12 right now.) The lone exception to this is the achievement to collect 1 million in game currency. After finishing the game and collecting all of the money vases, I only had 77% of this done. Some of the other achievements provided some extra amusement/welcome challenges. 8/10
Character upgrades and collectibles were well spaced. Throughout the campaign, new skills and techniques were provided at a good pace, keeping the game from feeling monotonous. Collectibles could be found in each area, but I thought there was a good balance of adding extra areas to find in areas and not littering the game with meaningless loot. 9/10
Negatives:
The story doesn't do much for the game beyond giving a sense of why you are there and what you are doing. It isn't over the top, in your face, or bad. It is just rather blase. The expose about each boss provides a little context about why you had to fight them, but feel a little contrived. All of this said, in my opinion it is much better to make the story adequate and make great gameplay than the other way around. 5/10
No comment:
I have yet to try the coop challenges.
Overall:
A lot of fun. I was a little sad it ended so quickly! However, any extra content may have started to become lengthening the game for the sake of lengthening the game. If there were to be anything added on, it probably would have required new skills as well to add more depth. I would definitely recommend the game to others. I would even go so far to say that I would be interested in a sequel if it were to add new skills or updgrades! 9/10

Outland
So far a fun game. I've played it co-op with a friend about half way of the second chapter. The game's impressive visually, fights are engaging enough for a platformer and switching between Light and Dark brings in that little bit of complexity the game needs to stand out.

Only problem I've experienced are the default controls and lack of options to change these. I eventually found out ways to fix these issues.

Keyboard Keybinds!
Go to your Steam/steamapps/common/Outland/ folder and look for the KeyboardMap.ini file. Open it in a text editor and replace the existing keys with the ones you want. In the in-game options set the controls to Default (not Alternate). Consult the ReadMe for more detailed instructions.

Controller Keybinds!
Turn on Big Picture Mode on Steam and map your keys in the Settings menu. This allows you to customize keys to your heart's content. Back" is Map

Outland
One of the, if not the best platformer game I have ever played. The artwork is magically rich in detail yet simplistic at the same time, allowing for visual clarity in the gameplay while providing the player with  a sense of wonder at the scene. The story is encapsulating and rich, with little to no lapse in game flow (some people might not like the lengthy levels). The combat may be slightly frustrating at times, but fights only last a few seconds, (with the exception of bosses, those are challenging in a fun way), so it is not a big issue. Most annoying part of the game are the obstacles in each stage; they are quite challenging and may leave you wanting to punch something.

TL;DR - Beautiful environment, very good story, very challenging but fun levels and combat.

How did they do it...................Best optimized game I've ever played, smooth as vaseline and the reading/saving speed is so fast, so fast. SO FAST!

10/10, Too well optimized to be a open world game.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
In five hours I adopted a wolfdog pup, kidnapped a spetsnaz officer, got mauled by a bear, repainted a helicopter, used the Fulton Recovery System on a passing goat, and sniped a spetsnaz recon team while She Blinded Me With Science played on cassette.

Yep, it's a Hideo Kojima game.

EDIT: So, this review got more votes than I expected. Why don't I edit it to be a little more useful?

I have 24 hours in the game as of writing this - and it came out yesterday. That should tell you something.

PROS- Who's a good boy? DD's a good boy! DD is a good boy, yes he is!
- The Fox engine is excellently optimized. This game should be playable with beautiful graphics even on middle-tier systems. If you can run Ground Zeroes, you can run this.
- The open world is well-done. It's also huge, but it feels dense enough that you're never more than a few hundred meters from something to Fulton. Environments are somewhat varied.
- There are multiple ways to approach any enemy installation, ranging from the obvious to the easily missed. It's encouraged to find a perch a couple hundred meters away and scout ahead.
- The world itself is well-done, too. There are weather changes, a day/night cycle, and these actually affect gameplay by making stealth easier or harder.
- You can Fulton extract anything. Anything. Soldiers? Of course. Cargo containers? Yes. Jeeps? Sure. Emplaced machine guns, mortars, AA guns? Definitely. Tanks? Yep! Bears, sheep, goats, and buzzards? Absolutely. I'm surprised you can't fulton-extract the freaking buildings at this rate.
- Mother Base management is like a more fleshed-out version of Peace Walker's. In many ways, this game is Peace Walker 2, and I definitely put that in the pro" category.
- Good soundtrack full of 80s pop and rock hits that you can blare out of a helicopter. Also

This is not a game, it is a work of art. I first played Metal Gear on the NES in 1988 during the slow decline of the cold war, and from the moment I started playing The Phantom Pain I immediatley felt like i was right back in my childhood again. Thank you Hideo for the memories. It was worth the wait!

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
ATTENTION: Words colored black are spoilers, so only hover over them if you're prepared for that!
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an open world action-adventure stealth game developed by Kojima Productions, directed, designed, co-produced and co-written by Hideo Kojima. The eleventh canonical and final installment in the Metal Gear series, and the fifth within the series' chronology.

Im still not exactly sure what to think about the game, as its both the best and the worst game I have ever played. I really enjoyed the gameplay and I think its one of the best open world games out today. However, as a metal gear solid fan who has played the previous entries in the series, the ending felt unfinished and wasnt very satisfying.

In fact, most of The Phantom Pain's second half doesnt really feel complete either. Many of the main ops in Chapter Two are basically retreads of the early missions at a higher difficulty, and their role as padding couldn't be more evident. The true ending isn't revealed in some grand, explosive fashion, but is simply presented on your list of things to do once you reach a specific set of milestones, making it feel hastily slapped in to give all of your prior actions context.

It's a shame, as there's no sense of closure from the revelation that we were the fake Big Boss all along, and the story as a whole ends up feeling hollow as a result. There are rumours that Konami cut Kojimas budget at some point and even denied his desire to work on the game for even longer, maybe that is one of the reasons behind this.

Likes and Dislikes below. They are just my personal opinions, so I strongly recommend reading other reviews as well.

LIKEDMother Base Management
Assigning soldiers, developing new weapons and gadgets, and further expanding your Mother Base often kept me busy in an enjoyable way

Freedom of Choice
Numerous ways to solve missions and objectives. You can either go in completely silent, killing or sleep darting every target with suppressor, or go in loud with machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and even tanks. To accomplish either, you have an abundance of tools and gadgets at your disposal. The good old cardboard box, a stealth camouflage device, C4 that you can place even on the backs of enemy soldiers, inflatable decoys that look just like you, explosive and sleep-gas mines, claymores, etc.

Interrogation
You can slowly creep up on soldiers and aiming your gun on them, they will notice and drop their weapon, begging you to not kill them. You can then choose to interrogate, kill, or just choke them till they pass out. If you choose to interrogate them, youre granted useful information about the current area. Locations of hidden resources, diamonds, even prisoners or your mission target

Supply Drops
They allow you to refill ammo, suppressors and fultons during missions. You can even drop vehicles wherever you need them

Fulton Surface-to-Air Recovery System
It's awesome and often hilarious! You can recruit new soldiers with this and remove them from the mission area at the same time. It contributes to your progression, and you dont have to hide their bodies, which can be found and woken by others. You can also extract vehicles, containers or even animals Later in the progression, the balloon is replaced with a black hole device, allowing you to even extract even while indoors

Fluid Movement
The transition from prone to crouching is very well done

Performs Well
No fps drops, no lags, no blue screens, just smooth!

Damn good console port
One of the best console ports ever created, I played it with keyboard/mouse and it was awesome

Never seen before degree of Weapon customization
Create your own favourite weapon out of dozens of weapon parts

Cassette Tapes
Though some of them wouldve been better off as cutscenes

FOB's
1vs1 online mode is intense and fun and you have to be really good to make it through 60 AI enemies and 1 real player

Precise Shooting Mechanics
You can even shoot trough small holes and there will be no invisible wall that blocks your shots

Great Soundtrack
Awesome songs in there, I recommend checking it out. Seriously, go buy it!

Custom Songs
You can add your own songs to the game and even set one of those as your helicopter arrival music
DISLIKEDCover System
Theres no key to enter into cover against walls or boxes, its a dynamic system thats at times unreliable

Silent Snake
Snake is quite the silent protagonist, and most of his dialogue is on the optional cassette tapes... During cutscenes and crucial events, he often said nothing, letting others talk for him

Driving Vehicles
Feels oddly quirky in this game, but its functional at least. Most of the time you will drift with a vehicle trying to avoid a stone, but just to crash right into it anyway

To be continued at the end of many story missions
Its not a movie and doesnt feel like one

Notable lack of cutscenes
Its unlike other Metal Gear Solid games and if there are any, they are very short compared to other MGS games

Checkpoint System
Be ready to do stuff again along the lines of Dark Souls... you die, everything is back, with no manual saving

Climbing Ledges
Its a real pain in the  if the edges arent even. Your character tries to climb, but can't and just gets pushed back down. This can even draw enemies attention as you try to climb a ledge but just cant, even though the game is telling you that you should be able to

Cheaters in FOB Mode
I really hope Konami does something about this

Credits after and during the intro of every mission
As if every mission was an episode of a TV series... It feels out of place in this game and gets annoying after a while

No Interesting Bossfights
The first Metal Gear title without them

The sudden change from David Hayter to a different voice actor, Kiefer Sutherland
Even though you aren't really playing Big Boss in this game the real Big Boss doesn't even have David Hayters voice

Repetitive Side Missions
Extract the Highly Skilled Soldier, Prisoner Extraction, Eliminate the Heavy Infantry, Mine clearing, Eliminate the Tank Unit, Target practice etc. They all can be done a bunch of times in different locations and gets slightly harder each time. Its boring as its basically the same task over and over again...

No useful fast-travel-system
There is no useful/functional fast-travel-system, you need to call in the chopper and that generates some unwanted downtime. Sure there is the cardboardbox fast-travel-system but you can only activate it if there are no soldiers around... And this for an open-world game is very bad
Do I recommend the game? Hell yeah, it is amazing! Awesome gameplay, nice story and a great soundtrack making this game one of my all-time favourites, even though it has some flaws
With over 200 hours of fun this game, it was well worth the money for me too!

If you should have any questions about the game or my review, feel free to leave a comment or add me directly.

A finely-crafted masterpiece filled with dynamic gameplay and a multilayered story about the misadventures of legendary pirate warrior Snake and his friend Kaz, a short-tempered one-armed fiddle enthusiast robbed of his future.  After rebuilding their oceanic party island, they cruise Africa and the Middle East in search of bootleg cassette tapes for the ultimate mix tape, while battling Cipher, the world's most advanced copyright enforcement agency.

10/10 would misinterpret MGS story again

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
Since I now have 100%, I guess it's time to review this game.

It's damn incredible. The gameplay is pretty much flawless. In my 300+ hours of playtime I haven't found a single bug. Well, except an AI-driven truck trying to do some offroading, with hilarious results.

The AI is really smart, able to wipe you out if you aren't careful. They use teamwork and don't aim like Stormtroopers or cheaters, being nicely in the middle. The buddy system is great, and each of Snake's companions feels like it has a purpose, with D-Dog being my personal favourite. There's a buddy for every playstyle, as long as you develop the right equipment. Speaking of development, this game has a ridiculous amount of weapons and items to develop, and even after getting 100% I still have new guns and upgrades to try out (They don't count to 100%).

As for the story, it's a strange one, and it has a lot of different opinions. I do agree with the majority saying that Skull Face isn't a massively interesting villain, mainly due to the fact that he barely makes an appearance until later on.

ENDGAME SPOILERS
The final plot twist was pretty good too, as I have a nice little idea on what Kojima meant by it, but it's too long to fully explain. Basically, I thought he wanted us to be a victim of Big Boss' antagonism, rather than play as him ourselves.

As for the graphics, the game looks excellent, with the FOX Engine keeping the game running at a smooth 50-60FPS, and my PC isn't exactly the best around. The sound and music is also incredible, with the music ranging from the calming flutes of Afghanistan to the pounding, intense drums of a combat alert in Africa. The soundtrack also accompanies the mood brilliantly.

So, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I almost can't fault it, and it's everything it was hyped up to be. Easily game of the year contender.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
What I learned playing MGS V:

-Hospitals are dangerous
-Driving a Horse is not permitted in Afghanistan
-Driving a Car is not permitted in Afghanistan
-Having an interpreter makes humbling understandble in form of subtitles
-Tanks are made with papier-mache
-Playing Hide and seek with a Metal Gear
-Hideo Kojima is a cult that you will see him everywhere, even in the Mother Base
-Punching my comrades makes them grateful
-Sandstorms are not what i thought
-My comrades are weeaboos
-Russians are weeaboos
-Sending a support helicopter is considered stealthing
-Cigars are the best thing in the world
-Grass is the most powerful stealth device in the world
-Punching your horse is very satisfactory
-The time doesn't stop while using I-Droid, no really it's the 100th time they say that.
-All russians read the same book

And probably i will learn more thanks to this Hideo Kojima game

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
What a weird game. The gameplay itself is stellar and if you're a fan of the stealth genre you've probably played this one already. It's basically a high-budget remake of Peace Walker. On the other hand, it has the weakest plot/story of all Metal Gear Solid games. It's clearly unfinished and with the current situation at Konami it's not likely we'll see an updated rerelease like Substance or Subsistence.

*NON-STORY RELATED MINOR SPOILER*

So , I was playing this awesome game enjoying every second of it , minding my own business.

And I get an urgent message from Ocelote telling me to hurry back to mother base for something important.

I make it back and promptly hear what sounds like a gunshot , few seconds later you start hearing fireworks.

I was putting 2 and 2 together and a few seconds later Miller , Ocelote and a couple more soldiers came singing Happy Birthday and they brought a cake , celebrating my birthday. A game , celebrating someone's birthday (7th September , yes it's my birthday) I was so ing amazed I kept smiling for an hour.

I never really paid much attention to the MGS series but this game takes the cake no problem.

Hideo , I tip my hat off to you , fine sir.

You have managed to leave me speechless.

This game is legendary , buy it and enjoy every second of it (I rarely recommend games since lately they've been )

10/10 Game of the Year material , would cri over cake again.

PS : Game has alot of funny little easter eggs! (Check my screenshots to find a funny one that happened during Quiet's battle)

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
Call me crazy..but I think this game was made by some sexy beast named Hideo Kojima.

The story takes place after the events of Ground Zeroes, 9 years to be precise as your main character Punished Venom" Snake has been in a coma and is now on a hell driven odyssey to get his revenge.

So gameplay wise

Game is amazing, the graphics, the story, the gameplay. I am just really amazed of what they created, from what i`ve seen the pc version is really great optimized, running with a 970 and i5 4670k maxed out at 60 fps with no frame drops. If you really like open world stealth action games just buy it and i am sure you won`t regret it. The only problem with the game might be that the k/m controls are not so great but i expect most people are using xbox 360 controllers like myself so that`s the only concern that i have. Also, i have finished chapter 1 and i only have 1% game completion so imagine that the amount of hours you could get out of this game would be more than 100 at least. 10/10

The last MGS game I played was MGS: Guns of the Patriots on PS3, that game was amazing. Having played this game & not knowing much about it before hand nor did I play Ground Zero, I've got to say that this is probably the greatest stealth game made.

The game not only looks beautiful & is well optimised (running at a stable 60fps @ 2560 x 1440 on a GTX 970) but is a pleasure to play. There are tons of missions and side missions for you to immerse yourself in as well as a base building mechanic which can be quite time consuming on its own.

I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a rich single player experince who is willing to invest quite a few hours into the game in order to fully experince it. In additon to the rich, story driven single player missions, there is also a multiplayer aspect to the game in which players can attack/defend their base or another players (mother) base.

METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN
Well guys, so this is the epic end of a 28 years old franchise, the great and epic end that this franchise deserve, or that is what the trailers said... I'm not going to lie, if you ask me if i recommend this game, **** YES, this game is great in all parts.

PROS

+ Good story (more less).
+ Incredible addictive open-world gameplay.
+ Good sound effects.
+ Exceptional soundtrack (but they don't use it, don't ask me why).

That were the positive things

I met the Devs at GamesCom 2014. Around noon on Friday they sat me down in front of a PC and had me try the game - apparently I did well (I looked at the goblin before attacking it and noticed it had first strike). After a merry but short romp through the introduction dungeon, which ended with a green blob of slime eating my poor adventurer, I went on to explore the rest of the Indie Megabooth. Friday night though, before I went to sleep, I knew there was a bit of unfinished business: I bought the game, and not just because the developers are great guys (but that too).

The game delivers what it promisses: bite sized adventures you can play during a break. The other day I had 15 minutes to spare: 10 of those were used by a berserker clearing a swamp of monsters.
It may look like a simple game, but it has a suprising amound of depth, with many abilities, items and other things that lead to multiple ways to tackle dungeons and may have you adapting your strategy based on what you encounter.
And there is a lot to encounter. Just when you think you have seen all the races, seen all the classes, you find one more. Then you check the journal and see just how much you haven't seen yet (I found it more fun not to check how much I am missing so as not to spoil the pleasure of finding something new).

But how do you play? Simple: you select a dungeon to explore and write an adventuring permit. The permit is the character creation" process of that dungeon. For example it could say: To [dungeon name]

I picked this game up not knowing exactly what to expect.

It is part RPG, part roguelike, part math.

It frequently makes me feel a bit dumb.

The problem is that I really, really enjoy playing it.

Desktop Dungeons
It's Minesweeper with a theme.  A nearly perfectly executed puzzle game which captures in an abstract way the dungeon crawling roguelikes which have sprung up like kobolds in the indie market.  You can finish a dungeon in five minutes if you're the impatient sort or if like me you like to mull over optimal moves, a board might take  fifteen minutes or so.  There is a light and humorous background story to give the puzzles a campaign-like structure but War and Peace it ain't.  Which isn't a problem at all as this is the type of game which you'll load up when you have some random time to kill.  You will unlock various ways to customize each dungeon, such as starting equipment, races, classes, gods, etc.  The graphics are cute, the gameplay is tight, the music is not annoying.  If you like puzzle games and think you would enjoy a deconstruction of a dungeon roguelike, then buy this game.  It is practically flawless.

Desktop Dungeons
If you're reading this, you're either wondering whether you should get this game, or you already own it but like to froth at the mouth as you experience opinions that don't match your own.  I understand.

Desktop Dungeons is a somewhat randomized puzzle game cleverly disguised as a roguelite rpg.  It's also incredibly brutal.  That aside (or possibly because of it), I found the game enjoyable in that bring out your inner masochistic rage junkie" kinda way.  A single mistake can cost you the level

Desktop Dungeons
I agonized for days over buying this because I just wasn't sure it'd be fun.  It is fun, and the tutorials are very helpful.

The big appeal for me was, easy in, easy out, and skirmishes finished in around under hour.  I just can't commit to days of playing games that are skirmish-like in nature.

I'm looking forward to playing this quite a bit.

Desktop Dungeons
I guess I was expecting more RPG and less Strategy because this game seemed to me to be too difficult to be fun.

It starts out easy, you have to clear single-screen 'dungeons' that are tough but defeatable.  By the time I had finished the tutorials (and even some of those I had to cheat and look for solutions on youtube) that was the end of any successful dungeon clearing that I was able to do.

Game in a nutshell is: The playfield is dark except where your character begins.  You always begin at level 1 but can choose your race/class and optionally pay some ingame gold for starting equipment (example: a shield that reduces all damage by 2).  You are placed on the screen and have to move around uncovering the darkened squares and ultimately defeat the level 10 boss of the dungeon.   Sounds fun right?

The only way to heal yourself and your mana (used for skills found as you explore the dungeon) are potions or uncovering darkened dungeon squares.  Both are in limited supply.

The 'casual' rating of this game is true in the time required to play sense, but if you don't exploit every single weakness of every enemy, and if you don't kill higher level enemies for the bonus exp (which is harder than it sounds, again, very limited healing) you have no chance of killing the level 10 boss monster.

Because every move counted so much, and because ultimately it takes a lot of moves to clear a dungeon, I found myself getting frustrated at how incapable I found myself of clearing a dungeon.  I'd get to level 8 or 9 and simply not be able to kill enough enemies at that point without dying, to get to level 10 or have enough of a stockpile of potions for the final boss of each dungeon.

So, instead of surely dying to the higher level boss, I would exit the dungeon, able to keep whatever gold I found in there and selling off the potions for 50-60 gold, take away 10-15 it costs for the items you bring with you.  At that point I was looking at minimum 500 gold upgrades to unlock anything more fun about the game, and I decided to uninstall and give up on the game because there was no other difficulty setting.

If that kinda game sounds fun more power to you but I was looking for a much more casual game, as in not an intense experience.  I wanted to shut my brain off for a bit but this took all of my concentration and was, for me, not a fun game to play in hindsight.

I see why people like this game I really do but this game isn't for me. That being said Steam asks if I would recommend this game to people, my answer is yes but not to everyone. See the game has plenty of replay value as evidenced by a whole bunch of other reviewers putting in much more time than I did. However if you're like me and enjoy more traditional rpgs then this game isn't for you. The graphics are standard roguelike graphics with chracter pieces not sprites added in. The music is very catchy and fun. This game can be like an extremely quick and complex version of D&D or an even more complex and long game similar to D&D. This game is well made while being easy on the surface it takes a bit to master it. If I were basing this review off of my experience alone I'd give it a 6/10 just because it isn't my kind of game. However seeing the game from a reviewers standpoint and looking at how the athstetics and gameplay contribute to the game as a whole I give it an 8.75/10 it's the type of game that demands patience and persistance. If you have the time invest into this baby, lord knows she desereves it... But I'm not the type of gamer that's ready for that type of commitment sorry Desktop Dungeons but I think you should see other gamers.

At first, I didn't enjoy this game. It seemed fairly random, simple, and frustrating. About 10 or so hours in, I started to understand how the game actually works. Then, things started to click. The game ultimately, is a puzzle game, and a very unforgiving, but rewarding one. Utilize your blackspace effectively, monsters are a resource, leveling up is a resource not to be wasted.

Having to kill 1 Level 10 boss seemed daunting, but when you think you've finally learned how to do it, they then throw 2 Level 10 bosses at you! How the hell am I supposed to beat that? But guess what? I did it. I was thinking, sweet, I know how to play this game. Then, the next set of dungeons appear. Defeat 3 Level 10 bosses. No way, impossible. how the hell do you do that? An hour later, the first of those dungeons falls. The next thing I know, I have to kill 10 of these bosses? IMPOSSIBLE, and do it 3 times with 3 different classes?

Every time you think you've learned what to do, the game surprises and challenges you to do 1 better. The quest system does get a bit grindy at times, and I have mixed feelings about the lockering system, but this is a great game that's not often on sale, but if you enjoy puzzle games, this will definitely fit the bill.

Desktop Dungeons
A very interesting game that can be very difficult, but yet still enjoyable. From the screens and videos I wasn't sure this was a game I'd like, but I'm glad I tried it.

The difficulty is like FTL's, you get pummeled and you just want to keep trying until you succeed. There's quite a bit of diversity in the game with a ton of race-class options. Beyond the varying difficulty dungeon runs, there are additional challenges and quests. To top it all off, you get to build a little city for succeeding in your adventures, opening up even more options.

Dungeons seem to take 10-30 minutes to run, so you can play for short periods of time or long.

Desktop Dungeons
Talk about unlimited content! You can still find new things to do in the game even after 500 hours. Desktop Dungeons is about as close to a real roguelike as you're going to get on Steam, and doing a damn fine job at it. Procedural map generation, turn-based combat, tile grids and permadeath are all present. Punishingly difficult, but really rewarding as well. Makes hours just fly by.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is exactly the type of indy game i like.
It starts simple enough with one dungeon and your lonely weak guard, but offers great complexity and variety.
Add to this the humour, which takes a stab at every rpg cliche, and the nearly unending replayability, DD makes the ideal mix of puzzle/strategy/rpg hybrid.

It also offers the possibility to just do a quick game and play one dungeon at a time, but can suck you as easily in and you can waste some hours with the just the next quest" addiction.

The only thing i am missing would be a possibility to reuse your heroes

Desktop Dungeons
I was wary of this.  I played a ton of alpha, even after I had unlocked everything and finished all the levels.  It was a lot of fun, and I appreciated the minimalism of the game.  I paid for the advance copy something like three years ago, played the game, then stopped and sort of put it behind me for a while.

Then, just a couple weeks ago, I saw that it was released on steam.  While I thought about looking up my copy of it, minutes later I received a message saying because I paid in advance I got a steam key!

So, I cracked it open.  And for a brief minute, I was shocked.  This isn't the blocky spreadsheet I remember!  Where did all these graphics come from?  Why are these characters saying things?  A town?  I miss my grid of things!

Of course I got over that quick.  What I wasn't sure about is what changes there would be, and after playing about 10 hours of the game, I am excited to say that I think they've put an amount of polish on top that has made the game even more nuanced, more complex and overall, well, more.

The base aspects of the game are the same.  You are in a dungeon with monsters levels 1-10.  Killing them nets XP, but killing monsters of a higher level than you gets you exceptionally more experience.  And you will need to kill higher level monsters, because otherwise you are unlikely to level high enough to kill the boss.  Lucky for you, the monsters are pretty lacksadaisical and tend to just stand around in the same spot, and won't strike unless you strike first.

It also has a clever mechanic where revealing tiles in the dungeon is the prime method of regaining life and mana (aside from leveling, which refills all your life and mana). The monsters also refill their life, though, so you can't just take anything out by regaining your life over and over.

It sounds simple, but when you count class skills, items, gods and so many other factors, there is just so much to this game.  And the random generation of levels makes every game, even of just random games, a thrill and a different experience.  And I love the way they build level by level as you experience more and more - the learning curve here is a big improvement on the original which pretty much threw you right into the fray and you had to guess what would be hard or easy.  Frankly, that never bothered me because a game like this that lets you take your time, you learn in your own way, but I appreciate what they've done here.  It opens up pretty fast anyway, and I think your particular sense of play can lead you towards certain classes as the most fun or interesting.

So basically.  I'd recommend this.  A lot.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is a turn based roguelike with a little bit of a difference; each run in a dungeon takes about five minutes to come to conclusion. You are free to roam around the dungeon as much as you want, enemies will only attack you if you attack them first, giving you the freedom to work out your strategy however you prefer.

Graphics are the usual 2d style which we are seeing so much of these days, but the sprites are nicely designed with some well-known characters thrown in there such as Super Meat Boy. The UI can be a little daunting to begin with but you see all of the information you require within one click.

Each of the individual levels are randomly generated; this adds to the replayability of the game as no dungeon will ever be the same; I believe each dungeon has its own set theme" but what is included in the dungeon and how its laid out is completely random. The difficulty is something to be said for though

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is a simple game like chess, easy to figure out and goals are very clear, however just like chess mastery of this game could take a vast amount of time.

Its also got goats, you like goats right?

I am someone who loves the more challenging and strategic games out there such as FTL and the Banner Saga. Even though Desktop Dungeons are both these things, I am going to tell you why you should not purchase this game (even at sale). Desktop Dungeons is a game that exhibits a little of roguelike quality into a strategy game that is mainly about killing the boss for each dungeon." You start off with availability to one class and one race and slowly progess by upgrading your town to obtain more classes/races/items/bonuses/etc.. The progression in Desktop Dungeons is fine. The game never forces you to use the same class or race at any prolonged period of time. Because of this

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons has honestly got to be one of the best games of its kind, in my opinion.  If a roguelike where you have to carefully plan out every action you make sounds interesting to you, I would certainly recommend picking up this game.  I certainly have loads of fun playing it.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is an entertaining indie game that combines a variety of aspects from RPG, strategy, and puzzle games.  As the ruler of a kingdom, you construct buildings and recruit heroes to do your bidding for you.  The buildings themselves offer unique perks to improve the efficiency of your kingdom while you take control of a hero as you send them out into the further reaches of your lands on quests.

Each quest that you undertake is an entire adventure in itself.  Your hero starts at level 1 and you are capable of leveling them all the way to level 10 during the course of the map.  Each level drastically improves the capabilities of your character and there are plenty of beneficial boosts and magical items to find along the way.

Your buildings, on the other hand, offer options such as crafting magical gear, unlocking one of the many unique classes, adding additional boosts and content to encounter on your adventures, and even new races - all of which have their own stats that significantly alter the playstyle of -every- class.

The quests themselves are turn-based and give you all the time you need to execute the strategy of your choice.  You'll have to manage your health, mana, and experience as you try to maximize your gains and minimize your losses.  The game is unforgiving, though, very rewarding when you successfully pull off a dungeon and drag home a mountain of treasure.

I recommend this game to fans of turn-based RPGs, fantasy worlds, and strategy/puzzle gamers.  I found it to be far more enjoyable than I was expecting.  If you're on the fence, give it a try!

Desktop Dungeons
Definitely one of the best games for people who enjoy a thorough mental challenge.
It is one of those case, where a few rules lead to an immense variety in gameplay and it is for the player to find out what works and what doesn't.

Desktop Dungeons
A pleasurable timesink! The 1,000th hour playing this game feels just as joyful as the first. At the surface, it looks like the marriage between a roguelike retro dungeon-crawler and a casual kingdom manager strategy game; though if you have the patience to dig deeper, you'll come to appreciate its unique balance and variety. Great for quick casual games, though there are also some multi-stage quest dungeons later on that can challenge even those who are apt at strategy games!

Desktop Dungeons
Extremely addictive Rogue-like randomly generated dungeon crawler that, at heart, is a strategic puzzle game. It implements the unique mechanic of exploration as regeneration, meaning that the unexplored areas of a map are a finite resource that must be used wisely. Lots of race and class combinations and many dungeons and challenges make for endless replayability. As of this review, I have played over 60 hours and I still feel like I have a lot to learn and that I am improving.

Great retro art style and soundtrack/effects combined with the fantasy genre make for a great atmosphere. But be warned, this game is not for everyone - the difficulty level ramps up to the point that it really requires the gamer to do further research via forums and wiki articles for the best strategies, as the tutorials are slightly lacking. You will die - a lot. Thankfully most levels only last an average of 15 minutes. If you feel like you can go no further in the level, you can leave the dungeon and take all the goodies you have found with you.

If you are a fan of games that require some nerdy research (like terraria, crusader kings 2, blood bowl) I would definitely seek this one out. Watch some of the Let's Plays on Youtube to get a feel for the game.

Due to the difficulty, when I actually pass a tough level the feeling can only be described as or.gas.mic. Maybe the closest feeling would be beating a really hard super meat boy level.

By the way, I have rarely felt as though the randomization was unfair. In 95% of cases, the map is definitely beatable as long as you have a very strong grasp on the strategy involved for each class and race, as well as the best way to approach bosses. I have played levels I deemed impossible, only to completely change my strategic thinking and end up beating the level with nearly every single attempt.

Is the game worth the price tag? I'd say yes given the hours played. As a bonus, you can actually play this game on the desktop dungeons website (without using steam) by making an account with them and linking it to steam. It saves the game into a cloud and transfers it over to steam. Once I discovered this feature I have been able to play at work on the sly (like I said, I love this game). If you know a friend who owns this game, ask them to set up an account at the website and you can try out the game before purchasing!

Desktop Dungeons
Damn hard. That's what Desktop Dungeons is. Even the easiest dungeons take many tries to finish. This game mixes basic RPG elements with roguelike quests/levels. If you die while trying to complete a quest you have to start all over again. Now, many of the battles (at least in the beginning) can be finished within minutes, provided you know exactly what to do. Completing quests earns you money to unlock and upgrade new classes, and of course, this will unlock new quests for you. All of this should make the game a little easier.

But the game might just be a bit too hard because I couldn't even complete 3 quests. And while I still had a good time playing it (mainly because of the short levels) I think the game isn't always well balanced. It requires dedication and effort, -two characteristics I actually possess- but if you have the feeling that you aren't making any progress it's time to quit.

Still, a very good and fun game, once and if it clicks, but beware of the difficulty (spikes).

[Rating: 72/100]

Desktop Dungeons
I played the original alpha freeware version of DD years and years ago, and I loved it. The strategy and careful planning, combined with many choices in which the player must weigh opportunity costs, appealed to me as someone who enjoys both puzzle games and roguelikes. This market version, however, is a bit disappointing.

Almost immediately I noticed that the quick and seamless gameplay of the original has been replaced with lots of flashy graphics and animations, most of which are far too long and prevent input until they have finished playing. While these animations are relatively short, the slowness becomes noticeable the longer you play. Those little microseconds add up. Yes, this is a turn-based game in which you cafrefully think through your decisions, but let's be honest-- the first 2/3 of every session is pretty much blasting through the weak monsters or exploring in hopes of finding the right item with the RNG. The real magic of the original was in the last 1/3, when things start to get tense and you really have to plan ahead. So it's frustrating when this version forces you to slow down at the part that deserves to be sped through.  These slow animations carry over to the menus as well, and it's  exacerbated by the dull, mediocre banter which tries too hard to be funny, and which takes forever to skip.

And of course, there are tutorial levels you can't skip. Really? Really?? This is 2014 and you are still making unskippable tutorial levels?

Perhaps the newest feature of this version is the introduction of the gold-to-buy-buildings (which then unlock new heroes or give small upgrades) system. There was absolutely zero reason to add this, because they do the exact same thing as simply completing the challenges in the original alpha. At least in the alpha, you didn't have to click through twelve haphazardly scattered menus-- once you beat the dungeon, the next level or hero was unlocked automatically. Seriously, why even add this?

The artwork is polished, but the style is just ugly. There is really nothing redeeming about it. While the alpha had simple, easily distinguishable 16-bit pixel graphics, this version tries way too hard to be detailed. It's like staring into those gross Ren & Stimpy  or Spongebob Squarepants closeups for hours on end! No one wants to do that. The music is also unmemorable-- it sounds like generic stock medieval fantasy music, versus the ominous, synthy fanfare of the original; it says a lot when a 5 second introductory song is more appealing than an entire soundtrack.

Lastly, I want to talk about how QCF Design has trolled other indie developers. Back when DD was still in development, League of Epic Heroes, a game by a single dev on iOS, got a cease and desist and was threatened with a lawsuit for copying" the gameplay concept. At the time

Desktop Dungeons
Don't be afraid of the price.
This game is marvelous in evey aspect. Beautiful art-work, nice music and a great gameplay that never gets old! It's a mix of puzzle and tactics with roguelike elements, random dungeons and plenty of quests. It have imense replayability, as you have in-game achievements that keep the game fresh for a long time.


Desktop Dungeons
I'm kind of torn on this game.  It's obviously well done and gets great reviews.  That said, I don't enjoy it very much.  I was looking for a game that could I could play quickly on the go or as in between other games and based on the reviews, this seemed to be it.

I've played around 15 hours now, and just don't enjoy it that much.  If you like rogue-like puzzlers then it's probably a good game for you.  For me, it just lacks that balance between depth of gameplay and casual mental involvement.  If you approach this game casually, you'll almost certainly never win (other then the few introductory games); and if you approach it to  win, then it's certainly neither casual.

I also found the depth of gameplay everyone talks about to be a bit lacking.  After getting frustrated, unable to beat even the first normal" dungeons

Desktop Dungeons
I started playing the free version of the game and finally got the steam version. That was a really good choice. My advice: Try the free version, it'll show you the very core of the game. If you like it get the full version.

Pros:

- Problems to solve strategically: Essentially every dungeon is different and you can solve it in many different ways. But, one or two mistakes and you're done. This is the rogue-like aspect of the game. In the start you'll feel very lost but as soon as you play you'll start using the deep mechanics of the game in your advantage.

- Progression and goals to be achieved. Development of your kingdom and uncovering different races, classes, items, etc. through the campaign mode. This is the hook of the game, the RPG aspect, and the way it's done is fantastic.

- Huge replayability. The amount of combinations is just enormous. It's always the same idea: get in the dungeon, kill the boss/es and get out, but the amount of combinations of classes, races, deities, items, layout of the dungeon, level of difficulty of the dungeon, badges achievable, etc make every run different than the previous one.

- Daily dungeon.

- Complex and difficult. This game is all about thinking, the puzzle element is about 70% of the game. I you don't like staring at the screen for a couple of minutes checking your best option then you probably won't like the game. Difficult dungeons take about 20-30 min and you need to be focus all the time.

- Good difficulty curve and very good tutorials.



Cons:

- Can't think of any.



Overall this is an extremely well done game (once you play for a while you'll notice this in the little details). Very original and unique in its way. But remember to try the free version first, this is not a game for everyone.

Desktop Dungeons
I am at 32 hours played and still have not played every map. Not to speak of the huge amount of puzzles and challenges I have barely touched. The game has an achievement for 100h playtime, which I will probably get with normal playtime and without getting burned out on the game. You feel smarter after every beaten dungeon and after every little intended exploit" in the mechanics you find. It gets harder really fast and it takes a while before you understand all of the games concepts and figure out how to play each of the countless classes. I still have not even unlocked all classes

Desktop Dungeons
A hardcore Roguelike-Puzzle."
I know I'm not the first to describe it like that but it's the best way to sum it up. This game is tough as nails but still fair. The music is awesome

Desktop Dungeons
Bite sized puzzle game with some rogue-like elements.

Go on a 10-20 minute dungeon run with a newly generated character with different abilities. At least a different dozen other classes that play very uniquely from all of eachother, since you need to be able to effectively use their abilities to their max capabilities in order to tackle the more difficult dungeons.

There are many hundreds of hours worth of replayability and gameplay in this package due to the extreme variety of challenges.

Desktop Dungeons
There are a lot of neat aspects to this game but what killed it for me is how often you know you have lost before you have lost.  The dungeons are largely an order-of-operations puzzle (so-to-speak) and if you get the order wrong, or some other minor thing wrong, you literally cannot win.  The worst thing is when you're down to the last monsters and you know that you cannot beat them because you have done something wrong several actions ago.  In what I have played it didn't seem like there was a lot of strategic adaptability, very unforgiving.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons is an extremely addictive roguelike strategy game where each randomly generated dungeon is, essentially, a puzzle to be solved.

It is easy to pick up and play but there is also a great deal to learn and lots of game mechanics to master.

The short length of each dungeon run means that it is a great game to dip in and out of but you can also play for longer periods of time. There is a longer-term aspect to the game as you unlock new options such as races, classes, challenges and quests.

Different dungeons along with the various race and class choices provide new challenges and the player is often required to update or alter their strategic thinking in order to be successful. This keeps the game fresh and engaging.

Desktop Dungeons has a lot of different race and class combinations plus many different types of dungeons and challenges. There is a high level of replay value and it is a game that you could easily play for hundreds of hours.

I feel that it is a really well made game. The soundtrack, in particular, is excellent. There is also lots of replayability here. I feel that Desktop Dungeons offers excellent value for money and it is well worth picking up if you enjoy this style of game.




Desktop Dungeons
This is a puzzle game. There's no role playing and no significant strategy involved.
Every level is a variation of the same puzzle. The dungeon consists of one tiled screen that's dark. Your character always start at level 1 and must beat a high level dungeon boss. The puzzle is how to level up your character, with limited resources, high enough to beat the boss. Sounds interesting, but there's only one way to do it: beat monsters with higher level than your character. You have a selection of spells, traits and tricks for this goal, and once you figure it out you just have to repeat it. I found the way this plays to be anti-intuitive and contrived.  It's not a terrible game but I can't recommend it.

Desktop Dungeons
A couple years in development, Desktop Dungeons has finally gone gold, and is a ton of fun to play. It's a unique mix of a light roguelike with a puzzler, and definitely exercises your strategy gland (that's a thing, right?). Each level is pretty short, ~10 minutes, so it's good in both short and long bursts. Tons of unlockables, immense replayability and staying power, light kingdom building aspects and lots of strategic depth add up to make this one a winner. The developers continue to improve upon it as well, which is always a good sign. The free alpha" version on their website is basically the precursor to this game

Amazing puzzler, there is simply no count to the number of hours to spend optimizing strategy and characters. Frustrating, in a good way.

It's like a more complex version of Minesweeper. The video on the store page actually describes it pretty well.

Hard to describe Desktop Dungeons. It's strictly a puzzle game, and a challenging one at that. Yet, the progress you make, the items you collect, the monsters you encounter, etc. etc. all *feels* very much like an RPG. Very well done. I've more than gotten my money's worth out of this gem.

Desktop Dungeons
I came into this game expecting a roguelike but instead got a puzzle game with roguelike elements. The puzzle elements force the game mechanics to be stringent to the point where making a single mistake will ruin your attempt to finish a stage, and the roguelike elements randomize everything to the point where you can't really plan ahead and you seemingly just have to hope for a good roll of the stage you're playing so you can even consider finishing it in the first place.

Desktop Dungeons
A really great game with tons of replayability, you won't find a better value game.  The game is humerous, can be tense, is highly strategic, turn based but can be played relatively quickly.  One of my favorite games.

This is a brutal puzzle game wrapped in a Dungeon Hack theme.  Since combat is almost entirely non random, you need to CAREFULLY pick your fights to space out injuries, healing, and leveling up.  This is a brain burner.

Oh, to make it more painful.  The natural way to heal or gain mana back is to explore the map, so you will use up the map over time as well.  It's hard, very hard, to win.

Desktop Dungeons
Brilliant game, best described as a mix of dungeon crawling and puzzling.
Its basically about solving" small dungeons

Desktop Dungeons
A great rogue-like rpg/puzzle hybrid with hours of gameplay value.

Pros:
+ Artwork: All functioning, no roughness, all easy on the eye
+ Soundtrack: Even its short, repetition doesnt bore you
+ Gameplay: Every dungeon is a puzzling challenge. Solving something always rewards. Many progression aspects for further gameplay.
+ Mechanics: Everything works as it is meant to be. Didnt encounter any bugs. Puzzle system is superb!

Cons:
- Sometimes a randomly generated dungeon might be too hard or impossible to solve. (Even tho' you can exit the dungeon forehand and carry your earnings, even losing is rewarding.)
- Even the game is cool and all, i find its price a little bit much.


If you want a good puzzle game (with rpg-roguelike spice on it), this is the game for you. Dont miss this one.

What can I say? I really loved the style of artwork portrayed in this game. This game initally starts off very addicted and emerssive. But that only lasted for an extremely short amount of time, leaving me unfulfilled and extremely unsatisfied with my purchase. It's not the gameplay or the game mechanics fault this time as to why it got old fast. This time the culprit was the difficulty. After the inital first few dungeons and extreme enjoyment, the game throws you in a hell hole of a metaphoric toxic goo and pretty much tells you to learn how to swim through it without dying. The tutorials they offer" (using the word "offer" very loosely) are not very great tutorials. Instead

Desktop Dungeons
I've played this game for 16 hours, the first 10 of which were a blast...very addictive and fun.

But unfortunately I must echo what others have said.  The game gets confusing/hard/tricky at a certain point and even after reading hints and tip online I couldn't make any progress.

Ultimately, very frustrating as it's such a great game idea and well done.

I've been hoping they will patch" it and provide a fix for everyone but I'm not holding my breath.

So

Desktop Dungeons
Very disappointed with this game and have no idea why it is largely getting good reviews. It claims to be a roguelike like but apart from the presentation it is simply an incredibly boring, repetitive, unforgiving puzzle game.

While the game is based in a dungeon, the enemies never actually attack you unless you attack them. They just sit there! You do nothing more than walk around the dungeon picking which enemies to attack and which to leave till later. The only way you die is when you've run out of options and basically have to commit suicide.

The art style is grotesque and is reminicent of the hideous zoomed in images of something gross from Ren and Stimpy. If you try to run the game beyond its native tiny windowed resolution its looks even worse... somehow

I'm pretty  off I paid for this game, and I got it on special. Don't make the same mistake I did and play a real roguelike instead.

Oh and the interface sucks balls.



Desktop Dungeons
I have played this game for years - even way back when the graphics were much poorer/different quality. I really like the game, but honestly it is just too difficult (and check out the games I own - I do not shy away from difficult games). I have spent many hours playing this, but could never figure out how to get 'good at it'.

I cannot recommend a purchase unless you try the free version (the oldschool one) and really like that.

Desktop Dungeons
This is not a roguelike. It's a clever puzzle game disguised as an RPG. While it has potential, it falls short in that single mistakes, or just a badly placed bad guy on a random map level can cause you to lose the whole map, regardless of what else you do.

The Good
- This is a truly hard game. If you like hard puzzles, this gives it in spades.
- The artwork and voice work is nice.

The Bad
- This game is frustrating when you lose making no mistakes. That's fine in real life a game shouldn't have unwinnable situations unless it's the Kobayashi Maru.
- Despite having multiple characters, playing gets grindy really quickly. You either get a good random map or a bad one.
- You lose your character and money spent each round. You level up by buying houses which allow you to buy add-ons.
- All these taken together give the game a pay to win type of feel like many casual games, but isn't one.

I wanted to like this game, but after playing I found myself both bored and frustrated. For some people this is going to be a good game, for those looking for a rogue-like, dungeon crawl, this is not that.

Desktop Dungeons
Desktop Dungeons est un puzzle game dguis en roguelike. L'illusion est tellement bien fichue que l'on a plus l'impression de jouer  un dungeon crawler light qu' un rel puzzle game. Rajoutez  a un humour trs sympa, une dure de vie colossale avec deux millions de choses  faire et des graphismes accrocheurs, bien que le jeu tourne malheureusement en une rsolution moisie genre 640 par mes couilles, comme en 1994, remember.

In regards to the negative reviews:
If this is not the way that you remember the original three Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, with bad physics and all, then please tell me what games you were playing and remembering. If this HD remaster has ruined" your childhood memories so much

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I am a person who LOVES Tony Hawk games. I've played and beaten every single one, (Save Ride & Project 8, but do those really count?) so I was super stoked to try this one out.
this was not made clear to me, so I'm going to bold this out for people;
THIS IS NOT A PORT OR GRAPHICAL UPDATE, IT IS A NEW ENGINE WITH THE SAME MAPS
why is this such a big deal? It feels different. For someone who spent 100's of hours with THPS 1 & 2 this is a huge deal. It just doesn't play the same, and that breaks it for me. There are just so many things wrong with this game.
-only single player available
-no re-mapping controls
-the only graphics option is to change your resolution
-they've taken out the option to skip  songs (why?) & They've added a lot of new ones that suck.
-They've taken out the park editor from thps2
-I run into physics glitches all the time

A port or re-release of the original games even with no HD update would have been 900X better than this, this is a poorly made, rushed-feeling wanna be remake of a classic that deserves better.

What DO I recommend? Buy or download one of the official tony hawk PC releases, or buy a Dreamcast of Craigslist and google how to burn the games yourself.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
In a day before games kept track of hours played, I'd estimate my time spent across the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) series in the 1000s of hours.  I fully completed and became proficient at games 1-8 in the series.  At the time, I thought 8 (the first entry on the PS3) was so poor that I couldn't bring myself to suffer through 9.  And then I played this disaster, which makes the constant issues/glitches in 8 feel like I was complaining about nothing.

Let's cut right to the chase.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is not the same game as the old THPS games.  The game was rebuilt from the ground up and does not feel like the old series.  While the PS2 iterations became progressively less inspired and lazy as the numbers climbed to 5, 6, 7, at least the game always FELT the same.  This feels totally different and the best way I can describe it is clunky.  I made an effort to max Tony Hawk's stats because I thought maybe it feels like garbage because my stats are so low."  I got close

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I want to tell you to buy this because its a lot of fun.  I want to tell you about all the nostalgia.

I don't want to tell you about the lack of multiplayer.  I don't want to tell you about the poor and sometimes buggy physics.

I enjoy this game, its okay, but nothing special.  Buy it for nostalgia and nothing else.

The best skating game on the PC in the past 5 years.

It's most likely also the only skating game for the PC in the past 5 years.

Childhood memory desecration simulator

The physics are glitchy and broken, you don't even need to buy the THPS3 Revert pack to get revert since its now implented in the game completely. That means in the revert pack, you're basically paying 5$ for a few THPS3 levels. Coming from a THPS veteran, I would say this game is mediocre and not worth your time. Maybe for some laughs, but the Unreal engine is the wrong engine for this game. RIP Neversoft.

EDIT: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is bad as well. Thanks for killing the series Robomodo

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Faithful to a fault, and doesn't live up to the potential this could've had.  I'm only an hour in, but I'm confident that's an accurate portrayal of the game.

This (with it's DLC) feels more or less like a mish-mash of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, 2 and 3 with HD graphics.  If they had taken everything from these games and thrown it into one amazing release, it probably would've done better critically.  Instead they hand picked certain levels, hand picked certain skaters, lost a good chunk of the original soundtracks (mostly due to licensing issues), ditched the multiplayer found in the originals (local or online), ditched any kind of create-a-skater and called it a day.  It doesn't feel like the complete" collection it could've been.  Like a greatest hits collection from a band that doesn't include all of their biggest songs

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Horrendously buggy, awful physics and lacking in the charm that Tony Hawks' games used to always deliver on. Feels more like a tech demo 'what if' than a full release game, but I guess the only thing in its favour is the low price.

I bought this for nostalgia, but all I found was despair.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
The Tony Hawk series was once one of th sports titles to look out for every year. However, after the seventh installement, the series went in idiotic directions with a pack-in skateboard that was worse than the Wii Balance Board. After 2 failed games that were playable with that board, Activision decided it was best to go back to the roots of the series. Remaking some of the levels of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and packaging them together as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD. The idea is great, but they screwed it up.

The controls suck. I tried to play this game with a keyboard and with a controller, but both times the game did not feel as smooth as the originals did. There are a lot of glitches and the graphics are horrible. I also wondered why they didn't just remake every level instead of just a few.

This PC-port is the worst. You cannot change the keyboard controls, there are no video options to speak of, the resolution is not even Full HD and there is NO Multiplayer... really?? I grabbed the old Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 box for PC from my shelf and that version had Online Multiplayer... that was 1999.

If you're curious about the Tony Hawk series or you're a fan.. in either case, stay away.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
It is horrible. It feels nothing like the original, characters are floaty, no multiplayer, no video settings, ONLY RESOLUTION, and awkward response times. Stay far away!

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Man, wasn't this game a massive disappointment. As someone who loves THPS 2-4, this game was a huge letdown. First of all, the controls are absolutely trash, and you CANNOT rebind them. They really should have just stuck to the THPS2 controls, as those felt absolutely fine, but here trying to do tricks just comes off as awkward. Second, they add some of the worst maps from THPS 1 & 2 (Mall, Downhill Jam, Venice Beach mainly). Third, reverts came in a DLC, which is unforgivable. Reverts are what made vert viable for combos past just ending them. Not adding them makes grab tricks almost useless. all of this, and the game doesn't even look that good, it looks like it could have been made 2007-2008. Dont bother with THPS HD, it's not very good, and will only make you want to play the originals. It feels as if little time and effort went into this reboot which could have been great had it just been a new THPS game that returned to it's roots of fun, satisfying arcade styled gameplay.

4/10

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
If you miss the old school THPS this will be a nice nostalgic romp.
It contains multiple levels and characters from the first few games with those same controls and functions perfectly with my controller.
I know people have their complaints, but really all I can whine about is:
Why the hell isn't this on Steam Workshop? Seriously, I miss the old level editor on THPS2.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Worst. Remake. Ever.

- Default control setup is changed to some seriously ed up settings, and you can't change them from the game (editing configuration files you can, but is that really something to be expected from game this new?
- Maps are ed up (smaller, uglier and full of bugs)
- No character editing, map editing, or any freaking options. You can change resolution and sound volume. This is not a potatobox360, this is PC. This is unforgiveable.
- Added only  music, and you can't skip them.

+ Original songs also included. That's the only good thing in this game.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
They updated the graphics but downgraded the gameplay. The original THPS2 gameplay felt way better than this HD remakes gameplay. E.g. they somehow couldn't get proper nollie flips done. Basically you do a nollie but then the flip animation is the one of a regular flip trick. Although I undestand that this issue isn't noticable or bothering for many players, to me it is a major flaw. Especially if you consider that THPS2 already did its flip trick animations perfectly fine 12 years before this remake was made. I would choose playing the old graphics with the old gameplay of THPS2 over the ones of the remake any time.
Summarizing my experience with THPS HD, I can't say it was worth the time. To me it is nothing but a pretty lazy remake and an even lazier try to cash in on the good name of the old THPS titles.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This buggy piece of crap is an insult to the original series. Worse than any other THPS game and highly not recommended !

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
If you are an old school type of guy who played Pro Skater series in your childhood all the way till now, you will be heavily dissapointed in what this game is. An abdomination with only the character names being the link to previous titles. It does not deserve to be called a Pro Skater game.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Being a fan of the classic TH games I had to check this one out.  THPSHD uses maps from TH1 and 2 (not counting the DLC in this review) as well as the placement of objectives in this undignified remaster. After hearing me say undignified, you may think that I resent this game and think that it should burn in hell for all eternity. IMO, I do not, but it seriously lacks the dignity and respect that Neversoft originally had for the series back in its hayday.

First things first, I bought this game when it was on steam sale for $5, so pricing is not an issue on that end, especially when Robomodo (the developers that took over the TH franchise since TH Ride) sold TH5 for $60, a unhinged pile of . At first i was going to let this one pass as a silly game that would eventually be fixed in the long run, until they pulled the same  on the full retail priced game. But enough of the price on this, lets dive in to the actual game.

the good: For the most part it is a classic TH game with all obectives pretty much in the same place and alot of classic 90s tunes like Superman make a return. Another thing to note is the return of the upgrade with cash system that was used in TH2, which is a nice return to form, also there is an upgraded roster, but lets be honest, if certain skaters are missing, im less likely to care. The last thing i say that is good are the returning levels, like The Warehouse(TH1), The School(TH2),  and The Hanger(TH2). I wish there was more good i could say about it, but that would pretty much be lying at this point.

The Bad: For such a game that could of taken the best ideas from the classic games, Robomodo (and Activision) decided to go the cheap route and make this game as short and barren as they possibly could to maximize profit. This makes me sad because the classics had much replayablility without feeling as repetitive. First thing I am going to hit, is how barren the game is, which is only seven levels long... Seriously... seven? That's it? No Roswell, NM? or Outer space? No Skate street?  Um.. okay. Unfortunately, thats not how shallow this game is. Remember multiplayer back in the ps1 days? Yeah those days are gone. Remember Leaderboards? Yeah, i do too... and its not in here either...How about creating your own skate park? Forget about it! Creating your own skater?  off! Wanna know what we get instead?  Big Head Survival, which is meh okay, and Hawkman...totally sucks. But wait, we havent even gotten to the best part! The physics engine! Oh man...suuuuuucks. Wtf do you think you're doing robomoto? Making a satire of Goat Simulator? I'll admit it's really funny at first, but it gets really tiresome after an hour.

One last thing, which i wont let effect my scoring of this game, but there was one level I left off of the list because i was so disappointed by what was done to it. Marsailles, France used to be my favorite level with how it was a tournament like level between you and the npcs (which you never see skate) that lasts a minute each run and you have to use your best tricks to outbeat your opponent. Well what do you get if you win? Well, a cash prize and a gold medal, which lead to future rewards. Turning my favorite level into a bland objective made me run out of steam in the end and i stopped giving a .

Overall, if you want to check this one out, wait until it is on sale for $5, or better yet, if you own a ps3, buy the classics used for $5 or less on amazon or ebay, and know what true classics are instead of living in a pipe dream with this one.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This game got a lot of bad rap when it came out. Why? No multiplayer. Does anyone remember playing multiplayer in any of Tony Hawk's previous games? No. They don't. Sure, there's no create-a-park or -skater modes, but that's why it's 15 dollars. Buy this if you want to sate that inner-skater that has lied dormant since 2005.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
A incredibly mediocre Port/Remake of the first 2 THPSs, it's buggy, barely has any content and the content that is there isn't that great (Venice is the worst ing level why is it always a recurring level???).

Also Reverts are seperate DLC so amusingly Tony Hawk himself is actually one of the worst characters without stat points because you can't combo in Verts.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This game ruined my childhood, Don't you think about touching this game. It's dreadful remake & THPS will never be the same again after playing this poop.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
An old popular skateboarding game got a remake recently, Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD. Negatively received in countless sites is it really disappointing? Read on to find out!
Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD is a skateboarding game developed by Robomodo. This game takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience for the PC.

You probably remember playing this masterpiece with your friends overnight just to hit that perfect combo and feel awesome. Now in stunning visuals, the game tries hard to deliver perfection but falls short at times - stick with me while I explain why.

Gameplay:This game is all about skating around the levels, mastering ramps, nailing those tricks and ultimately stacking up the biggest combo to earn the best score you can. The game kicks off with a variety of old faces to choose from with the worlds biggest skate pros round out the cast including: Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and of course -Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has over 8 boards, 3 special moves, and an alternate outfit.

Normally you start the career, choose a level and spawn at a fixed place in that level. From there, you  skate and explore around the level to find things you need to complete a task from your list of objectives. Once you complete a certain number of tasks, the next level unlocks ready to be skated out.

Each level has its own unique tasks to complete, once you complete them you earn cash with which you can buy skills, decks or special tricks. Upon completing the whole career mode you'll unlock the second for your character, while another mode unlocks - Projectives mode which requires 100% objective completion across every map (gaps aren't counted). This mode is the same as career mode but offers difficult challenges for those real Pro Skaters.

This game also has the old school free-skate mode where you can explore every unlocked level to find new gaps or hidden areas. Beside free-skate there are also Hawkman and Big Head Survival mode. In Hawkman you have to collect pellets in various ways, they all have different colors and all need a special way to get to clarify this let me explain, red pellets are only collectable during jumps, yellow during grinds, and so on.

In Big Head Survival all you have to do is keep your head growth below 100% or it will explode.. with the typical grow....expand...EXPLODE!. In order to prevent your head from bursting you have to chain combo's and long ones at that otherwise you'll fail and end up without a head not pretty. Both of these modes are great to play because they test your skills and wits. Graffiti mode also makes a return where you gotta nail combos and touch objects, upon completing the combo anything you've touched will change into your characters designated colour, the catch of this mode is to tag more objects than your opponents.

Content:The content of this game is worth for it's price, you get a selection of pro skater levels and it has steam achievements. The new DLC is on it's way.

The length of the game is 10-30 hours, depending on what you do in-game. If you just rush through the career you will finish the game in 10 hours, if you are an achievement enthusiast and want to master everything you'll easily clock 30 hours. Again, it all depends on your personal way of going about with the game.

For me it took 30 hours to get every achievement and game modes (beside hawkman) cleared.

Graphics:The game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo, using Neversofts original level models. All I can say is.. well done Robomodo! We finally have the HD version of the game we've been waiting for (or atleast the die-hard THPS fans). During the exploration of levels you'll just LOVE the sweet and eye-pleasing textures of the game. Everything I remember from the old games is so great to see in HD.

But still there is one thing, just a little thing I didn't like and that is the rag-doll physics in this game. This is just weird, sometimes you just hang around somewhere the other time you have a long neck...you know, graphical glitches.

In the old version when you bailed you'd fall on the ground, grab your board and continue riding, but here when you bail you'll face a white screen and respawn.. I have to say, it's not pretty. Even the blood has been reduced significantly.

Sound:This game has a great soundtrack, it is half classic THPS tracks and half new ones. Still I would love to see more variation of music added and the ability to skip a song like in the old games. Some of the returning tracks are Superman by Goldfinger, Bring the Noise by Public Enemy ft. Anthrax while the newly added tracks are quite good too like Teenage Blood by Apex Manor and many others.


Conclusion:Gameplay: 8/10
+ Addictive if you played the old games
+ Loads of pro-skaters to play with, as well as unlockable bonus skaters
- Sometimes it's hard to complete a level

Content: 6/10
+ Old tony hawk's pro skater levels in HD
+ New game-modes added in singleplayer
+ New upcoming DLC introduces the Revert from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (ETA: December 2012)
- No Multiplayer or LAN (just for the PC version)
- No Scoreboards of friends
- Not able to configure or change your controls / graphic settings (needed to be done through a 3rd party launcher or just change the .ini file)

Graphics: 8/10
+ Great HD upgrade since the old games
- Physics are sometimes weird

Sound: 7/10
+ Great music to listen during skateboarding
- More variation of music

Overall Rating: 7/10
A great skateboard game that all Tony Hawks lovers should play at least once to feel how this game really is.

Loads of people disliked this game but I can't see why. Personally I don't really need a multiplayer in this game just old school skating is enough to keep me happy, you could play it with friends in the same room (just passing the controller to each other). Anyway, if you've enjoyed THPS 1 & 2 it's time to grab the remastered version and relive your childhood, or even if you're a newcomer to the series then this is the best time to start your THPS journey.

NOTE: Old review i wrote for a website.

Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD.

Do I recommend this game?? No.

This game handles like a PC port of a mobile port of a Dreamcast game.

The Unreal Engine makes the unrealistic huge combos much harder, it slows the game down to a half.
The Tony Hawk games are funny because you do stuff you can't do in real life, I can't jump off a roof and do a 720 Melon into a Manual, but i can sit down for a few hours, get a 10 million combo and then be happy with that.
But in this game it feels like a chore, it's just not fun to play Downhill Jam over and over again.

I got 100% achievements in around 8 hours of playing, most of them came easy to me, but I can see some of them being hard to get for people who arent used to the game series.

This does not feel like a mix of the first two Pro Skater games, the mechanics are the same (with reverts added, they came from THPS 3) but it feels more like Project 8 and Proving Ground, fans of the series know that isn't a good thing

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I CANNOT recommend this game. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
Yes, yes new graphics. The graphics are really nice actually but the gameplay and the PHYSICS!
Glitching through Rails, in the ground, random falls.
You need to go into the Config in the Datafiles to change it to a proper Resolution.
No ing Multiplayer/Splitscreen or Create a Park/ -Skater.


Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Simply Awesome!
First of all i played the most Tony Hawks that came out in the past years and if you're looking for an evolution of the Tony Hawks series your wrong in buying this game.

In my Opinion its a nostalgic feeling to play the game. So its not the new and improved skatinggame" but a pretty good remake of some of the elder games with awesome graphics

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This game is kind of fun for the first hour or so, then that is where the cracks begin to show.

I was a big fan of the first 4 games in the series and was looking forward to visiting some of those levels again, and for a while i thought it was okay. Eventually you begin to realise the collision detection is not as it should be and you will find yourself bailing and clipping through walls quite a lot, regardless of how well you executed a trick. When you need to grind specific rails or transfer between certain verts, the game doesn't always detect it properly, which can lead to a lot of frustration. In certain instances i found the game wouldn't detect when i wanted to jump over a vert rather than come back down on it again; other times i would go to grind a rail, end up clipping it, being inside" it and would bail trying to get myself out of it.

The "Big Drop" mechanic seemed really hit or miss a lot too

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
First off, do NOT get this game if you don't have a controller. That being said, it's alright. Not good, just sort of meh".

The game was only $10 usd so I had no problem forking over the cash. Plus

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This IS my Childhood!
If you grew up in the 90's as a teenager this was yours too!!
This game brings some of the best levels from THPS (1999), THPS2 (2000) & THPS3 (2001) and meshes them all together with a *few* new additions to make this the remake made of all wetdreams.

If you don't like this game, it's because it wasn't made for you.
This game was made for the Day 1 Skateboard game players from the 1998 Playstation era. This game came out originally when Marilyn Manson, Deftones, Slipknot, Powerman 5000 & Otep were the best metal bands ever!!!

Play this game with that music and sit your  down for a travel back in time, HD Style!!! This is a remake, graphical wise, but nothing else changed.... that's exactly the way it should be!!!!
_____
8.5/10
_____

CONS:
- Music soundtrack could have been alot better (the left out Papa Roach, Static-X, Mudvayne, Korn and a couple other artist that I know for sure were on the official game soundtracks from back in the day.... hell, they even left out Goldfinger)

- Achievements are poorly put together, the 8 or 9 that they do have are pretty boring to a go after, alot of people may feel like it's not even worht it...

- The Skaters::: why remove some of the Best skaters (Kareem Campbell, Chad Muska and others) and replace them with NON skaters like Metallica frontman James Hetfield and Guitarist Robert Trujillo ???? WHY THE F.UCK did you make a seperate DLC to charge us for Geoff Rowley & Steve Cabellero?????

- They want to take advantage of you: by making you purchase a DLC that gives you 3 levels from THPS 3 and the Revert move.... -_- ... maybe nextime you go to McDonalds they should make you pay for your cheeseburger and then charge you extra for the FU.CKING KETCHUP!!!!!! (as.sholes)

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
can i unbuy this game?


Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Very nice game, you should buy it instantly, graphic and controls nothing more has changed but its very cool, if you want the old controls back follow my guide.

BUY IT!

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Is it terrible? No. But it is a remake that is actually worse than any other.

Usually a remake is taking what was, and adding just enough to make it better. They took alot of the original boarders off, like Kareem Campbell and Bam, and added others I never even heard of.

First play on the first level, I managed to fall on the top of the half pipe going to jump(which in every other game would land perfect) I tripped over air, and fell through the entire floor.

I understand the original didn't have switchs between grinds and manuals, but I would assume a remake would keep it as a improvement.

I would rate this a 6/10. I played so many tony hawk games from first one on n64, to THUG 1 and 2 on ps2. I never played one like this. Pro skater 3 will remain my favorite.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
There are no skateboarding Hawks. do not be fooled

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
If you have nostalgia for the early Tony Hawk games, and believe me no-one has more than me, You might want this game.

You shouldn't get it though. The whole thing feels spongy, the controls not as tight as they should be, and the balance system is heavily flawed. It will practically auto bail you If you attempt to get a combo going fort longer than 15 seconds or so.

The Remade levels aren't bad, but the actual skating and trick engine is nowhere near the originals and you'll be disappointed. Go find a copy of THPS2 and play that instead, it still works OK on Win7.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I can't say this clear enough...

You won't get warm tingly nostalgic feelings.  Instead you'll get your hopes up.  The sound barely ever works correctly.  Typically its extremely quiet until you hit on object (glass) and then its deafening loud.  The community had to find fixes for resolution and controls.

To top it all off the game randomly just will drop your save.  Absolutely a waste of time and one of the biggest dissapointments in a video game I've ever experienced.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Pretty bad Tony game.  The speed is gimped and the physics are very random.  You may go flying, and you may not.  It is pretty though, and they did acquire the licensing to play Superman" by Goldfinger."

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
this game has bad physics, tricks are hard to land, its not fluid like in old TH games. bad balance bar can't do long combos because of that. as an old Tony Hawk player i can't recommend this game. Tony Hawk series ended at Tony Hawk's Proving Ground.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Great to go back and play on classic tony hawk maps
My only issue is that i only ever had the first game for N64 and there aren't enough maps from the first game IMO

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I used to love the anachy" and the all the possible combinations just alone to build your skater.
Here.
This game.. Reminds me mostly of some sort of computerizede version of a (bad) iOS/Android game (Freemenium?)

What im trying to say is.. It SUCKS this game
Its boring

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
The game is just a empty shell of it former self, it try's to look the same sounds the same (sorda) but its doesn't feel the same. Gameplay wise pro skater hd is much slower then pro staker 2 and 3 (thanks unreal engine god go die in a fire), the ragdoll physics are the most annoying thing, in the the old  t.h games if your skater falls on his butt he's right back on feet in like moment but in pro skater hd it takes for ever for him to get up and waste time specialy when you are to do a objective and you only have 2 mins to do it.
The level selection form tony hawk 1 is the most confusing thing ever, this supose the best selections of levels form tony hawk 1 and 2  so why in gods name is the Mall and Downhill Jam levels that no one enjoys.
Music wise most of the songs form pro skater 2 (there is only one song from tony hawk 1)  make a return but the new track are okayish nothing bad but nothing  special either

NO CHARTECER CREATOR AND NO PARK EDITOR.   ........ WHYYYYYYYYYYYY ?

Overall this game is not worth your time and money, you might as well buy a copy of pro skater 2 on pc since it works on windows 7 64bit

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews on this game. I remember playing through the entire series when they all came out and then I forgot about this series. I saw this game on sale and I bought it for the nostalgia factor. The remake had almost everything that one would want. They include about half the levels from each of the first two games and you can pay extra to get 3 levels from the third (I did because I thought the third game was awesome. My gripe is more with the DLC in that you pay half as much as you did for the game but only get a small fraction of the levels you did with the game. The controls work well, the game supported my 360 controller. I played through the entire game, and had the same amount of difficulty as the old ones, where the levels get progressivly harder and you can never really master the game.

In the end, I like the game and would recomend it. I hope they make a new game or add levels available for purchase (hopefully better value for the dollar than the current DLC). Even at full price this game is worth it.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I put off buying this game, even though I loved the classics, because of the bad reviews. When the sale came on I finally said whatever and bought it. The game is awesome, plays just like the old school game, except with much improved graphics. I don't get what these crybabies are talking about. This isn't a revamp of the series. It's the old school game you loved to play for hours on end. My only critisism is I wish it was longer because it's so fun to play, but there is still a lot of playtime and fun packed into this game, and at the price, it's a no brainer. Ignore the neck beards and get it.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Imagine an alternate universe in which Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was never released. (To start with, if such a universe sounds like hell to you, you may want to buy this game.) All the blueprints for THPS and THPS2 were lying around, and years later, a Chicago developer picked them up and thought, yeah

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
Terrible port, I bought it thinking it would bring back memories playing THPS1 and 2 on PS1/PS2, the good music is gone, the levels don't feel the same anymore either. Do not buy, I forgot to refund it within the 2 weeks so i'm stuck with a bad purchase I may only play to get my moneys worth

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
5/5 Koska kaatumiset !

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I was very disappointed in this game, i don't know how they managed mess up what should have been an easy hd port. They have changed all the interesting objectives to collect 5 of these". You are 100% better off playing the originals on the ps2 or gamecube!"

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
The best skating game for PC I know ! They need more maps tought !

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
This isn't the end all be all of Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. It's a modest remake of some of the classic games for modern hardware on a modern game engine. It has a handful of iconic maps and all together makes for a pretty enjoyable expience for the price. Sure it's missing multiplayer and create a park/skater but serves for some good fun as long as you take it at face value.

With the DLC it took roughly 7 hours to do just about everything there is to do in the game but I still go back to it occasionaly to play a couple rounds and I definitely feel I got my money's worth.

Tony Hawks Pro Skater HD
I was excited to finally play THPS:HD, but immediately regretted my purchase before I was in game.  I was greeted with a 'Powered by Unreal Engine' splash, meaning this is a completely different engine, and then a 'Robomodo' splash, which while I already expected that, was still disappointing to see.  For some background - Robomodo are the people behind the Tony Hawk games that used those plastic motion control boards.

Gameplay:
The balance system is completely terrible, making it impossible for long combos.  In the previous games, every time you would grind or manual in a combo, your balance meter would be slightly reset.  In this game, the balance stays the same until your combo ends, meaning if you jump off a rail and then grind back on, you will most likely bail unless your balance was perfect.

The skater is incredibly slow, and grinding 90% of the time will only make him slower.  Moving just feels slippery and clunky.  Reverts require a DLC, and even then it's just as poorly implemented as the other mechanics.

Levels:
The levels look pretty nice and are spot on with the games they are replicating, though the goals themselves are lazily done.  For example, the competitions are replaced with just collecting 'competition medals' around the map in levels like Marseille.  In the THPS3 DLC maps there's no photo-related goals, and levels like LA have things like the car chase replaced with collecting items around the map.

Conclusion:
In terms of a remake, it just feels like an incomplete skating game with THPS levels and characters.  It doesn't play like a THPS game, it doesn't have mechanics introduced in the games (which are over a decade old), and just altogether isn't very fun to play.

I've tried multiple times to enjoy this game, but I can't.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

First Impressions:
For an early access game this game is already really playable as the sandbox mode works just fine. See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.

Your Ship:
Upgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.

Your Crew:
Yes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station/planet offers different crews with different skills.

Gameplay:
Random missions are generated all the time wich includes simple go there and shoot.." missions

Starpoint Gemini 2
This was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain/pirate.  There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've  off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.

Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?

It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.

Spaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space? (mine's space)

Starpoint Gemini 2
TL;DR: At the verrry bottom, ya heathens!

This game, wow. It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.

I bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him.

So far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.

You have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?
Also you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.

Even combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane Let's Moon'm" cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

So, you've played Freelancer, Wing Commander or Privateer. Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!!

Beta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome.

Theres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.

Perhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields.

You can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you.
Sounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight.

Seriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.
This game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!

Starpoint Gemini 2	(Updated review!)
======================================

LGM Games successful debut title, Starpoint Gemini, an RPG tactical sim set in a unique SciFi setting was released in 2010. It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.

On a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...

======================================

Pros	+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!
+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.
+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.
+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!
+Combat in big ships with fleets...
+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...
+Very well done Faction system
+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities
+Developer support that sets a new standard
+Best Community on Steam
+Awesome Replay value!
+Free content updates

ConsNone really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)

Neutral+/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)

======================================

Introduction
Starpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...

======================================

Game-play
I have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.

I played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you dont have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)

When you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...

Mastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.

This game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.

I mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, youll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.

======================================
======================================

Conclusion
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals. There is a true sense of adventure as you discover new areas of the star chart, with opportunity and danger lurking around every corner so you are constantly encouraged to build yourself up in terms of power, wealth, and relationships with the various factions.

LGM and its great team have created an instant classic that will be around for many years....

======================================

Starpoint Gemini 2
150+ Games in my account. This is the first one that makes me write a review:

+Addictive Gameplay
+Beautiful Graphics
+Amazing Soundtrack
+Awesome Community
+Sleepless, highly motivated Devs that listen to this awesome community


+/-There's no real Build your Empire" aspect as in the X-Series (yet) (Since I loved Freelancer

Starpoint Gemini 2
I have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC/Privateer/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.

PROS:

++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.

++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.

++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...

++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.

++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.

++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!

CONS:

++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad  with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is.

++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.

++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.

++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you.

I give this game an honest 10/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an easy button" but for me it really makes the game. (i'm old... ;) )"

Starpoint Gemini 2
SHORT SUMMARY:
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a bit shallow and a bit pricey for what it offers, but it is still enjoyable. Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.

However, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!
----------
LONGER REVIEW:

The good:

Visuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it.

The game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun.

The not-so-good:

The story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay.

Side-story missions boil down to repair structure there for $$$ and XP" or "kill enemies here for $$$ and XP" or "ferry person over there for $$$ and XP" with little fanfare. After you finish the main story

Starpoint Gemini 2
Overall the game is pretty awesome, but it could use some polish.


PROS:

Nice variety of skills and perks available.

Great variety of factions and areas of control.

Good selection of ships.

Can capture enemy ships.

Like the blueprints idea.

Like the compare weapons and ships.


CONS:

Traveling over 10 units takes a couple minutes.

There are four equipment slots to use and only about four that I found were actually useful, ie. shield recharge, strengthen attack, scavenger bots, hull repairs.  Even then, I rarely ever use them.

Crew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.

Blueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.

The only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.

Level 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.

Travelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.

Cannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.  Crew losses will occur if the captured ship has less.

There are three kinds of heavy weapons, but I failed to see any real difference in shockwave damage.

Exploding ships nearby do no damage.

Has lag and slowdowns most of the time.


SUGGESTIONS:

Make traveling without gates a little faster when in full engine mode.

Make some artifacts that last indefinitely / bonuses or useables that fit in equipment slots.

Change the decimal enhancement descriptions, eg. 0.5, with percentage values, eg. 50%.

Please fix weapon range.  Bonuses are not being counted.

Add a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.

Give a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.

Show radiation areas on the map.

Show map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.

Allow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.

Make plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.

Make lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.

Make railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.

Do a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.

Fix the pathfinding.

Improve AI for wanted bounties.

Starpoint Gemini 2
My initial reaction to the game was Wow

Starpoint Gemini 2
OK. this is awesome!! Think Eve Offline. From mining to full combat you are not constrained in any way, you can be a pirate, trader, miner, fighter, merc, whatever you want to be!

Starpoint Gemini 2
This is from a post I did on the forum and decided to add it here following a suggestion to do so.

SPG 2 The Good, the Bad, Oh God the Insanity


If youre on the fence as to whether you should get this or not it will all come down to what you are looking for in a space game.
This is not Eve Online so get that out of your head. Seriously, if you want EO youll need to go log into EO. There is no online multiplayer, no gate camping players, no griefers and no gankers.
That being said, this game offers something EO and many others, online or not, have simply forgotten or just dont care about. Interactive Devs.
Yep, you read that correctly. The Devs are extremely active in the forums. Id hazard a guess and say 99% of all issues, questions, comments etc. are answered near instantly.
They take concerns very seriously and look for ways to address them as quickly as possible, faster even it seems.
While this isnt to say other Devs arent around, personal experience has shown they just dont answer, are too busy, dont care and on more than one occasion are downright obnoxious and rude.

So +1 for Dev support seemingly 24hrs a day every day

Community holy crap, where to begin

There are a lot of helpful people. One or two I have noticed try to step in when the Devs FINALLY get some sleep. This doesnt mean there arent more filling in those roles, only that I cant read, re-read, and re-re-read each and every post over and over to see who is filling those roles. Though, I will admit, sometimes the forum reading is an exercise in hilarity.
Serious questions for the most part get serious answers. Once in a while they spiral out of control with loose jokes, odd references and such, though more or less after the issue has been handled.
Remember the active Devs from earlier? Yeah they contribute too.
Dont be surprised to find one or more of them plowing into your thread to partake of whatever silliness is afoot. Oh yes, my friend, they are characters indeed.
On the whole, the community is developing into a large group of knowledgeable friendly people looking to help out any way they can. Yes, some can be offended easily, but I have yet to see an all-out flame war like everywhere else. In fact, most people just apologize if they upset someone and move on, including myself.

So +1 for a truly friendly and helpful community.

Graphics
Nothing that will stress your system too terribly. High end or low end, it seems everyone can find a setting that fits the bill and allows them to play. I have seen one or two instances where certain systems (read Laptops) refuse to allow the game to run, but I have yet to see more than those.
Even then, the Devs are still trying to figure out how to get it working on those couple of problem machines. Interesting, since most would just tell you that your system doesnt have what it takes and to go get something bigger.
All in all, the graphics are very nice indeed. Nothing mottled, disjointed or misaligned. No missing pixels here and there or stand in objects for missing items.

So +1 there for that

NPCs
What do you expect? They are NPCs. They shoot at you, they kill you and they keep doing it. Unless you kill them first, in which case, they die rather well and dont whine about it. I seem to remember an account of griefing done by NPCs, though I believe that was a one-off. Funny though.
They get tougher as you progress through the game. Different levels, different types and different areas. They fight each other if they are opposing factions and will turn on you if you are low enough rep with one, or both. In which case, run.

So I give a +1 for good NPC mechanics.

Missions
Lots of them. They are everywhere in both aspects of the game. Free play or Story line there are tons. Decent rewards for the time invested as far as I can tell, probably a bit too decent considering some missions you just have to click a button and repair something.

Ill give a +1 here too.

Storyline
For as much as I have done, it progresses well. Seems to have substance and a bit of plot for as far as I have gotten.
But
It is buggy. Missions sometimes fail out. Sometimes you overshoot a zone and they get canceled, dropping you out of the storyline and into free play mode. Other times, you just crash out of the game.
They are working on the bugs as fast as they are made aware of them and that helps out a lot. More often than not, you can just reload from a save point and try to continue.

No points for this one, still needs work.

Mods

There are more than a few. Something for everyone I suppose. Uber ship, got it. More money, got it. Star Trek themed ships, go those too.
From Star Trek to vastly improve (overpowered) beginning station inventories, there is something to fit most everyone.
The game has a mod community growing faster than the game itself. Even at least one mod I saw that will completely change the game to Mass Effect themed ships and even a new storyline that appears to be in the works.
The Devs seem to support unlimited, no holds barred modding.

So definitely +1 here.

Oh, lest I forget...

Community input...

Look in the game. Look at achievements and improvements. You will see all the signs of active community involvement that has been taken seriously. (mostly)

Yeah, +100 and some Oreos for all you community peoples that report bugs, request content changes and overall general improvements.

All in all, for me, this has been one hell of a ride and its just beginning. The game is only getting better and more is on the way.
If youre on the fence, get off it. Buy the game and join the fun in the community.

And the insanity? Glad you asked...

There are the elite few who can claim this. They watch you at home while you play. They see you in your boxers. They wear your boxers, like I am right now. The Devs are part of this group, I know one, whom I shall leave nameless, who has watched me in my boxers. Yes, some of us are insane... And that is the fun of it all.

Sincerely,
Virikas

P.S. +1000 to the Devs for allowing us to be insane, taking us seriously when needed and for being on top of everything, everywhere, all at once, every day... always.

Now... which one of you took my boxers, Meep.

Early Access Review

This is a very entertaining space game with a healthy side order of role playing and is pretty well polished even at this early access stage. The developers have a genuine rapport with the community and this is helping to shape a very enjoyable game. Until the final product release and all features and story campaign are implemented there is still a lot to enjoy in the sandbox mode. If you like beautiful ships, trading, chasing anomalies, blowing up asteroids and firing lasers at baddies theres a lot to like. The music is awesome too.

Starpoint Gemini 2
This game has come a long way since its beginning and it's still going strong. For me personally it went to overwhelmingly frustrating to awesomely enjoyable. The devs are super responsive and really care about the community. Keep in mind this is a tactical combat sim with trading aspects. There is a living economy, but personally I never paid any attention to it.

Destroy enemy ships, capture enemy ships, loot enemy ships, grapple enemy ships, hack enemy ships. Do whatever it takes to defeat the enemy. Expansive map with plenty of variety to keep you exploring. Ships, officers, mercenaries, trading opportunities, weapons, weapon enhancements, system enhancements, equipment, etc.

This game is an awesome space game in terms of what its selling point is: a tactical combat RPG space sim.

Starpoint Gemini 2
** A gorgeous space game marred by painful lore elements.**
[[Recommendation comes with strong suggestion to play in sandbox mode only]]

This game was an odd experience.  The longer I played it, the less I liked it.

When it started, it took me back to the wonder of games like Privateer.  Sandbox, big galaxy, lots of options.  And it's really gorgeous, from the ships to the planets to the nebulous backgrounds.  Some of space stations look oddly low-res compared to everything else, but that's minor.

However, things went downhill when I started to follow the main story campaign.  The voice acting is truly atrocious, and the writing isn't much better, from the minor (bad grammar) to the median (dialogue) to the major (an incoherent plot with characters whose motives don't seem to correspond to events).  And when you get to a more difficult mission that you have to try several times, the lack of any button to skip the dialogue becomes truly unforgivable.

Speaking of retrying, there are several design decisions that make sense on their own, but quickly become annoying when you have to replay a mission because it's difficult or bugged (like the infamous mothership mission).  First, you can save only at stations or planets.  OK, there's a sort of 'realism' sense to that.  Second, there's a lot of empty space between points of interest.  That actually worked for me at first, because it added to the sense of scale and exploration.  But when you have to retry a mission and reload to find you are about a 5 minute cruise from the action -- and then remember that you'll have to sit through 3 more minutes of unskippable community theatre auditions when you get there -- it gets really difficult to stick with it for the next attempt.

There were also a number of minor annoyances, like the fact that missions seem to get reset when you load a game (so if you pick up someone or something to deliver, you must do it before you end your current session or forever have that passenger or item in your non-cargo inventory), some inscrutable elements, several mechanics that seemed incomplete, and a handful of crash bugs.

I think there are the ingredients of a good game here, with a good core and beautiful graphics, but the lore side of things really lets those elements down.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to ignore the story and play only in sandbox mode.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Well...the game looks nice but is actually quite boring. Here is why:

1. Unengaging story

The story consists of a lot of text (white on color, not very legible) and really really atrocious voice acting (which sometimes just cuts out). There are so many factions with text descriptions I did not bother to read all of them. Honestly I did not understand half of it because I have not played the predecessor. The game did not present its universe in an engaging way.

2. Simple missions

The free missions are all randomly generated but they consist  of either go to A and kill / capture or go to A and scan / repair (same menu button) or go to A and transport to B.

The campaign missions are the same. Go to A and usually kill everything there...done. Sometimes you need to ferry stuff. But the whole involvement is detached. You arrive...the game cuts to sequence and some voice acting..suddenly to reappear with enemies around...you kill them...cut to the next short scene...done. There is no drama, no real action, no emotional involvment. I did not respond emotionally to the characters, who are just pictures with horrible accents.

Trading and mining is a horrible grind if you like it. It is certainly helpful in the beginning but not worth your time later on. Just take the kill pirates" mission and blast everything to hell.

Once I got capturing ships down...I had so much money I could have bought ships that were not yet unlocked for my character level.

3. Simple combat

Usually you fly somewhere

Starpoint Gemini 2
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space trading and combat game, think Elite or EVE. You fly around a vast galaxy, smaller than in EVE or Elite though, doing missions, trading, mining, bounty hunting, etc. Captain your ship and level your captain in a RPG-like fashion.

I turned to SG2 for that EVE Online fix. I would call it a simplistic EVE, but it's still very good to scratch that EVE itch. You can forget about the RPG system, it's so simplistic, but the rest is a full fledged space game. The game's looks take a little getting used to, coming from sharp and shiny EVE or Elite gfx, but after a while it grows on you and flying around the galaxy is as fun as usual.

Getting through the story and all dlcs can take about 50 hrs, then there's some additional hrs if you want to replay SG story in SG2 engine, and then there is freeroam. Freeroam will not be so fun after completing everything as your ship will obliterate everything that the game throws at you, but still, 50-70hrs of game time looks quite amazing considering you can get this on sale.

I liked:
* quite a large map
* lots of different ships
* large amount of weapons and enhancements
* flying in space shooting / trading / uncovering stuff!

I disliked:
* capturing ships is the only way to go if you want to make big bucks

Get this:
* if you're looking for EVE Offline and don't mind simpler experience
* if you want to fly in space and pew pew stuff

Don't get this:
* if you're looking for complex space sim

Early Access Review

The next best thing if you want something similar to Eve and Freelancer. More arcade-ish Sci-Fi space shippy RPG. Start with a small gunship, make your way up to dreadnoughts and carriers by trading, doing freelancer missions like repairing a damaged space station, transporting a VIP from A to B, getting commodities to a planet or scanning anomalies, or just hunt criminals in hopes to get a huge bounty. The game is beautifully done, has a large selection of ships and weapons, the combat is fun although some say the camera is a bit slow, and there's a lot to do in it. Buy it! Throw money at the devs!!!! DOIT!

Starpoint Gemini 2
I must preface this by saying, I don't write many reviews at all, but when I do though, it means I really enjoy the game.

This game reminds me a lot of the X3 games, but the interface is a bit easier to get a grasp on.

Pros:
- Mod support
- Great music, think Mass Effect & EVE Online style.
- You can be anyone you want, and do whatever you want, there's a campaign mode, and freeform mode.
- Nice interface.
- Beautiful graphics.
- Runs smooth, haven't experienced any crashes.
- Combat is fun.
- Controller support.
- There's a large selection of ships & weapons, and you can upgrade your ship.
- All of the above points help with immersion, you really feel like you are in space driving your own ship.
- The developers work hard and are engaged with the community.  They do have their own forums where they answer questions, etc.

Cons:
- Space can be a bit lonely at times, but, it is space after all.

TL;DR - If you're looking for a game that is part X3, part Eve Offline that can also serve as a stopgap until Star Citizen & Elite Dangerous, you could do a lot worse than this game, especially when you consider the game is currently only $28.

8/10

Starpoint Gemini 2
Loved this game. Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play  the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine.
Just like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as  was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...).
No game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!)

In short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!

Early Access Review

As a long-time fan of the great grandfathers of space trading, exploration and combat games, (Elite, Wing Commander, Privateer). I am always on the lookout for a game of this genre that has the feel and enjoyment these classics gave.

Starpoint Gemini 2 goes a long way to bringing back those days in a modern, eye pleasing, fun package that is not overly complex like some of the modern games ( later X Series, EVE Online) which although are great games and in many ways superior, probably due to much larger budgets, leave me feeling like I have just sat the final papers to a masters degree.

Starpoint Gemini 2 which is still in beta at time of writing this review, shows great promise and I eagerly look forward to the future updates and release of this enjoyably challenging game.

I hope to add additional updates to this review as new releases come out and I explore the game further.




Starpoint Gemini 2
Well-made hybrid of SG1 and Freelancer. with light RPG elements on top.
Pros
+Vast selection of ships from fighters to dreadnaughts and carriers
+Engaging combat
+diverse systems
Cons
-Lack of persistent objects. You won't see ships traveling from one system to another, because they are always generated when you enter a system.
-There is like 30 factions, but reputation system is two-dimensional. So when you help one faction you improve/worsen relation with the rest of them.
-Below average performance.
7/10 (8 of 10 if the they fix bugs and improve optimization), worth buying if you are into space genre. If you are not, you can wait for Christmas sale, a lot of things should be fixed by then.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

The playstyle is an assorted combination of the Freelancer + tactical elements of Star Wolves + diversity of EV Nova + some good original ideas on top.
Do you remember that feeling of excitement when you discover something, something that makes you feel more alive? I feel a deep immersion when playing this game which is so rare nowadays (even in alpha state atm (nov 2013), with only a basic features present). The devs put a part of their souls into creation of this, I feel it in all those small details here and there. I'm looking forward for a release, and quite positive that anyone who loves space sims" won't be disappointed with this game

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

Very good game for being in ALPHA - quite a lot has been implemented to keep you busy, and the best part is the full support for modding!

I was looking for a space game that could keep me interested, and I found it with Starpoint Gemini 2.
Fun game mechanics with a nice RPG twist.

I recommend you go check it out, and if it tickles your fancy, buy a copy before the price increases!

Starpoint Gemini 2
Enjoyed the game a lot and felt like Freelancer!
Heaps of places to explore, lots of ships and good variation of weapons and effects not just different coloured lasers.

Loved it.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Very much recommended. a very good space opera game full of originality and good ideas.
A unique RPG experience made with spaceships, and the best developer support ever.

Besides, with 861 positive reviews and some negative cretin reviews which say this does not work on XP" when XP is not supported

Starpoint Gemini 2
TL;DR version - GET IT! Fun as heck! Some minor issues and bugs but devs are hard at work on fixing them!

Ok as far as space games go, this is easy to get into" and "fun" to me. Easy once you actually READ the tutorial tips and understand how it all works. And it's fun cuz I found myself needing to "just go over to that next unexplored sector" to see what's there.

However

Starpoint Gemini 2
I wish I hadn't bought this game. I loved Freelancer and thought it would be something similar but boy was I wrong.
This game lacks any atmosphere and feeling of a space-traveling universe. Docking at stations and visiting stations is one of the most disappointing events I ever encountered in a space game. There is no radio chatter, no clearance for docking; you never hear anybody over radio nor do you see more than one or two ships (even near well populated planets!). This game feels so incredibly dead and empty, that travelling and exploring just simply isn't any fun at all. It all feels so static. Add to that that planets and stations you visit are not animated but all just have a static, bland screensaver in the background of dull buying menues. There are no bars or other places that give you the feeling of really setting a foot on a place. Rather it all feels so incredibly generic and it doesn't get better if you add the boring go there and kill pirate x"-missions that we all have seen way too often now.

This game is nowhere near Freelancer and if you look for something like that

Starpoint Gemini 2
I recommend this game because of the following

The minor bugs are actively being fixed
The devs are responding on the forums
ExplorationSpace feels large, but it's only one solar system
Plenty of travel shortcuts
The map has to be uncovered by visiting each sector
There is, sort of, an autopilot for easy travel to a waypoint
CombatCombat is fun
Auto-fire if you don't feel like aiming
The controls work well, controller support
GraphicsThe visuals look good (DirectX 11)
All of the screenshots are from the in-game engine, not works of art.
The planet-side artwork is nice
The space stations and ships are varied and have style
The game is well polished
Simple user interface
Equipment and LootThe ship fitting is pretty simple
There are multiple types of ships, weapons, and multiple styles to choose from
There is a collect all button to make looting quick
There is a quick way to sell everything in your cargo hold
OtherYou can do more than just shoot other ships
You can choose free-roam instead of doing a campaign
You can crash into a planet
Achievements with in-game bonuses
It's able to be modded
Easy to learn
Music and sound is good
It's not complicated, but I am also a fan of complicated games
What's bad about it? Not much, just things I personally prefer.  Others might consider some of these to be Pros
No multi-player options
No empire to build
Freelance missions do not have much variety.
The officer system is a little strange.  You can only hire them in their original location, they go home when you fire them, then you have to fly back there to hire them again.
You can't equip ships unless you are piloting them.  This can cause you to lose crew or be forced to sell cargo.You might like Starpoint Gemini 2 if you like these games. Freelancer, X3-series, Eve Online, and space based games in general


Starpoint Gemini 2
A good game that could have been a great game.

After several hour of play the missions quickly get repetitive. Trading and mining get boring even quicker. The real challenge of the game is capturing enemy ships (and it is the only way to make enough money to advance in the game).

The faction system didn't much much sense to me, and didn't seem very important as it was just goodies vs badies in the end.

Near the end game there was nothing to spend your cash on. The weapons at the end of the game really aren't much better than what you get 20% into the game.

The game crashes from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game thanks to the auto-save feature. It is a 32bit only game and seems to run out of virtual RAM. The developers should have also included a 64bit executable in the install package.

So, good fun for maybe 20 hours.

Some suggestions as to what would have made this a great game.
- Some ship customisation (and why can't I see the weapon arcs)
- More variety in the  enemy ships (maybe some boss ships)
- Some random system wide events. Not just random pirates
- The hacking (and anti-hacking) features making some sense. I didn't get hacked ever, but had zero protection.
- More high end weapons and gear
- The galaxy having low and high level sections rather than being seemingly mostly uniform. At the moment sectors are either friendly or impossibly hard.  I never found any netural sectors.

Early Access Review

MINDBLOWING!!
This game has everything Xrebirth failed to delivered.
Which is... EVERYTHING!

Space sim at its best!
Awesome graphics, ultra complex UI, systems, skills, perks, menues, customization and upgrades!
Frekin' beautiful soundtrack, breathtaking space surroundings, detailed ships
fully customizable with your own colours, designs and even logos and names!

Full sandbox open space with Missions, from Bounty Hunting systems, to Repair, protect, assinations and trading.
Full mining system as well, with different tools including mining torpedos!
Tons of camera views, full manual aiming to fire at will auto-weapons.
Your own crew on board, from gunships to Capital ones, fleet or trading merchants, or even engineer corvettes.

The technical aspects of this game is AAA+
Bugs? I havent found any yet, even if this game is on beta stage, which is impressive!
There is a lot of things the devs will add following community guidelines as well.
A full story-mode and MODS are on the way!

Starpoint Gemini 2 is a masterpiece, a gem, and a chef-d'oeuvre for the price.
Thank you LGM for such a polished game.
I cannot wait for you guys to implement all the goodies including achievements!

Starpoint Gemini 2
Early Access Review

For an Early Acces title a great amount of fun, quick and often updates, Freelancer-ish feeling, 3rd person flight, tactical rpg. :)

Constant devs to players interaction gives a big plus, and another bonus regarding the implementatnions of player-desired solutions, and on top of that is the MODABILITY.

If you like space games and tactics - this is one of few I'd recommend:)

Starpoint Gemini 2
Most have taken to calling this EVE offline, but I find it to be more EVE Lite or Diet EVE. Think the core concepts of EVE in an open sandbox map rather than many separate systems, but with the waiting 5 months for a skill replaced by grinding for a few hours and all the player interaction removed.

At the end of the day you're left with all the things that made EVE great, with none of the stuff that makes it only suitable for people with vast swaths of time available. You can jump in, do a quick mission, save and jump out. You don't have to worry about being dicknailed by a ship fifty levels higher than you at any given time, and you get an experience that's much more simple than EVE.

I'll reccomend it. I've come across some bugs, and the voice acting is really, really bad at times, and just pretty bad at others. Personally I think the 20 bucks out of pocket I paid (had 6 bucks steam credit) was in the right area for the game, maybe a little high. I'd say buy at 5-15 for sure and 20+ only if you like the sounds of EVE Jr.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Really good fun, was worried about some of the EVE comparisons but tho it does lack first person/cockpit view its not to its detriment and it seams to make the fights more tactical and less frantic also i havnt done any spread sheet crunching yet.

pros

Big seamless world with lots to explore, compleat with random space anomalies worm holes and nebulea

lots of different ships at diffrent lvls to fly

All the different playstyles youd expect, fight, trade, pirate ect

space drugs

its fun

its not X rebirth

cons

seams like quite a grind to earn cash for ships but kind of expect that and it makes that first ship upgrade seam all the more special

it has crashed on me a couple of times (nothing game breaking ) but meh that will probably get fixed in time and the auto save is pretty good

Starpoint Gemini 2
Finally out of Early Access, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great entry point into the genre. While you're waiting for things like Elite and Star Citizen to come down in price (or release), this is an excellent stop gap game. While the science behind it isn't world-accurate like other games, the pure amount of things to do and systems in play is excellent. Workshop support is excellent and the modding API is well detailed on the developer website.

Starpoint Gemini 2
This game gets compared to Freelancer a lot (particularly by forums users), but it's like a poor man's version of Freelancer without any of its artistry or high points like the lore backgrounding the game, and the great universe design. There are similar mechanics: do some basic trading, have a ship...

TBH it is a bit of a disappointment after the hype you hear about it from fans. To be really blunt in its current state I think this is a $10 max game. It feels a bit like it would be a good iOS space game, but as yet isn't a good PC space game. It needs an additional layer of depth and polish to become anything more than average. I'm playing it a bit but it's mostly as a time filler and because its a pretty massive grind to get anywhere (which I assume covers for a lack of content).

The forums seem to be an unadulterated love fest for this game and that was one of the main things that swayed me, but it's fairly average so far. I think it has something to do with the developers being active on the forums, big-upping anyone that says anything positive. Will update this review if my opinion changes, but I have a pretty good picture of the core dynamics: capture till you get a bigger ship, capture till you get a bigger ship until you get the biggest ship. Do really boring missions until you get your rank up. Otherwise you might do the really boring version of trading or mining (compared to other games).


THE BAD Tutorial and the campaign to date are pretty bad and unengaging (I kinda know what I'm doing but just don't care).
Visuals are mediocre, although the ship art is okay.
Universe feels empty in a bad way.
Voice acting in the plot is amateur.
You can only save in certain places which is a pain in the  (there are some lackluster excuses about this)
Combat seems fairly one dimensional
RPG elements are lighter than I expected (4 skills that you level, and some perks)
Crew are just stats bonuses
Trading economy and mining seem extremely basic
Overall I think a game like Starsector has far more RPG depth.

THE GOOD...You can customise ship colours, decals, and names so we can all call our ship Stormbringer, however, I haven't tried naming one Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath - it might be possible.

The cosmetic stuff like naming the ships and changing colours seems to be my high point so far. It might end up being a good timewaster...here's hoping.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Sorry for the negative review, but I found this game frustratingly boring...

- The game is a real grind.

-Freighting cargo around doesn't pay well at all, and I installed a mod to try and solve that issue, but seemed to not help.

-The story did not capture my interest. With sad voice acting, and the death of the characters farther on the second mission, I felt nothing for it, and was simply poorly laid out.

-Not a fan of the combat, it's clunky, panning the turret cam is slowed in combat. (that could be due to my system but the graphics run fine in combat, I suspect it's something else)

-A lot of the free roaming play is go here, go there... with not much inbetween. maybe some random combat

-No feedback on some systems, if you can't charge your engines in combat, no way to tell how long they will take to comeoneline, or I didn't find any readout to tell me

-not a fan of magical powerups/skills but that just my preference

-The sell all button is poorly placed with no confirmation, will also fail you if you're smuggling. you can't buy it back to complete the mission sigh...

-Not a fan of the docking anchoring system. it makes the long or short trips that much more unsatisfying :(

-missions seem to be straightforward but lack information eg. where am I smuggling this to? You want help, what kind of help? Missions simply lack information that would give you the choice to make a educated decision.

-Combat music sounds very VERY similar to Freelancer... just putting that out there...

I have tried to get into the game twice, tried to give it a chance. I have put 13 hours into the game... I don't feel there is any need to put more.

I strongly recommend anyone considering purchasing this title to thurellery research it on youtube or forums, as actual game footage it not supplied on steam, and is quite misleading...

Starpoint Gemini 2
Updated review as of October 1st.

First impressions: Broken. With a lot of potential.

Secondary impressions: It's an acquired taste. It does grow on you. But it's lopsided. Strong gameplay props up a (very) weak campaign.


Initial review:

This game may be out of early access, but do not be fooled. This is NOT a finished product. Not even close. It is sorely lacking in decent voice acting, and the campaign hangs together by the thinnest of threads, and liberal deus ex machina. Frequently you will look at the screen in confusion and ask Who is that? What is happening? Why am I supposed to do this?" The game approaches storytelling in a very basic

Starpoint Gemini 2
Update : Now LIVE V1.400 (Internal Test build)

I myself have been playing since Alpha (September 2013 release) and I have seen SPG2 come along in strides. Below is a basic list of what is in-game and can be done whilst playing. SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80's onwards.


Star Point Gemini 2!

DLC - Secrets of Aethera - Adds in new ships, new storyline arc, tweaks and updates to game systems.

Riftways - Oh my, something to experience yourself! - Rollercoaster rides in Space.

Fighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.

70 ships to buy/capture/destroy

Equipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancements

Customizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.

Consumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etc

Power ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)

Ship cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)

Hero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM's competition)

Global events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.

Junk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.

Trade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)

Board and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.

Worm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere You dont want to be")

AI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me

Starpoint Gemini 2
This is a good game for space adventurers. However, there should be an emphasis on the word adventure" more than action on this one.

There is story here

Starpoint Gemini 2
So I thought Id wait before writing this review until I got at least 10h+ gameplay and finished the story. So at the time Im writing this I got 43h+, and just finished the game.

My favorite space game of all time is probably Freelancer, and other games Ive tried havent even come close to it. But when I heard about Starpoint Gemini 2 I got my hopes up a little. Started following the game, checked in-game videos and such, and I got very interested.

So I decied to buy it a week before the release cause it was on sale.
Its a good game. If you, like me enjoyed freelancer then you will no doubt enjoy this aswell. Its not as good,  but its definitely not a bad game. The RPG elements are an interesting addition to the game.
You start of by choosing your class which are:  Commander, Gunner and Engineer all with different set of skills. Depending on your play style if you prefer being in a small group of ships or just pure loner/dogfighter etc, I think most players will find these classes interesting.

Alright, now to the positive and negative aspects of the game: I really liked the feel of the ships, smaller ships are easier to maneuver while the bigger ones are heavier, and I like that feeling it really does feel like you are flying a ship. So the developers got that down quite well, spot on. I do wish they would have added like a secret ship(s) that could only be found and bought at a specific place that was hidden.   And continuing on the topic of ships, there are A LOT of them to buy. Allthough you will be very discouraged with the prices in the beginning, but dont worry cash will eventually start flowing in. Just do side missions or if you prefer mining or trading etc.

The map is huge, and you have a lot of exploring to do if youre into that. Just wish there were more things to explore, more secrets and mysterious anomalies etc. There isnt really any suprises or wtf moments in this game, which is sad. No mystery.
The graphics are awesome, no complaints here its a living world and the designs are nice.

The sounds and music are awesome. ButI really wish they would use at least more than just ONE battle tune, cause it gets reaaally tiring to be hearing the same  over and over again. Specially since battle is a big part of the game. Would it have hurt to put in at least 2 more songs in? Other than that the rest of the songs are awesome, it really suits the mood and game.

There are also enemy heroes in this game, which all have bounties on them. And they give you a lot of cash, I totally missed this feature when I started playing so it took forever for me to get cash in the beginning.
So thats a nice feature, but would have been even more interesting if they had like one final hero that was nearly impossible to beat, unless you were leveled up to the max with the best ship etc.

Now to some of the negative aspects of the game: Map travel, when you press M or whatever button to bring up the map, the game pausesso while you check your map and try to plan ahead for your future travels, the game is on pause and you dont progress at all. So while I was travelling to this planet, and checking the map at the same time I noticed I was right where I left of. So thats annoying.

The autopilot fails a lot of the times. It only does this after you have docked with a starbase and you click on your next destination to go there autopilot, most of the times it just freaks out and takes you in circles.
The voice acting in this game is a big joke. And not in a good way either, cause sometimes bad voice acting can at least make you laugh, but this was justugh.

The storyline is nonexistent. Which is really sad cause of the big universe the developers built up they could have written such a better story for this game. So if you buy this thinking it will have a nice or at least mediocre story, rethink why you want this game. Im not saying not to buy it, beacuse the good things outweighs the bad in this game.

So to end this Id say it probably is the best new single player space game out right now.

Id give this game a 7/10

+Many ships to buy
+Huge map, a lot to explore
+Pretty graphics
+Music
+Enemy Heroes
+RPG elements

-Maptravel
-Music
-Bad voice acting
- story
-Autopilot fails

Starpoint Gemini 2
(Still in Alpha stage)
Pick a style that you like to play, space sim wise, and go do it..lol Be a pirate/bounty hunter/merchant/miner..ect No story line ATM, but as it stands right now, it is still worth the money. You can easily get 20 buck worth of enjoyment out of it, plus some. When the game is done, you will be glad you did get in on early access. Fun ships and plenty to choose from, even now. Good fight and flight modes of flying. Great space eye-candy. No loading screens to get from one side of the map, to the other. Unless you are using the jump gates, then there is a small load. You want that ship the npc is flying? Just board it TAKE IT!!..lol Over all, I cant give much of any complaint. As a reference, its like a graphics smak down, with a upper cut in gameplay, to Freelancer!!..lol (only SP, no co-op multi..-1/2 star..lol)
I give it 4&1/2 stars out of five: with it, as it stands, in Alpha

EDIT:
Now that this little gem is fully released, I can go ahead and say I wasn't wrong in my EA review. There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!

Starpoint Gemini 2
When I was a young adult (28) I bought an Amstrad CPC 8-bit computer and a cassette with the game Elite" on it. I played that religiously at least a year and after that again every now and then. The graphics were underwhelming (green wire graphic)

Starpoint Gemini 2
Pros:
+ Beautiful game; very nice to look at!
+ Lots of small interesting mechanics and ideas, such as boarding other ships, hacking their systems, etc.
+ Mining and trading are well implemented, although it's very hard to get rich through either
+ Plenty of unique ship designs and overall great attention to art
+ Very decent music and sound effects

Cons:
- Boring story
- Abysmal voice acting
- No multiplayer
- Excessively combat-focused (good luck getting rich as a merchant)
- easter egg hunt (in a space sim? sigh, okay)
- only one star system, seems limited for a space sim
- the prices for using the jump gates are insane, get your podcast playlist ready and have fun trucking through space
- lack of animations for entering or leaving stations/planets (yeah this one is a bit nitpicky)
- placing stations and artifact containers right next to riftways is borderline sadistic
- what REALLY pushed me away from this game:

WELCOME TO USER INTERFACE HELL!
oh my god, this game's interface makes me want to stick puppies in a blender!

--> fifty thousand menus that don't give you all the information you need
--> 'why can't I select this station? oh the waypoint marker is in the way, let me place it somewhere else for the 1000th time so I can move on with the docking procedure' (same thing applied to any static object in space you hope to interact with)
--> 'does a green price mean it's a good sell, or does it mean the price is very low?'
--> 'why can't I use the turret camera while in PTE mode?! oh, I can, but I need to press Mouse1 simultaneously. wtf?'
--> 'time to compare some prices, now let me just find the item in this huge list which isn't alphabetically organized'
--> I spent several hours having to remind myself that the BLUE bar under the red HP bar doesn't represent shield, but speed. Why do I need a speed bar? God only knows. And one that looks like a shield bar, on top of all.
--> I could go on, but the point is: if this game's UI had been better conceived, SG2 wouldn't have  me off so often. I'm not saying it's a bad game, just that... it's not great fun. I guess that's enough.

Starpoint Gemini 2
I'm 60+ hours into the game as I write this review. I have to say that I haven't played space sims for a while but do have fond memories of Freespace 2, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer and Darkstar 1. The good news is that SG2 has some interesting elements. Could it be better? Sure, but let's get to the nitty-gritty. There are 3 things I'll comment on: RPG elements, SIM elements, and GAMEPLAY elements.

RPG:

	Not great -- voice acting is poor, and I don't really care much about the storylines (I have Origins, Aethera and Titans DLCs), which I feel could be better or more compelling.
	Not enough random events by NPCs, etc. The universe is constantly changing economically, politically but it doesn't feel ALIVE. The characters seem dead.
	There is a points/perk system where you can improve your character but that's about it.
	You get some credits and blueprints for completing campaign missions (no medals or other perks). The blueprint reward system is interesting but really tough to complete a whole set, so what's the point, really?
	The NPCs you deal with are flat and uninteresting. Oh and the voice acting sucks. Or did I mention that already?

SIM:

	This is supposed to be a space sim, but many controls are lacking. e.g. You can't coordinate attacks with wingmen or give them specific orders.
	Other sims even let you contact NPCs/wingmen over comms; not here.
	Combat is simplified -- which may or may not be a good thing. i.e. You have an auto-fire button for your light weapons, and a key for your heavy weapon. You have to be facing your opponent appropriately before other non-frontal weapons will fire. Sometimes the AI fires at other targets even when you're locked on the nearest one.
	There doesn't seem to be full support for my Thrustmaster -- I can't map the buttons, nor does it allow me to use a Joystick / keyboard combo. There is a turret cam view that can be useful, but without my joystick, it's pretty pointless.

GAMEPLAY:

	Pretty graphics
	Fun sandbox (free play) mode. I actually spent more time here than on the campaigns.
	These are cool: Space stations, T-gates, T-drive travel, worm hole travel, boarding ships,
officers and mercs you can hire
	Lots to explore
	Faction/reputation tracking system
	Very useful star map with overlays and filters
	Game seems skewed towards battle; i.e. hard to get rich through the economic model

Overall:

The game world is pretty. While the devs try to create a decent economic model, I'm not quite sure it succeeds. You can't really make much cash that way. The quickest way is to board and capture ships with your troopers, then sell the vessel, or through bounty-hunting. This skews the game towards a combat model -- not complaining, mind you, but if you want to have a robust economic model, well, then make it workable. Players should be able to make MORE money through mining, gas clouds, and trading. There's a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to play a merchant. This is a shame because there is an excellent transport infrastructure -- i.e. you can travel vast distances using T-gates, rifts, worm holes, etc.

I like the fact that there's sandbox mode and campaign mode. Having hangars and your own fighters/bombers is a nice touch; and being able to beam your troopers to enemy vessels to try capturing them is fun.

All in all, SG2 is an entertaining and pretty game, but it falls short of being great -- more RPG elements would help, and of course, proper joystick support... and yeah, the voice acting sucks! I would recommend getting it only if it's on sale.


6.5/10.0

Starpoint Gemini 2
This game will give you hours of fun, not a fast pace action packed in your face game but the strategic plan your every move with every action having consequences game. In saying that the combat is very rewarding with many battles containing the fast pace action (if you manuver your ship properly to avoid incoming damage and allow your weapons to target correctly while adjusting speed, shields and/or gunnery). Interface gets the job done but can take a few minutes to understand which isn't a negative with a great tutorial that can be accessed at any time if you forget something.
There are not many camera angles which I look forward to an update on this to make a more fluid experience especially in combat (there is free move camera angle which can hinder while flying and looking around). I truly would enjoy a cockpit view from the captains chair to feel really immersed while mining or ship to ship combat. I also want to see more interactivity with planets and stations ( one suggestion would be allowing the player to approach an enemy planet to try a diplomatic or subversion mission to change the flow of power/status of that planet).  In a nutshell try this game it makes for a great space flying simulator.

Starpoint Gemini 2
Starpoing Gemini 2 is a humbling game.  It isn't on the scale of some star exploration games, being in only one star system.  But where it lacks in size to its competition, it makes up for it with sheer density and diversity in play.  You can be a star trader, pirate, a security operative, or... yes, even a mere space station mechanic -- only accepting missions to repair other space stations to earn your money.  The combat is intelligent and engaging, but not too challenging.  The only drawback is I cannot bring my friends in.  But with a list of objectives like I have in this, who has time for them?  time to go kill some pirates and steal whatever they've stolen, and sell it!  BETTER SHIPS ES


Starpoint Gemini 2
At a glance Starpoint Gemeni 2 is a sandbox space sim, nothing special and it has been done better before.

I could live with it if the game features an interesting story, which the game does. The game also has a tendency to crash during or shortly after finishing a story mission which makes it a race to reach a save point before the game crashes and you need to redo the mission. So the redemption from story doesn't apply. If anything it just makes me more frustrated.

Looking further into the game, you realize it is a single player MMORPG, ship upgrades are gated behind arbitrary level requirements. Ships handle basically the same except for the top speed, so your carrier is just as agile as the starting gunship.

Weapon upgrades follow a similar MMORPG route, some weapons are poor and you go through the game trying to find better weapons. Weapons that are described in awkward and sometimes even incorrect ways, such as rate of fire" being the delay between each shot. Once you get over the initial hump of how weapons operate you realize you need a calculator to figure out which weapon to use.

Sure I can play this

Starpoint Gemini 2
Excellent game, now that they have the story in.

I've gotta say, that I've watched this go from an alpha state (when I first bought the game) to a completed project.  It's truely an amazing experience.

Buy this game.  You won't regret it.



Starpoint Gemini 2
Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great space rpg.

usually a statement like that needs clarification, so here we go.

this game is basically if you took the most complicated parts out of games like x, opened up the game world like evochron mercenary and throw in a control system not unlike eve online. what im getting at is that its not as complicated to play as the aforementioned games but leaves the best parts of each and marries them into a system thats fresh and familiar.

one of the things that irritated me about the x series and evochron for that matter is that missions had to be acquired at a station. my question has always been, why? no long range communications in either universe? in SPG2 that is a thing of the past, when you enter an area, you will be notified when missions are available and you can accept missions directly from the starmap

which brings me to the next point. the starmap is one contigious area, like in evochron, there are no load screeens and while the actual area is smaller than evochron, its a lot more detailed visually. so yes its probably not 100% true to life because there are very few areas that just look like a black void in space, but the visuals are well done and give you more to look at than just black with white dots everywhere.

controls are reminicent of eve online though i havent played it in years, it reminds me of that. not necessarily a terrible thing, but if you are looking to find yourself in the cockpit of the ship, these ships dont feature cockpits. if anything even the smallest class available would have a bridge. so in comparison to the ships in X or EM, youre piloting a capital ship right off the bat. in fact to give some comparison, the M5 through M3 classes of ships in X are basically bought as commodities to place in the hangar of carriers. you wont be flying anything that small and if you were, youd have reason to be very very afraid. it would seem that the gemini system doesnt build much of anything in small scale :)

As of this writing there are a few technical issues that arent game breaking but considering the devlopment team is very active and even communicates with the players regularly i feel that this game will evolve into something even better. if you like rpgs and space games, this will be right up your alley. LGM has done a great job keeping the game fun and challenging without making it a nightmare to learn how to play.

Ragnarok Online
Playing RO for around 10 years.


Ragnarok Online is good, it's a good time killer with very friendly community
(Even tho the game is anime-ish" there are not so many weebs as you could think)
Ragnarok Online 2 is a terrible sequel

Ragnarok Online
It's like I'm 16 again, only this time it didn't take a day and a half to download the client.

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok is something I wasn't expecting to see in Steam in late 2013.
So, does that mean that Ragnarok 2 failed so hard they put 10-years-old-game on steam?

Ragnarok Online
I hate this game why do I keep coming back

Ragnarok Online
One of the first MMORPGs to grace the Internet. It still has the same look and feel from 2004. Despite it's outdated graphics, the sprites and music make this game cute and nostalgic enough to re-try again. The game is still active after all these years and has a very familiar feel to it. It might be hard for newer players to just pick it up without any outside research but still worth it.

Ragnarok Online
This is by far the best MMORPG I have ever played, even now that the game is 10 years old. If only modern MMORPGs followed this game model instead of WoW...

Ragnarok Online
After 2 weeks of coming back, it is obvious that this game is cashing out on its old legacy. It used to be an amazing game I admitted. But if you're looking to come back for the good old days, there's not much iRO can offer here.

1) Pay2Win system:
It is against term of service to purchase in-game gold (zeny) using real cash. Yet it is ok to sell your warp portal energies into zeny ( which is obtained by cash). So the only way to cheat is to give money to WarpPortal.

Cash shop items also rendered many other in-game gear useless. And the only way to upgrade safely to +9 is to choke up $20-$50 in game cash for it.

2) Cheaters
There are so many bots in this game. Honestly I only see around 100-300 active players in game, and the rest are either bots, vend bots, or afkers. Worst part is some bots are actually ok, I see them roaming around cities buffing people, and somehow that makes everything ok? Also there's this thing called ragial which is obviously run by third party bot systems.

3) Lag issues and DDOS:
It's 2015 and this game is still constantly lagging and I am using 75mbps fiber optics internet.  Also their servers keep crashing very often,  and usually at the worst time of the day.

4) Immature game design decision:
For those who paid for VIP for leveling, the GM sometimes decide to change the turn in quests so impossibly difficult that only godly geared veterans can do them. So you're likely wasting 1 week of VIP time afking or slow grinding your level. Also good luck finding public parties to play with outside of the turn ins.

5) Slow customer support:
It literally takes them days weeks or months to answer ticket issues. Worst part is they will just ban you and give you no reason sometimes. So you have to open them a ticket just to find out that some of the items you bought may came from a cheater, causing you to have weeks of downtime.

6) Good luck finding players to play with.
Finally, good luck finding enough players to play with. It's a dying game, and most of the time you'll be spending time waiting for a party to setup (30min - 3 hours recruiting time just to setup 15 minute leveling session)


I'd say save your money folks. The old days of Ragnarok is loong gone.

Ragnarok Online
This is my first online game that I've ever play. My childhood is here.  A very good game to play. A game that worth to learn.

Ragnarok Online
This is for the Classic Loki server. I have not played on the Renewal server.

In terms of a decade old MMORPG, Ragnarok really hits home for the nostalgia factor. Gameplay is still smooth and fun. I quite enjoy playing.

That said....

The botting is rampant, don't bother trying to sell anything through vending. Someone has more on sale for less because bots.
War of Emperium is a cycle of 3-4 guilds exchanging castles on a weekly basis. If you want to try and bring a new guild in, be prepared to be squashed by maxed out veterans wearing god-items.
The market is beyond skewed. The botters have so much on the market that you are LUCKY if you keep a vigilant eye on sites like ragial.com for good deals, as some poor sap tries to undercut the botters of their excessive amounts of loot.
To counter the botters, folks will often crack dead branches" (spawns high-level mobs) where bots frequent in an attempt to grief kill them. Chances are you will die a few dozen times to these things walking from Prontera to Izlude or just trying to get to your hunting grounds.

Logging on

Ragnarok Online
Came for the RPG, stayed for the hats.

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok Online was for me the best MMORPG out there, but its official servers confront some issues mong them:

I. Economy. The cash shop of Ragnarok Online offers a lot of powerful hats and items, that aren't available normally inside the game, of course, you can purchase some of those items with IGC if someone else is selling them at the market, but this has two issues: 1. A player can become rich in a short amount of time by purchasing items from the Cash Shop and then selling them for IGC. Making it completely unbalanced for F2P users. 2. The price of those items is so high, it demands a ridiculous amount of effort to acquire only one item. It's funny how is illegal to sell IGC for real money and yet is OK to sell Cash Shop Items bought with real money for IGC.

II. Bots. The game is plagued with them. There are many solutions to deal with bots, but, either, Gravity got tired of trying or just didn't try hard enough.

III. Lag. The server has lag peaks, not only on WoE time, but at any other time as well, it makes it horrible to play, even when alone. The problem must be either, the way the servers are distributed or their capacity, which is strange, considering there aren't that many active players nowadays.

IV. Rates. People grow and time decreases, the rates of experience and drop of the game are so demanding, that you either, have a lot of time in your hands or you can forget about getting anywhere inside the game, it doesn't particularly appeal to new players and it didn't adapt it to its actual player base, causing a constant drop of users.

As you see, those problems could be easily fixed, but Gravity never seemed to care about them, that's why, if you still want to play Ragnarok Online, I'd highly suggest you a private server instead.

 | Loved it, but disliked iRO servers

AFK-Merchant Simulator.

Ragnarok Online
I've been playing this game for years off and on, have tons of fond memories of playing with my brothers and friends.
No matter how much time goes by and no matter how many new shiny games come out, the original RO will always
have a place in my heart and games folders.

Ragnarok Online
Hi steamers. I played Ragnarok Online religiously before it was released on steam and while it was on steam. Although it seems my hours are not logged, They are there. I have had the best times in this game. It really breaks my heart to not recommend this game.

Best friends of mine who played this for decades, girl friends who hated my soul for WoE timed events, craziest card drops that changed the whole tide of war, awesome battles in WoE, and PvP. Please beleive me. I am trying to warn you of your current time.

Year 2000. Alpha and Beta stages all alike. This game was the best MMORPG you would ever of played, even surfacing vanilla WoW Imo if u had a chance to play it. PVP and Guild WoE slaughtered the idea of capture a flag.

Since around 2005 till now its cash shop has screwed and spread like a virus crossing the korean world and globably to not just this game but many others. It has ruined this game. This game is also ran on a bot fest economy, if it isn't then problems start showing up. This is another hatred of many. But the problem is that its needed, yet not allowed, supposedly lol.

This game has turned into a phantasmal ghost yet people still feed into it and I can't blame them, It's beautiful. Not alot of games come close to the joyous, no holding of the hand feel of entering a world such as midgard. There is always something to do unless you have it all. Venturing map to map as your cool class, seeing and slaying awesome pixel monsters, hopefully with friends. Hearing some classic music that makes your nostalgic sense kick in always, and collecting items such as cool hats, accesories, and of course those cards. Gosh, next to increasing your skills and stats through an allocation system. You will never wanna leave.

But heres the hard truth. This free game still lives because of the real life dirty money still being pulled through botting and idiocracy. You either need to be in this game to be slaving someone, becoming a botter, or selling into the cash shop. But why not do it all? Lol. Zero game experience

It will never shine like it used to and as a retired vet take my word of advice. You are better playing on a private server or just a different game. The people playing this game are mainly young millennials experiencing a zombie game full of bright colors and cool effects being mislead, or adults still milking this game dry.

Do not be mislead by my words.

R.I.P. RO

Ragnarok Online
My love for Ragnarok is deep and infinite. I quit playing years ago because (much like The Sims), this game is a giant addictive time-suck... in an amazing way. Years later, I still love seeing those cute little pixelated sprites.

It's still a great game for people whose computers can't handle the more graphic/RAM heavy MMOs.

I now love Ragnarok from afar, like a creepy old lady at the park.

Ragnarok Online
Can't help but recommend this game. Yes it's old like other people have said but it's graphics were setup in  way so they don't age. Wonderfull 2D sprites in a amazing easy on the eyes 3D world. I've actual played this game since late Alpha, early Beta, about the 1999-2000 time frame. And I still play to this day, though mainly on the classic server.

Beside the easy on the eye graphics another amazing feature is the customization you can do with your character's stats and skills. Unlike nearly every other game on the market you stats matter. Your character's ablity will change massively based on what stats you take.

Want a Swordsman that dodges attacks and hits faster instead of just taking hits and having high hit points ? Put points in to Agility instead of Vitality. This means you trade High Hitpoints and high defense for High Flee (dodge) and high Attack speed. You then could go on to make a Agility based knight or Crusader with your swordsman. Or go the middle of the ground and do a hybrid of Agility and Vitality, You might not dodge as well as pure agility or have as much hitpoints as pure Vitality but you can take less damage per hits then agility based characters, and dodge more then pure vitality.

And this is just the start of it, You can go pure support acolyte forgoing increased melee damage for the ability to heal massive amounts of damage, or for a true acolyte and have a mix of Melee damage and Healing ability.

Want a Mage that beats things as well as toss magic at them? Put points into Strength, Vitality, and Agility, instead of going pure intelligence. You lose magic damage but can dodge, take hits, and do better melee damage then a pure magic caster. Go the sage route and get the skills that let you move while casting and add the chance to auto cast a low level bolt spell while your hitting monsters.

Like making money, while beating on things with axes, swords or maces? Go a Merchant class character. They don't have the Melee skills of other classes but you can carry more loot or healing potions items then any other class, can buy cheaper and sell for more then any other classes, have access to a cart to carry even more loot/potions, and use your fortune to pay the god of the merchants to attack your enemies (Mammonite skill). Want to craft potions or weapons, take your Merchant to ether Alchemist or Blacksmith. And even Blacksmith and Alchemist have the ability to go Pure Battle, pure Crafting, or a Middle ground, not building items as well as their pure counter parts but still being able to fight for themselves.

And there are many other classes to chose from like Archers, thief, TaeKwon Kid, Ninja, Gunslinger ans Super Novice. On top of all that it's free to play, with subscription players (only 7 bucks a month) only get 50% more experience and loot drops, larger storage and other minor abilities. I've spent most of my time since it's gone free to play not using a subscription (they call it VIP) and had no problems with it. So give it a try, nothing to lose but a lot of your free time, and a lot of fun to be had.

Ragnarok Online
First MMO I've ever played.. This game brings back sooo many good memories. The music in this game never gets old and brought a tear to my eye when I came back to playing it after many years. I still remember that excitement I felt when I created my very first character all those years ago and all I wanted to do was explore the world of Rune Midgard. Sure the graphics can't compete with today's more modern games, but then again today's more modern games don't have the sentimental value this one will always have for people like me who remember talking about this game in school and then rushing home to continue an adventure with friends. I can only hope that they will make a (third) remake of the game that only involves making the graphics better while maintaining virtually everything else to preserve the feel" of the original."

Ragnarok Online
Never gets old, Hack and Slash at its finest. Better than RO2 and always will be.

Ragnarok Online
This game... Oh boy this game. Where do i even start,  For starters i am what you would call an old time veteran when it comes to Ro1. This game and me go way back, I couldn't even tell you how many years/months/days i have spent running around in this game. This is one of those classics situations where i have a sudden wave of nostalgia and emotion run through my head just thinking about it.

Now, here's the nitty. I have of course played this game, i was an avid hard core player of Ragnarok, But i moved on to other things and basically rarely ever turned back unless i was just casually hopping on to see what changed or for nostalgia purposes. And let me tell you this game is not the game it was back in 2002-2007. Oh no, The new IRO is just a mess of Trolls/Bots a very strange slapped on questing system as well as many other band-aided systems trying to keep this game afloat or up to par with what i would call mmorpg standardization. Many server merges causing lots of strange naming conflicts and renaming issues. Some people given free character name changes, While others somehow being skipped over.

The game at its core is still the same old Ragnarok, But the magic that is Rune Midgard has just somehow been lost somewhere down the road these past years. Partially the community, and just the way the game is ran, The game even seems to somehow run worse now than it did years ago, as if the Server technology has been downgraded even tho computers have gotten better.


So what is my final verdict? I would say give the game a shot, But don't go into the game expecting a lot, It's pretty laggy and seems very quiet at times. gravity definitely seems to be letting the game run its course, But on the bright side at least it seems to be alive and probably kicking for many years to come.

Ragnarok Online
Lets be clear: I love RO.  My username is a result of my love of RO.  I played on iRO all those years ago, and broke into tears when I hear the Prontera Theme for the first time in years.

Thing is, all that love is nothing more than rose tinted glasses now.  This game is old.  REALLY old.

Old time Thief players (like me!) will easily understand that much of the combat is literally just Right Click

Ragnarok Online
I was super into this game back when it was in alpha. It was at least 2002, if not earlier. I have no idea how the f2p works, whether it's pay to win or purchasing character slots, but it was an enjoyable, if korean-grinding, mmo.

Ragnarok Online
I adore this game. I have been playing on private servers for years. My one complaint is the botting. There is no community. I have only once ran into other users that actually talk. I try to stand even at eden group or warp points in prontera. Nothing. If I ever had a question, I'd go to like 5 different places to ask it and was lucky if I had one response at all. Needless to say, great game, ing terrible community.

Ragnarok Online
Welcome to the worst private RO server the world has seen... Made official. The key areas have so many people sitting around with chat lobbies and merchants that the NPC's are overwhelmed, and you can't even move properly, let alone interact with anything.

Complete with a thoroughly bot-infested community, this RO server needs severe de-brining before it's playable.

Ragnarok Online
What can i say. Im a sucker for the classics.

Ragnarok Online
This game brings me back to a very nostalgic place called Childhood. Ragnarok Online was the very first MMORPG I've ever played, and it really is a good feeling to relive the adventures I'd had when I was 12ish.

Ragnarok Online
great old game, but the servers that this game runs on, are so slow, it makes the game unplayable.

Ragnarok Online
Game is far from it's glorydays 10 years ago. If the classic server didn't die I'd probably still be playing, but with how it is now, it's less populated than some private servers.

Ragnarok Online
Don't let my game time fool you.... I played this game AGES ago. My first MMO ever. Absolutely loved this game when I was a freshman in high school. I couldn't wait to get home from school just so I could sit my happy  down at the computer and log in, haha.

Ragnarok Online
This will always be my favorite online game. Lots of fun to play with a group of friends.

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok Online is a game where you star as a ruthless warlord who murders tons of small, fluffy, blobby creatures.
Revel in victory when your murder entire villages of fuffly animals (including the younglings)

Collect and build your character until you level up to the ulitment warlord.
Start a guild and go on a murder spree with your fellow maurders

Never go to prontera, we dont goto prontera

Ragnarok Online
My favorite MMO of 2002 is finally on steam, thanks gaben

Ragnarok Online
Product received for free

Found this Gem on steam,

It is the Real deal, the original game.

Pros:

Weekly Updated
Good story,
Good Quests,
Good PVP system,
Good Group PVP event.
Runs Great on almost any PC.
Little to no Lag (Thor Server)

Cons:

Not enough players (thor Server) needs more. (Very Low Bot (read almost none) Count)
Seems to have been forgotten in the mists of Time.

I use to play this when it was a subscription game and fell on times that prevented me continueing it. It is now Free to Play with a VIP / Cash Shop option.  Big hint The Cash shop stuff does not Really break the game if you know how to Hunt for Gears.  The market on thor is not insane there are good equips for vend.  The people mostly come from the phillipines so US time zones there is a low Population and almost no Lag unlike the Chaos server which has a higher US population.  The Player base is very nice and welcoming to new players.  Aperently the Game has been getting updates every week, has an active GM staff.

A worthy MMO that will not tax your system.



Ragnarok Online
Where to start...This is one of those games that if you played it when it first came out, years would pass, you would try multiple other MMOs and realize that you keep coming back to Ragnarok. There's just a certain charm to it.  On the surface this might seem like a usual simple grind-fest, however the game is very complex. Mainly because it gives you complete freedom to build your characters the way you want (and make many, many mistakes in the process).
Want to build a battle-priest because you do not like monks? - go for it.  Want to make a full-crit assassin with the sole purpose of hunting high-def monsters? - go right ahead. The beauty is that with enough research and equipment planning you could make even the most bizzare character builds work.  Or you will fail miserably and realize that you want to try again, with a different skill-set, different stats, different cards and equipment..possibilities are limited only by your imagination.
Even though the game is quite old, it definitely held up very nicely and is worth a try.

Ragnarok Online
You're better off with private servers.

I was excited with Steam first came out with this. I mean, I used to play this game from the beginning of middle school to my high school years. And now I've graduated. But when I started to play Steam's server for RO, I realised it wasn't helpful at all. You're out of luck if you're alone, if you're poor, and/or if you don't know the basics of RO. So either you study outside of RO, or you play with friends. Otherwise, Steam's server was a huge let down.

Ragnarok Online
its ok.

Ragnarok Online
A classic definitely. Clunky mechanic and does not work properly on Windows 8 nontheless (Run the options and the game in compatibility mode for XP S3 and you should be fine. Don't run it in full screen, you have been warned.) However, it retains the charm quite nicely and the new renewal patch makes grinding more fun with kill quests.

If you are looking for a F2P MMORPG that is mindless, look no further. Also, since it is free, give it a try will ya. If it's a no go, then just uninstall it. :) Just... don't get addicted.

Ragnarok Online
This game has had a lot of influence in what I expect from recent MMORPGs. To this day, the core game is still engaging and dynamic, which is more than I can say about 99% of the MMORPGs from the 3D era.

Desprite how much i love this game, how many good memories with it, i still NOT recommend it on Steam. Ragnarok Online is so great. Cute sprites, nice music. But server here is too lag for anything to feel good. The developer should ashame of themselves that offical server is not working as well as private servers.

Ragnarok Online
nice and entertaining game to play beside dota 2..

Ragnarok Online
Great game... brings back a lot of nostalgia
The player base is great.
If you liked ragnarok ...you SHOULD get it on steam :D

Ragnarok Online
old school yet stil fun to play

Ragnarok Online
I havent played this game in years, but when my index and middle fingers are the first things to go arthritic, Ill KNOW what did it.

Ragnarok Online
Seriously, I do like RO, but this server probably has more than 200ms anywhere, and it's not just the delay, but the actual LAG, it is unplayable like this.

Ragnarok Online
UPDATED 06/05/2015
Games still Slow and Laggy Cant Enter Any Dungeons/towns/maps/houses Without the tremendous lag - Developers really know how to stick it to old fans of the game. this game is only playable living close the servers, I play on free servers and give my support to People Who host These Servers Better then the Actuall DEVELOPER OF THE GAME ITSELF.


DO NOT LET DEVELOPERS LIKE THIS STICK A FORK DOWN YOUR THROAT AND EXPECT YOU TO SWALLOW
This Game Should Not Be Supported (AT LEAST NOT YET) Let me tell you why

I Remember a time when i played this game Day in and Day out Almost 10 years ago now, It was really my first mmo And one of the best still to date. the sense of community and love you feel for this world is somthing still not found anywhere else Comes down to being a very friendly and social Game.

All these good things So why should i not play it. Cause this game has been Put to the side There is TREMENDOUS LAG Which Results in miss clicks, Getting killed, Miss casts, Aswell as terrible walking. I dont know what happened but i used to play this game on my OLD BAGE Desktop that was slower then molasis AND i was on dial up at the time an i never experinced this Much lag in the game.... So obviously the developers REFUSE to update servers for the huge surge of players... or for any reason from what my knowledge

And I hear people Say oooo customize this

Ragnarok Online
I have been playing Ragnarok for 9 years and counting. I play other games, and I've tried other private RO servers, but I always come back to iRO.

My favorite aspect of the game is the social aspect. It's fun to make new friends and explore the world, do quests, or hunt MVPs together.

Ragnarok Online
Good old ragnarok got better. But gets repititive very fast as you go around killing monsters over and over again to level up and thats it. But definitely worth a try for rpg fans.

Ragnarok Online
One of the best MMOs I have ever (and still am) playing, it has stellar innovation and diversity between classes, coupled with a very friendly online and international community. There's a place for everyone in the the wide world of Rune-Midgard (and surrounding in-game countries), so why don't you hop on and give it a shot? It may be tough for a new player, but the game is still going strong after ten years of running!

Ragnarok Online
Ragnarok Online is a 13 year old MMORPG that has charmed its way into the hearts of millions and continues to this day. Collect hats, PvP, PvE, run insances, make friends, and many many more activities can be done in this grandfather MMO.

iRO is a F2P server, but you can purchase what is called VIP to speed up your leveling experience. I would reccomend this if you are serious about the game.

I will not lie, the cash shop makes this game somewhat P2W but it is not impossible to play without spending a dime. Overall I love this game and it has been a part of my life for the past 8 years and I would change any of the time that I have spent on this server. Long live Ragnarok Online.

Ragnarok Online
Product received for free

Just a jewel of the MMORPG history that i've played for 13 years (still with some comebacks randomly)

Playing Tree of Savior now but Ragnarok still stays in my memories.



Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

I have been playing this game for 15mins. It's hilarious!

The controls are very good and responsive, which is a must for this type of game...
Because it's also unforgiving.

Not because it's stupidly unforgiving, but because there's just SO many unexpected ways you can interact with items... and die.

Now, onto some of my favorite deaths:

#1   I manage to jump and swim across a pond full of piranaes.
- Haha, look at them. They're biting and still looking at the edge of the water, mad that I managed to make it across!
*Piranae picks up speed and jumps out of the water into my face*   X_X

#2   Hmm, a pounding trap... let's see if I can activate it using my slime!
- Yes! Ah crap, now the trap is glued to the bottom of the shaft, preventing me from passing...
- I wonder if I can unglue it by jumping on it and hitting the chain repeatedly
- Oh oh, its unstuck and coming back my way   X_X

#3   Sweet, I just killed this orc thing.
Let's loot it!
- Ooops, I ate it. Only the bones remain.
- Okay, what's up with these bones... let's eat them too?
X_X   Died from choking on the bones.

10/10, would die from choking on bones again.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Despite my (currently) low play time, rest assured I've put at least 30 hours into earlier kickstarter-exclusive builds. This a simply fantastic roguelike platformer. To me, it feels like a combination of Spelunky and Super Smash Bros in a fantasy environment.There are four big selling points I'll discuss below. TL;DR: Very fun, fluid movement, challenging skill based combat, incredible variety of organic environmental interactions, and all play styles are equally supported

The thing that initially drew me to this game is the way the player moves throughout the environment. It's the smoothest system I've ever played with, and traversing the environment is not just a means to an end, it's a pleasure. The only gripe I have with it is there are occasionally environmental hazards you can't protect against, but they're few and far between.

This game is extremely difficult, make no mistake. In my opinion, not all of the stats are as balanced as they should be; it's very difficult to survive hits from Grumbuls (humanoid enemy, think orc) early on, and getting good will definitely take practice. That said, the combat is very fun. Killing the enemies is always satisfying, and your deaths feel horribly brutal, but never unfair. The magic system is very intuitive and is useful both in and out of combat.

The third and perhaps biggest selling point for me is the interactions that happen organically in the world. For instance, within the game there are poisonous mushrooms, boulders, pools of water, and fire magic. Let's look at the interactions possible between these four objects. If there are fish in the water, a mushroom can be thrown in to leak poison into the water and weaken the fish. Using fire magic, you can burn up the mushroom and it's poison cloud to safely pass. Using the same magic, you can super heat the boulder, and hit it into an enemy to deal extra damage and potentially set them alight. If you need food in a pinch, you can heat the rock, push it into a pool to boil the water, and then throw in the mushroom, which will cook and become edible.

The final aspect is that this game supports playing essentially however you want. In many roguelikes, leveling up is based on getting experience from fighting enemies, completing objectives, and so on. In Catacomb Kids, each floor has a leveling orb, which, once picked up, allows the player to level up once. Nothing else matters, as long as you get the orb, you can level up. That means if you want to play by dodging dangerous situations with teleportation magic, no problem. Want to slaughter everyone you come across? Cool. Tackle the levels however you want, because you won't be punished for skipping rooms and opponents like you would be with an EXP system.


Overall, it's a very fun and unique experience that I think is absolutely worth $16 in the current state. The developer is very communicative as well, and does weekly Dev streams on Twitch.

Edit: I forgot a HUGE aspect (equal playstyle representation), so I've updated the TL;DR and added the section.

A thing people always loved about those cranky old-school ROGUELIKES was the fact that the worlds they presented adhered to rules and could therefore play on their own". A foe could find a flask of poison you dropped

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Introduction            	 Catacomb Kids is the Dark souls of the roguelike 2D platformers. If you mess up just a little bit in this game, it punches you in the gut and kicks you in the teeth. Randomly generated catacombs and randomly made characters make the game infinitely fun. Right now Catacomb Kids is in Early Access, but there is tons on different variants in the game. (Weapons, shields, armor, potions, catacombs layouts, and different types of magic.) Right now there is only two classes with more on the way in future updates. Along with all the single player features, there is a verses mode with eight different arenas, but there is only local co-op and verses an AI. The only bad thing that I can say about this game is that there is no setting for changing the difficulty.
Pros
Versus mode
Randomized catacombs
Randomized playable character
No game breaking glitches
Great controller support
No performance issues


Cons
Can be too hard for some
Very unforgiving
Barely any display options


Conclusion
Catacomb Kids is a brutally fun roguelike game, but it could be too hard for some people. It really needs a difficulty setting.  Catacomb Kids has almost unlimited replay value because it has randomly generated playable characters and catacombs. In the end, Catacomb Kids is 100% worth a buy even in Early Access, and there is more content on its way to make this game worth it even more.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Twenty minutes into Catacomb Kids and I've died approximately twice every minute. Completing the tutorial alone saw my death toll rise into high double digits. With over three hours under my belt, I'd say I passed the 100 milestone some time ago.

Catacomb Kids is malicious. I'm not a skilled gamer, but I'm experienced enough to pick up a few universal tricks. This game cares nothing for that; if you go in overconfident, you're going to be humbled. Any bravado will be wiped clean as you're forced to learn the ropes from the very basics. It's difficult not to reference the Souls series, though I'm loathe to as it resembles it in spirit only, but it's still an apt comparison. The game may be a seething, malevolent entity but it's not at all unfair.

You have every means possible to succeed, even from the very beginning. The variety of classes possess myriad skills and equipment, while leveling offers increased stats and perks. Your melee swings must be timed but they're reliable and spells provide valuable effects from a safe range. Your repertoire is further boosted by agile rolls, boost jumps, throws and Mario-style head-stomps. On top of this, you can find loot all over the dungeon to increase stats, quaff or hurl at unfortunate enemies.

The danger you face is all-pervasive. You have your usual mobs which so far have been pretty standard aesthetically but their behaviour helps mix the action up. Slimes cling to surfaces and charge when they spot you, bats will pester you from the sky and bands of goblins will gang up but flee when over-powered. Empty rooms are no reason to let your guard down though; there are minute details revealing traps all over the level. Tiny, pixel-thin tripwires will trigger a flood of gas once broken leaving you a couple of seconds to flee before it ignites, setting the room aflame. Pressure plates will send massive weights crashing to the floor and hidden spikes will pierce you if you get close enough. The sheer variety of ways you'll be dispatched is enough to ease the blow when you're once more incinerated, devoured, flattened, stabbed, poisoned, decapitated etc.

The controls are a little wonky to begin with, at least with keyboard (no mouse necessary). I can see it improving greatly with a gamepad but there are currently some issues the developer plans to address so I've not tried it myself. Of course, I'll update the review once I've had a chance to test it out. There are three main buttons alongside the directional keys but apart from some initial confusion, it works well enough. Later skills, magic and items have appropriate hotkeys; it's all very standard and can be reassigned easily. Once you've adapted to both the control scheme and the mechanics themselves, all the initial issues have resolved.

It's one of those lovely Early Access experiences that could easily function as a finished product but that's not to say that it wouldn't benefit from the months of work ahead. I've had one instance of graphical glitching but nothing game-breaking, so far at least. There are clear plans to include extra content, with entire menus exhibiting future items and the class system promising more than the inital two types. It certainly could do with a little more of everything but what's here already is a solid product. It's hugely playable in its current version, which at least helps ease the worries that comes with all my EA titles.

I'm a roguelite/roguelike fanatic and the recent resurgence of the genre has been my personal Golden Age" but I'm not blind to the flaws inherent in the formula. Catacomb Kids might not sidestep all those pitfalls but it works with what it has to be both unique and exciting. As such

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

There was 4 of us to begin with

We entered the dungeon, came out of the door one by one, the first to go met his fate when an axe swinging back and forth from the ceiling almost cut off his head, he rolled under it just in time, went off the edge because of his roll, and straight into some spikes off the side of the edge

There were 3

The Second to go had found a fancy chest, but it was to dangerous of an area to open it in, he grabbed the chest and brought it with him until it was safe, but the first gap he came across he tried to jump, he fell into spikes AND triggered a pressure plate which sent a hammer flying down and squishing his already dead body.

There were 2

He opened the door confidentally while i stood back watching him, he rolled into the room and was surrounded by tons of monsters and met his maker

There was me

I had 1 health, i rolled through a bunch of monsters, opened a door and before the monsters could get through i closed it, i was safe, i found a dead body, and i was screwed any other way so, i ate the body in hopes food would help me heal, i started eating anything edible i could find until i found a skull, i shrugged, bit into it, and choked on a bone.

There were none

This game is very unforgiving and hard to get used to, but very rewarding if you play well, i give this game in its current state an 8/10

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

I can't express how happy I am that this game has finally made it to steam. I missed the kickstarter so I have been twiddling my thumbs and biting my nails in anticitpation since the day I first saw gameplay. This game hits all the sweets spots when it comes to my criteria for rouge-likes. Lot's of random/procedural goodness, stats, classes, weapons, enemies, clever traps, etc. There is even a brilliant implimentation of some basic physics built into the game which you must strategize with and use to your advantage. The aspect that really makes Catacomb Kids stand out are the small details that add comlexity to such a simple platformer, for example, I discovered that when you are weilding a magic dagger of electricity, jumping into a pool of water will (for now obvious reasons) f***k you up. Another neat mechanic is your food pallet. Eating certain combinations of enemy corpses will have varrying effects. There's tons of small details like these that just gives the game charm and character.

Overall I'm super excited to see how things will progress and just how active the devs will be. The price is a bit steep but I don't regret buying the game. In it's current state it is 100% playable and the most fun I've had with a game this year. My pros/cons:

Pros:
-Hard as nails (in a challenging/fair way)
-Proceduraly generated goodness
-Great pixel-esque graphics and wonderful sound
-Controls are really tight and dialed in (playing on a 360 controller)
-Good varriation of weapons/loot/potions
-The one boss that I've made it to was really badass
-Lots of depth in the game mechanics and strategizing is a must
-The exploding trap is really clever and I've never seen it in another game

Cons:
-As of right now the level layouts and room/combinations repeat quite a bit
-At first the menu and gameplay were really confusing and the tutorial was buggy and confusing as well
-Only 2 classes at the moment (obviously I know this will change)
-Spells are fairly limited as well
-Minor game mechanics that need tweaked/balanced
-All the other expected buggy things/ lag spikes that come with an Alpha build

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

A genuinely fun, if unforgiving, roguelite platformer, Catacomb Kids is a seemingly simple game with excellent gameplay, good atmosphere, and a really neat soundtrack. It is still very much an alpha at the time of this writing, so I would recommend waiting if you're concerned.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This game is unforgiving. Although no mouse support, gamepad support is present and I am yet to try this. Controls can be remapped, especially as jump on Z is annoying.

Like the top review, A LOT of funny playthroughs have happened in my short play time.

1) You can jump on things to kill them. I jumped on a poisonous mushroom to destroy it... which launched me into a swinging trap. No more leg. I landed in a lake with pirahnas. Dead.

2) Ate a troll thing. Survived. Ate another troll thing. Got poisoned. Ate is bones. Choked and died.

3) Drank a clear potion. Turned into a block of ice and died.

4) Drank an orange potion. Poisoned and got killed by a flipping bat.

Many ways to die.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Prepare to die! MANY times. This game is all about making wise decisions at a rapid pace.
Do you fight that skeleton or stealthily avoid it? Do you jump that lava chasm or hope for another way around?
With a little bit of luck and experimentation.  You will learn tactics to survive and overcome your enemies. Using the traps of the Catacombs against them. Spells, and random magical loot also help in survival. Nonethless though, it all can end quickly as one mistake can spell your doom. Catacomb Kids is an unforgiving game.

I made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Before the review, I'd like to say this is my first time reviewing any game, and I have been hyped for this game since 2013, so this review may be slightly biased.

Where to start... most things about this game are excellent! The controls are excellent IF you use a controller (I'll get into that later), the enemies are really fun to fight, the combat feels pretty nice, and mechanics are what makes this game stand out.

About the controls, I say it's excellent with a controller because the keyboard is a little weird, however that's just my opinion. It's not unmanagable though, and if you prefer keyboard, go for it!

The enemies are really interesting, since the grumbles, which are the main enemies, tend to have a lot of health, however are easily predictable. The slimes, goos, and byats are all easy meals, which is great. When you descend deeper, more types of enemies start to appear, making the game a little more difficult each floor.

The combat is something that made this game really great. With blocking, rolling, parrying, and dismemberment, you have tons of options. There are a variety of melee weapons, aswell as tomes for those who prefer the mage class. Speaking of tomes, the spells in this game are each unique, and are all good in their own way.

The mechanics, however, are what makes this game what it is. For example, you can heat up a boulder using a fire spell, then push it into water, pick up a poison mushroom and cook it, ridding the poison and making it safe to eat. You can beat enemies to death, create distractions, or activate traps or switches with JUST a rock! You can melt balls of slime or goo, and consume them for health, or use them as weapons against grumbles by blinding them. You can knock over torches and create a fire, burning enemies in the vicinity. Plus how each kid is randomized with different traits just adds more variety to this game!

That's the end of this review. Keep in mind, this is my first one, and it may not be clear. If you're interested in difficult, but fun rogue-likes, you'll definitely want to pick this game up. 9/10.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

I absolutely *love* this game, early access though it may be.

It's *brutal*. It's not uncommon to roll away from an enemy and straight onto some spikes within seconds of starting the game.

But it's *fun*. It's like Spelunky (you HAVE played Spelunky, haven't you?) except with some traditional action RPG elements like classes, equipment, skills and attributes, and it makes for lots of intriguing possibilities.

Maybe you play as a Wanderer, and you pick up the first Grumbul corpse you find, hold down V to track the Grumbuls. You find the leveling orb and level up Intelligence and choose Trajectory. You aim the first mystery potion you have at a pair of Grumbuls, but it's a potion of might! Fortunately, you also knocked over a sconce and set the floor on fire. One of them makes a beeline for you, so you run like mad. Fortunately, you chose Boots of Gossamer and you don't trip the pressure plate, but the Grumbul does... but not slow enough to get caught by it. It hits you for two health out of your four and sets you on fire. You roll into water to put the fire out and then jump out of the water, but not before a -off fishana jumps out of the water and takes your final health point.

Maybe you play as a poet, and you chance it with three health. You learn the Double Jump spell (it's a spell in this game!) and find another Magic In Motion spellbook. You hold C to learn that one, too, but click on the middle, which gives you the floating book skill Otherblink". You get the leveling orb and choose Strength with the skill Heavy Lifting

Early Access Review

This game is tough. Like it will rend you a new behind, tough. It tests your intelligence, skill, and overall ability as you fight the myrid of opponents the Catacombs have to offer. I am new and have been killed by a slime 6 times and by falling into darkness that lead to spikes 4 times. Despite the deaths I still want to play, it is that kind of game, the kind that keeps pushing you down but regardless you keep getting back up. The developer Fourbitfriday truely has put his love in this game. So if you like platformers that have RPG elements and are very difficult going in, then this game is for you. I myself shall continue to explore those Catacombs and fight the Grumbuls and other monsters it has to offer.

Vagante's older Brother.  Catacombs Kids expects you to become a real MacGyver, to make the most out of what you got to get through each level. This is where the game truly shines. You can't just steamroll through everything. Sometimes your ingenuity will get you further into the game than pure strenght. Knowing the strenghts and weaknesses of your character, you must assess the situation and sometimes act quick to get through certain areas.  When you do kill enemies or get through the level by using your head, it feels extremely rewarding.I am so glad i bought this and Vagante as both provide a kind of different experience but ultimately both are very fun.

Death 1: green slime
Death 2: green slime
Death 3: burning green slime
Death 4: purple slime
Death 5: spikes
Death 6: ricocheting bottle of lava that i didnt know existed until i used trajectory into lava and hit hit a green slime on its way back to me killing us both... fml XD
Death 7: still laughing about death 6, while getting murdered by a green slime
Death 8: grumble

This game will test your resolve and make you go insane if you let it. but kleep in mind 99% of the deaths you inevitably will recieve will still be as funny as your first time playing and they will be YOUR FAULT, you were too slow to react, jumped a tad bit too far/late drank the wrong potion ect. The game gives you a few ways to puss out by Finding another way" to do things but if you cant handle it

I backed this on Kickstarter, so I didn't pay the full $16, but I would if I had to. Worth every cent, I knew this game would be awesome when I first saw it, and now that I've been able to play it, I have been proven right. I know that a lot of people are wary of early access games, as they should be, but this one is 100% worth it. The developer is kind and quick to fix issues, and the game truly speaks for itself. It's very challenging, but so much fun. Great game, highly reccommend.

Tough, unforgiving, and death is often. Rewards players who think about their surroundings instead of rushing head-first into the room full of baddies. I'd say it was worth the wait.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

One of the most detailed, polished and simply fun Rogue-Lite" games out there even in it's early stages. I genuinely think it can compete with the likes of Spelunky and Binding of Isaac if it continues to be developed like this.

Edit: I have been a kickstarter backer and have been playing the alpha for much longer than what is visible on steam."

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This game is so mean to me, but I love it! I've been slimed, decapitated, torn to shreds, burnt, poisoned, drowned, poisoned and drowned at the same time, burned to death with my own spells, burned to death after knocking over a torch, burned to death after incenerating a goblin, only to have him start me on fire, and many more.

Fastest death so far? 3 seconds after spawning (yep, my fault). Longest lived character? Probably 40 minutes and I was DAMN PROUD!!

Hard as it is, it's totally fair. Each of my deaths was due to inexperience, rushing in without looking, panicking and mashing the attack button instead of timing it, mis-timing a jump, or (most frequently) losing a fight due to poor strategy or timing. The battles can be pretty epic, especially once your skill level rises and you can be more creative with your combat choices. Early on you'll be happy you lived at all.

There's something about the way permadeath is done in this game that makes it fun and very compelling. Part of this might be due to the fact it's only in Alpha 0.0.9 and is extraordinarily fast & responsive, and impressively bug-free for such an early version.

There are a couple issues I'd like to see fixed. The jump mechanic can be a little wonky. If you jump into a wall with a ladder on it, you'll stick to wherever you hit on the wall as long as (a) there's a ladder there, and (b) you're still pushing left or right on your controller. However, if you roll the controller UP as you reach the wall (a natural movement, since you'll be wanting to go up the moment you get there), then you will not stick to the wall and instead fall back to the ground.

Lastly, a wired XBOX controller makes a HUGE difference -- it's much easier than the keyboard for this game -- but the controller bindings don't work for OSX. I ended up buying ControllerMate for OSX and then programming it to match the KBD1 key bindings.  The game doesn't seem to actually recognize the controller; it works because ControllerMate converts each button press to an equivalent key binding.

Overall, if you like dungeon crawlers of any type, this may end up being your favorite.

Early Access Review

Catacomb Kids is a real-time roguelike platformer that draws more than a few cues from Spelunky, but approaches the genre in a manner all its own, resulting in a game that mashes roleplaying elements with platforming and inevitable death with a suprising degree of depth and tact.

Fromt the start, Catacomb Kids serves up a generous helping of character diversity, with two (and eventually six) different classes to choose from in the beginning, and an infinite pool of randomly-rolled characters with entirely different starting stats and equipment within each class, not to mention a randomly-generated appearance and name, just to reinforce how different each of your runs will be. Even in the game's current incarnation, the Bully and Poet classes offer an entirely different gameplay experience from the start, and even then, a vividly different experience depending on whether your chosen victi-er, hero" is

Already worth its price, no risk of early access disappointment.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

First this game is still in Early Acces but it feels already pretty finished. There are NO awful bugs and the game runs pretty well. Furthermore the developers are constantly working on the game and they are very close to the
community( https://www.reddit.com/r/CatacombKids/new/  ) as you can see here.

There is enough content to play hundreds of hours or even more and not only because it is a rouge-like. Catacomb Kids has so many possible ways to play. On every new run you can try someting new and so its never get boring. For example there are five different weapon classes(Hammers, Swords, Daggers, Spears, Axes) and each weapon class splits into six differnt typs. And those are just the weapons, there are also magic, armor, skills for each weapon class and so on. This game can be incomprehensibly complex, but this is the point why Catacomb Kids makes so much fun! Though you have to invest some time to understand everything and get into. And yes the game is really hard and you will fail at the beginning however its a part of the game and you will love it.
The graphics are functional that is clear. But the Pixelart has its charm and the game looks in his own way very beautiful.

So just buy this piece of software and have fun! You won't regret it :D

The price may be intimidating, but regardless this game is amazing. Whether or not you want to pick this up though, is your choice. Even in early-access this game is relatively bug free, haven't run into a single one, Yet not all content is there yet. WARNING: This game does not mess around when it says 'brutal'. Normal enemies can one shot you if you have low defence. Be prepared.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

As of this review, the game is currently in Early Access for about $16, so its price and content may not be representative of its final product.

So continuing on to the actual part of the review, This Pixel-art Rogue-like game is amazing. I don't even know where to begin, so I guess I'll start off with the background. I originally torrented an earlier version of this game. Yes, I'm a terrible person, but keep in mind how hard it can be to judge a game from a trailer and some gameplay footage. (Hint: It's bloody difficult.) I did end up purchasing the game though, because I think that the content that they placed for early access was spot-on.

What piqued my curiosity from this game is the depth of this game. There's just so many interactions in this game that you simply would not expect a Triple A developing team would do. While I am comparing apples to oranges here, let's say you're in an Open-world RPG and you kill a goblin. Would you have been able to eat the goblin down to the bone? Would you have been able to eat the bones of the goblin and possibly choke on some while losing health? Simply put, you can in Catacomb Kids. For anyone playing, if you kill the purple slime and throw the ball toward the kombold, then it blinds the enemy allowing you to kill it or let it fall into the traps.

If you are able to, you can bottle a ball of slime and cook it in an open camp fire and drink the slime. Luckily for me, it was sweet. After going through some floors, you can meet a merchant, which sells a number of different equipment. Of course, on the off-chance that you don't have any money from killing the goblins, you can try and kill the merchant him/herself to acquire some loot. It's just these little things, like throwing a goblin into a lake of piranhas to get across without being gnawed to death, that is really fun.

Each time I enter a new floor,  goes down. Quite literally; there are traps being activated with spikes from a pressure plate, flammable gases dispersed to blow up, mushrooms that extrude nauseous gases, and potions that can either freeze, zap, or burn you to death. Simply put, each floor is pretty unforgiving in its current state of the game, and on the off chance you step on a trap and it teleports you to the bottom of the stage, you better hope that you don't get stepped on like a goomba. Personal experience from that.

Gameplay aside, Controls in the game are top-notch, but a bit atypical from what I expected. If you have some experience using a Super Nintendo Emulator like snes9x, then you will get into this game a little bit smoother than others. I wish that the interaction between the ladder and wooden platform would be a little bit smoother, but that's something to wait for later I suppose.

As for graphics, the game seems to be currently set to a 4:3 aspect ratio resolution, but won't be a huge deal as most of the area will be covered in the shadows. There's no options for AA whatsoever or quality settings, but let me be honest here. You won't need to worry about having 800x600 screen to play this.

My main gripe at the moment is probably the music. It's not bad in that it doesn't fit, nor is it just poorly composed. I just wish I had an option to turn it off, even moreso it would be nice if the music would be muted when I'm on a different program. Other than that, it's quite soothing.

**

Overall, a lot of people have been saying to wait until the final product comes out. I don't disagree with this statement. I'd hate to be hyped up for a game only to be disappointed and regret investing my money into this team, but this game deserves my money. While I have not been able to get to the end of the game, the content they currently have out right now feels like enough content to be a full-fledged game. Just not for the same price value.

If anything though, I wish that there would be some more random interactions between heading to the next floor. So far, I've been able to see two different merchants, a kombold encampment, and a narrow dungeon. There would be times between each floor where I get a wad of cash, not knowing when or where I'll spend it. Perhaps a clergyman can heal players, a wizard that can imbue weapons, or a tailor can disguise you as a kombold. They're probably coming in the updates, but here's to hoping that this game will be worth the investment!

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

It wasn't until now, dying once again to the Reaper, that I decided to write a review. You'd think this would come after finally defeating him -- but I still haven't. I just had my best chance and blew it, and it was truly awesome. I'm not great at platformers at all, but this game is difficult. Yet, unlike, say, Dark Souls (not really a platformer -- I know, shhhh), it always feels fair. Not at first, no. At first it's going to feel like you're bouncing down a flight of stairs, and once he adds stairs you probably will. But eventually you'll understand the various complexities of what makes a good build and how to navigate the world without dying. How to navigate quickly, eventually. And how to find, after hours and hours, the thing that's truly exciting about this game. That shot of adrenaline.

I might play a 20 minute session or two hours. For instance, I spent more time writing this than I did on the run that inspired me to write this. But it's not a casual game in the slightest. It's unforgiving.

I can't wait to see what classes he adds next and what other weird systems he'll introduce. I haven't felt that way about an EA game in a while. Most of the time I just sit tight and hope for the best. In this case, I check daily to see if the new build is out, because I know there's a new class in it (Wanderer).

Use a controller.

I hope it gets optimized as it goes, since it starts to chug a bit on my Mac around Floor 3. My gaming PC handles it fine though, so (shrug).

There's not a ton of content just yet, but I've been entertained for almost 30 hours over the past few months by it, and I expect to play a lot more as it grows. I also play a lot of games and cycle through them pretty quickly. I have this sitting firmly atop my Perpetually Playing" category.

It's dope. I feel cool playing it even though I suck at it. Like I know that it'll either be huge or it'll just stay this rad secret I know about. Either way -- but I hope it takes off

This is A tough as nails roguelite platformer and I love it! It's currently very tough. If you are looking for a casual game, look elsewhere. It has excellent controls, especially with a controller. I know why I died every time.

I'll update later, but I've been playing the alpha builds. It's only getting better with each release.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Disclaimer, I backed this on Kickstarter and played quite a bit before EA.
If you want  the short version: It's pretty damn awesome.

Okay, slightly longer one. Mix of Spelunky and Darks Souls kind of fits but with even infinitely more weird stuff that happens. It's always the bunch of things that interact in ways you had never thought of making something awesome, just so you can abuse the hell out of it next afterwards.

You can  and really should experiment. If only your life probably will end quickly otherwhise. And with time you learn tricks that help you tremendously - or kill you because you make some incredibly dumb mistake. Maybe lay a  stone on the pressure plate to trigger the giant weight and go through before it is back up? Maybe stop it by freezing the whole thing in place? Or just use some slime to stick it to the ground? Or maybe you should cut of the rope and throw it around with that one strength boon? Or just let enemies run into it and laugh? Or use it to craft items? Or put bouncy paste under it to throw enemies into the air just before they become pancakes with no chance of escape? Or...

These lists of interactions can be made for pretty much all gameplay elements. And all these things you can do connect with the other things you can find or make.
For the EA part: It's surprisingly polished. At the moment the biggest stuff missing is content past floor  5. There are a bunch of supre scary enemies and variety but if you get past the Twins (yeah, as if, good luck :P) the difficulty slowly decreases because the later stuff isn't there yet. Also, so far only ~20 from the ~60? level up boons are implemented so if you get that far you probably don't want to focus on one stat only. To be fair, you will have to play for a loooong time until you see any of that.

It is a game of YASD but you keep comming back and back and back. And I don't think there is any game quite like it.
In short: It's pretty damn awesome.

What to expect

Similarly to, Rogue Legacy, you will play as a randomly generated character with various skill buffs and deficiencies. A trait like Likes Swords will give your kid a skill bonus, while a trait like clumsy will make them particularly loud when landing. You level up by picking up glowing orbs, or gain magical spells by finding books in the dungeon. Its fairly easy to get into the rhythm of bounding around and fighting off the denizens of the catacombs.

You should expect to DIE without warning. This game is incredibly difficult, and it doesnt care how or when you die. You will enter a level and suddenly youve been slain by an orc, or by drinking a potion that happens to burn you alive. Once that occurs, its back to square one with a new kid and on to penetrating a new dungeon.

Catacomb kids is definitely not for the squeamish or the impatient. You have to take your take to assure yourself safe passage through the catacombs, and keep your guard up against the terrifying A.I. of the monsters. Im not going to say the game gets easier when you get higher levels, or gear, because Ive never had the pleasure of becoming a powerhouse. Catacomb Kids takes pleasure in destroying your hopes and dreams, and more than likely it was your own damn fault.

This game uses objects in a way that not many others have. You can eat the corpses of the fallen, or throw their goo against a wall to create a sticky trap. You can combine meals to increase your stats, use potions as bombs, and so much more. There is a lot to the system if you live long enough to bask in its glory.

Changes we want/Additions

Attribute deficiencies  I dont mind the random skills that give the player some negative factors, but the negatives in stat points is unnecessary. The game is already brutally hard to the point that it seems like an annoyance to lose stat points. Especially when you can enter a catacomb and instantly die from the swipe of an enemy after finding a perfect stat combination for your character.

Scenery - Level design is fine for a Rogue Lite, but the levels become a cluster of cobbled rock too quickly. Id like to see more of a varied look to the areas. If for nothing more than adding a bit more ambience to my continuous deaths.
Platforming  Platforming is a bit too floaty and will lead to tons of accidental deaths. I wish it was more traditional to the 2D spirit of Super Mario and other platformers.

Enemy Difficulty  When youre starting out the enemies are much too powerful. Youll face off against monsters who can take 5 stabs from your weapon, and instantly kill you in one hit. Its a little too frustrating after dying multiple times in a session, and finally gaining victory and receiving terrible drops.

Gearing up  Since Orcs dont mess around and can kill you in one hit at the start of the game. The reward for defeating them is usually an awful piece of gear. Since these hard nose battles can end with them simply winning through a battle of attrition, defeating them should feel more rewarding to the player. Mostly because they are pretty adept at breaking through your attacks, and ignoring any top of roll moves you attempt.

Cooperative play  This title features a competitive mode which is cool and all, but Id love to tackle the dangerous catacombs with a pal. Make it happen!

Early Access Verdict

As of Early Access release Catacomb Kids is a brutally hard game that often focuses too hard on frustrating the player. It has a lot going for it in the way of a great item system and interesting combat. The A.I. is murderously powerful and unrelenting, the jumps are a little imprecise, and slaying the enemies isnt as rewarding as it could be.
As of now the game is loads of fun, but feels as if determination isnt enough to progress through the catacombs. Id prefer better rewards and investment for tackling death at every corner. It needs a little less Dark Souls and slightly more Dungeon of the Endless at the moment. Lets see how it shapes up in the next couple of patches!

This game is already more full of content then many full games...

And it's GOOD content. I played at least 100 hours before it came out on steam, and it looks like I'm getting a lot more.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

My Let's Play, skip below for the quick impressions:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9310oIFNIds

Roguelite Platformer with tons of RPG mechanics.  As you explore, your map will slowly flesh itself out with an almost intense fog-of-war shrouding your playing field which managed to kill me good with traps just out of sight.  Even though I know they are randomly generated levels, they feel designed with cruel intentions.  Which is to say, this game is HARD.  Unmercifully hard.  And it's permadeath.

But the game is about experimenting.  Not only do you have to pick a class with specfic attributes, you're given a random roster of characters to choose from (within that class) that have a random assortment of starting equipment and attributes.

And even though it's only version 0.0.6 game is really tight.  Animations are excellent (in my Let's Play, I land on a ledge and my character had to catch his balance which felt perfect for the situation because there were a set of spikes right below me) as well as cause and effect.  Find a potion and drink it? Now you have an empty glass bottle.  You could throw it at an enemy or drop it on a trap.

You can carefully open doors so that you may re-close them, or you could bust them open and then destroy them.

There are only two classes to choose from right now with another four to be released at a later date.

I think my only real complaint is that it's local co-op and not online co-op.

Amazing game. Hard as hell. Permadeath dungeon crawler platforming game with many ways to approach situations and tons of ways to die. You will die a lot, but it makes succeeding that much more rewarding.

You begin by selecting one of three (at the moment, only three) classes and then you pick a character from a randomly selected group of individuals, each with their own unique abilites, items and weaknesses. Once you enter the catacombs you are free to do whatever you like. You can go back through the door you just entered right from the start or you can rush the door to the next floor. However the smart way to play would be to explore the area and grab the orb of leveling" which can be found on each floor as that is the only way to level your character.

You can interact with just about everything in the environment

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This game is probably one of the most mechanically solid experiences I have seen. The animations are excellent, the combat is great and the difficulty will make you wanna stab yourself.

I particularly enjoy the interactions between objects and enemies. It is reminiscent of games like Spelunky (which I love). There is also a nice amount of detail like Grumbuls hunting smaller creatures and being able to knock over torches in the background to set things on fire.

The mechanics are fantastic and things like climbing and jumping feel responsive and fluid. Combat is nice and entertaining with things like shield blocking, grappling and using the environment to your advantage. Everything feels" just right and it's a joy to jump and run and stab and so on and so forth.

So far it is a bit lacking in content though. Only one "area"

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

One thing this game really needs is a intro message saying This game is not for the feint of heart". The reason being is that catacomb kids will beat your  into ground and then chew on it for good measure. Even the tutorial is hard to get trhough without dying atleast five times. Yet despite it's ruthlessness I feel an odd mix of total satasifaction and soul-crushing depression every time I play it. CK is increadibly in depth and leaves much to be discovered on your own. I lost track of how many "not so obvious tricks" I learned from my ("checks death counter") 73 deaths. But don't let my ever so depressing review scare you away

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

Item and environment interaction is something so integral to good roguelikes. It's something that sets them apart from games like Rogue Legacy, that have the kind of difficulty roguelike fans look for, and an affectation of 'nintendo hard' platformers that hit people right in the nostalgia, but have no real substance behind them.

I could tell right away that the developers of Catacomb Kids were not only familiar with more venerable roguelikes, but that they had a keen insight into what makes them so captivating. I often find myself thinking my way around a problem much like I would in Nethack or DCSS, where I'd tally my resources and make calculated decisions that would often fail spectacularly. My poor catacomb kid would die, but with every death I learn a little more about the game's logic.

This level of complex entity interaction is something I expect from any game calling itself a roguelike (much more so than, say, the overzealous expectation of an ASCII interface), even to an extent that I believe it's a cornerstone of the genre.

Catacomb Kids does not claim an indulgence of weapon types, monsters, or classes for the player. Instead, they have created a meaningful and treacherous arena for players who want a game that demands that they think tactically and, most importantly, learn from their mistakes.

Catacomb Kids

Gracefully dismember three Grumbul, knocking two of them into a brazier and sparking a fire that finishes them off. Yeah. I'm a badass. Pick up a hot potato attempting to rifle through the pockets of the bodies. Die. Fear the potatoes, they know when your guard is down. They know when your health is low. They come to sear your palms when you least expect it.

Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

My takeaway so far - Its very much like Vagante, but with a little bit crisper platforming controlls.

If you dont know Vagante, then this game is essentially a traditional rougelike but with a side scrolling  dungeon/cave instead of top down.  The main difference being that its not turn based of course.  This isnt a rick dangerouse/splunky/ect style thing (no they are not rouglikes at all).  This type of game has a lot more focus of RPG things like leveling up, finding equipment and spells ect.

Its good so far, playable and fun.  A few crashes from time to time but its very early alpha and is pretty polished at this early stage.

Its hard, like vagante, but because the movement is a bit crisper and free flowing, its not as frustrating.

Recommeded if you like the genre.



Catacomb Kids
Early Access Review

This is a strong recommend from me; even at an Alpha stage of development. The procedurally generated dungeons and the statistically random generated characters add endless variety and unique situations.

Brutal and unforgiving. Expect quick deaths if you do not have appropriate reaction speeds; the random generator can create incredibly difficult to traverse trap rooms. One nice touch right from the beginning is the ability to re-roll by entering the exit from the previous floor.

There are too many gameplay elements to explain, but the attention to detail in the weapon-type combat, spell-type combat, and ailments is very refined and filled with variety, even at an Alpha stage. The level up upgrades (Rainbow Orb); if you survive long enough to make it to these coveted items, they will allow you to use attribute upgrades like parrying, free-running, reduced damaged from traps, plus many more expanded as you obtain more orbs.

I am very excited to see the game develop further, to see more classes, and see how refined the gameplay between them comes. To be honest, the two class system works for me currently, but having more, it would be interesting to see. I for one, would love to see a miner-like character.

Catacomb Kids

This game is amazing! Its brutal and fun and every run feels so different. Already played it for around 12 hours and its really good. Not like a lot of other rogue-like's where randomization feels bland. With the diversity of kids and layout and starting armor and magic etc, you feel like ever run is unique.

Closure
CLOSURE is a black and white alienish platform puzzle game where the world exists because of light. Without light, there is only nothing and I mean nothing, if you try to jump onto a platform that doesn't have light near it, you will fall through the world. If you are swimming and your light floats away, you will drop out of the world without it. Solid walls become jumps when there is no light on them. The object of each of the almost 100 levels is basically to make it to the door at the end. You can pick up lit orbs, you can put lit orbs into carriers that will carry them. This leads to some really interesting platform mechanics, such as moving lights turn into elevators when normally they'd be solid walls. You can put orbs into transporters that will make 2 areas lit instead of 1. There are push boxes, push rollers that will of course roll, lit push boxes, lamps that you can adjust to cast light onto different areas and so on. This is a unique, enjoyable, atmospheric, immerse game, but I have a feeling that once you're done, you're done. They made a really alien world here and the music is awesome and belongs in a suspense drama. After the tutorial levels when the game opens up, the music eases up so its not as intense. Very worth a play through, I own it a few different ways, Steam, GOG, did I mention its free for Playstation Plus members?

Closure
Guide your little person up the ladder, across the gaps in the floor and out the door. But if you can't see it, It doesn't exist. Walk off into the darkness and fall into oblivion. Wall lamps can be rotated to reveal floors and glowing orbs can be carried to light your way. Some doors need to be unlocked with a key and you can carry only one thing at a time. Appropriate for a game about light and shadow the odd art design is done entirely in black and white.

The levels were a bit on the easy side, But I enjoyed the light/dark aspect, music and art design. Things are kept at a minimum, Though perhaps too minimal. I think more interesting things could have been done with the games gimmick. There's no story in the game. Just different themes for the three groups of levels. Which is fine as the game is fairly abstract anyway, But filling out the vignettes more would have been nice.

Closure
Closure's puzzle design is new, unique, and absolutely brilliant.  The story is told without you ever reading anything or any voice acting.  The music and art style is extremely moody and creepy in an almost Tim Burton-esque way, but still has plenty of it's own personality.  Highly reccomended for it's top notch atmosphere and genious puzzle design.  Solving the puzzles always feels rewarding.  I cannot complement the developers enough on this masterpiece.

Closure
Closure is a platform-puzzle game in a very unique form.

It has a very beautiful and minimalist (and kind of creepy) design all in black and white and very good sound and music as well. The way the game works with the shadow/light is pretty cool, and the levels are very well design, some of them has more than one way to be completed or some secrets"

Closure
I suppose the concept is pretty original, yes, but I think that's for a reason... there's just no way it could've worked. A puzzle platformer where the puzzles are easy and the platforming is clunky. Spend several minutes on tedious puzzles only to fail a jump and have to restart the entire level. Whoops, that looked solid, but apparently it isn't. Item babysitting is really fun, especially when the entire game is focused around it.

Sigh. I can't be nice to this game, there's not much enjoyable about it.

The puzzles" in this game are not ever too challenging. The hardest part is figuring out whether or not what you're trying to do is actually possible

Closure
This game has a unique aesthetic combined with a novel game mechanic. The multi-legged shape-shifting protagonist uses light to manipulate the game world. Whatever is not illuminated does not exist. The levels build on this mechanic and become increasingly complex as the player works through the challenge of completing the game.

Some levels (at least for me) are fairly challenging while others will seem straight forward, but I suspect different gamers will find a varying level of challenge on the same levels. i.e. What is a piece of cake for me might be a bear for you and vice versa.

I've played this game for about 8 hours over a few days and am closing in on completing it. Hoping to achieve 100% completion. The game has fascinated me and left me wanting to get back and see what new creative challenge the next level holds.

Closure
Closure is a puzzle game with a simple premise - what you cant see really isn't there. I thought this was a cool premise.

Most of the puzzles were very easy some even purely atmospheric. However, many times i fell through annoying small holes in the ground or messed up on something really minute causing me to replay the whole level. This game was still very fun despite being really annoying.

The final level set and secret bonuses were mostly pretty challenging and enjoyable. Closure has no replay value but the over 100 levels should last a decent amount of time themselves. There is also a developer commentary unlocked when you complete the game any%. I found it fairly interesting.

I got this game in the 1$ humble bundle. I thought it was a great game buy it if you like an atmospheric puzzler

Closure
Remember those short levels in Yoshi's Island where you could only see through a small light circle surrounding your character ?
This puzzle game elaborates upon the idea on more sophisticated ways, but with a unique catch: what cannot be seen does not exist. Platforms and walls become thin air when not in light.
From this base, there is enough variation not to be bored along the way.

Please note that the atmosphere is very strange and gloomy in this game, which you may or may not like.

If you want a demo, I advise you to try the Flash prototype the devs published a long time ago at Newsground. The final game is slightly better and more refined iirc, but it should give you a taste.

Closure
Closure is a 2D platform puzzle game, where everything that has light on it exists. Everything that doesn't have lights will make you fall down. If you fall  down to the bottom of the screen you will die. That sounds really simple as a mechanic, but is really well executed in the game. With a great look at detail. The thing you have to do is in every level is that you have to open a door to get to the next level. So you  for instance have to find a key or get some object activated to open the door.  You will be really challenged by many of puzzles. Some puzzles also got me really stuck for a while. What I like in the levels are the many different puzzles with new objects. The design and the sounddesign combine well within the game, working well with the game's aesthetics. The only bad thing I can say about the game was that at the third stage of the game the puzzles where strangely enough really easy. When compared to the stages before that. (Maybe it was just me.) Closure is instead of many other puzzle games I experienced, packed with many hours of gameplay. (12 hours )
Closure is also one of the few games that convinced me to replay some levels over again to get all the collectables. Which is challenging.

In short: A puzzle game with many hours of play where only anything in the light exists.

If you are interested you can try the gameplay out on newgrounds:
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/480006
( Also maybe interesting for people who own it because it has different levels )

Closure
Very unique puzzle - platforming game, utilising light as the main element. The game introduces different mechanics very well on each level, and tests the player with different combined mechanics  within a level. The artwork is brilliant, Tim Burton-ish style glamoured with Lovecraft's world. The music is beautifully composed, bringing up different theme on each level but still retaining the eerie atmosphere. The game also entices you to explore the level- not just completing the puzzle, by putting hidden moths throughout all levels which is complusory to finish the game completely. I would recommend this game for people who likes puzzle games and/or gothic art style.

Closure
The fear of the dark is one of the most common phobias. But how many people really fear the dark, and not just the real or imagined threats it conceals? Certainly anyone who plays Closure, Eyebrow Interactive's wickedly creative indie game. In Closure's world, only what is visible exists-- step on a shadow and you'll fall right off the screen. To light a path through each level, the player must learn to use various arrangements of fixed, rotating, or portable light sources.

This is two-dimensional platforming like you've never seen before. Carry lamps to preserve the solid ground beneath you. Divide walls into stepping stones by lighting them in segments. Free trapped objects by temporarily eliminating obstructions from reality. Even across 72 levels, these inventive puzzles never fail to surprise.

Closure's spooky, greyscale style perfectly matches its central theme of light and shadow. Artist Jon Schubbe is responsible for the hallucinatory environments, which range from underground mines to deserted carnivals; Chris Rhyne provides the unearthly music and sound effects; and programmer Tyler Glaiel ties it all together. With no unnecessary parts, this game is an articulate, memorable experience.

The player takes control of three human characters throughout the game, each with their own backstory that is left open to interpretation. The player can also travel to the hub world, a land of doors occupied by an arachnid creature with horns and a hollow face, who gives access to the human protagonists. The difficulty ramps up smoothly when the levels are played in consecutive order, but if you get stuck in one world, you can use the hub world to jump to another.

Gamers exhausted by the frantic pace of many games will find relief in the methodical progression of Closure. No time limits or point scores here-- not even a Heads-Up Display. The game clearly wants you to share the unhurried pace of the protagonists as you explore their environments. Before proceeding through a level, it is sometimes necessary to study the paths taken by meandering globes of light, which I found to be a relaxing, almost meditative experience. If you're feeling impulsive, however, a fast respawn speed lets you experiment without punishment.

With Closure, Eyebrow Interactive proves that a game built around a single gameplay mechanic can offer not only an absorbing experience, but a re-playable one as well. To reach the game's many collectable items, players are often required to devise entirely new solutions to familiar puzzles. This results in a more sophisticated difficulty scale than traditional easy or hard modes, as players can choose their difficulty mid-level. That said, some of the later levels are mind-boggling. But a good challenge is healthy, and in a market saturated with mindless button-mashers, it is good to see a game that encourages thoughtfulness.

TL;DR -- Cool concept with a haunting aesthetic; smart puzzles that award creative solutions.

Closure
One of the few puzzle games I've completed without resorting to a walkthrough. The solutions are by no mean obvious or easy, but they always make sense.

Closure
A very challenging puzzle-platformer presented in black and white to take advantage of the shadows.

Whatever the light does not touch does not exist.
Expertly guide the light from one side of the map to the next to progress to the next room.
It is not as easy as it sounds, believe me.
This is trial and error in every sense of the word.
You are going to die. Alot.

8.5/10

Closure
Closure is a game unlike anything else out there.

Which isn't necessarily saying much on its own merit; there are many games out there are that are one-of-a-kind but also aren't really well-made games.

Closure isn't this game.

The core mechanics consist of a puzzle-platformer where solid ground shifts according to what is visible in the light. A very simple concept to understand, yet in end-game becomes very complex.

The atmosphere and art direction contribute substantially to the light/dark dynamic, and overall create a particular experience that only Closure can deliver.

If you enjoy puzzle-platformers, interesting art design, and conceptually stimulating gamesets, this is a game you cannot miss.

Closure
In Closure you will find challenging puzzles based on special orbs of light which you play with in a strategic way to reach the end of each level . It's got original and funny graphics along with a great soundtrack as well.

Closure
A well-paced and very challenging puzzle platformer with some interesting game mechanics, great art style and soundtrack. The disturbing and surreal atmosphere and plenty of room for its interpretation also make this game stand out among other platformers.

Closure
B&W platformer with a dark atmosphere. Play with lights & shadows, tons of possibilities. Just began trying to speedrun it, and there are some amazing shortcuts. Ambiant music is quite soft, has a nice ring, and not too tedious, even after listening to it for couple hours straight !

Closure
If I cant see it, it doesnt exist. This is pretty much the premise of the game and it is executed to very good effect. Closure is a puzzle platformer in which you are a weird little creature with no face, running about in the dark, and clinging desperately to the light so you dont fall off into nothingness while you try to map out each level and locate the exit. Oh and then you steal some peoples faces or something and solve light based puzzles in their bodies or whatever.

The puzzles themselves are pretty clever. In each new zone you start out with some pretty simple puzzles which gradually introduce new elements to you, but towards the end of the zone youre having to work out some pretty complicated stuff. The way these puzzles work is that walls and floors do not exist in the dark, so you have to position lamps and orbs of light about the place to let you do stuff like pass through a wall and not fall through the floor into the abyss, or maybe ride a spotlight up a wall to the exit. Its a bit weird at first really, but definitely an innovative twist on the standard puzzle platformer. One thing I really like about Closure as a puzzle platformer is that it doesnt just delight in killing you for no reason (unlike certain other dark puzzle platformers). Every level has a good sense of logic about it that you could probably work out without dying if you were careful and really thought about it; Closure doesnt resort to tricking you into dying, thats just not its style. The fact that Closure puts such a weighting on logic rather than trickery or trial and error (though I did have many trial an error moments trying to get my head around some of the harder puzzles) means that every level completed comes with a strong sense of accomplishment, as opposed to other puzzle platformers which only provide the feeling that youre glad its over before you walk into the next ridiculous trap.

The music that accompanies the game is top notch and really adds to the atmosphere of the game. Closure even makes use of some Tuban throat singing, which I dont think Ive heard in a game before, but it works really well for the existential and slightly creepy theme that Closure has going on.

There is one thing that I would warn people about with this game, and that is that I encountered a really weird bug playing this game on my new laptop (Windows 8.1 with integrated intel graphics) which caused light to not interact with surfaces properly and made me perpetually fall through the floor and die even though it was lit up  it was a game breaker. Ive also played this game on a rather old laptop (dedicated graphics, Linux) and on my main PC (dedicated graphics, Windows 7) and on both machines the game runs perfectly. From what I can tell the devs seem pretty active and willing to help resolve any issues but since this problem only affected 1 of my 3 devices and I was so close to finishing when I tried it on my new laptop I didnt bother getting it sorted out.

I have absolutely no recollection of purchasing Closure, which has added to the mystery of the game for me. Im just glad I did buy it (if I did buy it) and then happened to stumble across it in my game library. This is truly one of those hidden gem type games and I would definitely recommend it.

8 out of 10, would illuminate.

Closure
A very clever game where the intangible becomes tangible with help from a bit of light.

10/10.

Closure
Extremely original puzzle platform, a little creepy but very charming. They did an amazing job with music too (notice for example the water thing).

Closure
Closure is a 2D puzzle game that use elements of light and darkness to manipulate your environment and solve the puzzles of the various levels. The concept sounds good on paper, however the levels and gameplay become very repetitive and tedious that makes the game just not very fun. If you fail at anytime during a level you have to start all over which can make the game very frustrating and even more not fun. Looking at the overall Steam achievements only 3.5% of the game owners have even beat the game, and less than 10% have even beat the first section of the game which shows you how little amount of players have progressed through the game.

Closure
Closure is an excellent monochrome puzzle game in which you mostly deal with light and darkness.It's fresh and has quite challenging puzzles.You will feel a sense of accoplishment each time you manage to beat a puzzle and its truly enjoyable.You won't be frustrated if you get stuck in a puzzle as after finishing it you will realize that the solution was right there.Brilliant Game 4/5

Closure
Attrative and unique visuals, a delightfully atmospheric soundtrack and a wonderfully clever central game mechanic make the early levels of this game an intellectually stimulating creepy journey of discovery. Sadly as the game goes on the levels become tedious and obtuse with even minor errors forcing you to repeat entire level no matter how much progress you've made in them. If you see this on sale I would absolutely suggest buying it and experincing the core of what it has to offer, but for $10, as little as that is, there simply aren't enough decent levels to justify the asking price.

Closure
What isn't lit, doesn't exist. Everything is based around this concept, but somehow the levels don't feel repetitive at all. It's astonishing how many different puzzles are packed into this game. And I assure you that all of these puzzles, while not easy, can be solved if you learn how to think in terms of the game. No need to bang your head against the wall (and look for walkthroughs).
Add to that beautiful art and nice soundtrack. And we get a very, very good game. Do give it a try.
P.S. Some light sources don't exist until they're lit... and then they keep themselves in existence. Coooool.



Closure
Closure is a pretty clever black & white puzzle game. The game revolves around lightness and darkness--the world around you only exists when light shines upon it. So you can literally walk through walls and fall through platforms by removing the light shining upon them. Some of the levels are very simple but many of the later levels get quite tricky.

The initial learning curve required a lot of trial-and-error to struggle through. However, once I fully understood how to use the light correctly, the game became much easier making many of the later levels seem simple compared to the early ones. I think the game would have been improved by a rewind mechanic because if you fail, you have to start each level from scratch.

Overall, a very enjoyable puzzle game.

Closure
Usually I don't play platformer games.

But this one, turned out to be exceptionally good. It's a dark, surreal adventure that introduces rather interesting and involving light-darkness mechanics.

Only what you see in light exists. What is shadowed by darkness does not, and you will fall into it. This creates as you can well imagine, creative gameplay posibilities.
But in all honesty, the game for me is probably too hard to ever complete, yet it seems to be accesible for the first few levels and the atmosphere is amazing. You explore 3 distinct environments: A Factory, A Murky Forest and A Circus.

It has good music and each of the three characters that morth" into your spidery-like creature have a story of their own

Closure
Closure is a solid puzzle-platformer, hampered only slightly by its limited scope but aided by gorgeously stark visuals and moody score.

You play as a weird little spider thing that puts on masks of people's faces and traverses their memories (I assume, as there's no spoken dialogue). Platforms are only solid when a light source is illuminating them, and you manipulate a variety of these to create or remove terrain so you can reach the exit door in each stage. The mechanic is consistent, buta llittle finnicky -- terrain partially lit by orbs tends to create sloped edges or free-floating pixels of floor, which combined with slippery controls will kill you a few times. The most frustrating moments come from falling through a floor or wall after painstakingly setting up platforms in a 1-2 minute stage, because you weren't quite precise enough. But engine quirks come with the territory in indie platformers, so it's easily overlooked.

What makes Closure really work is the way the level chains are paced. It has over 100 levels, but cerebral puzzle-solving is broken up by stages that serve only to (literally) illuminate the backstory of the characters whose lives you're navigating. You only realize this as you're moving through it, and realize there's no puzzle beyond carrying the light to the exit and seeing the environment unfold ahead of you. It's a neat trick that made me want to keep playing in a way that an unbroken string of puzzles wouldn't have.

The game has some rough edges, but it's a very enjoyable playthrough if you like puzzle-platformers. Definitely recommend.

Closure
Closure has a lot in common with Limbo, and by a lot, I mean more than the eyes can see. It's not just the innovation, the black-and-white visuals, the puzzles or the uber-simplistic UI. It's that unique feeling that you get to play and experience something special, different, that makes a game not only a form of entertainment, but a form of art.

Anyway, I still like Limbo more, as Limbo felt somehow more alive, more artistic, more personal, and more lyrical (the spiders, the story of the little boy searching for his sister, those evil killer kids, etc.), while Closure is rather liniar (all you got to do is use the light and get to door, in every level). Maybe Limbo can be defined by a mere layman as nothing but an artistically-looking puzzle-platformer, but Closure's original concept of using the light to solve the puzzle is the only thing that remained for me to like after playing a couple (12) levels of this game.

Closure might be unique and innovative, but it's too damn difficult for my short life to waste any time with it. I mean, I couldn't still pass level 2:12 not even after seeing on YouTube how it's done. If I just gave up on my pride and searched for the solution on YouTube, and I still haven't passed that level, then ok, I'm an idiot, but I'm also leaving this game once and forever.

Closure
Such a bizarre AND well thought puzzle game! If you enjoy solving puzzles this is the right game for you. With a dark atmosphere (actually the game is all based on light and darkness) you get to control weird characters through a series of chambers". I love the concept

Closure
An excellent puzzle platformer with an extremely unusual central mechanic. Balanced far more towards thoughtful planning than refelxes or pixel-perfect jumping, it will confuse at first, then challenge (but usually stay just the right side of frustration) and eventually have you thinking in its strange language. Imaginitive, orignal, sometimes ingenious puzzles in a brillianlty drawn dark world which rewards the urge to explore & discover - this is a unique, weird delight among the thousands of seemingly similar games on Steam. I hope more people find it.


Closure
I freakin' love this game! It's one of the most interesting and beautiful puzzles I've ever played.

Closure
2-D puzzle game with unique light-shadow experience. Too bad it was so short. But still the game was very fun to play and some puzzles were hard to complete.

Closure
What if there is only what you can see? What if nothing exist in the dark and existence is only in the light? Cannot go through the wall? You can if you don't see it. ;) It's a brilliant concept and if you like puzzle games and unique ideas you will love this game. And wait till you hear the music and see all the art behind. Go for it, buy it, enjoy it.

Closure
THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND I'M NOT BIASED AT ALL

Closure
Love the simple & clever gameplay and the weird art style. Great puzzle game to sink time into.

Closure
This is one of the most unique and atmospheric games I have ever played. If you're on the fence about buying this, I urge you. Do it. You will not regret it.

Closure
It's LIMBO plus an acid trip, except unlike LIMBO the puzzles are actually very good and challenging.

The platforming and physics can be inconsistant at best, with bits of the geometry rematerializing as it's illuminated and pushing other stuff out of the way, but those rare moments aside, it's very well thought out and put together.

On a more personal note, I find the atmosphere/artstyle/whatever to be a bit annoying. The entire game is dressed up in that Tim Burton-y style where it tries to be creepy through being weird, or tries to be weird through being creepy, or whatever, but just manages to be irritating. The lowest point for me is any time you have to be underwater, and the normally passable music slows down by 50% and becomes a nuisance. This is probably a personal hangup that won't affect anyone else too much; I've never been a fan of things like Nightmare Before Christmas, either.

All in all, good puzzle game.

Closure
Really interesting game, great concept that I hadn't seen before. Essentially anywhere that is lit up exists, and anything that isn't lit up, does not. Can be tricky to get your head around the concept, considering at times you know there is a platform there, you just can't see it. If you do however go to make that jump, you will fall to your death.

The graphics are quite well done, sticking to the black and white theme throughout the game does not make it seem bland in any sense; rather the play of the lights is the main graphical focus.

The soundtrack was really good, quite symphonic in some areas which really worked for the mood of the game.

Not too sure what the story was about, not even too sure that there was one. At the same time the format of the game does not suggest that there really needs to be one.

The only two downsides would be the length of the game, taking roughly 7 hours to 100% (some maps will have you stuck for a while, where others you will complete within a minute). The other issue is something that really goes with the genre, and that is the extremely touchy physics. If something is not quite right with the positioning, it can mean restarting the whole level. There also seems to be some inconsistency with the falling of objects, in regards to whether they will bounce badly or simply land flat...

Overall, I would give 8/10.

Closure
Nice puzzle game.
It has quite interesting visuals, fine puzzles, bit strange controls and very interesting game mechanics.

Creepy \.^_^./
9-9.5/10.

Closure
Closure is a puzzle-platformer (emphasis on the puzzle side), based on a brilliant idea: only what is lit exists, the rest is not solid and the player or objects fall through the endless void. This could have gotten old after a few levels, but the game design keeps using new ideas to make use of the system and refreshing the experience. The level design is very good and well thought, making good use of the ideas. The game is cut in smaller levels, so getting lost on an adventure map is not an issue. Although going from one level to another (that is not the one right after) can require to go through a bit too many loading screens.

The art and music are pretty nice too, giving soul to the levels.
There is not much of a story, very minimal story-telling, but it is not really an issue, the gameplay and atmosphere take priority.

Closure
It has a magnificent mechanic centered around light and darkness, however it can't build an enjoyable game around that. It lacks a motivation to press forward like a story or something like that, it's basicaly just a series of challenges which is a bit disapointing. But deserves some praise for the fantastic and inovative mechanic.

3/5

Closure
The game itself is good; the main mechanic creative and well utilized, the puzzles are difficult but fair, the levels are varied and well-designed, and the art is beautiful.
However, I can't recommend it in it's current state. The game has a major graphical glitch. If you have the wrong graphics card parts of the screen will be darker which renders some of the puzzles unsolvable. For example, at the begininng of a level the portion of the floor the character starts off on is missing causing you to fall into the abyss in an endless loop. Or a platform is missing but you don't know that so you wind up spending an unnessecarily long  time trying to solve a puzzle that you didn't realize was glitched. You could go back and tweak the code but that renders the other puzzles unsolvable. Basically you have to back and forth between the code and the game every few levels. It really sucks the fun out of the game because you're never sure if you're failing a level because you did something wrong or because the game is glitched. If you want to play this game I recommend the free flash game instead. It's smaller, shorter, and harder than the Steam verison but at least you'll be able to finish it.
Edit: I recently picked up Closure again and it works perfectly fine now. I haven't found a news about the game developers patching this bug on the Steam page. (If there is let me know and I'll edit this review). So I don't know if a computer update fixed the problem or the developers patched it or what.
Now that I've finshed the game I stand by what I said last year. The only new thing I have to add is the puzzles toward the end of each level are frustrating. Not because they're particularly hard but because some puzzles require an annoying level of prescison. I got stuck on puzzles I knew how to solve but I had to do them over and over again because I didn't put a spotlight in the exact position. Or because an object I needed bounced into the abyss becuase the platform it was suppose to land on was slightly too small.
That aside it's a fun game and it's worth playing. However, I'm keeping this rating until I get confirmation the glitch was formally fixed. At this point I'm not sure if the game actually works now or if I just got lucky.

Closure
I admire original idea, visual style, sometimes catchy music and of course great puzzles. I recommend this piece for everyone, who likes to solve logic puzzles. I appreciate also achievements, which are not insane and don't force players to uselessly reapeat the game.

Closure
A clever, dark and atmospheric puzzle game that will enlighten you with its unique concept, but will eventually leave you in the dark with its rather anti-climatic finale. However, the solid game design and the smart riddles make this title a little gem worth playing.

Closure
Nothing you can't see actually exists; this is the concept behind Closure" and the change in thinking required is very similar to how "thinking with portals" is different than other puzzle experiences.  Simple design

Closure
This is one of those games  that you can play for 20 minutes when you have just a little bit of time. It's dark, moody and somehow relaxing to play a few levels before moving on to other things.

As for the game itself, it's a different spin on a platform puzzler. In itself not so special, but it does make the puzzles quite different from what I'm used to. And that's never a bad thing.

Highly recommened if you're looking for something doesn't require ages to learn or many hours at a time.

Closure
Closure  um game de Puzzle, Dark 2D bem legal.
Gostei da sonora, ambiente e os desenhos.
O que achei mais legal  voc ter que manipular a luz dentro do cenrio para andar, explorar e resolver os puzzles.
Comprei no Winter Sale por 1,99 e valeu super a pena, recomendo =)

Closure
I've installed it for cards and started playing. After a few minutes, I forgot about anything else than how to solve THAT little annoying piece of ... puzzle. And so on and so on - level after level, hour after hour.

Closure is worth its price. It steals whole evening and makes you go to sleep later that you planned.

Closure
Another quality indie platformer with a unique gimmick.

Trust your initial reaction to this review's headline. I expect you'll either be excited for another fairly well made entry into one of your favorite genres or you'll bemoan that the indie scene is oversaturated with these types of games. I find myself starting to lean toward the latter.

Generally Closure's puzzles are cleverly designed with an adequate amount of variation. There are some that were too easy as well as some that, for me, crossed into frustration territory. These aggravating stages were always the longer stages where if you made even one mistake you'd have to start over and redo numerous steps that quickly become tedious. Where the game faltered most for me is that I'd estimate a third of my a little over 7 hours playing the game was spent on these infuriating levels.

Adding to the challenge are 30 collectable moths hidden throughout the game that you'll need to gather all of to get any kind of ending. I got 17 of them during my playthrough then elected to watch the ending on Youtube rather than go back for the remaining 13. I'd suggest skipping the moths unless you are really enjoying the game.

Taking a look at global Steam achievements suggests that the game isn't as widely appealing as its positive reviews would make you believe. Currently, 48.2% of game owners have completed the tutorial stages. Only 8.4% have completed the first 24 levels called the Factory." In other words

Swipecart
This game. Oh boy this game. Just don't even bother. Simple as that. Here is why...
It is broken. The mouse controls are just down right broken. I could only continue playing this because I have an xbox controller to plug in. Even then this game is barely playable. The physics...who programed these physics, they make no sense. Was no effort put into making this? When you roll down a hill, hit another hill GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, you somehow gain speed and keep going up. This can be level breaking in some levels in which you have to stop or you will fall off.
The first chapter has 30 levels and the second chapter has 9. Did they forget how to count? Why the sudden change? I am still trying to finish the game 100% and so I do not know how many levels are in the final third Event" but at this rate it should be around 3. It seems that as the game development progressed the just completely gave up. Speaking of giving up on design

Terrible PC port of a smartphone game. Glad I got it for free.

Swipecart
Good (I guess) for a smartphone, bad for a PC. Everything is HUGE on your screen, as a result of not giving it a minute of work on redesigning it for a PC screen.

I got it for free, but if you didn't, please don't buy it.

Swipecart
Did the first 5 tracks and got 1-0% top scores on all of them so the controls seem to be alright... yeah they are finnicky and imprecise in some ways but they work for me fine at least. Got the game for free so I'm satisfied so far. Give it a go if you can get it cheap or for nothing.

EDIT: This game is insane... in both a good and bad way. It's a love or hate it kind of thing and I got to agree with some of the reviews that this type of gameplay is better suited for a touch enabled mobile device but still, for cheap, it can hit that gaming itch on the pc as well.

I for one am glad it's on steam.

Swipecart
Please note the name of this game is 'swipe' cart and not 'works with a mouse' cart.

Swipecart
Don't mind me
I'll just take my cards and go

Swipecart
First - Ignore the Shouldn't be on steam" hate

Swipecart
So in general this game is a solid concept. However, there are a few issues with this game.

1. There are levels that are very difficult to beat, with a mouse.
2. The game is a swipe game that uses the mouse as a controller input.
3. As a result of 2, we end up with the problems associated with 1, leading to a very difficult game as it is difficult to accurately control the speed of the cart.

Devs, take note this is NOT how you port a game from a touch screen to the PC platform.

Swipecart
Thank God for Steam Trading CardsThis game has thankfully allowed me to make a profit through the steam trading cards. Other than that, there is no other redeemable quality to this game. Everything is total trash from the controls through the graphics. The game just isn't interesting at all so i suggest that you just idle this game until you get the cards and GFTO.

Swipecart
The games pretty original and fun, and exactly what most people look for in a mobile game. But, its not particularly well optimized for PC, nor does the gameplay translate well. For those looking for a good mobile game, Swipecarts a great game. But PC players may want to be a little wary.

Swipecart
You know how when you buy a bad game and overrall you are disappointed, but there is still atleast one redeemable quality about the game? Yeah well, this game doesn't have any.


Pros+Trading Cards Just take them and go.

Cons-Mouse controls are awkward As suggested by the title of the game, you have to swipe in this game... With a mouse. Sounds like an alright idea for a mobile game.... I'm not going to go any further about the controls are terrible.
-Graphics Trust me, pixelated graphics can be done well, but this is just plain disgusting. The character's little pixelated head is rage-inducing and the background looks like someone had sharted and pixelated their excreted substance.
-It's just not fun. It just plainly isn't. After 1.1 hrs of searching for some form of entertainment I could not find anything.

Overrall:A cancerous game that is not worth your time. I got it for free but I still have strong opinions that this game is as bad as a diseased fish. Not diseased in a metaphorical way but diseased as in, this game actually went and swum into an underwater druggie hangout and took one of the needles and injected it into himself, giving him hepatitus C (or hepatitus Sea for that matter). C is also a better rating than what I will give this game because it is most certainly elementary.

2/10

Swipecart
Game crashes on startup and forums/developer won't help. (forums are dead)

Swipecart
SWIPECART
Want to kill your mouse? If so this is the game for you.
The game has a poor control mechanism in which you have to keep on click the damn mouse throught out the game.
The game is actually like an sentimental movie indeed it doesn't make us cry but make us angry.
Ain't going to suggest this game at all very well i didn't loose a single penny just because i grabed the game for free.

What it was worth for?

Trading cards ofc ._.

Bought a new mouse after playing this game.
R.I.P Mouse

Thanks.

Swipecart
This just barely gets a recommendation -- and only if you have a controller to play it with. The game is in my opinion unplayable with mouse controls. If you do not have a controller - skip it.

Swipecart is not an action game - it is a physics puzzle game. You control a minecart which you give speed at the start, then strategically slow down on the actual tracks in order to not fall to your death.
Each level can be played either for maximum speed, or getting all gems, and these two are tracked separately.

Play this windowed as it does not look good in fullscreen on a large monitor. But if you can get past these problems, you're left with a decent game to waste a few idle minutes with, and the presence of online leaderboards keeps you primed to try and do better.

Swipecart
Swipecart a game that came from phones, that should have stayed on phones, because most people don't have a touchscreen (TS for short) option on their monitors.

Graphics - Mediocre, not pleasent on the eyes if you are playing for a long period of time. 2/10

Music - The only good part about this game, especialy if you have a bass system. Still not worth getting the game only for its music. 4/10

Cinematics and Story - None

Content - A few levels and a level editor, yay (still not worth it) 3/10

Controls - Only if you have a TS monitor, and yes I know the game can be beaten without a TS monitor, but be my guest, It is really hard the normal way, bonus note I am a bad player (take whatever you want from that). 0/10

Gameplay - Stiff and downright bad. 2/10

Do yourself good and don't even think about getting this game, it is not worth it, Be right back, going to check it out on the phone.....yea don't buy it even there, just forget this game even existed.

Final Score: 2.2/10

Swipecart
i got this game for free but I still thinks I paid to much for it

Swipecart
Basically what you do in this game is you move the mouse cursor back and forth to gain momentum before you cross the start line. As soon as you cross the start line you can no longer increase your speed, you can only break. The objective is to come to a full stop at the finish line.
This game was made for smartphone and then ported to PC, so graphics quality is bad. Perhaps this game is fun on a smartphone, I wouldn't know. What I do know is that it's no fun at all on PC. It's boring.

Swipecart
I would if I could...totally recommend this game, however it can give me serious rages on some maps. The main reason for this review is to establish that anyone who has a short temper should NOT play this game unless they don't play it on a PC.

It has really awful control of the breaks and wheelies...it makes some maps impossible to get with gold medal and perfect gems even though you played it right (unless you do it like 30-50 times until you get it perfect).
So...as a conclusion, when they'll update the controls (which after all...are one of the bases for a game), I would totally recommend the game for thrill seekers and stubborn people who like challenges.

Swipecart
I have tried my hardest to like this game. Its good in concept, but the controls are astronomically bad. It would not be good on any platform. The controls sometimes stick, and im pretty sure its not my mouse, cause it works at other times.

Swipecart
I can see people enjoying themselves with it, but it's just not doing it for me.
Concept is decent all the rest is just mediocre, just a simple little flash game.
Wouldn't recommend it unless you can get it for free.

Swipecart
More like a nonsense puzzle game.

Swipecart
Bad port with weird controls.

Swipecart
i got this game for free and decided to play , sadly , it wasn't a very  good game , it uses the mouse only as a controlling mechanic , it was ok , but i think this game should be developped for mobile devices not  for pc

2/10

Swipecart
Swipecart is not optimized for PC, and that's a bad thing. It can be entertaining at times, but it's not a game I'd recommend to the average PC gamer.

Swipecart
Smartphone game...

better than Bar Rats/10

Feels good to be the alpha.

Swipecart
Love the music at the begining of the game lol :)

Swipecart
Swipe and hope your cart reaches and stops at the exit.

That's it. That's the whole game.

Also, the controls are really weird and the game is obviously a port, as swiping can be really awkward at times with a mouse.

Swipecart
Wandering around my library I spotted this gem, it was installed.
I brothered checking it and my eyes spilled blood
Now there's blood everywhere, and my family thinks I'm a girl


Anyway, to the review:

Swipecart is a port of a really bad android game. If the game was bad on android can it get worse on steam? Oh hell yeah.

Well first the port is a bit obvious by just looking at the name swipecart"

Swipecart
I would play this game on smartphone/tablet but definitively not on PC.

- I took time to figure out how i can control" my cart and to understand the menu (RIP my mouse).
+ The tracks

Swipecart


Swipecart
This game should be on a Flash games website, not STEAM!

Swipecart
Has a deacent idea but is missing things like good physics.

Swipecart
This is a game where you have to manage your momentum in order to beat the levels.
The biggest problem that I have with the game is the menus they are so clunky and it shows in many aspects that it is a mobile port.
So overall this isnt a good port because it doesnt feel like they have put effort in doing it.

Swipecart
Should Have just been a flash game on a browser.

Swipecart
Precision skill based minecart game that lacks good UI/UX.

Swipecart
A bad port. It made the attempt, but it failed. Just get the mobile version.

Swipecart
I don't care about the graphics but for some reason i really hate the controls

Swipecart
Very bad IFONE game, control are awful, the 1st levels are easy after that, it's start getting very difficult which will lead to frustrating, glad I got it for free and not in my smartphone, if so i will smash it

 final judgement : 30/100 

Swipecart
Just no.

Swipecart
Just no.

Swipecart
This game was obviously a terrible attempt at making a quick buck
-It's a port of a mobile game, never a good sign
-Very simple options:turn audio off and resolution(only in windows mode)
-30FPS cap
-Constat lag spikes
-Broken mouse controls
-Highly unintuitive menu design that took me a while to figure out
-Terrible physics
-Gets repetitive fast
-For some reason all 'k's are capitalized
-The text format often breaks
-Servers are never online
-The music is all blatantly stolen songs that are just made 8-bit"

0/10 would buy bad rats instead"

Swipecart
I got this free, so I am thankful for the free cards. The game has an interesting concept, but is a very bad PC port. Might be fun as a phone game.

Swipecart
Giving this game away for free didn't do the game any favors as it allowed even more people to see what a mess this is. It's just a crappy iphone game that somehow became a badly made port of a crappy iphone game. 1/10 will no play anymore.

Swipecart
The Game is a great timekiller at least for a little bit. Probably not worth $5 but it is not a bad game. Give it a shot if its on sale.

Swipecart
hehehe funny retro game

Swipecart
In general I really enjoyed this game, it is very simple, yet fun and addicting. I encourage people to buy this game since it is only $5 and since it's like no other game on the store. For more details check out my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pmO6Ozr47U. I hope you give this game a chance, especially if it's on a sale!

Swipecart
Really needs a UI fix. Its pretty messy. Maybe an option to rezise it to be smaller. Otherwise a pretty need cheap game.

Swipecart
un poco entretenido, me gusto 6/10

just one word: classic!

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

First of all, this game is inspired by Titan Quest. However, it is NOT Titan Quest, don't be fooled with the title. I will compare it with TQ time to time but basically just to show differences than similarities.

Is it good or bad? Neither. It is just another game. It inherits many features from TQ - the same engine (that's what makes some people to think the game is just a masked TQ), dual mastery system, basic skills ideas, itemization principles, inventory management and others. However, gameplay and overall feeling is not the same. I wonder why some people look at Grim Dawn as at skinned TQ because it feels very different in terms of pace, combat, quests, athmosphere. It is... err... faster. It's the best description I can imagine. Everything happens quite fast in the game. You start to feel your character powerful relatively fast - pretty since the first level. Many things support this feeling - from the actual raw power to hits animation which makes you feel impact on most of your hits. It could get boring soon if you would not unlock new skills with levels so you still will have something new to play with :)

Basically, it's the game about doomed and dying world where mankind was pretty much eradicated by two powerful magical races. You're one of few remnants survived the just happened Apocalypse and trying to establish themselves in the changed world. So there are lot of remaining ruines and lore in the world. I actually like the way Crate has placed world information and story in the game - it does not come in forms of long quest dialogs but as pieces of paper here and where which you can read if you are interested or skip if you are not interested in learning the story and want just to kill things. I tried both and must say the story is very well-written which is rare case for ARPG genre. Just try to read that diary of the dead child... The world is also well-detailed with many small pieces adding the feeling of doom pretty everywhere. Overall graphics is probably not that detailed and eye-catching as it was in TQ but I guess TQ had it somewhat excessive while GD looks just fine for the fast-paced game where you won't pay too much attention to details most of the time anyway. It is still look fine when you stop for a while and zoom in to see details like a doll on the stairs. So the graphics is just fine on my taste. It looks much better with AntiAliasing and AnyzotropicFiltering turned on though ;) Overall story and graphics is much more mature than TQ with some of dark humor and some serious emotions it causes but much less pathetics. Bad guys actions are basically better reasoned and logical based (if you bother to read the story pieces).

Quests. They are various enough to not get bored. You will meet those kill X monsters" and "collect Y pieces" things along with exterminating big bad guys

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Grim Dawn is one of the most richly detailed and beutifully sculpted unfinished game I've ever played! It's definitely one to keep your eye on.

I'm a massive Action RPG player/addict with 1000s of hours in Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, Van Helsing & countless others. Hell, I've even made a career out of making YouTube videos for them. Grim Dawn was little more than a curiosity to me when I first checked it out in the Alpha. But since then I have repeatedly come back to it whenever a new build is released and each time I play it I fall a little more in love with it!

Development progress has been slow, I wouldn't expect a launch this year, but the quality of updates has been phenomenal. The devs at Crate have their finger of the pulse of the community and have a very clear vision for the game they want to make - it's the game they want to play. I recently spoke to Mediera one of the developers and he said that he barely even played Titan Quest when he was developing it - but while developing Grim Dawn he can barely tear himself away from it, with 100s of hours spent 'playtesting'.

This game is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, with some of the developers that originally worked on the game now making up the indie dev team at Crate Entertainment. The game is built on a heavily modified version of the same engine Titan Quest was built on. You'll notice the similarities between the games if you're a fan. But this game is not Titan Quest reskinned - it's a much better game in my opinion. It's taken some of the best features and mechanics from that game, put them into an immersive post-apocalyptic world and expanded themin interesting ways.

Grim Dawn is the type of game early access should embrace - supporting great and communicativbe developers make games the fans want to play. Keep this one on your radar!

If you want to see more of the game and my thoughts on it you can find me on YouTube & Twitch as 'ZiggyD'.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

In-Depth Review
Prepare for a long read!


First off the Story:
Grim Dawn is full of interesting dialogue and well written textbooks that truly immerse you into the game. Furthermore there is a multitude of sidequest that often allow you to make meaningful decisions and sometimes even determine the fate of a whole village.

Unfortunately these stories are hard to follow for someone who doesn't read through all the text. As much as I know the devs plan to voice the main story towards release.


Atmosphere:
The graphics present you with a harsh and sinister environment which is further emphasized by the great music and sounds. The handcrafted maps are quite large and feature hidden passages from time to time. It also feels great when you encounter hostile factions attacking each other and follow the transformation of Devil's Crossing from a small survivors-enclave to a small town as you progress through the story.

Only downpoint for me was the repetitiveness of some maps, especially the 3 swamps in act 1 and arkovia/broken hills in act 2. I was told that the devs are planning to rework some of these areas though in terms of visuals.


Gameplay:
Gritty, fun combat, just as you would expect from an ARPG. The constitution system makes sure that you don't just wait to regenerate and the scarcity of potions underlines the fact that you are survivor of a perished world. Unlike Diablo 3 leveling feels rewarding and presents you with relevant decisions that influence your progression later in the game. The dual-mastery system of Titan Quest opens up a ton of possibilities and will further improve the more classes are available. The locational damage will probably not suprise TQ-veterans, but for ARPGs in general it's a really noteworthy feature that adds further depth to the game. (On a site note: There is an existing faction system that will be dramatically improved in the upcoming build)

Since build 20 there is a well-working multiplayer, unfortunately the damage monster deal is also scaled if you play together. Resistances don't show much effect if they are not pushed quite high and casts and even aoe skills can miss enemies. Coming from WoW I was never very fond of a accuracy" stat as it pretty much forces players to cap it.


Itemization:
The game features a multitude of stats to choose from: many types of retaliation

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

You know that itch that Diablo 3 couldn't scratch?

That.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Pros:  Rough around the edges, but still an excellent value.    If you loved Diablo, Torchlight, & Titan Quest then this is the game for you.    Combat is solid, the story is well presented, monster design is top notch.   Spiffy animations.   Art direction takes a few cues from Fallout 3 & Borderlands.    A few shout outs to H.P. Lovecraft.    No crashes for me & almost no bugs.    Very stable game!

Cons:  has pretentions to being a 'Ye Olde Skool' hard core ARPG game.    Thus the game lacks modern rpg conviences like quest markers.     Expect to wander lost for stretches at a time.    Game balance is nightmare.   Playing a caster is easy mode.    Loot drops are a bit sketchy, but it is getting better.    Crate employees are swell & willing to listen to feedback.   Crate fans on the other hand...     Well, let's just say they are a bit defensive.    Saying that there are flaws with Grim Dawn is tantamount to calling their baby ugly.    The Crate Forums are going to be very interesting when the final product ships...

In conclusion: post apocalyptic, low fantasy that doesn't pull any punches.    Some of the game design choices are real headscratchers, but they're being ironed out.     Crate entertainment is a pretty decent indie outfit  & deserve support.   It's a work in progress that takes you on fun, brutal journey.    8 out of 10, Above average.   B+   Four Stars out of Five.

Grim Dawn
Disclosure: Review Written at Level 25

Do you miss Diablo 2? Do you miss skill synergy that matters? Do you miss abilities not being worthless, and having options?

Grim Dawn opens up an interesting school of thought: You begin as nobody, and at level 1 you're given your official class: Are you the melee tank guy? Explosive experiment guy? Arcane knowledge guy? The angry zoo manager? Pick your class and begin to carve your way. But don't lose sight of What Might Have Been.

At level 10, you are able to pick up a second class. No penalities. You become a Something / Something. Want to play a Tank / Mage? Done. Want to play a Caster / Pet class? Done. Pick your flavors, combine then, and destroy everything. Right now, I'm a Soldier/Demolitionist that is made out of tank and explosion, and when things come near me they go on fire, and if they hit me they go on fire EVEN HARDER.

You will get your fill.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Let's get my opinion across to you as a reader as soon and as clear as possible.

I genuinely love this game.

For an early access game, it feels very polished and content rich. But then, it has been in early access for some time now.

If you like Diablo, you will definitely like this game. Because it offers the same hack&slash loot fest gameplay as that game, but without the frustrating bull****, such as the permanent character damage of Diablo 1 and the excessively restrictive builds (And rare respec) of Diablo 2.

The game offers at present 5 different classes, of which you can combine any 2 of them to create hybrid classes. There is the Soldier (Typical warrior), the Nightblade (Rogue with a melee focus), the Demolitionist (Archer type, but with versatile crowd control options and traps), the Occultist (Debilitation and pets) and the Arcanist (Spellcaster). There are skills in each class that well complement those of another, but a pure class build is just as viable.

There are no skills that are purely support, since the developers have made a conscious decision to make singleplayer just as playable as multiplayer. Instead, most classes offer some form of skill that applies a bonus or ability to you, as well as an equal one to other players and pets, allowing increased power and versatility in multiplayer without compromising the viability of the skill in singleplayer.

It's a lot less restrictive than most similar games in how each class can be built and still be viable, but it is worth putting some advance thought into your build. Skill points can be refunded if spent on skills, but not if spent on class mastery (Which increase your stats linearly and unlock further skills).

Content wise, the game currently contains 2 full chapters of reasonable length and 2 out of 3 parts of the 3rd chapter. A total of 4 chapters are known to be planned for the full release. There is a lot of various equipment to find with interesting items offering unique skills to complement the arsenal of your chosen class. There is also a lot of varied enemies to use your weapons and abilities on, with especially dangerous (mostly) randomly spawned unique Heroes to contest with, each with their own special skills and abilities.

Four difficulties are planned, each which will be unlocked for a character as the previous is completed. At present there is only two difficulties available, Normal and the optional Veteran. These two difficulties can be alternated between at any time from the main menu and share the same campaign progression. Completing the game on either will unlock the next one, once it's added.

I strongly recommend playing on Veteran difficulty in singleplayer, as Normal mode is a tad too easy. In multiplayer, the game scales the difficulty based on the amount of players, making Normal mode offer a decent challenge and making Veteran very challenging.

Enemies do scale to your level, but as I understand the scaling will be lesser in the full release and is only set as high as it is now to offer a continuous challenge for higher level players.  Right now, the maximum level is 40, which is still plenty enough to allow the construction of very interesting character builds that do end up feeling extremely powerful in spite of the scaling enemies.

Story wise, the game features an original world by the name of Cairn, with has an Victorian-esque aesthetic and technological level. It offers you the usual swords and shields but also black powder guns, bombs and magic. In this world mankind is at the brink of extinction with the event dubbed the Grim Dawn" as it's cause

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

By far my favorite ARPG I've played since Diablo 2. I've had a craving for years for something fresh that borrowed as much as possible from Diablo 2 and implemented it well and Grim Dawn hits an absolute home run in that department. I enjoyed Diablo 3 and sunk a ton of hours into it, but man does Grim Dawn feel like what Diablo 3 should have been. It's that good. It's like everything Titan Quest and Diablo 2 did well had a baby and this is our result.

I've been a supporter since 2012 and playing on and off since well before the game ever hit Steam Early Access and man... it's incredible how far this game has come.

If you're a Diablo fan of any sort and wasted away who knows how many hours of your youth on Diablo 1 and 2, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. Even at the full price of $25 it's an absolute steal.

10/10

Grim Dawn
There's a reason that Grim Dawn has 94+% positive reviews on Steam: it's a great action RPG.

I'll start by talking about Grim Dawn's character building system. The class system involves mixing two classes together (you unlock a second class at level 10), which is pretty unique to the genre. Titan Quest had this system and now the same developers have incorporated it into Grim Dawn. This adds an additional layer of depth to the character building process.

Let's say you're looking to build a poison focused Nightblade. You can pair your Nightblade up with the Occultist class for even more poison capability (Nightblade combined with an Occultist makes a Witch Hunter"). If you want your Soldier to have some of the abilities/theme of a magic user

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

this is probably the best ARPG i've ever played.
- coherent and in-depth lore
- very unique dual class system that allows for tons of customization and all the replayability you could ever want
- beautiful and well-optimized (still looks great on lowest settings and can run decently even on a toaster). the art direction is better than Torchlight/Diablo 3, kind of reminds me of the first Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2. plus, a rotatable camera allows for every detail of the environment to be admired
- quests are interesting and fit perfectly with the game world (no collect 20 monster hides" for no reason)
- loot is abundant

Grim Dawn
I never imagined to throw faeces at enemies as a method of obliteration

Full game review
It is almost a miracle. After about 6 years of development, Crate Entertainment's Grim Dawn has finally been released. A game that had been in early access on Steam for so long due to the developers experiencing some personal difficulties. Not only that, they also greatly expanded on the game's original content due to fantastic support by fans along the way. The result is a superb aRPG that is currently among the very best. Having owned and closely followed the game for about 2 years, looking at the (finally) complete game is a pure joy. Hold on tight aRPG lovers, because you're in for a most wonderful ride with this one.

<<<Story>>>

Enter Cairn, a dark and mysterious world that was once a great empire, but now on the brink of extinction. At fault are the overly curious arcanists who brought Aetherials into their world. These spiritual beings seek to use humans as hosts and consequently turn them into powerful, yet abhorrent creatures. If that wasn't already enough, survivors also have to battle the Chthonians: they have the malicious intent of offering as much blood as they can to their almighty god. You, the player, awaken at the worst time possible: a grim dawn. For a little while, you yourself were possessed by an aetherial and thus have no memory of your former life. This possession almost cost you your life. However, those aetherial remains dwelling inside your body seem to grant you odd, yet useful powers ...

<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>

Grim Dawn is an aRPG like there are quite a few others in the genre: Torchlight, Diablo, Van Helsing, Path of Exile, Victor Vran, Titan Quest ... While each game differs and has its uniqueness, they all have the same core gameplay: run around, kill monsters, find loot. And all of that in an isometric perspective. Even though a bit repetitive in gameplay (which is no problem if you're a fan of the genre), they have great replay value, mostly due to their theorycrafting: how to create and finetune the 'perfect' build(s). In trying to do so comes a lot of experimentation and farming, which can take quite long.

Unlike certain other aRPG's, Grim Dawn does not force you into a specific class. Mages don't necessarily have to wield wands and warriors don't have to wear heavy armour and shields. Every character has access to all gear. However, you are required to invest in specific attributes in order to wear different equipment. Another feature that is quite welcome, which was present in Titan Quest also, is how the game lets you combine any of the 6 available masteries to create your personalized class (= 2 masteries combined). A first mastery can be chosen at level 2 and the second at level 10. There are so many skills that one can choose to build around, that even within the same mastery, there is a lot of room for variety. This allows for an insane amount of experimentation and theorycrafting, which is sometimes even more fun that actually playing the game!

One day, Crate decided that character customization wasn't deep enough already, so they released the devotion system. What is this system exactly? It is basically another (yet smaller) layer of customization where players have a total of 50 points to invest in certain passives (e.g. +10% piercing dmg, +20% elemental resistances etc) or actives that enhance your main skills. Those actives can be bound to certain skills and will proc under various circumstances (e.g. 100% to occur when critically hitting). Devotion points can be acquired by restoring old shrines that are spread throughout the whole world and between the 3 difficulties (normal -> elite -> ultimate).

Seeing the amount of customization, being able to (partially) respec is a relief. Reallocating is done by visiting the spirit guide in one of the major cities and can be done at any given time, granted you have the currency for it. It starts out pretty cheap, but can get extremely expensive for those who experiment endlessly. Both skill and devotion points can be reallocated; mastery and attribute points can not. This allows for decent experimentation, but also reminds you to choose carefully when needed.

Cairn is a place full of mystery and secrets and is not afraid to reward players who feel like exploring everything. Exploration is rewarded by various things: one-time chests containing extra rare loot, hidden devotion shrines and notes. More loot is always good to have (this is an aRPG after all), devotion shrines keep your character's customization up to date and lore notes inform you of the story - which was better than expected - of Cairn.

Besides the deep character customization and satisfying exploration, Grim Dawn offers other features that may interest you. The first thing that comes to mind is the 'fast travel' system. Your character can use rift portals anywhere, anytime (except in certain challenging rogue-like dungeons), which sets the game at a good pace. Don't worry about picking everything up, as you can sell it right away by teleporting back and forth. Another feature that is a nice 'extra' is the faction system: by killing certain enemies and completing certain quests, you gain reputation. This reputation allows you to buy certain goods and complete certain objectives. A last feature that is definitely more than welcome is the ability to play with up to 3 other people. There are no dedicated servers though, since the game is more single player focused. But the fact that it is there, is what counts.

<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>

Like many other aRPG's, actions are mostly executed via the mouse: killing enemies, opening doors, speaking to npc's ... everything's done with the mouse, with the exception of using your skills. They are activated by pressing the corresponding keys. All keys are rebindable if desired.

Graphically, the game seemed a little outdated in certain places, however, it is not too bothersome. Aesthetically on the other hand, the game is very well made and really brings that atmosphere of eeriness and desperation to life. Most animations are ok.

The soundtrack was enjoyable to listen to for the first x amount of hours and certainly added to the atmosphere. However, certain tracks get replayed over and over again in way too many areas. A little bit more variation certainly wouldn't harm the game. Tracks that are most excellent are the boss tracks. They sound exciting and make the fights more epic.

<<<The verdict>>>

Grim Dawn is one of the finest aRPG's I have played in the last couple of years - if not my favourite of all time. Victor Vran seems a little too simplistic, whereas Path of Exile can be overly complex. This game brings the best of two worlds together: being indepth enough without being overly complex. Therefore it is recommended to all aRPG lovers for 100%, but even regular rpg/hack & slash fans might enjoy this one, if just for 1 playthrough.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Since i have played Grim Dawn, Titan Quest and Diablo 3 a LOT, here's what i think about this game:

Pros:
- Skill system is similar to Titan Quest and very complex, allowing you to customize your character alot. There are obvious builds just like in D3 (Pet-master, Fire-builds etc.) but you are not limited to them.
- No allways-online, you can in fact play this game completely in offline mode, characters are saved on your harddrive. (similar to Titan Quest)
- Many items with the same system as in TQ where rare pre- and -suffixes can occur on normal items. Also Epic and Legendary stuff (including sets and abilities granted by items)
- Farming: A combination of TQ and D3, boss runs are still effective (TQ) but there are also Hero spawns in normal locations that can be lucrative (D3)
- Simple Multiplayer system, you can either host a game (and others might join you, you can set a password or kick others) or you can join a game yourself (direct join to your steam-friends or browse existing hosted games)
- almost no bugs, the few that are there allways get fixed ASAP


Things i personally dont mind but might be important to you:
- performance issues when ALOT of stuff is going on (R9 290, 16GB RAM, i7 and dropping to 20fps on high settings, can be improved by lowering the settings though)
- Multiplayer MIGHT not allways work, make sure you have administrator rights when searching for games or it can crash (just like in TQ)
- even though they are not popular, you might find cheaters online (since save-files are on your harddrive you can just manipulate them). In that case just host a game yourself and kick them :P
- no voice acting and average grafics might scare you. but keep in mind that crate entertainment is a really small studio (Crate Entertainment has grown from one man with a dream to a team of ten with veteran developers....") so what they achieved is actually really impressive.


Conclusion: A really good ARPG. not a tripple-A title like D3 with millions of budget

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

There are three things that matter in an ARPG. They are:

Build diversity
Itemization
Fun combat

Build diversity:

The game features dual classing. I can play the exact same two classes as my buds and all of us would have a character that behaves and functions completely differently. Want to be a melee summoner? Dual wielding spell caster? Tanky totem user? Alright, we gotchu. Stuff just sort of works. Maybe not for the highest difficulty, but that's part of the fun of this game. Because playing it is actually fun.

Itemization:

I've gotten items for character ideas in this game I've never even thought of. I've gotten items specifically built for the character I'm playing as. A plus? They actually look pretty cool, too.

Let me put it to you like this. I have a tanky totem guy who uses spells to tank and does vitality damage. There are items specifically for this. Do you understand how cool that is?

Fun combat:

Alright, so, let's be real here. You are going to make characters that just don't work. You'll get to a point and maybe you didn't spend enough points in to your mastery and just don't have enough health. Maybe you don't do enough damage. Maybe you just kind of walked around and made it to the final difficulty and now you're stuck. Well, you had fun doing it.

And you had fun doing it because the combat is a blast. Oh, you want to shoot a laser beam at enemies? We gotchu. Want to use a shield to destroy your enemies? Hey now, I got something for you. Want to use that same skill but make it spammable and useable with two handers? Yeah dude, no problem. Want to put a bunch of mortars on the ground and run around like you would in the real world? Ayyyy, yep.

This game has it all. And it's all fun.

If you don't buy this game, I feel bad for you.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Grim dawn is a deep loot driven rpg, with a unique setting, and good atmospheric graphics running on a heavily updated and improved version of the titan quest engine. If you thought that developers won't invest in this style of game again, think again. Love has gone into this.

You start with a classes character, if you are a titan quest fan - you know the drill. If you do not, you start out without a class, think elder scrolls. Then you pick up an item, do some damage, and eventually you get some gear. By this point you will have leveled up and you can choose your class. Usually the player chooses something depending on what they have picked up, however you can choose something completely different and scour for items to match what you are going for.

Once you level up some more, you can choose a second class. Allowing for two to coexist concurrently - also like it's father titans quest. There are large number of class combinations. I don't find that every combination is satisfying, however most are at least interesting and fun to experiment with. One issue I have with the second class choice is that they are usually targeted at a specific item combination. For example, the soldier tree has many two handed skills, whereas the rogue tree has many duel wielding. That means you won't be able to pick the major skills in either tree. Since it's wasteful to be good at a two handed weapon and duel wielding skills. Unless you hotkey weapon switching. It's far better to just invest fully in whatever items you choose. Which means you are scouring the second tree for non-weapon based skills. It's not ideal.  However almost any combination you choose will be viable. And thats good enough. At least it represents freedom. If you want you can just stick to the one class.

The loot system is solid, although it lacks the pop you got a legendary" sensation that diablo managed. The melee combat

Grim Dawn
Update: The game is now released, and it still doesn't suck. 10/10

Early access review below:
I very rarely do Early Access reviews, solely because of how quickly a good game can go wrong, and vice versa.

So when I say Grim Dawn has not only met, but surpassed my expectations, I want you to get my full meaning.

Long before Act 4 was finished, Grim Dawn was always a very solid and playable Early Access title. Crashes were rare, nothing felt glitchy or unfinished. You'd just hit the level cap, or hit the wall of the next unopened area.

Which meant, even when there was only 1 complete Act and a couple of class choices, there was a lot of fun to be had. It stood as a testament to how the rest of the game would play, and Crate has delivered. It's been a long time coming, and I mean a solid 5 year development, but it was always consistent enough to never have felt abandoned or misled. A trait I'm finding more and more important with Early Access titles.

I'm not going to compare it to other ARPGs, as I'd much rather compare it to other early access titles in general. We had notes for every patch and hotfix. Always updates on what will be in the next patch along with future updates. I am glad to have supported this game in its early days, and am excited to finally see it's release, because I can absolutely say it does not feel rushed or unfinished. Crate put the time and effort necessary for a quality release, instead of giving us a half baked game and selling us the rest later.

Grim Dawn sets the bar for what we should expect from Early Access development and release. Bravo, Crate Entertainment.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

So, in the entire time that Path of Exile's extreme skill customization was a nice change to the Diablo 3 habits of hand holding style. With Diablo 3 and Path of Exile now being moreso known as the top two of these kind of games, there's in between Grim Dawn.

Grim Dawn for one, has the same customizations like the old Titan Quest, you don't have any skills to start with and you have no class, you make your class by progress. What makes that so special, is that there isn't a single class to choose from, one character can specialize into two paths(You don't have to).
Surely not all will be fully suitable for another, but it takes a little curve in knowing what to choose and why. Rather then a path being chosen for you, you can make yours from scratch.

Along with this in terms of skill customization, the game features a nice amount of loot, along with the entire factions offering you their items for trade as well, given you are on their good side. As for the looks of the game, its like the name suggests. Its grim, dark and grimy. Nothing in this world is given to you on a silver platter, and don't think you'll be quick to make friends.
Along with the nice bit of gunpowder skills and weaponary given to you, it gives another feel to the usual magic and swordplay world that is like PoE and Diablo 3, the combat is nice and beefy, strikes feel like they hit hard and enemies are plenty, either to be vaporized by magic or chopped to bits by a gaint sword.

Having played this game a fair bit, I can say it bring back the old feel of Titan Quest, in a new and fresh setting, unlike the PoE and Diablo 3 universe.
I can surely say, to those that enjoyed Titan Quest back in the day or want something different from the two big boys that are Path of Exile or Diablo 3 to check out Grim dawn, its not done yet, and its not perfect. But its a really nice change of pace and well done so far I can say.

Grim Dawn
Writing with only 16h of gameplay:

If you loved playing Diablo 2 as a kid (like myself), Grim Dawn is THE ARPG to buy!

Just forget about Torchlight (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it was made by the same team from Diablo 2).
And forget about Diablo 3+ (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it's the successor for Diablo 2).

And go ahead and buy Grim Dawn.

Here's why:
I played both Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and PoE and Titan Quest), and they won't even come close to make me feel like I'm back in my teens playing Diablo 2 with my friends.

Grim Dawn does it!

All the ambience, the sound tracks, the atmosphere, the theme. All the darkness, the condemned world, the shading, the monsters, the bosses. All the item hunting, the items themselves, the skill trees, the character evolution. They all feel very much like Diablo, WAY MORE than Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and Path of Exile and Titan Quest and ... ).

Sometimes when I'm playing I get this strong feeling that I'm finally playing a true new DiabloSometimes I get the same feeling I get when exploring a dark, hellish dungeon from Diablo 2.

I strongly recommend this game if you like Diablo 2, and I want to say Thank you so much dev team for making this game! This is like a dream coming true for me. This is the Diablo sequence I was waiting and hoping for.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

This game should not be overlooked by anyone who is interested in either Diablo 2,3,Titan Quest, or POE. While all of the games have fundamental differences in gameplay. Grim Dawn brings something fresh to the table that I have found lacking in POE and D3.

The Pros:

- Attention to detail (for example piles of burning bodies in fields and outside of burrwitch lead one to believe there was a major fight against the rampaging Aetherials, which leads me to my next pro".)

-The story telling ( while it does lack in lore like some of the AAA games (Diablo) it does  a masterful job at telling a story  without spelling it out for you. Different scenes you come across throughout the world really get you interested in what had happened as you put it together.

-Itemization ( the loot is both unique and visually appealing)

-The Combat (the melee and spells feel really good)

-The MUSIC ( is just amazing

Grim Dawn
It cured my dota 2 addiction.

Early Access Review

Hello. I rarely review.  40 year old gamer here.  Been gaming my whole life...TT and PC.  This is without a doubt the greatest RPG/ARPG I have ever experienced.  186.6 hours of play time later, I am still amazed at this masterpiece.  It may be the best PC game ever made...but I will stick with best RPG.  Seriously, the designers of this game have truly just created a work of art.  That is all.  Buy this game, play it to death and then play it more.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

If you are an action RPG  Lover, then the hours I have put into grimdawn should tell you enough :)

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Grim Dawn  is one of the best  Early Access  games on Steam right now, and one of the few Early Access games that I totally don't regret purchasing. I'll be using a few comparisons to other popular games in the ARPG genre, and giving some reasons on how Grim Dawn differentiates itself.

Grim Dawn is developed by  Crate Entertainment. They are only a small indie team of 7 or so, but they have some noticible talent from from titles like Titan Quest and Diablo 2. It's actually amazing what they have managed to accomplish with such a small team as the game was originally going to be a lot smaller in scope, but Crate had a fairly successful Kickstarter Campaign, which let them increase the scope of the game substantially.

So what does Grim Dawn manage to do right? What are some key features that are different from most ARPG's?

Huge Open Map
Grim Dawn features one giant interconnected map. Every Act has it's own feel and tileset, and areas connect and loop back to each other in such a clever way that at times, it reminds me of the level design of Dark Souls. There are plenty of Dungeons and Caves throughout these maps to explore, usually rewarding you with a cool side-boss. The big map design is a really cool feature considering games like Path of Exile have really small maps in comparison.
Exploration
Most other ARPG's mostly focus on the combat, which obviously--should be a big focus for any ARPG. But Grim Dawn kind of encourages you to explore and pay attention to the environment a bit more then the others. There are breakable walls in Dungeons (which are quite well hidden), but if you manage to find them, you tend to be rewarded with secret areas and enemies, meaning every Dungeon is worth fully exploring.
Combat
Since Grim Dawn is running on the Titan Quest engine (though, it's been modified and upgraded), there are some very satisfying physics and ragdoll effects.
Monsters tend to explode into gibs!
Combat is slower paced compared to games like D3, but it is responsive and punchy.
Animation quality ranges from good to excellent. There are some really nice looking abilities, but I have noticed a few animations could use a bit of work. The monsters are fantastically animated though!
Combat and movement in general is smooth.
Monsters Drop Weapons They Are Using!
This feature was in Titan Quest I believe, but I'm glad Crate decided to include it in Grim Dawn, as it's an awesome feature that most ARPG's should have.
What this means in more detail, is if you see a creature holding a weapon that looks unusual, and you notice after it hits you, you were drained of some energy for example, there is a good chance that monster is going to drop the same weapon it used to drain your energy.
This adds such a cool dimension to the game, as monsters can already have random affixes on them.
Loot
Every ARPG needs good loot. Good thing Grim Dawn delivers on that too! I'd say the loot system is a bit more old-school in it's design and approach, as there are a lot of % based modifiers, which is pretty standard, but a lot of items also have abilities attached to them. Other then that, you have your usual loot rarity system that are similar to most other ARPG's (Common, Magic, Rare, Epic) and Legendaries--which are not in the game yet.
Looting in general is just satisfying as hell. I love how loot explodes out of chests, and you even get loot piata's from killing bosses/mini-bosses.
Crafting & Components
The crafting system is actually quite in-depth and deep. It's perhaps not as deep as Path of Exile's crafting system, but it's not as simple as Diablo 3's either--it falls somewhere in between. One great thing is it's not as RNG focused as other crafting systems I've come across in other ARPG's.
Components are basically upgrades for your gear. They are found and crafted, and they can be attached onto most armour pieces. Components can also have abilities attached to them. Overall, It's quite an interesting take on an upgrade system, as components let you easily fix some flaws in your builds.
Sound Design
Absolutely amazing soundtrack! It's probably one of the best soundtrack's for an ARPG since Diablo 2, and I don't say that lightly.
There are some very well done ambient sounds, such as hearing flies buzzing around corpses, crackling around fires, etc--which adds a nice layer of detail to the sound design.
The Combat sounds are quite well done. The guns are punchy, spells sizzle, and weapons thud like you would expect.
Day & Night Cycle
This really adds to the games presentation and atmosphere, while also adding a layer of believability.

Now, some cons:

Lack of Cinematics & Voice Acting
There is some voice acting, and what's there is actually pretty well done, but there is no voice acting for quests and dialogue. The writing is overall pretty high quality, but I think some more voice acting would help sell the story more. This is only a minor con imo, as I think Crate are planning to add in more voice acting towards the end of their development schedule.
Slow Start
I gotta admit the game didn't immediately click with me at the start. This seems to be a problem with most ARPG's, as you have a general lack of abilities and gear in the first few hours. But, it gets a whole lot better if you decide to stick with it for a couple of hours and get a few abilities.
Lack of Visual Customisation
Games like Diablo 3 let you dye your armour, as well as transmogrify a peice of armour to look like another piece. Path of Exile has microtranscations for those things too. This is a great thing for games that are so focused on character development, and it's one feature that is sadly lacking in Grim Dawn. It does suck when your character is wearing armour that is not matching, with random colours and such. I'm hoping Crate adds a similar feature in the near future.
Lack of Randomised Dungeons & Maps
There is a rogue-like Dungeon which is meant to address this, and admittedly it is meant to be a pretty kick- dungeon (I haven't checked it out yet, but I have seen videos). Compared to Diablo 3's Rift System and Path of Exile's Maps, it's missing a lot of Enemy and Tileset variety.
Development is a little slow...
The game has been in full development since around 2012 (counting from the Kickstarter date). The general consensus seems to be that new builds take a little bit longer to release then most would like.
Most of these cons were only minor cons for me, but can be major cons depending on how you feel about them.

Overall, Grim Dawn does A LOT of things right. It has some features that should be standard for ARPG's, and those features make Grim Dawn feel like a very believable, detailed and rich gameworld. There is a lot of depth and replayability here, and if you even have a remote interest in ARPG's--Grim Dawn should be a no brainer.

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

I was and I still am a huge fan of Titan Quest. Grim dawn has exceeded my expectations by miles so far. I like the graphics, I like gameplay and I like the way you can improve gear by using collectable items. Gameplay is great, resources are not too scarce but its still a challenge. I just love it!

Yeah, progress is slow, the game is still in early access state. That's because developers resources are low and mostly because they are doing it right instead of releasing a half baked thing. Where I live we use to say do it right

Grim Dawn
Grim Dawn let me make a sorceress with a shotgun. More than that it encouraged me to, because that shotgun happened to be the perfect fit for the build I was working towards. I could have given her an enchanted pistol, or a giant warhammer, or really any of the countless weapons to be found throughout the world, and made it work. But as I was dashing through the ruins of a seaside town, ducking in and out of crooked doorways to blow zombies and floating eyes to hell with burning buckshot, I knew I had found my calling. At least until I find a bigger gun.

Freedom of choice is the chief takeaway from Grim Dawn, one of the most recent entries in the crowded ARPG/Diablo lootsplosion genre. Unlike its peers, Grim Dawn decouples weapons, armors, and even skills from specific classes, letting you be anything from an armored shaman with a lightning scythe to an arcane fire-slinging gunman to a demon-worshipping hammer-wielding assassin. The only thing limiting your gear choices are your level and your three base character stats, which all rise as your character grows and you invest in your classes. And yes I said classES because Grim Dawn lets you choose two of its six archetypes to mix into your character.

The classes themselves can be a bit of a hangup for new players because of the unique level of control you have over your skill progression. Rather than unlocking skills at certain levels, each class tree has a Mastery bar for you to spend skill points on. This bar grants you important base stat boosts and unlocks your actual skills with enough points invested. Of course, then you have to balance spending points on Mastery or the skills, and across two class trees to boot. It can be a bit daunting until you realize your greatest gains come from your Mastery, so you'll generally want to one-point your skills until you unlock them all.

Many of your skills are passive, meaning combat tends to be less technical than Diablo or other competitors. Indeed, more than a few battles are won or lost in the preparation of auras, toggle abilities, and weapon selections. You'll also find skills baked into the gear and upgrade components you find, some powerful enough to design an entire build around. In another liberating design decision, class skills are much more focused and specific while item skills are your more general fireballs and lightning novas, allowing you to make a pure caster out of literally any class combination.

Unprecedented freedom means nothing if there's nothing to do with it, but Grim Dawn does not disappoint here, either. The world of Cairn is in the throes of a magical apocalypse, with ruined towns and valleys and forests full of unspeakable horrors to bludgeon. Enemies and allies alike are divided into factions, with new quests and gearing options availiable from those that like you, and new bosses and challenges from those who don't. The main quest will keep you busy for a good 30 hours just putting down one of the major threats to the world, but building reputation and uncovering new secrets can last you dozens more hours.

And my God, the secrets! I'm a big fan of exploration in games and few reward you so richly as this. Unmarked dungeons and unique bosses can pop up just about anywhere, providing unexpected challenges at any level. Virtually every map has breakable walls and hidden chests, and much of the best loot to be had is found in hard-to-reach containers. I once found a secret dungeon beneath a side dungeon inside a completely optional dungeon! On top of all this, there's another character progression system called Devotion that uses points earned from hidden shrines all over the world, a genius system that more ARPGs would do well to ape.

Grim Dawn doesn't hold back in challenge, either, with some brutally hard side dungeons and optional bosses right from the first few hours. The main quest is easy enough to get through for even the inexperienced, so you have your choice of difficulty through exploration as well. All of this is presented with a gritty, moody look and some meaty sound work, though the soundtrack is pretty lacking and gets repetitive in a hurry. The Lovecraftian themes are well-realized and there's a ton of detail to the world, from engaging lore to morally gray decisions to make. Even if there wasn't so much to work with in the gear and skills systems this would be a solid competitor to Diablo and its ilk, but the wealth of options and progression systems easily makes Grim Dawn one of the top titles in the genre.

PS. FU Blizzard"

Grim Dawn
One of the best early access games I purchased. I love the world, graphics, combat, and skill trees. If you enjoy these types of games, you know how satisfying it is to think of a build and go for it, only to see it work better than expected. Good stuff.  In my opinion this is better than Van helsing series and Diablo 3,.. As of others have said, this is closer to Diablo 2 and what Diablo3 should have been. Also, you can play offline and online if you choose.

Grim Dawn
I am a great fan of the diablo series, but this game feels like how diablo 3 should feel.

You start off in some small city and from the first moment in, I felt it to be ''just right''. Even when they used the same engine as Titan Quest, the graphics in this game looks amazing and stunning.

Its like the developers didnt want ANY place in this game to look like it has been created on a hurry. Every single bit of environment you encounter looks just right. The trees, the little abandoned cottages, the looks of mobs. As far as I have played, which isnt that much yet, even the most outlying places looks great.

I am a fan of multiplayer, and the way this games handles the ''drop-in'' and ''drop-out'' of multiplayer works like a charm. Indeed, they dont support their own servers for multiplayer, but they did an awesome job here. No port forwarding needed. Just enter if you would like to play single player, multiplayer using LAN or INTERNET, or joining one of those. Everyone with a decent connection should not have any problems with this game playing over either Lan or Internet.

The dept of this game overall is amazing. The skilltrees, the devotion points (Points that can be acquired through shrines around the world), the dual specialization, the different classes. The blacksmith who can craft amazing and lots of items and add-ons for your character. The shared stash tab, so you can share items between other characters instantly.

Although Grimdawn is an ARPG, the different playstyles you can combine with or without friends feels so good. I have played a lot of RPG's and ARPG's before, but Grimdawn feels like something ''new''. Not the standard hack and slash experience, but something feels different in this game. All the variation in it makes it so great. You even have an option to turn your camera around, so if you're bored with this game (I cant image why), you could turn the camera 180 degrees and its like you're playing a whole new world!

Would I recommend this game?
Well definitely I will!

And that for only 25 euro's? Thats amazing!

Grim Dawn
This is one of those games where you can just feel that the developers poured thier heart and soul into its creation.  Solid from start to finish and challenging on the ultimate difficulty.  Skills are fun to use and the multiclass system adds additional depth to character creation.  If you enjoyed Titan Quest or Diablo 2 I would highly recommend that you check out Grim Dawn.

Grim Dawn, a spiritual successor to Titan Quest (check that out if you haven't already) a new standard for ARPGs by Crate Entertainment, better than Path of Exiles, Torchlight 2, and WAY better than Diablo III.
Full character customization
Mix 6 different classes for different play-styles
Explore a HUGE world
Craft
Gain reputation with several factions
Reap great rewards and fight big bosses
The world of Cairn is gritty and dark, with interesting lore that definitely is inspired from Lovecraft and music that reminds me of the good old days of Diablo and Diablo II.

All in all my new standard for all ARPGs, Path of Exiles is a great ARPG, Torchlight 2 is a goodARPG, Diablo III is not a funARPG, for me, Grim Dawn has everything and then some that all of these other titles don't have, and for that reason alone its worth the purchase.

Need another reason? Its only$24.99USD, that is what I like to see on PC gaming, great games and great prices.

Support these guys now! And thank you Crate Entertainment!

Grim Dawn
I've been playing ARPG's since Diablo, am a firm believer that Diablo II: Lord of Destruction is the best ARPG ever made and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls is not a true successor to the series. Besides that I've also put time and effort in Torchlight II and Path of Exile, which I both found to be better than Diablo III but which still couldn't satisfy my ARPG need. Now I've purchased Grim Dawn early on but due to performance issues I was unable to play it at that time (which have been fixed) and I left it until recently.

My experience comes from playing Act I in Hardcore Veteran mode, both solo and with friends in multiplayer. The difficulty at Veteran -which is a modifier to Normal difficulty, increasing the amount of Hero enemies" and the rewards that you reap from them- is very solid. You will roughly level from 1 to 18-20 during Act I

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

After 30+ hours of playing the first act i'm still having loads of fun! Plenty of replayability due to experimenting with different character builds, tactics, and the awesome dual class system. From what i've seen in act 1, the difficulty is good: A gimped character will die alot, as well as players rushing head long into the fray. Graphics are awesome, although carts on fire still eat up all my frame rates...
Definitily buy this game if you are a fan of TQ, or if D3 wasn't enough to satisfy your hunger.

Grim Dawn
With nearly 400 hours played, and being old enough to play Diablo 2 when it first came out, this brings back memories like you cannot believe.

I would recommend 100% for any ARPG lovers out there... Only good things to come in the future.

Very much worth the $30 CAD on the game, better than any Popular" game in the RPG genre"

We now have Voiceovers and an intro video.  It's hard to describe here, but the overall smoothness" feel of build 31 is significantly better than it was in b29/30.  We have gotten some added content in act 2

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

After nearly 500 hours of early access playtime I feel i should weigh in on Grim Dawn. Also at 491 hours and rising it should tell you i've enjoyed this game greatly, and have paid for two other copies that i gave to my brother and a friend. Now lets get to the actual Review.

Grim Dawn as a game does not hold your hand, in quests you are told to seek out something or someone at a location, after that you are left on your own to search for your objective, only once you get near your objective(about near the edge of your screen) does a marker show up. This encourages exploration of areas in full and i also reccomend that you fully explore an area there are many secrets in the game to be found, from loot, to quests, to bosses that may or may not kill your character when you first meet them.

The world is also not sectioned off like say as it was in Titan Quest or Diablo, it is instead one continous worldspace, akin to Sacred, some complain about this giving the games world areas too similar to one another, i personally enjoy this as it creates a more cohesive world.

As for the games story, i find it enjoyable enough, when you start the game your character was to be hung at the gallows for being possessed by an Aetherial spirit, said spirit abandons ship before it dies with you, you're cut down, then asked if you want to stay you need to earn your keep by assisting the settlement of Devils Crossing, i wont spoil much more, but another thing i would like to address about the games story is that some NPC's you meet arent helpless sods needing rescue, bar some casses. theres quite a few times in the game where you find the odd NPC camped out somewhere surrounded by slain monsters, I find this a refreshing change of pace compaired to other ARPGs. Lastly much of Grim Dawn's history, backstory, and lore are found via notes scattered throughout the world, some are journals from before the game, others history of the world, or just the odd bit of why a particular foe is with a faction. Again encouraing more exploration of the world.

Now to the meat and bones of any ARPG, Character customiztion, progression and loot. Lets start with the Masteries, in Grim Dawn there are 5(and a 6th coming in the next build, Build 27) Masteries, Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist, and soon to be the Shaman.

the Soldier is your melee specialist,  hearty and strong, a robust choice for someone new to grim dawn.

The Demolitionist is all about explosions and fire. Like seeing the world burn? then this is the mastery for you.
The Occultist Focuses on debuffs, pets, and debilitating attack spells. command minions to maul your foes or debilitate them with vile curses.
The Nightblade is your melee dual wielder, focusing on speed, and very fast attacks, want to shred your enemies into ribbons? chose the nightblade
The Arcanist is a pure spellcaster  that rains down destruction and devastation. the glass cannon of the game
Each of these masteries can be combined with another to create a dual class, covering one masteries weakness or bolstering anothers strengths. in my opinion this lends the game a great deal of replay value because i am the kind of person who will explore all avenues of play. with the varied skill pool of a single mastery there are quite a few dual class combinations you can take advantage of and explore different playstyles.

The loot in Grim Dawn is quite good, the qualities ranging from White(basic), Yellow(magic), Green(rare or rare monster infrequent), Blue(epic) and Purple(Legendary, not yet in the game). Curiously magic rare and epic are competative, in some character builds a good yellow might be all you need to properly outfit an equipment slot,  while another can get by with some basic epic items, or builds looking to gear in all rare equipment. there are a number of affixes to suit any and all builds, as well as epics.

There is also a Faction system in Grim Dawn, there are many groups you can aid, and many you can anger. Increasing your standing with friendly factions allows you access to their equipment and augments. these augments offer additional bonuses to your items and can be worth the effort to obtain access to them. Conversely further angering hostile factions makes them send more dangerous enemies at each threshold, culminating in the chance to encounter a Nemesis, a random boss linked to the faction you angered. these nemesis bosses while rare drop incredible loot, and assure an epic from their defeat, and once they are in the game, an increased chance of legendary drops.

this last section I am going to adress some deal breakers: Many ask will there be secure servers?" at this time there are no plans for such

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

When I was a wee lad, I had an addiction to Diablo 2.  Sure, other games would find their way on to my 500 MB HDD, but they were just visiting.  That's where D2 lived.

I waited 13+ years to Diablo 3 and, well, we all know what happened there.  I was left without a new ARPG that could scratch that itch.

Then stumbled upon Grim Dawn.  It scratched.

The visuals are stunning and gritty.  The atmophere is oppressive yet relaxing.  Hit detection is perfect.  Balancing seems on point.  Classes look and feel unique.  Skills are inventive and beautiful to execute.  Loot is expansive. Mechanics are sound.  MP community is wonderful.  Story is awesome.  Etc., Etc., Etc.

Serioulsy, if you're like me and haven't been able to find that ARPG that satisfies that craving, this is it.

10/10

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Well... I suppose I'll write a review after testing the game for over 1k hours though after the game's release I will definitely update this.

So. Let's start with the company. Crate Entertainment currently consists of a team of 8 people who not only communicate with the community (this is amazing) - but also know how to create a kick  game. They started with only 2 people for quite some time while receiving off and on support from people they knew who also worked on TQ - gradually and with help from Kickstarter + Steam Early Access sales they have managed to expand and continue to amaze the fans who are eagerly waiting for this game to be released (even now it is defnitely worth it imo).

Grim Dawn takes all the good things from Titan Quest and makes it better while also distinguishing itself in it's own way. The game plays and feels like Titan Quest while it also reminds me of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 when it comes to the grittier/darker visual appeal. This to me is the ultimate combination of ARPG games and to be apart of the development process in testing and providing feedback for such a game is an amazing experience.

Now to the game.

Story - Grim Dawn is actually what the peope of Cairn (world of Grim Dawn) call what is pretty much the apocolypse in that an invasion of 2 otherwordly races have invaded the world. One race, the Aetherials want to possess everything that lives all the while pretty much terraforming the planet in order to make Cairn a more liveable place for them - while the other race, the Ch'thonians want to stop this from happening which means butchering those that the Aetherials are interested in possessing which includes you and any survivors that managed to live through the initial invasion.

That is the overall plot in which the beginning of the game is more stressing the survival aspects of living in a now ruined world - while also building a foundation for future encounters with the Aetherials and Ch'thonic invaders. The danger is very real - and there are other nasty beasts, creatures and outlaws that also pose a threat to your survival.

There are Quest Options for choosing different outcomes in a quest, and there will be factions that will be added later on in development (perhaps late this year or early next year hopefully).

Combat - Very much like Titan Quest but having a faster pace. So far it's been quite good and the devs continually update animations, balance skills, and fix bugs with skills when they can. Definitely not Diablo 3 which admittedly has some good combat that flows very well (one of the few things that I'll give to the game) - but it's still pretty good. Hopefully as development continues whatever issues that people find will be fixed and improved upon.

Characterization - Creating a character has only male/female options but this will probably change later when it comes to having different options for faces/hair as pertaining to a dev post. As this isn't hugely important it will be done later on I would imagine. However the main thing: replay value and creating Skill Builds. This is definitely there. Just like Titan Quest, Grim Dawn has the dual mastery system where you start off with one mastery/class at level 2 and once you reach level 10 you can choose a second one. With 5 Mastery's that is 15 combinations of either sticking with 1 mastery or using the dual mastery system. Itemization also expands character builds by a lot which brings me to...

Itemization/Crafting - Really good. Common/White items are useful for the couple low levels in which you can then turn them off (making them more of a visual look when it comes to enemies dropping stuff they are wearing/using(!!!)), Magic/Yellow items are next in line which although not usually as powerful as later tiers they can roll a lot higher with their affixes, Rare/Green items have affixes that are unique and can be quite powerful, Epic/Blue items have set affixes with merely the rolls being varied + they can be set items, and Legendary items are not yet in the game.

Needless to say the itemization in this game is fantastic and compliments both the skill building aspect of the game and the loot hunt part of the game.

Level Design - Handcrafted world means the level design looks really good but of course trades that off with less randomization. Enemy camps can be randomized in some cases and there are randomized barriers which players can encounter and have to find a way to get around them via an alternate route - giving some slight randomization and also promoting exploration. The level design for each area is done in such a way that the player can continue on in the direction of the next area quickly - or spend time to explore the area for loot/dungeons/caves/quests. Essentially levels are short but wide - so later playthroughs you can choose whether or not to spend more time exploring or continuing on with the quests. The game isn't finished yet so content on Act 3 and perhaps the miniature Act 4 that may be added will also be quite interesting to see.

Enemies - Are quite diverse and are also in their own faction which means you can actually see Aetherials and Ch'thonic enemies duking it out before you even get to the fight. As with Titan Quest later difficulties means secret bosses/challenge dungeons that would have been locked in the previous difficulty.

Some more Positive things:
-Modding - is amazing. Titan Quest and Diablo 2 both have great mods that I have enjoyed and since GD's modding tools will be better I am hoping for some amazing mods later on in the future.
-Survival Mode. Sounds just like it says in that you need to survive against waves of enemies, modding can definitely expand on this.
-Open World PVP. Though the game's skills/itemization isn't based on PVP modding could definitely create balanced PVP and probably some interesting game modes I would imagine.
-Camera that is fully rotatable and has decent zoom.  Might not seem like that much of a deal but after playing GD - trying other ARPG's or even Moba's can be relatively frustrating due to lack of camera control.
-Weather + Day and Night System.
-Will be DRM free on release - for those that are wary about Steam and want to fully own the game.
-No economy.

Some possible Negatives:
-Single player based with optional multiplayer. Single player mode is perfectly fine while multiplayer can be a bit iffy mainly due to it being just released - optimization will definitely improve on the multiplayer experience.
-No closed servers. Like TL2 and TQ there aren't closed servers. Should the game do amazingly well the devs have expressed their interest in such a thing but they would rather spend money on more content before considering closed servers. That being said public games are usually pretty good and if someone joins in with a modded character you can always ban them from the game/server. A con when it comes to modding but the pros definitely outwheigh the cons.
-No economy.
-Slow development. Though I expect the game to be finished either early or middle of next year - the pace is relatively slow due to having a small team. That being said they do communicate well with the forum users and give updates every other Monday.
-Costs $25. For some reason people really like F2P games but I'd rather pay a flat price for a full game rather then have a gimped free version of the game. For what you get out of the game $25 is super cheap even with the content that is available now.
-Not optimized. Though I can run the game at max fine, that doesn't mean everyone can. Obviously lack of optimization is a given that will be improved later on in development - however both the devs and the community are pretty good in trying to help those who are having issues with running the game.

Conclusion: Grim Dawn is definitely worth $25 if you enjoyed Titan Quest and perhaps Diablo 1 or 2.
10/10 for an excellent Early Access game. Will update on release.

Grim Dawn
In the grim dawnness of Crate Entertainments' ARPG, there is only excellence...
Grim Dawn has had one of the longest journeys through Early Access, I've been there right from the start, when it was a very rough and ready prototype with the first act, when the frame rate was choppy and the scenery was a little bit flat to say the least. But gods, the core gameplay was satisfying. It scratched the itch that only Diablo 2 and more recently Path of Exile had scratched in a very specific, and pleasing way. Over the intervening timeframe, it has grown, evolved, and refined itself, and matured into this majestic, noble thing.

Scalable across a wide variety of systems, able to look beautiful on the very highest of rigs and still managing to look good on systems of modest means whilst maintaining a good framerate, the levelling and class development has grown with six base classes available, and the ability to dual class means that in effect you've the choice of no less than fifteen possible combinations from which to pick your build from. Twenty one if you decide for whatever reason to stick with a purely single class setup (which is eminently possible, but who wants to just go one way these days when you can swing two...). That's not even touching on the brilliantly insane devotion system, which unfolds like something that looked at Path of Exile and went You know

Early Access Review

My friends were all like ITS LIKE TITAN QUEST! ITS AWESOME!"

Guess what; its like titan quest. Its awesome."

Grim Dawn
**New In-depth Review Update**
I'm still playing this game.

**Old Review w/ 50% less depth**
Look ya s! As you can clearly see I am entirely too busy actually playing this game to write you a proper review. So.. Look at my hours, now look at my recommendation. Finger it out and buy the game. Peace.

Grim Dawn
TITAN QUEST 2.0

After 550 hours of playing Grim Dawn, I think it is time to write up my review.

So, what is Grim Dawn? The short answer is that it is Titan Quest" 2.0. The long answer is that Grim Dawn is an ARPG from Crate Entertainment. The game takes places in the world of Cairn

Grim Dawn
I haven't enjoyed an ARPG so much since I summoned my first Clay Golem at level 6.

Ya know all those other ARPGs that have come out since then? Each one tweaked Diablo 2 just a little bit, and added or altered stuff, but never really quite hit the preposterously high bar D2 set. They were good games and I enjoyed most of them that I played, (except Torchlight, wasn't a fan for some reason) but they still left me wanting.
If you can relate, Grim Dawn is what you've been looking for, its cherrypicked the best systems and ideas of all the recent well-done ARPGS, and basically jammed them back into a reimagining of Diablo 2 with great results

Its the most worthy among a slew of competitors for the true successor to Diablo 2 (including PoE, D3, Titan Quest:IT, Torchlight 1 & 2)
If you feel like this genre had gotten stagnant, like I did, this game will renew your hope.

+1-4 player, instanced loot, trade loot, enemy difficulty/loot scaling by player
+Atmosphere and feel of Diablo 2, but with guns
+Class/level system of Titan Quest
+Tons of components, crafting, and enhancements that significantly alter playstyle and can easily alter build path, like Path of Exile
+Fantastic character build options
+Shoulder slot
+Totally needless amount of isntanced loot
+good loot variety
+good enemy variety
+huge enemy groups, frequent enemy heros
+fun, satisfying combat
+Main quest is decently long, high replayability
+reasonably priced

=some pretty blatant recreations of Diablo 2 encounters (definitely more of an homage than a copy)
=Class-granted skills are varied, but uninspired. (The excellent customzation comes from combining them with various other effects)
=Lots of skills that prock on or or are dependent on % chance-per-hit

-Environment variety isn't so great, simialr colors and titlesets pretty much the whole time
-Summoners can only have one of each summon, no hellhound army builds :(
-Storyline is meh. Not terrible, but clearly not its focus



Grim Dawn
Ok calling all RPG fans....

Grim Dawn was made just for you if you liked
Diablo 1 or 2, PreSkyrim Morrowind cycle, Throne of Darkness, Van Helsing, Titan's Quest, or any of their closest kin.

The opening plot starts with you being possesed, tortured for inforrmation, and being hung. The hanging exorcises the aetheric infestation (4th dimentional being has no desire to die stuck in your body). Your rope gets shot down and the game starts with you enhanced body being asked if you're willing to redeam yourself and help save a small parcel of humanity. No spoilers there folks, watch the trailer (nicely done).

The setting is as if someone took magical Renaissance era Europe added a touch of the old West, a dash of Tesla, and iced it all with some Soloman Kane.

Graphically
You've got the 3 person top down angle camera view.
And well folks... while the detail level isn't bad. This game is dark, grubby, and crumbling in looks. A while one occationally gets to walk through areas like this
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652567803
more often you'll get dungeons like this and darker
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652567901

I turned up my brightness. Cause everytime I was in a dark area at night. Even with light enhancing items, it was bloody hard to see. Which is realistic (and can be nice in a horror game) but I personally don't find it fun in a dungeon crawler.

Audio
30% of NPCs have voice acting. The rest speak only in text format. The hacks, shots, grunts, ect are worthy; but nothing special. The background music is your typical ignoreable mood enhancer stuff.

Gameplay
Now here's where it gets enjoyable. It's your standard mouse point directional walk, left click attack, right click ect.. with the customizeable 2 layered slots for potions, spells, special attacks, and the permanent spot for your personal rift portal (that your lovely modifed humanity grants you). A great class system and you'll get to choose 2 of them eventually. Then you get you devotional choices once you restore your first shrine (on a nice astrological skill map). Your inventory will expand with some quests. You have a storage chest and the ability to send items to your other characters. You get enhancement bits to add to your items. Once you help the blacksmith, the ability to craft.

And if all that seams familar to you (to any core rpg player it should) there's the truth of this game. The developers have taken nearly every well working gameplay aspect from all the games before and used them.This isn't a bad thing even if it's not truly inovative. It's nostalgic without being hokey.

There's also multiplayer available.........

Overall
I really think if you ever enjoyed a 3 person view RPG you should buy this. It's a premium experiance and a excellent dungeon grinder.

Grim Dawn
It's like the creators went to the salvage yard, found the old and rusted remains of Diablo II, Titan Quest, and Fallout and thought Hey

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

I actually had low-ish expectations going into Grim Dawn as I'm not the biggest fan of ARPG games, but I've really enjoyed playing this. This game has TONS of loot, many different class combos, exciting combat and a decent story to hold it all together. I picked this up when it was 50% off, but I would have still been happy having paid full price of $25 as there is a LOT of content here.

This game is still in Early Access (full game due around Q1 '16) but you wouldn't know it while playing. The dev's have focused on releasing one act at a time, and releasing quality content instead of a full game of bugs and glitches. I've played now for about 40 hours and haven't encountered a single bug, which is quite impressive. The only negative I could think of is the frame rate gets a little choppy at times, but I'm guessing this is just an optimisation thing, which will no doubt happen before launch.

In short: Great game and really good value considering the content within and the asking price. I totally recommend this to all ARPG fans or just RPG fans in general.

Grim Dawn
Before I begin. here is DAIL mod. it is updated as often as possible and has an installer.
http://www.nexusmods.com/grimdawn/mods/11/?
(1000s of actual edits, new content, 3 new masteries infinite maps, 12 mods merged in etc)

now for the Review"

This is my new favourite time waster/grinder
It doesnt have the disneyland polish (not always a good thing) of torchlight 2

Grim Dawn
At first this game seemed like one of 'those' Diablo copies. But as I played through it, several positives that other similar ARGP's don't have become clear:

Positives:
+ Grim Dawn has six well-rounded premade 'classes' you can invest in.
In Grim Dawn, you start out with all options open and you can choose from a big variation of offensive and defensive skills.
+ Grim Dawn allows for Dual Class mixing.
After reaching level 10, you can start investing points in another 'class' skill tree, allowing you to mix with even more offensive/defensive skills from that other class.
+ Grim Dawn has an item for most skill builds.
The items in Grim Dawn are unique, but also generic in a good sense. Flat bonuses to whatever type of damage your character deals are widely available.
+ Grim Dawn has a massive variety of item-enhancers (called Materials).
You find these in the world and can attach them to items to make them more powerful in a certain way, or use them in the extensive crafting system. They can be somewhat compared to 'socketable gems or runes' in Diablo 2, but every item has a 'socket'.
+ Grim Dawn has a very extensive 'talent' system (called Devotion).
In the world you find shrines that once defeated/something sacrificed to award a talent point. This can be invested in a very broad talent system. This has a slight downside for those who do NOT enjoy theorycrafting; it can be a bit overwhelming.
+ Grim Dawn plays fluently.
Now this may seem irrelevant, but for those who played Path of Exile and were thrown off by the 'clunky' gameplay (I know I was) will have a much cleaner feel of gameplay flow in Grim dawn that is almost similar to Diablo 3. You character feels very responsive to your actions and he goes where you want him to go.
+ Grim Dawn has a good mix between realistic and clear art style.
To make a game both pretty in a realistic way AND still be able to see what happens where is NOT easy, and Grim Dawn does a good job at it. The minimap, map and color scheme are all clear enough to see (I am r-g colorblind).
+ Grim Dawn is fun to play with friends.
Once set up, GD is a very enjoyable multiplayer experience. You can easily build characters that complement each other, or slaughter each other in a duel.
+ Grim Dawn items can (usually) be traded/given to friends.
Yeah, this is good. Not like Diablo 3 where every-****ing-thing is soulbound. Some items in Grim Dawn are also soulbound, but with reason.
+ Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.
It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.

Negatives:
- Grim Dawn has a seemingly pointless mechanic of stat points.
You are allowed to invest in Physique, Cunning or Spirit. Physique gives hp and other health bonuses, Cunning gives crit and hit bonuses and Spirit gives more energy to spam your skills. It SEEMS like a choice at first, but because items REQUIRE flat amounts of these stats (715 Spirit for that great caster item, 715 Physique for that awesome armor) this choice is an illusion. In fact, this can be very frustrating for a first playthrough; you might not be able to wear something awesome you find. Diablo 3 doesn't have this problem (but many others).
- Grim Dawn tends to stutter a bit with large amounts of monsters and particles on screen.
Played on a high-end PC (2016 built), with 3 Wind Devils, 3 Storm Totems, 1 Wendigo Totem and 4 packs of monsters can give lag, even on the best of machines. This is not any worse than on similar games like D3 or PoE.
- Grim Dawn leveling can become tedious.
After level 50, the experience needed to advance increases rapidly per level. Reaching max level on a character is an every-day, 2 week investment at least.
- Grim Dawn needs portforwarding for most people to do multiplayer.
Right now, hosting a game in GD requires you to manually open port 27016 (UDP/TCP). Although this is easy for me, it may not be for those less technically inclined.
- Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.
It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.

I hope you found this summary review helpful! Have fun :)

Grim Dawn
Early Access Review

Disclaimer, This is my first review.

First and foremost, I was highly skeptical about this game before I bought it. I saw it and thought Re-skin of Titan Quest." I am happy to see the spirit of TQ perserved while establishing itself as it's own Intellectual Property and its take on Action Role Playing Games.

I was let down by the charactor creation (I spend a lot of time on charactor creation in games like Saints Row 3

Grim Dawn
TL;DR-  Grim Dawn is a fantastic game with an immense amount of depth that might intimidate casual players... if it weren't so Dag Nabbed fun and hooking right out of f***ing box when you fire it up.


I've been playing since I believe March or May 2013ish... TBH, this game is the whole reason I initially downloaded Steam. For awhile, I wasn't a big fan of the whole Steam idea. Now it's a part of life. Strange how things work out. Anyway, deciding I should actually start supporting these talented small teams early instead of just crossing my fingers like I did with GGG, I backed Crate pretty heavily on Kickstarter (for me at least) and had to install Steam to test their Alpha releases.

My opinion has, of course, wavered throughout the last few years. At the finish line, I can assure you that this is a top-notch aRPG that belongs in ANYONE's arsenal who claims to be a fan of the genre.

My pet-peave at the moment is that with it's stellar reviews on big-name sites such as ign and such it is of course getting the indoctrinal which is better" treatment.

Grim Dawn is it's own beast.

Path of Exile is my social aRPG. I play it for teamwork. I play it for that economical atmostphere. Sure

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Ultra Street Fighter IV is not a game for everyone. It is a very hard game. A few hundred hours is the basic learning curve for essentially being a beginner. That being said even for people not planning on being competitive there's a lot of content just in the combo system. It's satisfying working towards just doing combos in themselves or eventually beating your first opponent online. That being said, this is where the true nature of this game comes out.

USF4 Is a game of competition and self-discipline. This game will appeal to yourself if you always strive to improve. There will be an unlimited amount of times you will frustrated and convinced you hit a brick wall. This game is about gradual improvement, a constant cycle of finding new plateaus and satisfaction of overcoming them with practice, hard work and intellect. This is a personal game, you shoulder all the blame for losing in a competitive setting. If you are prone to rage-quitting then this game will quickly be deleted from your hard drive in anger.

Pushing past this however, you see the evolution of play and how you express your personality and play style as well as who you are playing against. It's oddly intimate in that you can recognize someone solely based on their movements, actions and decisions. In every game it is you against another person, another individual wanting to get better and improve, wanting to learn from you as you learn from them. This is the addicting part of USF4 and Fighting games in general, your best friends are always your enemies and you push each other constantly. Nobody will ever truly be satisfied in being good enough"

Ultra Street Fighter IV
I only played a little but it was fun.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
100 hours and i still suck

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Genre: 2.5D Traditional Fighting Game

Summary:
SFIV is a footsies-based fighting game that emphasizes slow methodical play and meter management between rounds.
Game features the inclusion of 'focus attacks', a universal move that grants a character one hit of armour and the potential to crumple the opponent; the nature of focus attacks allow characters to aggressive advance through attacks without infringing upon the effectiveness of projectile characters.

Pros:
- 39 characters, an additional 5 in Ultra Street Fighter 4.
- The majority of match-ups are balanced (future update to provide further balance).
- Decent netcode if neither player has much traffic.
- Large established player base online and offline.
- Great for players trying to get into fighting games. Will teach fundamentals through play and the abundant tutorials on the internet.

Cons:
- Single-player modes are lacking; arcade mode has terrible A.I. and the challenges aren't fun.
- The game itself does not provide instruction to newer players.
- No theatre mode for the animated clips from Arcade Mode.

Neutral Points:
- There will be a learning curve; it is a fighting game afterall. If you are a new player then you will be terrible for a while.
- Input leniency allows newer players to perform special moves more easily but can become an annoyance at higher level play.
- There is a comeback factor for newer players (Ultra) which becomes a tool at higher level play.
- The plot is barebones, but hey, that's a norm for fighting games.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Online has been patched. It was an issue on Steam's end, and now many problems have been fixed. Reviews before March 2015 lamenting online play might be outdated. Online isnt perfect but it is definitely playable (and better than Netherrealm fighters at least).

In my opinion this is one of the best fighting games on Steam. If you want a deep and competitive game or just want to jump into the genre, this is a great title to pick up, especially with EVO right around the corner.

+Diverse roster of 44 playable characters
+All classic SF2 world warriors (Guile, Sagat, Cammy, Akuma, etc.)
+Good mix of SF Alpha and SFIII characters (No Alex or Q though)
+Wide range of controller support
+Very balanced. Every character is viable in the right hands.
+Good soundtrack (Character themes aren't nearly as good as in SFIII: 3rd Strike though)
+Useful training mode with attack data, input display, dummy recording, and even 2 player online training
+Matches can get pretty hype
+Runs well on PC (80 fps on an AMD 7770)
+Solid netcode. Again, not perfect (unless you live in Japan) but most matches are smooth.
+Lots of colors and costumes (everyone has at least 3-4 costumes and ~12 colors)
+New unique Focus Attack system.
+Extensive Trial mode gives a fun way to burn time if you want a challenge
+Interesting Japanese ink brush art style with great 3D visuals (sort of prefer the old 2D sprites though). Fireballs look beautiful.
+Online community is still active
-V-Sync causes input lag
-New Revenge Meter is built up by taking damage. At 50% you can do an Ultra combo. This feels like it rewards bad play and makes comebacks more common and less exciting.
-Ubiquitous 1 frame link combos. These are much more punishable on a missed link due to the large reversal window, allowing players to mash out a dragon punch if you mistime your inputs
-Typical cheap arcade fighting game A.I. with psychic reaction time. Final boss in arcade mode is cheap as hell
-3 joke characters. Dan is funny, but Rufus was unnecessary, and El Fuerte should be removed entirely.
-Character Select starts 1P at Juri and 2P at Hakan. Why not Ryu and Ken?
-Did I mention El Fuerte?

With USF4 what you get is a well polished, balanced, and deep fighter. What makes this game enjoyable to me is the high skill ceiling; every time I play I have the opportunity to improve my ability. Heck, even with the amount of hours I've put in I still kinda suck. Much of my playtime consists of playing in private lobbies with friends, which is always a blast. While Street Fighter may seem technically daunting, I definitely recommend it to those looking to get into the fighting game genre. A learning curve is definitely present, but the fundamentals you pick up from playing this will carry on to other fighters. This is also currently the most played fighting game in the tournament  scene, so those with a competitive drive should be satisfied. Whether youre familiar with fighters or are a total newcomer, I recommend picking up Ultra Street Fighter IV on PC.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Well what can I say ... I spent some time on this game, and I'm pretty sure that is one of the best fighting games of all time.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Probably the most balanced versus fighting game ever, easy to learn, hard to master.
Just play it, have fun and make people salty.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Title: Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition makes for a very intriguing title. It contains one of those fancy circle Rs which probably stand for something legal, so you don't have to worry about any legal issues when you fire it up. Title has you covered.
This game is also rather super, as every single character without exception has a super move that can be activated when you have a full super meter. Each character also has Ultra combos, although the title will not reflect that until an upcoming change in 2014.
Street Fighter IV is the defining Street Fighter of this generation, with over four street fighters to street fight as. Furthermore, this is the arcade edition. Arcades are known for many things, but I don't actually know what any of those are. I remember that I never wanted to play in them that much because I'd have to pay every time I wanted to try again, which would be extremely frequent. I'm terrible at this. Fortunately, you do not have to buy a respawn DLC, even though this is the Arcade Edition.

Graphics: The game comes with graphics, many of which are even 3d. The camera does fancy spinning flying things when you do ultra combos, and while that may not be related to graphics, I feel that is a very huge selling point as there is no better way to emphasize just how hard you punched that little casual in his filthy jaw. There are also fancy effects you can put on the characters that make a subtle but noticeable difference I can't put my finger on because my monitor does not have a touch screen.
At any rate, the answer to Does Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition have graphics?" would be a resounding "Yes!"

Gameplay: As you might expect

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Played online and now I am saltier than the ocean

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Yeah, what can I say. Greatest game ever made if you put in the time to learn it at the higher levels. This is definitely the deepest game out there. Pro's have to consistently hit timings down to 16 ms, in addition to reading the opponent, adjusting to their character, and developing their own strategies to psyche them out. In reality this is psychological fighter IV, and if you like deep games, you can forget about any of the other ones out there.

USF4 takes the cake.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
- I choose Dan
- My opponent picks Dudley
- It's the last round and we both have 20% health
- I'm in the corner. He throws out an Ultra 1
- I blocked and now he's open. I go in with Dan's Ultra 1
- Window pops up The player has left the session"

Can't get past Ryu Trial #1

10/10

No, for real though, Ultra Street Fighter IV is a superb fighting game, boasting some of the
most iconic characters, music, and mechanics that's ever been put on PC, Console, or otherwise.

Keep in mind that this isn't a overly fast-paced 10,000 combo fighter,
know that Online Multiplayer has a few hiccups, but overall is actually quite good now,
grasp that USFIV doesn't play like Third Strike or Street Fighter II in regards to timing and
execution (though some aspects definitely strike Street Fighter II more than any other SF
title to date), don't expect too much from this title in regards to story,
and you'll know what to expect if you've every even glanced at someone else playing a Street
Fighter game.

Like any other Fighting Game, it will take time and dedication to arrive at the
same level as others you might come across online, but at the end of the day the rewards
greatly outweigh the effort you'd put into the game.

If you like Fighting Games at all, PICK THIS UP.

Maybe when it's on Sale, though. I know the struggle.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
I hate this game so much, but I can't stop playing.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
As an avid Street Fighter 4 player, I consider this game to be one of the best fighting games currently available.  Not only the character roster great, comprised of 30+ old and new fighters from the series to date, but so is the sophisticated combo system that is both easy to pick up yet difficult to master.  I wasnt particularly a fan of SF4s visual style and initially reluctant to try the game because of it, yet Ive grown to appreciate the unique look and feel of each characters and stages that the developers faithfully recreated in this title.

Like many similar games in the genre, SSF4 was initially released on console systems and then ported over to PC.  Luckily, the developer Capcom has done an amazing job, implementing number of customization options for PC, such as support for greater than 30fps and multiple resolutions including 1080p.  In addition, the game also supports many controllers out of the box including XBOX 360 controller and numerous fightsticks.  Outside of Games for Windows Live, game runs smoothly and the loading time is relatively short, so there isnt much for me to complain about this quality port.

Although brief single player portion of the game is quite good, the multiplayer is where this game truly shines.  Thanks to its improved netcode, finding multiplayer matches are quick and reliable.  Built-in match setups work consistently for the most part and despite it missing my favorite championship mode from a previous title, both ranked and endless mode keep the game interesting and fun.  I really like the replay / save feature as well, which helped me to capture and savor those favorite character match ups over the years.

Super Street Fighter 4 definitely isnt perfect and the game isnt groundbreaking enough to likely persuade those of you who arent interested in fighting games.  If you hold even a little preference over the genre though, this is good as any place to start.  I wholeheartedly recommend this to both casual onlookers and fighting game fans.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Ultra Steet Fighter IV is an update for the original Street Fighter IV which was released in 2008. Believe it or not, but this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise.  This game is a standalone product too, allowing you to just purchase this definitive edition.

This update brings the total number of playable characters up to forty four - each of the characters also has a different version of them selves, meaning you have in effect eighty eighty different characters to play as. Street Fighter IV has one of the best combo systems I have played with, much better than the combo system in Mortal Kombat X to say the least. You can easily view the combos for your character on the pause menu, meaning you can learn them on the fly,

The graphics are really quite nice too, it shows a cartoony style art much like the previous games, but with a more polished and finished look to it. All of the special moves and combos each have their own animation, as well as special effects, making this a really good looking game to look at whilst spectating.

Each of the characters in Ultra Street Fighter have their own story line, so with 44 different characters, that is a lot of story to include! I was quite surprised at this amount given the very linear style of fighting games I have played in the past. Obviously some of the stories are more in depth than others, but each of them give you a good amount of content to see.

I only managed to play this game on Easy mode, and even then, on some of the latter stages to the arcade mode, I was struggling. I would hate to see how devastatingly hard the normal and hard modes are, because I was having to retry plenty of times before being able to beat some stages. That being said, this is the sort of game that you will just get better at with practice, you won't be pulling off massive combos to start with (unless you are highly experienced with this genre) so it will take some time before getting right up to speed.

I have completed four characters arcade mode, meaning I have another forty left to go, this has taken me just over two hours to do, so there is a heck of a lot of content on show here, and that is just the single player. Ultra Street Fighter also has a local and online multiplayer too which will really wrack up your hours with ease.

I had one technical issue whilst playing, I for the life of me could not get the game to run in 1920 x 1080 AND full-screen. Not sure whether this is intentional of a bug with my game. It runs fine in that resolution and windows mode though. That being said, you probably won't notice it too much given the amount of time you actually get to look at anything else whilst playing.

I can easily recommend Ultra Street Fighter IV, even though this was my first experience with the Street Fighter franchise, it really does a good job of introducing you to this style of game and giving you hours and hours of content too. To buy this game from scratch, the 22,99 price tag is easily justified with the quality and quantity of gameplay on offer.

Tom's Score Card
1) Stay away
2) Only recommended when on sale
3) Recommended
4) Highly recommended
5) This is a must play

Ultra Street Fighter IV is not a game for everyone . It is a very hard game. A hundred hours is the basic . Always people say you need to know combos No!
What You Need To Know This Game
+Basic Elements
+Game Systems
+Frames
+Hitbox
+Save/not save combos/moves For example Heavy/Ex Shuryuken is not save
What i like in ultra street fighter 4 is W-Ultra is the big standout here, giving you access to both of your characters ultra combos instead of one or the other.
Neither will do as much damage, but the utility it provides is almost irresistible for characters like Dudley for instance, whose Ultra 1
against those whos like to throwing Hadouken's but his Ultra 2 when making combos at the corner almost at the end need make ex machine gun blow C.HK Ultra 2
very useful to It's a great additional tactical consideration that adds dimension to many formerly stale matchup consideration.
Red-Focus-Attack on the other hand, are a little more situational in application With multiple hits and more combos.
The most changed is blanace like increased damage reducing and fixing .
For instance Ken's Shinruyken non animated version is now increased and Cammy and Fei long was reduced damage But Rufus Messiah Kick And Chun li Ultra 1 now is fix it and others.

Online/Gameplay
Steam version was with problems connection .Even when my opponent's connection quality is green, one out of every six even with even ,with green bars was bad but now after patches works good.
Online is pretty funny endless mode you can meet strange people you playing too good you kick it you playing bad kick 0pp/bb deafet opponent with more then 1kpp/bb kick it even .
I remember my first matches First Match-Lost Second-Rage quiter Third-Lost Forth-Rage Quiter and circle gose again i won after after twenty times by cause to many rage quiters sometimes even i quting matches:D
after more hours in rankeds i win againts high rank player sometimes but even opponet wanna rematch when i lost match reamtch beggins i got the advantage almost at the win opponent The Player Has Left The Session almost everytime
.I saw there almost at the win rage quit's almost everytime even i saw on steam community screnshots/youtube video's i saw how low pp/bb almost deafet opponent with high pp/bb
The Player Has Left The Session :D.
What really my friends/people thinks this game is so easy some of them say this is mash buttons this is not hard and not competitive this game not popular bla bla bla bla hater gonna hate talking bull  :@ :@ :D :D.
I have friend whos always say it this game so easy has no skill and i can take 50 win streak is not hard even more than 50 win streak this game is not so hard.
My friend try this game on free weekend about Jul 16 and after first match his got rekt so hard and say this game not blanaced i get only strong players is not impassible to make combos
talking nonsense about this game when it is crap but for me and others this game is not crap is so funny :D :D.

The Final Review For Ultra Street Fighter 4
9-10 Very Good
Ture competitive game with real hard gameplay what people say about this game this game is so easy  don't lising to those people

Ultra Street Fighter IV
While the game itself is quite good as far as fighting games go, the PC version suffers from horrible network performance. Also some of the new characters are a bit buggy. I wouldn't recommend it on PC until it has been sufficiently patched.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Capcom still doesn't know how your ing PC works, news at 11

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Still better than Street fighter 5

Ultra Street Fighter IV
No longer properly functions online after GFWL removal
The game breaks into bouts of pasuing and stuttering stating it's retrying for a connection and sometiems even drops mid-game. This is a massive hazard when making inputs.
Judging from people willingly going for a rematch agaisnt me even after it, it must be the norm and not just me
I did not have this issue even once before steam integration and now it's in nearly every match
I for one would rather not play Super Stutter Fighter IV
Additionally everyone who joins my games is said to be local canadian players but their steam profiles have been in kanji or cyrillic and listed as being from entirely different parts of the world

Ultra Street Fighter IV
If you are going to exclusively play offline, with fight requests off at all times, the game is entirely worth it and I recommend it wholeheartedly. But because I would like to play online and I believe most interested people would as well, right now I cannot recommend this game.

It is a fun game and the community can be really great, but the state of online play is unacceptable and the fixes being released are few, far-between, and are seemingly half-baked and not nearly enough to address its problems and, due to the history of the changes implemented so far, I don't see the online issues being actually fixed soon.

Ultra Street Fighter IV is a great game, but as of mid-October the online portion of it is mostly useless because of bad net code, and it can even affect offline elements of the game if you have incoming fight requests on while playing offline.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
The best fighting game in the last few years, it offers an addictive and engrossing experience. To master each character you will need to spend some time tinkering with each moveset, but once that character clicks in your mind (and fingers :D) it is a blast.

If you decide to go online after practising with your favourite chars, you will find a good range of fighters available in ranked and/or endless lobbies. My favourite way of playing online is to activate in single player the 'fighter request' option, so you can practice with any character against the cpu, honing your skills while you 'receive' requests to fight some real people.

Last but not least, I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone interested in the game to buy a fighting stick, it is essential to master the game. I know they are expensive, but nowadays there is a good range of sticks under 100 that will allow you to feel sharper and precise controls compared to what you can do with a gamepad.

If you are commited to spend some hours with the game, you will experience one of the best fighters ever.

'The answer lies in the heart of battle'

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Since they implemented steamworks the games are far laggier and they pause mid-game with the message Waiting on other player" it's completely un-playable

Ultra Street Fighter IV
I ing hate the people who play this game

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Fantastic game, ashame steamworks had to ruin it for everyone. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I really miss GFWL!
Cons:
Laggy beyond all belief
During said lag it says Waiting for other player, whoever reconnect first gets to attack first while the other player is waiting at his mercy to not land a free ultra/combo.
Can no longer message people, instead forces you to use a mic to communicate with whoever your fighting.
Mic must be either on or off, you can no longer toggle a button to make it active, extremely annoying.
Announcer is annoying as hell and there is no way to turn him off.
Did I mention the lag?
If you bought a dlc pack from someone other than steam your SOL.
Pros:
Can change your name at will whereas with GFWL you had to spend money to do this.
DLC from steam convert over.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
After having this game since release with over 1000 (yea 1000) hours played and at one point being the number 1 ranked guy player on pc in the world it saddens me to say this game is now unplayable. Going from GFWL to Steamworks has made this a laggy terrible game that disconnects CONSTANTLY. It is now absolutely unplayable in online vs. Such a terrible shame to ruin such an amazing game like this.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Optimization and Netcode performance 10/10
would play again while downloadiing

i am not a fighting player at all the only fighting i play and i am super good at is Mortal Kombat series. i got this game from bundle for a really really cheap price then i just wanted to test the netcode and went directly online, well honestly even with red bar connections and me downloading and playing at same time i had no lag at all, the best part is game is not even fps locked like MK. i could reach over 91 fps at a time and have extremely smooth matches online.

instead of wasting your money on netherrealm garbage products just support this game and buy it and gift it to your friends and play together because online WORKS in this game. in MK series there is no online it is just an option which never works...

^ this comment comes from a guy whose life was dedicated to Mortal Kombat and you wouldnt be finding a hardcore MK fan like me, but when the developer has ZERO respect to at least test their product before releasing it on PC after getting $90 for their garbage game (MK X) it can even turn a fanboy to hateboy. i probably start learning SF and play it more i just have to find me favourite character then it is a GO!

Ultra Street Fighter IV
*Has Vs against CPU
*Has Arcade mode
*Online works and has modes you can actually play.
*Has more than 16 characters

10/10 Not Street Fighter V

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Like hard games? This is ing hard.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
The developers don't care about the game anymore and have betrayed their playerbase multiple times. The online mode is a bug- and lag-ridden mess that doesn't uphold to modern fighting game standards.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
its ok

Ultra Street Fighter IV
So it's about a year until Street Fighter V comes out and people who haven't really took Street Fighter seriously are wondering if it's worth the purchase.

The answer is yes.

I've been a complete casual Street Fighter player for years. But gradually over the years I always saw the pros and wonder if I can compete at their same level. Quite honestly anything is possible.. Except in a fighting game you don't rely on what level you are, or what kind of stats and skills determine the outcome of your character. It all boils down to memorization, muscle memory, adaptation. Honestly, the entire point of Street Fighter is the interesting aspect of the mind games between 2 players. It has the ruggedness of not a multiplayer game but some odd form of chess/board game appeal. As I played dozens of hours of this game I seem to realize it really does have a chess-like learning curve to all of these characters. As long as you put forth the effort into learning patterns and the characters mechanics (strength/weakness) and overcome all the mistakes you've been making as a casual player, this is a very rewarding game. Anyways, All I'm saying is if you're looking for a worthwhile fighting game I suggest you pick this up strictly to learn the fundamentals until Street Fighter V comes out. Also, Online play is very habitable. Pick it up before V comes out I promise you.. You won't regret it.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
laggy multiplayer online,
1. should not have been released if it needed a fix as capcom admits
2. fix still not here.
3. bs

Ultra Street Fighter IV
From an outsider's perspective, the differences between Street Fighter 4 and its three existing sequels must look marginal at best. The first game made its console debut back in 2009 and helped revitalise the fighting game genre. Super Street Fighter 4 surfaced a year later and added 10 new characters to the roster, but since then, the game-to-game differences have been tailored more towards the dedicated fans. Ultra Street Fighter 4 continues this tradition with five new characters, a trio of fundamental system changes and not so much as a story mode in sight.

If you're not the kind of player who spends hours learning combos in the training room, discusses the finer points of character match-ups on a regular basis and stays up till the crack of dawn watching the Top 8 duke it out at the yearly Evolution Championship Series, then the Street Fighter 4 series' consistent lack of single-player content will be a tough pill to swallow. But for those who view Street Fighter as a competitive fighting game that only truly makes sense when two minds are trying to outsmart each other, then Ultra can be seen as both curtain call from Capcom and the most substantial sequel since Super.

Of the new talent, Poison stands out as the easiest to get to grips with. Her lingering fireball and feet-first dragon punch mean she shares some shoto fundamentals with Ryu and Ken, but when you also consider her Rekka-like whip special and her command grab Ultra, it's clear that Poison isn't as orthodox as she initially seems. The larger than life Hugo, on the other hand, is about as heavy-handed as a grappler gets. His normal attacks have extremely limited combo potential, but if you can close the distance and land his wall-bouncing command grab, you can inflict severe damage.

New girl Decapre can combo into her air throw from her launcher. She can also use the new EX Red Focus to land an Ultra off her Rapid Dagger special.
If the fighting styles of a pink-haired cross-dresser and a gigantic wrestling simpleton don't sound like your thing, then the other new characters offer something a bit more technical. Elena returns from the Street Fighter 3 series with two far-reaching overhead attacks (must be blocked standing) and one frighteningly quick overhead special that can combo into respectable damage. In comparison, Rolento is more of a hit-and-run-style character with excellent mobility and lots of long-range pokes. He can quickly get out of trouble with his EX roll and his Pariot Sweeper Ultra will combo off anything stronger than a sneeze.

The last character on the guest list stands out for two reasons. Firstly, she wasn't previously playable in Street Fighter X Tekken or any other fighting game; secondly, she's the first new charge character to grace Street Fighter in what seems like forever. Indeed, Decapre may look like just another Shadaloo Doll with similar moves to Cammy, but once you actually take her bladed gauntlets out for a spin, you'll realise that she's fundamentally different. Her variable dash can be cancelled into her slide, dive kick, launcher or even one of two baits, and while most characters tend to have one standout Ultra, Decapre benefits from two.

Choosing which Ultra to incorporate into your game plan has been a core feature of Street Fighter 4 since Super, and now with the advent of the Ultra Combo Double system, you have the option to take both at the cost of raw damage output. Other additions to the core mechanics include the Delay Stand and Red Focus. The former prolongs the time it takes for your character to rise after a hard knockdown and is useful for escaping vortex pressure from the likes of Akuma, Cammy and Ibuki, while the latter lets you absorb any amount of hits in addition to giving just about every character a viable way to combo into their Ultra.

Six new stages have made the journey from Street Fighter X Tekken. That should decrease the odds of getting Volcanic Rim on random.
The fact that there's no way to elegantly highlight the impact of these changes without dipping into fighting game terminology just reinforces who Ultra is aimed at. The same is true of the extensive list of frame data tweaks that have been applied to the existing cast of 39. Evil Ryu has more health, Yun's EX lunge punch is (once again) advantageous on block and dragon punches are no longer safe after focus cancelling forwards. This might not mean a lot to casual players, but if you've invested the time with any one of these characters, then the chance to fight with a heavily revised set of rules is an offer that's hard to refuse.

There's no way of knowing where Ultra will take the competitive scene or how much the changes will affect the overall balancing, but if you feel like going back to the series' roots to see how much damage Vanilla Sagat could achieve off a simple Tiger Uppercut FADC into Ultra (it's over 600), then the new Edition Select has you covered. This isn't the first time that Capcom has put all past versions of each character into one game, but its inclusion suggests that this will be the last chapter in the Street Fighter 4 saga. Plus, there's nothing like picking the definitive version of your character when you're trying to prove a point.

Despite boasting a thriving community that streams regular tournaments and keeps the online competition flowing day and night, the Street Fighter 4 series has always been somewhat lacking when it comes to useful features. Ultra helps to remedy this with the option to record your matches while playing offline and change your button configuration while on the character select screen. Better yet, the Training mode has been expanded with a network simulation tool that lets you mimic input latency and a save state feature that makes practising your setups less time-consuming.

Poison's Ultras basically boil down to a kick in the crotch or a whip-assisted assault on the buttocks. Tough choice
The only feature I couldn't find was a way to reduce Elena's health so I could test out her Healing Ultra, but that's a minor grievance. On the flipside, the new Online Training mode lets you practise against another player without health bar limitations. There's also a revised Team Battle mode that pits two teams of three against each other with a shared health bar that carries over between matches. It feels a bit gimmicky when weighed against the other new features, but at least Capcom has added something that isn't focused purely on the one-on-one experience.

Taken as a package, Ultra is an easy recommendation for players who view Street Fighter as a sport. It offers highly refined gameplay married with a rich art style, and by acknowledging fan feedback in an effort to make a well-rounded game even more polished, Ultra feels like the work of a developer that's content to please its core audience rather than trying to grab everyone else's attention. That's rare, especially from a studio that was responsible for Resident Evil 6.

The only thing that holds this sequel back is the sense that it was made on a fairly tight budget. It's the little things, like the meagre choice of new" characters and the way that some of the new Ultra animations lack the dramatic flair of their predecessors. But with the development team's passion taking up most of the slack

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Problems that need fixing before you consider buying this:

1. Random freezes / lock-ups in game.  Offline or otherwise, not related to netcode.
2. Buggy netcode, frame-skips, lag and poor matching.
3. Players using bots online.
4. Players can disconnect from ranked matches with no consequence denying other players their legitimate wins.

Not recommended at this time.

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Basically the counter-strike of fighting games. (As in skill and practice is rewarding + competitive)
Everyone seems the same until put into play, difference in skill stands out greatly. So much that you can feel when someone is bad. However, equally high-skilled players make for very intense fights.

Has many tactics and mechanics and such which sound complex but become second nature with practice.

Warning: GAME CAN EASILY MAKE YOU RAGE IF YOU'RE BAD, DON'T PLAY IF YOU'RE A BUTTHURT MONKEY WHO CAN'T ADAPT.

Dude...just get it...

Ultra Street Fighter IV
Do not buy this game.
Since the transition from GFWL to Steam the online is broken, matches are very laggy, matchmaking is much slower with many timeouts, and it's generally a very frustrating game, and now today I can't even play online, I get session creation failed" and can't search for games.

Capcom has gone really downhill

Ultra Street Fighter IV
This is absolutely unplayable online. There's amssive lag spikes even on green latency. while waiting for players in training mode there's even random lag spikes. this game garbo, no go

The Old Tree
You can beat the game in 10 minutes, but it is completely free so that is hardly something to complain about (although it would be nice to play more of this). The art is great and the music is relaxing, the puzzles are fairly easy but this game wasn't trying to be Myst.

If you are looking for a short game to pass some time and don't want anything too heavy and complicated this is well worth playing.

The Old Tree
I just really love these interactive experiences...kinda a sucker for em you could say. lol...This is totally worth the short bit out of your time to check this out...Someone worked very hard to create this artistic view of what the first few moments might be like for this little creature...I super enjoyed the creativity of the graphics and the interactions of the character on his little life adventure! :))...Reading another review I do agree that if you have your brightness turned down you will not be able to see very well what you need to do. (I did not have this issue as I prefer my particular settings at the brightest.)...So if you enjoy an artistic point of view, interactive short stories, and something rich in uniqueness and an immersive experience then I highly recommend trying out The Old Tree. *double thumbs up*

The Old Tree
Every once in a while you come across a game that is more than the sum of its parts yet defies traditional definition. Such is the case with The Old Tree, a minimal and simplistic point and click adventure that takes less than a minute to download, less than twenty minutes to complete, and leaves a lasting impression.

The gameplay has you clicking on interactive objects while the camera follows a small squid like alien through several unsettling and atmospheric scenes. You could say this is more interactive art than actual gameplay  it is a little creepy, and the games experimental nature is clear from its opening.

Yet this doesnt detract from the experience. The art is clearly the major draw for this game  and the minimal design aesthetic works well in its favour. There are several small puzzles that work on a light versus darkness factor, and this is usually very easily discovered. There really is no frustration. It feels familiar and yet different.

The sound is also minimal and simplistic, with an unnerving background drone-like soundtrack. It repeats often, but I think this also is to The Old Trees benefit. Im not sure what its trying to accomplish, but I feel urged on to completion and at the same time just slightly rattled.

While there really isnt anything to say for the games replayability or even for the games controls  The Old Tree is an easy recommend. Being available for free helps  but I feel its important to recommend games that are just a little different than the norm. And in that  The Old Tree really works.

7.0/10.

The Old Tree
This is a small, short Flash game that has you guide a cross between an apple, a snail and a squid to its destination.

There are a few of these small free flash games around, most notably Little Wheel"

The Old Tree
Short and very cute point and click adventure game designed in the style of Samorost / Botanicula / Machinarium. If you enjoyed those, then you will probably have a nice time playing this one too. If you have 15 minutes to spare, then try it, since this mini piece of art is definitely worth it!

P.S.: Another game developed by the same people is still in the greenlight phase, you can vote for it here: Tales of Cosmos.

The Old Tree
This review will be incredibly short as there is not much to say about this incredibly short title. So lets get this show on the road.

I'm not really sure what the game is about. You play as this little squid who hatches from an egg and makes his way up on top of a tree.

The game is a point and click game, but you don't move the character. The character moves on his own and you just clear the path so he can continue this journey.

The art style is incredible. It's this games best feature. It's fun to just to look around at the environment.

The game is also incredibly short clocking in at around 15 minutes long, so when you finish it don't expect a second playthrough.

Overall this game is a fun short experience. If you're looking for something while you're bored give this game a shot.

Final Rating:
7/10 - Play It

If you have sixteen minutes to spare and you enjoy a non-challenging point & click adventure then check out The Old Tree.  It's a true free-to-play game where you take the role of a young alien hatchling who is yearning for some adventure.

The Old Tree
Very short and simplistic, with much of the interaction dependent upon clicking on items that you can barely see.  I would have liked to see some actual puzzles and more interaction with our character, but as it is, if you'd like to relax for five to ten minutes, this is a charming way to pass the time.

The Old Tree
While it took me only thirteen minutes to play through The Old Tree, the impact it had on me, my state of mind, and my general outlook on life was greater than that.  I'd say it had an impact of at least a fifteen minute game, maybe even more.

I know the descriptions say its an alien, but I couldn't help but think it looked like an apple, and that it would probably fall pretty close to the tree, because, you know, proverbs.  No, I don't mean like in the bible, I mean in the colloquial homespun wisdom passed down by old people on rocking chairs.  Ever wonder just why these wise old folks are almost always found in rocking chairs?  I do.  I wonder if maybe they're not all that wise after all, if maybe for some reason we are all just programmed to accept anything said by someone in a rocking chair as being wise.  Now that I think about it, my grandmother would sit in her rocker and by golly it seemed like all she could do was spout pearls of wisdom, but I'll tell you this much.  As soon as she got up from that chair, bam, we put her  in a home.  Just kidding about the home, the truth is we had her put down.  Such is the way of our people.

So, yeah. it's well worth the time to play The Old Tree, it is a pretty game, little bit like something Amanita would do, also reminds me of The Plan.  I give it something out of something else.  Whatever, I can't do maths.

The Old Tree
The Old Tree is quite a charming and atmospheric little point and click adventure game. I'm not kidding when I say little either, the entire game took me 8 minutes to complete.
You have to guide a newborn alien(or at least that is what the game description claims it is) to it's end destination mainly by clicking on and elimination obstacles and generally helping it on it's way. The artwork is very subtle and understated not overpowering any scene and creating the right mood to allow the game to shine with it's relaxed slow pace.

If a nice relaxing 10 to 15 minutes of gaming is what you are looking for, then look no further that The Old Tree.

The Old Tree
More proof of concept than game, this short, free little point & click by small hungarian company Red Dwarf Games is a spinoff of their upcoming full release, Tales of Cosmos. You play as, well, probably some sort of small alien baby that wants to go places. Help it by observing the environment, clicking on things, removing obstacles and allowing it to move forward.

Without any explicit story, and with very basic puzzles in the vein of Samorost and Machinarium, there isn't really much that is particularly new or exciting here. None of the puzzles are particularly difficult if you are observative - but there's still a well made guide you can consult if you get stuck. Even so, this 15 minute experience is well designed and evocative, with beautiful art and a nice soundtrack - and if nothing else, it made me curious enough about Tales of Cosmos to download and play its demo. (Something less than an hour worth of puzzle and exploring in space, with some interesting ideas - worth trying out!)

If you have 10 spare minutes, you really have nothing to lose and may gain a few free smiles. Go help the little blob reach the big wide world!

The Old Tree
I did like this; short, sweet and unique, however I recommend raising the brightness on your screen if you have it low like I do because at a few points (particularly the water puzzle) I spent ten minutes clicking wildly everywhere, could see nothing I was actually interacting with and had to look up a walkthrough to see where they clicked to finish the game. Unfortunate when it's just a little game but again, may have been my fault for my screen settings.

The Old Tree
Less of a game and more of a 'mood piece',
the surreal setting was interesting, unpredictable/unexpected and had a somewhat relaxing vibe

Cons
---
The ending was rather anti-climatic

Earlier puzzles were not intuitive - required too much trial and error

Alien creature could've interacted more with the environment

Steam store banner/image did not represent the game well

Pros

The mood & atmosphere

Superior in every aspect to The Plan"

The Old Tree
This game is a tiny little thing, sweet and interesting enough to linger on the palate. It's brilliantly brief. You can play it here, or on the developer's website, and in this and other ways, it's kind of Samorost-y. It should take you 15 minutes or so to finish, though I put in more time than that because I tried playing it at work and ended up having to quit and start over later from home.

Basically, you play as the watcher who makes safe passage for a little hatchling who looks like a cross between an apple and a squidlet. You'll left-click a couple of times on likely spots, and when the coast is clear it will creep along to the next puzzle. There's atmospheric music, seamless execution, and an upbeat finish to this trifle. A properly-calibrated monitor will make this all much easier, since some of the puzzles are in murky dim light.

Totally fun, and made me happy.

The Old Tree
Had a longer campaign than TitanFall

10/10

The Old Tree
An absolutely exemplary instance of free gaming in practice.  Aesthetically gorgeous, genuinely wondrous - my forty-two year old mouth whoa"-ed an awful lot of times during its roughly ten to fifteen minute duration - and extraordinarily intuitive in its mechanics and puzzle-solving.

To all you other wannabe devs putting out short games which are free - or at the very least which SHOULD be free (!) - the benchmark which this incredibly simple yet incredibly beautiful game sets leaves you with NO EXCUSES not to do something of similar quality.  And at the risk of offending some of the parents out there who are no doubt keen to dub this a refreshingly "kid-friendly" Store page

The Old Tree
hmmm....I'm not totally sure what this game was really about, but it was a pleasant and short experience. An alien is born (hatched) and makes his/her/its way through a series of rooms and tunnels, sometimes with the help of a bee (or was it a fly?) on it's way to.....who knows. That isnt disclosed, lol.

Anyway, the puzzles werent challenging, but they were clever nonetheless. The graphics were polished and looked nice, and the representation of the apple/octopus hybrid looking alien was kind of cool. Why there were flies/bees (?), a microscopic robot, and a full sized squirrel/chipmunk/something similar, is beyond me. The reason for the elvators, bike pump and so on were equally mysterious. Nonetheless, it was what I would call a quaint experience. The final moment of the game was also quite nice.

All in all, for a ten minute free game, you probably wont find a better looking game with as good a puzzle mechanic.
I liked it well enough even if I have no idea why it exists or what purpose it truly serves, lol.

8/10

The Old Tree
I thought it was a mutated apple but then it's an alien baby.
I thought it just want to find it way to the top of the tree and get pollen (because the bee/firefly is your friend) but then it just want to find his way out to nowhere.

For 15 minutes, my whole life is a lie.

The Old Tree
Not much to say here...  Very short and it's a bizzare 15 mins.

OverviewGameplay: Artfully done point and click adventure.
Graphics: Great - I loved the art and is really the only reason you should check it out. I hope this dev does more games done in this style... maybe make the next one a little longer, because really, I want to see more!
Sound: Decent... Music is drone-ish and the sound effects blend nicely with it.
Controls: Just point and click - not much more to it.
Replayability: Sadly NONE! You'll play it for 15 - 20 mins and you might be like whoa" for those few mins and you'll unistall it but it's free... so it's worth checking out. You have nothing to lose except 15 - 20 mins which you were going to burn on video games anyways...
Overall: "Worth Checking Out!"[/list][/code]"

The Old Tree
If one is observant enough, they can find many interactive short animations disguised as (Flash) games on the internet. Even Steam has a few, The Old Tree being one of them.

This product follows the journey of a squid-like creature  freshly hatched from its egg  through a series of corridors built into a large tree. While there are a few elements which may be classified as very lightweight puzzles, The Old Tree is more of a 10-15 minute long animated journey than an actual game.
Is the journey worth it at least? If you like silent short animations that rely on their imagination (think of something like a very simple Amanita Design game), then yes, absolutely, itll be a memorable experience that wont even take much of your time.

The Old Tree
Thought the thing was an apple.
10/10

The Old Tree
Another one of the artsy games on Steam. It does this well. Just a warning: contrary to many of the other games on Steam, it's not exciting (it's not supposed to be, so if you're looking for some action-packed adventure, find another game). However, as one who appreciates things like this and further proof that video games are an up-and-coming art medium, it gets a thumbs up from me. :)

The Old Tree
This masterful piece of art is without a doubt a beatiful symbol of the progression through childhood and ascension to adulthood.
The simple yet fascinating puzzles represent real life struggles and challenges that are often difficult in the present but simple in retrospect.
The journey through the phases of life are captured and blended seamlessly through background cues. Recurring themes such as the elevator are likely symbolic of similar real world themes with staying power.
Often times the puzzles result in the destruction of environment in order to progress, akin to the difficult choices we often must make- opportunity cost is not free.
But this game is.

The Old Tree
Super Short but fun and very cute. Some parts can be a little hard to figure out.

The Old Tree
Simple,short,cute point & click game. Simply amazing!

The Old Tree
download ->play 15 minute -> uninstall
Good game but it have a low playable time.
we can only end this game under 15 minutes,
if this game had a more chapter it will be good.

The Old Tree
I got to make soup
10/10 would cook again
but no really I did enjoy this short little game it was fun and simple with a minor challenge.
The look of the game was beautiful to me I guess I just like the general feel of it.
All in all it's a good game I recommend this game.

The Old Tree
Download this? YES!

The Old Tree
It's a cute, short game. I like it. :3

The Old Tree
A little fellow needs your help to reach a certain place. All he needs is ten minutes of your time.
He promises to be quiet, he'll follow your instructions and patiently wait for you to figure out what needs to be done.
You won't have an hard time helping him and there will be music   gentle music   to accompany the journey of you two.

And if you happen to feel sad, this journey will mend some of your wounds.
At least, it did it for me.




The Old Tree
Its not a very long game but its easy to finish with many hidden meanings to the story. It was enjoyable if you're looking for  a quick 15 minute game, more or less in time.

The Old Tree
The Old Tree is a free to play adventure point&click game that is pretty cute and fun to play through. There's no tutorials and it's all up to you to find out how to finish the game, some puzzles were a bit tricky to understand, but overall it's a very easy and short game.

You don't lose anything trying out this game, it's free and it doesn't take any space at all on your PC. So if you like short point&click games, so ahead and play it, it's pretty good!

The Old Tree
short puzzle game with weird but cool art style.
and since its free, definately recommanded.


The Old Tree
A very short game.  Maybe 15 minutes.  But it's free, so who cares?  (I only mention this because I've noticed some people REALLY do care.)

It's fun!  A good style going, appropriate soundtrack, easy but not completely trivial puzzles...  A solid way to pass a bit of time.

The Old Tree
The Old Tree. The game where you play as a green apple with legs. It is the most hardcore puzzle game I have ever played!

No hand holding!

No dialogue to tell you what to do!

No quest objective!

Challenging enemies!

No respawn!

A true next gen experience!

Nah, Im just kidding. But honestly, you are like a green apple with legs o_O Took me 15 minutes to beat this game and I have no clue what I just played. You just got to try it for yourself (recommend)

The Old Tree
Interesting art style.++

The Old Tree
Very nice game worth plying.
And it is free :)

The Old Tree
Cute, simple, free game

The Old Tree
A free, point and click puzzler that can be completed in around 10 minutes.

- Lovely artwork & music.

- Cute character

- No particular story, only one goal which remains ambiguous

Worth a single play through.


The Old Tree
still waiting for a multiplayer version :D

The Old Tree
Cute Game, short. 

Couldn't take screenshots because Steam Overlay was not working.
Tip: Turn off the lights when playing The Old Tree".

The Old Tree
I have bouight multiple copies of Machinarium and Botanicula for my very young grand kids as they love the graphics, the non-narrative format, and the music. The puzzles are secondary to them. I help them complete the puzzles so they can keep the story moving. They love to verbalize their own stories to match the action. It's thrilling for me to listen to their imaginative accounts of what they think is going on in the story.  I have Steam accounts for the three familes and Steam is the perfect vehicle for me to add the games I think they will like and are in the problem-solving, imaginative genre.
I would have paid $10 for The Old Tree, for all three families, so they could have another quality game in their Steam accounts. When I visit the families, instead of a bedtime story, the kids want to huddle together around games like The Old Tree. And so do I. I highly recommend The Old Tree and thank the developers for making it available at no cost but I do think they should charge something for the game.

The Old Tree
A very nicely done short indie game. The artwork alone is worth taking the 20 seconds to download, and less than 15 minutes to complete. Especially when it's a free game.

The Old Tree
While it is not a challenging puzzle game at all, it is very calming and nice to play.

The Old Tree
This is the greatest 10-minute Flash game I have ever played! Definitely 10/10!
In this game you'll lead a small alien baby through different obstacles. I can't tell you more without spoiling your gameplay. I can only say that game controls include just left mousebutton clicks, so don't get confused if you think you end up in a situation without any exit. No more words, just go and play it! :)
Graphics: Very good
Sound: Very good
Idea: Very good
Have fun!

P.S. And I don't mind playing the sequel (if it exists).

The Old Tree
my cute alien octopus child :')

The Old Tree
The Old Tree is an atmospheric puzzle game. As a newly born alien, instinctively walk the strange world that surround you towards an uncertain destination, solving puzzles to continue forward.

Pros: The eerie and the unknown meet with beautifully handdrawn-like graphics and atmospheric music. You have absolutely no idea what you're trying to accomplish, just that you must go on, bypass the obstacles that block you, and proceed. The puzzles are simple, but they are only obvious once you've figured them out. The world feels utterly alien to you, as it would to a new born baby alien. There is no fighting, to violence, no dialog and no age barriers to this game, just the feeling of discovery.

Cons: The game is very, very short, 15 minutes tops. There is no mistake you could make, nothing that would require you to restart, and no progression or branching path that would entitle a form of replay value. Most puzzles involves an extremely obviously click, maybe two.

Verdict:  - It's up to you

This game was made with heart, with care. It's quick, it's free, there is no reason why anyone wouldn't give it a try, if only to see it for themselves. You may think you just wasted 15 minutes, or you may spend the next hour or so pondering its meaning and the undefined mood it left you in. All I can recommend is to just...see for yourself!


This was just my opinion.

If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

The Old Tree
A really short and experimental point and click adventure game but the art,soundtrack and atmosphere are quite good.i enjoyed it. I will check the developers new game Tales of Cosmos" when they will release it."

The Old Tree
I feel like its intended to mean something, but really it's just a 4-legged creature that has telekenesis who can cook.

Good art though and sound effects.

The Old Tree
This is an interesting one.

It's more like an interactive short story than a game" in the traditional sense. You solve some puzzles to help a little blop advance through the story

Rush Bros.
Since playfire rewards made me play this piece of... worthless software again, it reminded me just how terrible this game is, so I thought why not review this and help potential victims avoid it.

If I had to describe this game in one sentence, it would be - demands perfection, doesn't offer precision.

The game tries to be an electro version of super meat boy, and while the music is fine and likable, the controls are just awful, everything feels very stiff, and unresponsive. The levels are by far the worst thing in this game, they are not built for speedrunning or fluent platforming at all, in fact I think they created a set of levels that were perfect for a game of this type, and then they just inverted them totally to make them this bad, they are just atrocious. Also levels sort of react" to the music - traps spring up quicker when faster music is playing... trust me it makes things even worse when you are achievement hunting as the ingame playlist is randomised and you can't lock it to a certain track that would actually allow a human being to beat a level in time for an achievement. Another HUGE minus would be that every time you restart a track

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros Oh my, where to begin.

Its incredibly rare that I come across a game so absolutely, irredeemably awful Im forced to leave it after a mere twenty minutes. Thats a shockingly short amount of time to spend on a video game, free or not. And yet, Rush Bros manages to be that rare kind of awful. I honestly think that the developer was actively trying to scare people away from their game. The menu alone is enough indication of that.

Let me break down the basics of just what exactly Rush Bros is for you. You are one of two Rush Bros, your goal being to get from one end of a 2D level to the other. So, yes, its a platformer. But wait, theres more! The games claim to fame (can we even call it that?) is that your music library (or, if youre too lazy to actually point the game at your music files like me, the set of techno that comes packaged in) determines the way the levels play out and react. Cool, right? Yeah, that sounds great! I get to listen to my music, and it changes how the game works! Wow!

Well, unfortunately, very wrong. This feature is barely used for anything but a spike or two popping up and out of the floor every few beats, or a lever that needs to be pulled on the beat (a mechanic which, by the way, is very poorly explained). Its incredibly lame, and it means that Rush Bros is nothing more than a  platformer with some funky tunes.

Now that weve established Rush Bros is completely devoid of originality, lets talk about the graphics. Theyre bad. And I mean really ing bad. Once again, it manages to be that one breed of terrible that not only assaults your eyes with character animations which look to have been haphazardly assembled in flash by a sixth-grader who just figured out how key-framing and looping works, but it also has the audacity to apply filters to the entire image which, after only five minutes, will leave you with a piercing headache. Think Max Payne 3s most egregious examples of cutscene visual tomfoolery, except constant, always there to taunt your eyes with what could have been clarity instead of a bloom-addled, disco-infused fever dream.

Oh, and of course, the controls. Or rather, what controls? This game has controls? Couldve fooled me, because the first 10 minutes of my time with it was spent trying to figure out why the hell I couldnt move my character around the screen, at all. Well, as it turns out, unlike most other (well put-together) games, Rush Bros completely ignores the fact that youve plugged in a controller when you actually begin playing it (despite the fact it works 100% properly in the menus you use to actually take you to the play portion of the game). Yes, you have to manually bind the controller to the actions you want your character to complete despite the fact it tells you right from the get-go Hey, we made this game for controllers! You should use one! Well, are you sure you made this game for controllers, XYLA Entertainment? Because from where I stand, that really doesnt seem to be the case.

Once you actually get running, it quickly dawns on you that everything about the running, jumping, positioning, and wall-grabbing in this game is completely off. Jumps seem to inconsistently propel you varying distances, movement is so floaty its impossibly difficult to land on a jump pad that takes up nearly 20% of the screen real-estate, and the speed at which your character slides down walls when he grabs them will have you wondering if hes composed of primarily molasses. I cannot tell you how many times in the mere 20 minutes I spent with this steaming turd I died due to the horrific controls.

Oh, and dont even get me started on how hard it is to actually start playing the game in the first place. I still havent been able to figure out how any of it works, since when trying to select the singleplayer stages, I kept getting requests to join the games of others. And you know what, I dont blame those who spammed me with the intrusive offers, either. Hell, Im sure I did the same, because despite the fact that Im very obviously trying to play singleplayer through the singleplayer-labelled Arcade menu option, the game seemed to love pairing me up with total randies from the boundless realm of The Internet. Im still not sure if I managed to get into the singleplayer at all, actually, seeing as how every time I finished a stage the game showed me the statistics of an unnamed, invisible second player who never seemed able to finish the level before me. Or maybe the game was just unable to identify that I was playing alone, which seems far more plausible.

Credit where credits due, the in-game soundtrack (read: not the one you import) is actually pretty good. I enjoyed the techno tunes included, and must admit its mostly because of them I even stuck around long enough to get past the first few levels (which are only about 30 seconds each, by the way). However, whatever algorithm the developer is using to apply the beat to the in-game geometry is flaky at best, since it always seems to speed-up or slow-down completely at random. Hey guys: if the feature youve touted as revolutionary and unbelievably innovative for the platforming scene doesnt even work with the music you tested and included it with, I think there may be an issue somewhere. But hey, Im no programmer, so what do I know right?

To sum things up, this game is awful. Why I even dedicated a whole 1010 words to it is actually beyond even myself. Stay away from it (not that you honestly ever intended to buy it) and spend that cash elsewhere. Im just glad I got this smear for free.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros attempts to marry the minimalistic, highly difficult platforming of games such as Super Meat Boy and I Want To Be The Guy, with the music generating gameplay of Beat Hazard or Audiosurf while putting a heavy focus on multiplayer. Unfortunately it fails abysmally at being comparable in even one of these aspects, with almost every feature going against the basic concepts it tries to establish, resulting in a game that I could barely force myself to play.

The problems with the platforming star with the controls. Your character feels as if he's made of putty, plodding along at anything but a rush and sticking to walls like glue. This is a problem firstly because the entire game is based around speedruns which become almost impossible to pull off when movement is akin to running molasses and are you're character is constantly getting stuck on the environment. Secondly, because the level designs haven't been tweaked to compensate for this slowness, with much faster hazards and gaps that are virtually impossible should you miss a speed or double jump powerup.

On top of being frustrating to navigate, the levels or to be more accurate, tracks are chock full of tedious backtracking which often sends you all the way to the start of the level after you grab a key or open a door. Checkpoints are also a point of contention as there is no rhyme or reason as to their placement or even inclusion. Some tracks feature nearly endless checkpoints before every obstacle, others without a single one to speak of which needless to say vastly changes the difficulty level.

Although it's clearly the main focus, Rush Bros manages to somehow be even worse in multiplayer games do to the completely unbalanced powerups that randomly pop up during play. Once again it goes against the core speedrunner mentality, instead resorting to unnecessary gimmicks that cheapen the thrill of winning a match.

The final aspect is the use of custom soundtracks to change and augment tracks, but it is so inconsequential and often unnoticable that it's hardly worth mentioning. The actual music that is included is of a suitably low quality, and the graphics are incohesive with each background seemingly plucked at random from the user generated reject of other games.

I had high hopes for Rush Bros, and even after playing it feel the concept of a music generated platformer has a lot of potential, but the execution here falls apart with every lazy step it takes. Though it's becoming exceedingly rare for me to play a game where I cannot find even a single redeeming quality to latch onto, but Rush Bros truly does nothing of note and there is no reason I would advise anyone to play it, not even for novelty's sake.

Rush Bros.
Upon starting the full retail version of the game you are greeted with a EULA for what is stated to be the DEMO VERSION of the game that includes some truly pernicious terms of service and also some plainly rude language telling the customer that if you try any funny business you will incur a bunch of legal costs through arbitration, also it is unclear about the scope and nature of the data collection the game will be doing or why a simple platformer needs to store any personal information about me on an out of country server in the first place.

I don't think I have ever seen a EULA that looks quite this bad before. So I was like is it just me

Rush Bros.
The concept intrigued me, but the execution fails like mad in this game, where the order of the day is less on platformer skill and more on memorization - if you do not a) locate and b) precisely follow the 'correct' route every stage, you are not hitting the time trial goals, and if you're not playing to hit the time trial goals, there is, as far as I can tell, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to this game. Aside from playing against a friend (or random people who can drop-in from Steam, which is a decent enough feature), there's really no reward or drive to keep playing that I can tell. All(? there are 47 I want to say) stages are unlocked from the beginning and... I dunno. I wanted this to be good and it let me down.

Rush Bros.
not worth the money for this game. the controls mess up all the time, really difficult and repetive levels. do yourself a favor and buy another musical game is that more fun other than this. this is cancer right here, atleast the music is good. but this is horrible.

Rush Bros.
Avoid this game. Laggy controls and repetitive levels. Do yourself a favour and get a Bit Trip Runner game instead.

Rush Bros.
thank god it was free.

Rush Bros.
Rush Brothers is a side scroller  la Knytt series with a knack for speed and precise platforming, a mix that sometimes performs well, other times lets you wanna throw your controller/keyboard off your room with the whole console or computer.

The game has been marketed as a competitive musically-driven" platformer and I could agree with the former adjective since the Steam multiplayer allows "challengers" to hop in your game and play

Rush Bros.
Pure frustration,good concept but not good enough execution,randomized traps that depends on music without any discernable pattern.

some levels demand perfect execution of moves,irrelevant of traps/music,too bad the controls are not provided for it since it does at best 90% of the commands issued,and that 10 really does matter.

In the end,if it wasn't for playfire I wouldn't even play it again.

Rush Bros.
If Super Meat Boy and Jet Grind Radio had twins, they would be the Rush Bros. This precision platformer starring two feuding brothers doesnt just test your jumping skills, but does so while throwing a ton of bright colors at you and using an awesome soundtrack to make every death seem like a good thing. While you may want to be frustrated as a gamer, as a person, you cant help but be glad since it lets you listen to more music! Its a brilliant way to make a game fun at its most challenging moments.Its classification as a racing/platformer may seem a bit confusing at first, but when you play the game, the term makes a lot of sense. Rush Bros. is a time trial-focused game with a side focus on beating stages with as few deaths as possible. Obstacles in your path arent just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else youll add precious seconds to your time. Its always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so thats never an issue. Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits  so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the games environments, which tend to be bathed in color.

Not a bad game per se, but nothing particularly good about it, either. Platforming is pretty basic, controls seem a bit off, visuals are nice but not really outstanding, being able to use custom music is nice but the stage elements that depend on the music don't always work well with that. This game is bundled often and I'd say go for it in a cheap bundle, but I wouldn't buy it on its own.

Rush Bros.
Music game that has nothing to do with music...
Without power-ups it's unplayable.

Rush Bros.
If Super Meat Boy and Jet Grind Radio had twins, they would be the Rush Bros. This precision platformer starring two feuding brothers doesnt just test your jumping skills, but does so while throwing a ton of bright colors at you and using an awesome soundtrack to make every death seem like a good thing.

While you may want to be frustrated as a gamer, as a person, you cant help but be glad since it lets you listen to more music! Its a brilliant way to make a game fun at its most challenging moments.Its classification as a racing/platformer may seem a bit confusing at first, but when you play the game, the term makes a lot of sense. Rush Bros. is a time trial-focused game with a side focus on beating stages with as few deaths as possible. Obstacles in your path arent just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else youll add precious seconds to your time. Its always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so thats never an issue.

Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits  so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the games environments, which tend to be bathed in color. Beyond the usual things like space-themed and forest backdrops, there are even some with creepy faces all around them. Theres no sense of sameness with the look of levels, and the use of little color trails for power-ups only adds to the visual overload.

I personally loved the game, but WARNING! only play with a controller as it feels alot better and more smooth.

Rush Bros.
Of fun game the music really gets you in the mood to play this worth playing :P you can even import your own songs O.o

Rush Bros.
Not worth $9.99. Anyone interested in this 45-stage obstacle race course game should buy it in the Indie Gala Intersteller bundle for $1 like I did. Not worth a cent more.

Rush Bros.
Basically, the game is simple and based a bit on skill and reflexes. In addition, the music is also not bad but that's a matter of taste. The maps are well designed and the control you get used very easily. Multiplayer, local co-op mode, steam cloud, and controller-support is offered. For 10  a bit expensive but if it is on offer can afford each.
My conclusion: Rush Bros can be a lot of fun, but it is a game which is not too versatile.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros. Is basically what it says in the game desc. A fast pasted platformer. Although I normally avoid platformers because they cause rage most the time to me and others I got this due to me meeting the dev. of this game. He also said there would be a hat with it in tf2 called the fuzzy wub wub that never came out, o well. Anyways this games level design changes with whatever music you put in it, causing some obstacles to move faster or slower depending on what music is playing and when the base drops in the song. Of course like i said that does cause lots of confusion and makes it so you normally die 15~100 times depending on map and if there is a checkpoint system in the map you chose. Luckily deaths are fast and they spare no time throwing you back out there to continue. All in all this game gives you enough fun for its price and its fun to play with friends and share your music with them. I'd give it... 6.75/10 I think. Gives you enough fun for your buck. (I'd recomend getting it while it is on sale during winter or summer. Although it is fun I can't see to many people playing it over 4 hours.)

Awhile back I wrote a review for this game. I thought about it and then I thought, Wow

Rush Bros.
The game is pretty normal and there are many games that are basically the same but the graphics are amazing and the levels designs are pretty sweet . Also , there are some nice musics in the game where you can listen even when you are not playing the game . If you like those type of relaxation game , this is one of those game but i suggest buying it during discount as the regular price is a bit high .

Save your money. Controls are terrible and the gameplay is boring. If I got this for free, I'd feel overcharged.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros is a pretty addicting race platformer, which lets you race against friends or other people on the internet. It is challenging, but far from impossible.

First of, this game has a main gimmick: music. You can import your own music into this game or just play one of the music within the game as background music for the stage. The fun thing is that Rush Bros applies your music to the stage. Some obstacles, including spikes and pillars, go along with the beat of your song. That means that it can be used in your advantage or in your disadventage. When you are playing online though, the opponent has his own music, and therefore also his own obstacles.

As I've said before, Rush Bros is a challenging game. But that is mainly for the achievement hunters or the competitive online players. Whenever you die, you respawn just before the point of death. You have infinite lives, so you don't have to worry about dieing. This also goes for online play.

Me, being a speedrunner, absolutely love the stage designs and eventually reach the goal as fast as possible. I myself do not care much for achievements, but it's a nice aim nonetheless.

However, this game is mainly for online play. If you don't have anyone to play with, this game is less fun than it is supposed to be. Also, you might want to use a controller, as it is clearly not made for keyboard use.

Rush bros is a fun and entertaining game, but I would advice buying this game when it is on sale. Otherwise, it is not worth it.

Rush Bros.
Rush Bros is a interesting platformer with a couple of cool concepts. But tries too much by using conflicting concepts. The game would be better as two separate games that only use the concepts that support each other together. Because it tries to be a speedrunner where you can run against each other or alone against time. But also have different styles of level designs almost each level. Most levels you need to backtrack for keys. That's fine but not when you're speed running. The randomness of the level reacting on the music is also goes against the speedrunning. And you have some trail and error dead traps in the level design.

The controls feel a bit off in the beginning and I think it's because of the stickiness when you wallslide. In most games where you can walljump the wallslide is fast but here it's really slow. And it's counter intuitive to the speed running. It's really annoying and I don't get why they made it like this.

I really want this game to live up to it's potential. The music is great and the art style is pretty cool. It just isn't working as a speed running game. If you just play too casually complete the levels it's fine. But the whole racing against each other and time just doesn't work for this game because the developers wanted too much. It could have been an amazing platformer like Super Meat Boy or Electric Super Joy.

Rush Bros.
Godawful piece of  game.
It's super boring.
The music feature makes no sense at all.
There is no purpose.
It's buggy as hell, keep getting stuck.
Lags when loading songs 25%-30% of the time.

Just stay away from this garbage.
You are warned.

Rush Bros.
This game would be awesome . . . if the gameplay follow. When you see graphics, musics, you think of a Meat Boy like game, very fast, you never stop. Here you never stop, but because you feel so slow ! Jump even has a little second before actually seeing the character jumping ! In a game like that, you cannot mess whit the gameplay at this point =/

Rush Bros.
Absolute crap platformer masquerading around as a time-attack super meat boy clone. Moving obstacles change speed depending on whether you're moving or not, and controls are unresponsive, making your character seem sluggish and unpolished. Rush Bros. feels more like a beta release than a full game.

Oh, and who sets online versus mode as the default on first install? (turn Accept Challengers" off to play single-player mode)"

Rush Bros.
After playing the game more to give it further analysis here are my thoughts.

The game is okay" but not worth anything more than $2 because of how boring and stale it feels. It often tries to tote itself as a precision platformer but fails to deliver on adequate platforming. The jumping feels awkwardly clunky and more often than not you will end up falling because it doesn't recognise input for more than 100ms which is unacceptable. The game falls off and the level design is interesting but the platforming mechanics feel weighted and not precise at all. My biggest gripe with the game is that it often tried to get me to play against other players in a race before I have even played a level

Rush Bros.
I like the idea of the game, and there isn't really much else out there specifically designed for head-to-head racing like it is, but I super cannot get into how movement in it feels. The controls are at least consistent, but everything feels weighted and timed wrong to me. I kept going for a while to get used to it, and it did get a little better, but it's more like less wrong at this point, not actually right. The levels I played did seem reasonably well designed for running through them once you get to know them though, and the soundtrack is great, so there's that.

Rush Bros.
We spent 2 hard, long years developing Rush Bros. and our biggest weakness right now is word-of-mouth. We're trying to do everything we can to make Rush Bros. known. It's a hard-core racing game which can be enjoyed by both casual players and dedicated speed-runners. The philosophy behind the game is: Play the way you want to. When you're on a playground you don't normally declare the rules before everyone jumps in a sandbox. By the time you get there somebody is probably already making sande castles. Then somebody screams The Floor is Lava" and things get really interesting. Rush Bros. is themed around this kind of play- this more organic make-up-the-rules-as-you-go-along kind of play. This is a hard concept for some people to understand because it's something more natural / organic and less structured. If anything else Rush Bros. is an experiment with how you can allow your players to design the rules for how the game is played while they are playing it. You choose what levels to play on

Rush Bros.
I'm pretty disappointed.
This game looks and feels like a flash game.
Now, I can get along fine with that, but the problem is that as a platformer, the physics feel like a flash game aswell.
The jumps feel linear and unresponsive, just like a flash game (even when playing with a controller).
Which is the biggest sin for a game like this. Jumping doesn't feel like it should in platformers.

On the plus side, it has great music, but thats about it.


Rush Bros.
Solid platformer with good controls, fun to play while in a Skype call with your opponent. The music in the game's quite good too.

Note: To everyone complaining that the achievements are too hard: they're supposed to be. That's why it's called an achievement, you have to achieve something hard to be rewarded, instead of being spoonfed worthless messages in easy games.

Rush Bros.
The only reason I bother to download and play Rush Bros was to get the achievements. A lot of them seemed simple enough. Finish this level in under a certain amount of time to unlock the achievement and what not. What I didn't realize is that in order to get the achievement, a person would have to be nearly perfect to obtain it which was made difficult by the fact that the obstacles were set to the rhythm of the music in the game making it extremely inconsistent. This made achievement hunting more unbearable and annoyed me to no end when the controls in game were unresponsive at times. If anything, Rush Bros tries to copy Super Meat Boy and the like with a musical element added which ruins the overall gameplay. I'd avoid this title unless you like dubstep or want to give this to someone you want to really annoy.

Overall Score: 3/10

Rush Bros.
Fun at start, but gets boring quickly.

6/10

Rush Bros.
This game is nifty, and can be fun in short bursts, though I can't stand to play it for more than 10 minutes at a time. Might be worth getting while on sale or as a freebie, but I wouldn't bother with full price. It claims to use your own music for gameplay, and in a sense it does, but it only uses it very minimally. I give it a resounding Meh.""

Rush Bros.
Edit from the future: A patch came out that said they've fixed the achievement bugs. I don't want to play this game anymore, but at least they fixed the stability issues that I've complained about in this review.

Original review:

===

First the good stuff: amazing music. I would recommend paying for the OST.

Now for the bad: Its buggy. I have been trying to get the No death" achievement on the "Spikes Everywhere" level. It is hard enough

Rush Bros.
Sorry but no. The level design I found terrific, it's very sonicish"

Rush Bros.
Control of the character is awkward, pace feels slow (in a racing game). Unlink most other custom music rythm hybrids (Audiosurf, Beat Hazard) it doesn't seem to change anything gameplay wise. What you end up with is a mediocre stylized platformer, of which the indie game scene has a nearly infinite supply of.

Rush Bros.
This game seemed like something good on paper, jumping around to music and competing with other players, however about 5 minutes after purchase I realised this game is a bug infested waste of time. It tries to mimic other great platformers however it horribly fails to do so by giving you and un-fun and minimalistic challenge of running across an empty space without power ups only to get a better score than another player. On top of that the game is filled with bugs, I often found myself challenging other players to a race when I clearly selected that I wanted to race alone. This game in a short summary is a waste of money and a big disappointment.

Rush Bros.
if you're looking for a hard super meat boy-like game with decent tracks (some are pretty good) and colorful, well-drawn levels backgrounds , you can give rush bros a try ,
although it has one of the worst things for a platforming game - laggy controls , it still manages to be challenging enough and dare i say satisfying once you master a level and finish it in a new record triggering that achievement notification (managed to get 21 achivements through 3 days for playfire rewards, if i play it more i'm sure i can get at least +40) ,

give it a try if you're into rage, hard games , maybe not with the 10$ price tag so wait for a sale (in case you haven't grabbed it for free at GMG promotion)

Rush Bros.
I would have expected the controls to be better on a game like this.

Pretty good (customizable) music, a good game idea, and a pretty cool art theme unfortunately didn't make up for the controls feeling a little sloppy and haphazard.

Great concept, but the game is pretty unforgiving and frustrating, leaving me unlikely to pick the game up again.

Rush Bros.
The music changes beat too quickly and rapidly, making for good techno music but terrible platforming.

Rush Bros.
The creators of Rush Bros manage to completely miss the basic concepts of their own game, while managing to make it look somewhat pretty and have a good soundtrack. They fail to make the platforming fun or even feel right. It seems like they spent very little time getting the feel for the game correct. The animations are also fairly poor. Even the colorful visuals and music can't make up for it what is really just not a fun game to play. If I paid $10 for this game I would be pretty . In fact, I got this game for free as part of a Play Fire Rewards promotion and technically got paid for it, but I am still not happy with my decision to play this game.

If you want to play a game that does the Racing-Platformer concept correctly, I would suggest SpeedRunners.

Rush Bros.
I saw many videos and trailers of this gmae and thought hell yeah

Rush Bros.
I really, really tried to like this game. The idea of a platformer that you play to your music sounds good on paper, but I feel that Rush Bros. doesn't deliver on it's cool-sounding concept. If a game has the option to play with my music more often than not I will choose to do so. In Rush Bros. however, unless you're playing anything other than electro house you're probably going to have a hard time moving through a level since obstacles will either focus on A) the back beat B) the vocals or C) some other element to the song that isn't made readily apparent to you. This results in either trying the level with a different song or the default music (which works fine, btw) and I feel that's very poor design on the developer's part. Speaking of poor design, some of the levels in this game are just terrible. This game excells when you're going fast and dodging obstacles and there are quite a few levels where you are put in a maze and have to find keys to progress almost in a puzzle-platform kinda way. Being forced to slow down and think your way through a level wouldn't be so bad if the wall jumping didn't feel as sticky as it does, which sucks since in the puzzle levels there are tons of walls for you to stick to for whatever reason. Again, I really wanted to like this game but some of the core parts of this game just don't click with me.

Rush Bros.
The MOST IMPORTANT thing in a game like this is how responsive the controls are. The nput lag just kills any chance of this game being fun.

Rush Bros.
Avoid it! i took it free from GMG and at least got 3 cards, LOL

Rush Bros.
Horrible game, probably one of  the worst platformers I've ever played and that's saying something. even though I got it for free, I feel scammed by the low quality it presents, the controls are quite clumsy as hell and the background music ends up being monotonous and boring incredibly fast. Don't waste your money or your time here, do yourself a favor and get super meat boy instead of this crap. completely unfun.

Rush Bros.
Honestly Rush Bros. looked really promissing when I saw the trailer and I was really excited to play it but after getting my hands on it I can safely say that pretty much the only thing the game has going for it is the soundtrack and even that may not appeal to some people. Visuals, level design and animation quality is something to be desirable on Rush Bros and story is pretty much non existent. The game might be fun if you play with someone else but playing it alone, as I did, will probably be a waste of your time. Even if you're a fan of platformers I doubt that you'll have fun with this one on yourself, playing with a friend might give you somewhat a good time and probably some giggling when someone dies but I honestly don't recommend Rush Bros. in any circunstances.

Why So Evil
I've played some ridiculously hard games in my time, but none with controls that feel luck-based, obstacles in almost every level that can either desync or become luck-based to dodge. One of the most amazing things about this game is that I'm at Level 49/50 on Practice Mode with around 2794 deaths. Why on practice mode you may ask? Well if I wasn't I'd probably have 10000-100000 deaths, because everytime you die in the other modes you get sent back to Level 1 and there's some ridiculous level design in this game and you will always be fighting the controls. The graphics are awful maybe just barely hitting the PSX mark and with bare bones textures at that. Nothing in this game looks visually appealing in anyway shape or form and it's using a barebones Unity Engine that doesn't even work properly. I literally think with all this it's pretty much impossible to beat the game on anything other than Practice Mode. For anyone curious where I gave up or why I gave up  here you go:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87l9Eisr5t4

Why So Evil
Why We Can't Have Nice Things, or Tragedy of the Commons: Steam Edition

When Why So Evil was on Steam Greenlight, I voiced my concerns politely, but clearly. The developers did little to assuage my concerns, but I am nothing if not forgiving, so I decided to pick this title up and give it a fair shake. This game goes to show exactly what purpose Steam Greenlight served, because now that the gate has been torn asunder and the guardian slain, all manner of hellspawn issueth. And I don't mean in a good way.

This game has a 3D take on the Super Meat Boy style of challenge: unforgiving difficulty with unrelenting learning curve. I ended my first playthrough at Level 9, and I feel like, even in my short time with the game, I got a fair feel for how I'm going to like it long term.

First, the good: The designers show a good head for iteration. Each level (from 1 to 9 admittedly) showed decent improvement challenge-wise from the last. The game was, indeed, challenging, but with a game like this, being unable to beat it is not a fair argument for it being TOO challenging. For now, I will say that I got to level 9, and that level was too frustrating for me to beat at this time.

Now, the bad. The user interface on this game is bare bones, to say the least. Think Air Control"

Why So Evil
Clearly a first attempt at making a videogame.  This looks like someone's homework.

Why So Evil
Well, that's a very simplistic game idea with messed up controls making it very hard. No idea why they called it 'Why So Evil' instead it should be 'Why Bother At All'.

Why So Evil
Another game that claims to be incredibly difficult, but instead just has poor controls.

I got to wave 27, I'd highly suggest staying away from this game unless you are a ego maniac.

Why So Evil
I got this game for free.
I want my free back.



Why So Evil
More words below, but a simple list first:
-Bad controls
-Bad game design
-Bad UI
-Bad textures
-One looping song (at least untill level 30ish)
-Game breaking bugs in some levels (granted some of them will actually help you)
-Holding a direction while dieing will cause you to have to let go and then repress to start moving again... with instant respawns, this can kill you again.
+The concept behind it could have worked, if more time and effort was used.
+A toaster could probably run it, if you set the graphics to the lowest.

Probably the biggest issue at hand is the whole, you are a box. This makes movement extremely luck based, due to your edges causing you to ricochet in random directions. You basically have two control schemes, one for if your corner is facing the way you intend to move, and the other for your face. If you are moving with your face first, you will roll your box, which causes a ton of rng for exactly where you will go. If you move with your corner first, you kinda just slide in that general direction.

There are also plenty of bugs and bad texture mapping randomly throughout, though you probably will quit before encountering too many. The most noticeable bug is the fact you can climb up over some walls or moving objects if you hit it just right, which happens more often than not. Alas, other moving enemies can also utilize this (e.g. a chaser" type of enemy climbing over locked doors before you even open them).

It is evil how bad this game is, but then again, Steam trading cards worth more than the game are lovely (   )

Why So Evil
Well, it is evil, if evil is defined as annoying.  It is clumsy to play, tedious to beat, and has some annoying tricks that are played on you.  I played about 30 minutes and got through many levels with tons of deaths.  Then I just let it run to get the cards as I was not enjoying it at all.

Got this in a bundle, for about 35c and did play about 30 minutes, which exceeds my US$1/hr threshold.  I wouldn't recommend it at full price.  The cards are worth about 32-36c so it was a free game basically.

Bundle (<50c) - recommend 5.01/10 for the cards
Full price - no way  2/10

Why So Evil
Very often Ive asked myself why I have such an addiction to rage games. I suppose because being challenged to a point of frustration by a video game leads to a greater sense of accomplishment when you are finally able to conquer it. Its also what attracts me to rogue-likes. When its always do or die, you need to be in top form in order to even get close to the finish. Why So Evil? wants to be both of these, but ends up coming close to neither. The game opens to a startup launcher that allows you to pick your resolution/graphics, a windowed checkbox, and a controls tab. The launcher is my favorite part of this game. Almost nothing in the game feels as well made as the launcher. I could end the review there, but my masochism wont let me, so lets look at this game a bit more in-depth, and ask ourselves the question, Why So Awful?

The game is launched without a menu. No tutorial, no further options, just a room with a green cube, a blue cube, a bouncing red cube, and a horrible-looking default Unity UI. Now, I understand the difference between a AAA title and something from an indie studio But to leave the default buttons and text on a UI that cant be turned off? Pure laziness. Anyways, WASD appears on the screen, and you will find that you are the green cube. If you are intuitive, you will avoid the red cube and head towards the blue. If youre curious you will test the red one. This sends you back to stage one. Which you were already on. Okay, no harm, no foul. We now know that red cubes can kill us. So you roll past the red cube, everything lights on fire (Which, for a game that touts its realistic weather effects, look exceptionally unfinished) and in that horrible default text it asks Are You Ready For Hell? Whereupon touching the blue cube, you will be forced to complete the first stage for a third time. Leading me to believe that the blue cube isnt my friend at all. Everything in this game seems to kill me, lets be smart, shut it off, 3evil5me. Am I ready for hell? Probably. But that still didnt prepare me for this game.

The first few stages arent really hard, the hardest thing about them being getting used to the wonky physics of this game. Sometimes moving left or right will cause you to roll, but it usually doesnt This leads to a game that feels clunky and cumbersome instead of the death-defying action game it advertises itself as. Around level five or six, the game will start punishing you for making it to new levels. Youre placed in a big blank level, with the exit nowhere in sight, and suddenly platforms start flying every which way to knock you off the edge If it were a well made game, you might be able to roll toward the edge of the platform and save yourself. Instead, youll usually end up stuck inside of it and swept off the edge. Then you get to go back to level one again, and play through 20 stages, all so you can get a few more seconds learning which way the platforms come from on that last stage you died at. Are we having fun yet? Yaaawn. This is simply a glorified memorization game, and I understand it calls itself evil, but I think the most evil thing about this game is its lack of effort.

Even if you can undergo the kind of repetition that Why So Evil? will force upon you, you will inevitably ask yourself Why? There is no sense of progression Theres no sense of enjoyment. Theres no sense of accomplishment. The only thing this game was able to deliver was artificial difficulty, and monotony. I think I gave this game a fair shake. Its not as if I dislike this sort of game, I raved to my friends about EDGE. But this lacks any of the inspiration EDGE had. It physically pained me to see that they thought this game was good enough to not require any updating (as stated on their store page), because in order for this game to be worth any amount of money it will require quite an overhaul. It isnt all doom and gloom though, some of the weather effects are done quite well Well, the rain looks good at least. The soundtrack might also be enjoyable for some people too, if you enjoy techno or house. Also on a positive note, most things about the game are passable, and the level designs that arent unfair can sometimes be quite clever, but to me it isnt worth the pain because there is no reward except for more pain. If you need to fulfill some masochistic tendencies, pick this game up Otherwise, buggy physics and unfair level design will drive you off the deep end.

Summary: A neverending masochistic adventure that tests the limits of human endurance.

Final Score: 4/10 for weather and soundtrack. Could be brought up to 8/10 with major physics/level design overhauls.

Why So Evil
This game should have been called Why so ""

Why So Evil
You play as a cube and you try to tumble through a bunch of different puzzles.  There's really nothing wrong with it, but at the same time, there's really not much reason to keep playing.  There's nothing to really change up the gameplay.  Each puzzle is a bit different, but they seem very repetitive.  The developer seemed to make a basic game mechanic and did nothing else.  It's essentially a bare minimum game, and there's not much satisfaction in completing it.

Why So Evil
I just can't recommend it.
Frustrating (but not challenging!), poor hit-detection (not even touching the hazard but die), lame design + traps and sometimes strange physics (sliding box), high system requirement for such game...

If you really want it, get it from bundle or wait for 75-90% sale. I bought mine on 75% sale for 1.
But instead of this, check out Lost Marbles, Puzzle Dimension or Spectraball.
Or Super Meat Boy! Those are awesome games!

p.s: You want a really evil game? Check Syobon Action! (Cat Mario)

Why So Evil
Almost four hours of idle for 4 miserable Steam trading cards...

Why So Evil?""

Why So Evil
If this was a traning demo for Unity it would be considered incomplete - as a game it's worse than that

Why So Evil
I got this game for free.
I want my free back.

Why So Evil
Default Unity menu, streched rock textures for walls"

Why So Evil
I don't like to leave negative reviews. I know someone put time and effort into this and takes pride in it... but they shouldn't.
This game is awful.
-It's ugly
-The controls are clunky
-The movement is clunky
-The interface is lazy
-The level reset when you die is boringly simple
-The challenge" isn't in the gameplay

Why So Evil
Go from A to B avoiding obstacles. Thats all.

So unless it is a bundle... Dont bother.

Why So Evil
you need ASAP change the game name to Why so laggy.
not worth with the price

Why So Evil
Why sio evil?" That's what I asked my friend when he made me play this game.

It's awful

Why So Evil
It's a simple physics puzzle game where you play a cube and you're trying to cross a field filled with obstacles to get to another cube.

Why So Evil
Pros :
Trading Cards

Tutorial how to play this game : Download it, get cards, delete it.

Why So Evil
Not that cool. You're a cube and you hit another cube while avoiding things. Not that cool.

Why So Evil
Do you know the old flash game the worlds hardest game" by armor games? Yeah this is a blatant ripoff in source engine with a cube as movable object. The levels are created without love and thought

Why So Evil
Really bad controls are the only reason this game is hard". I had 32 deaths and got to level 26 in my one and only session

Why So Evil
It's not that really a bad game, it's simple and plain and challenging because there is no checkpoints in the levels and it can get quite complex futher down the line.

 I do not recommend using keyboard controll because it's so terrible, so i prefer a controller.
 Should buy this in Sale/Discounted.

Should suggest they add achievements and workshop.

Why So Evil
!! cubical Hell !!

Why So Evil
A friend of mine gave me this game as a gift, im gonna sue him.

Why So Evil
I got this game on a 97% sale (including the second one), so i can't even regret it. I'm in lvl 39 so I can point it's main flaws:
-Ugly HUD (Unity default HUD, they didn't even bothered to change it)
-You can't move the camera, that's really annoying.
-2 players mode is completly useless since you lose if just one of the players dies.
-IT'S A CUBE!: it's difficult to control and sometimes you have to rely on luck. A sphere would make the game much better, not easier, but enjoyable.
As you can see from my play time it's not THAT bad but isn't worthy the full price.

Why So Evil
Rather boring in all honestly...

Its not really a game..
More of a standard physics test someone new to coding would make...

Why So Evil
Game developers need to understand that terrible controls don't make a game hard, they just make it bad. This game is a waste of time and energy, not to mention money.

Why So Evil
Em, WTF?

No, no, no.. This game is horrible. Gaben, why? ;-;

1/10

Why So Evil
This (not-so-realistic) physics-based puzzle arcade of rolling a dice towards his mate thru mean environment. Will put yr nerves to test, if you dont ragequit at 20+lvl you might as well successfully apply to zenmastery black belt or work as an electroshock dummy at torture museum.

Why So Evil
first i dont wanted to write a review because there are already enough, but this game is so bad that it hurts!

Why So Evil
Its not that bad, its just not worth anything above $0.0099

Why So Evil
At this point it's clear for me that this game should be published for free. I understand that somebody put a lot of effort into releasing this product, but it looks like it was an alpha release. Simply, good things in this game are so scarce that I cannot recommend it.

Why So Evil
I think in some ways this review goes out to the people who made the Unity engine.  They made it very easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things, and the people at Valve gave them an outlet to thrust mediocre things to millions of people who frankly deserve better.

In this case, Why So Evil" is a very poor puzzler/timed obstacle game with really terrible highschool student graphics and an even less imaginative premise.   Roll the green cube to the cyan cube

Why So Evil
It's a rage game.

Simple graphics, repetitive soundtrack, and levels designed to annoy you.

But it's a well crafted rage game. If you like things like Kaizo Mario, Why So Evil will be right up your alley.
If not, skip it.

Why So Evil
It is a bit challenging and some can have fun with it. I only recommend it with a big sale
the game is not pretty and sometimes it is a bit sloopy, but, well, it is playable

Why So Evil
Very evil game. Don't be fooled by reviews, it has good controls. Everyone's just butthurt from the fact you're moving a cube. If you're going to play expect tons of changes mid-game and try to expect the cube going crazy if you have it propped up at one of its corners. Although there's no intro, I found that you control a green cube that you move to avoid red cubes and any other obstacles to reach a blue cube. Very short game though.

Why So Evil
This is a far better simulator of the unfairness of life than Call of Duty will ever be.

Why So Evil
This game could be fun if it was a top-down view and if the controls weren't terrible.  I have 1 good thing to say about this: this is the same dev who made the depressingly bad Zatwor series and this is slightly better, but it still sucks donkey .

Hitman Movie/10

Why So Evil
Borring lazy poorly made game where you get the bonus points for ramming against the wall a few times to get over it.
3d is lazy, objects overlap wrong. Lack of dept of the objects. Poorly made hitboxes. Poor physics.
Give me my money back.

Yes it's sorta challenging. Yes it made me go oh come on" a few times. But it's not worth a penny to be honest. You can find much more elaborate games online for free.  This one is not even worth the time."

I like this game. I've played it a lot.

I had it for about 7 years before I had it on steam.

Peggle Deluxe
Its like plinko on shrooms.

Peggle Deluxe
This is entirely addictive. 4 hours flies past like nothing. Can't sleep. Must Peggle.

Peggle Deluxe
This one is the perfect game to kill time when you have 5-10 minutes free. I really like the concept of this game, it's fast, simple, yet extremely fun. You can try hard or just chill and play, launch it and then relax, your moves takes only a click. Good job Popcat.

Peggle Deluxe
Wow!, what a colorful and  addicting game this is.  When I first played Peggle several years ago it took me back to the old arcade  games I used to play when I was a kid, standing on the pier spending all of my  money on those machines.  That game was called  Pachinko,  (where you send a metal ball bearing spinning around a series of peg like mazes, trying to  get your ball to drop into various cup like  recepticles on the board)  and it is  still all the rage  over in Japan where  whole arcades are devoted to the game.

Peggle has become one of   my favorite 'short term'  arcade games of the last decade barring Ricochet Infinity and Gish.  What I mean by short term, is the ability to play  for  just a few moments in between other games, or when  on a coffee break from more important  things.     With Peggle,  you have to  attempt to knock out all the orange pegs  from  various arrays of  blue and orange pegs  (55 levels in the adventure mode)  using a ball launcher/cannon  that fires a ball from the top of the  game board.  You get 10 balls  to clear the board of the orange pegs.  If you can clear the whole board of both orange and blue pegs plus any special pegs,  you get  extra bonus points.  There's a bucket like object that is constantly on the move at the bottom of the board.  If your ball falls into this you get your ball back which in turn makes it easier to complete the  round. There's also  more points gained depending where your ball finally comes to rest, with a jackpot score of 50K  from the central well, 25K from the two adjacent wells and 5K from the outer wells.  The first time  you fail to hit any pegs  you will get your ball back, but this only happens once on each board.  Each new board includes two green pegs that give you one of several special powers when you clear them away.  These can  help you clear  the orange pegs away easier, for example  you may get   a double ball that enables yopu to clear away  a lot more  pegs, especially if you get it early on in the level (as more pegs get in the way), or extend the length of the ball catcher to give you a greater chance of catching the ball and getting it returned to the ball launcher or  a marker that shows you where your ball will bounce.  Some of the powers come into effect immediately (like the double ball which only lasts for that turn) or on the next turm that last for the next three turns; (the latter power is very useful for  aiming your ball for maximum effect).  Each of these specials  continues through several levels before changing to a new power, that are introduced   via Peggle Masters.   There's also a purple  peg that when hit  gives you bonus points.  Each time you flick a new ball, the  purple peg changes position.  Scoring over 250 000 on one board  gains you an extra ball as well.

There's four different modes included with the PC version, Adventure mode with 55 levels spread over  10 stages,  quick play, which allows you to play any  board you've already unlocked, duel that  allows you to play against either the computer or a friend (with the X-Box version you can play online against up to 4 players) and finally theres the challenge mode, which has 75 harder levels and is locked until you've completed the adventure mode.

There's two different  versions of the game available on Steam,  Peggle Deluxe and Peggle Nights, both of which are well worth buying if you  like arcade games.  Sadly there's no  level editor, but Steam do have a free version  Called Peggle Extreme that features   levels dedicated to Half-Life 2, Portal and Team Fortress.  There's only  ten levels with one special (also known as Peggle Masters), and five Challenge levels, but it's enough to gives you   an introduction to the game.  It's more like a demo, but is different to  the two commercial versions, so is worth getting if you  like the game.   I think they also made a second free themed  version that's not available on steam, but I've forgotten what the theme was.

The beauty of this game for me is that it never gets boring.  The levels are  vibrant and  enjoyable to play;  each time I replay the adventure mode or replay  levels via the quick play  mode   the game is  never the same and it's great  playing against friends or family, sadly it's only local play on the same computer and you share  the 10 balls.  If you play against the computer  you can select one of four difficulty modes.

The game is  only 4.99 on steam  in the UK  or $4.99 in the US (it's cheaper to get a freind in the US to buy it for you if you live in Europe).  I oriignally paid $20 for each version   via Reflexive Arcade when it was first released seven years ago.

You can see a video speed run of the whole game HERE  (it's 2hr 14mins in length), which gives you the opportunity to skip ahead and check out all of the various levels available in the deluxe version  or you can check out the free Peggle Extreme version HERE

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle is a fun casual game. It's very straightforward. Aim for the orange pegs. Hit the green ones to get various power ups that change every few levels. The power ups are all very different and keep things interesting. Some are not as useful as others like the lobster claw flippers. Each power up makes you think differently about how to approach a level.

As straightforward as the gameplay is, Peggle isn't simple. You only have 10 moves to clear all the orange pegs and it's difficult to predict just where your ball may bounce at times. Most of the time the results are what you aim for, but sometimes the judging an angle slightly wrong can turn into a wasted ball. Other times, you might just get a layout that works against you. While the design is always the same, the placement of orange pegs varies. But that's the challenge of Peggle.

There are 55 levels in the game, so plenty to play through. You can always replay levels of your choice later outside of story mode to try your hand at clearing the entire playing field of all blocks.

I wouldn't really consider Peggle a largely re-playable game. I played through story mode twice on a non-Steam version of the game, and playing through again on Steam didn't really hold my interest. But I would definitely consider this a great game for at least one or two playthroughs that is worth it's price point.

The only negative aspect of this game is the resolution, which is low and doesn't stretch to fit widescreen monitors.

Peggle Deluxe
Do you like Diehard?

If so every time you finish a level its like receiving a High Five from Alan Rickman.

10/10 Would High Five Alan Rickman again.

Oh and something about pegs.

Peggle Deluxe
I played this game to 100% completion in college. My laptop then died and lost all my local content. I replayed it to 100% completion again. I then bought it on Xbox 360 and completed just the story then. I then bought an Xbox One with the main purpose of playing Peggle 2.

Peggle Deluxe is very good.

It's nice to play Peggle anytime. You can play it as a quick break. You can play it while watching tv that doesn't require total focus (sports). You can play it while listening to podcasts.

Play Peggle. Join us.

My friend bought me this game as a joke.
I now have a shrine for our true lord Bjorn.
10/10 would shoot ball again

Peggle Deluxe
Who would of thought that hitting pegs would be fun?. Well it is. Especially when you unlock all the characters and get the different power-ups they possess. Cool.

Peggle Deluxe
It's fun I played a bit.

Peggle Deluxe
Are you looking for a game that offers the same play style as Call of Duty? - Well champ, Peggle Deluxe is the game that offers this one of a kind experience.

The game begins off with a cut-scene of a character named 'Peggle' starting his or her own tour of duty. Yes, this is game is exactly like Call of Duty: Ghosts where you are able to make your character male or female. I must assure you that if you do not play as the female, you will not get the benefits of being a grill gamer. However, if you do not mind what sex you are, then you'll enjoy the game regardless of the limitations that is given to you when you're handicap. (i.e. Not a female or grill gamer)

As you adventure more into Peggle Deluxe

Peggle Deluxe
You shoot balls and rainbows happen.

5min of this game (all character powers)
https://youtu.be/NADS7LWfcbs

This is a take on pachinko an Asian gambling game but in here your just trying to hit all the orange blocks.
This game has 10 parts with 5 levels each = 50 boards in all.
Each of 10 character has a special power that activates when you hit a green block.
Then pink blocks boost your points. points will fill a bar each time you release the ball and you'll get a Extra every time you fill it but it resets on each launch.
There is a basket on the bottom that moves back and forth and if you can get the ball in here you won't lose it.
The game end when all orange blocks are hit or you lose all your balls.

Peggle Deluxe
Incredible! Has so many levels, and is very fun! Would recommend for all ages!

Peggle Deluxe
 you if you don't like Peggle. What are you, some sort of prick? Some sort of prick who does nothing but play ARMA 2 all day? Some sort of prick who is ing dumb and stupid?  you!

By far the closest game to CoD ever.

grandma put 800 hrs in this game.

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle is a casual puzzle video game developed by Sukhbir Sidhu and Brian Rothstein of PopCap Games. Initially released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems in 2007, it has since had versions released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, the Nintendo DS (with the help of Q Entertainment), Windows Mobile, iOS, Zeebo and Android; the game has also been ported as a Java application, and an extended minigame incorporated into the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. A sequel was released in September 2008, titled Peggle Nights.

Inspired by pachinko and bagatelle, each level of Peggle challenges the player to shoot a limited supply of balls at a field of colored pegs to clear out specifically marked pegs while attempting to achieve a high score through skilled shot planning. Special powers associated with a number of cartoon Peggle Masters" can be activated to aid the player in this task. Peggle initially sold slowly but was boosted by the inclusion of a specially designed demonstration in Valve's The Orange Box

Peggle Deluxe
Watch a ball go from the top of the screen, and hit pegs on the way down.
Considering that I've lost countless quarters/coins in real life machines that share this same game mechanic, it's pretty easy to sell this game on anyone familiar with the machine(s) I am talking about.

Recommended.

Peggle Deluxe
Excellent game, this was heavily advertised in the orange box and with good reason, the quality of this game is on par with what valve made. It's a pity that since then valve has almost completely stopped making games and popcap has been eaten by EA...

Peggle Deluxe
why am i so good at this game

Peggle Deluxe
Addicting and amazing, but you shouldn't buy this on your PC. You can't change the resolution from anything other than 800x600, compared to Peggle on Xbox 360 and iOS which take up the maximum screen real estate. If you can, get those versions instead. However, one advantage to the PC version is that you can use your mouse cursor as a de facto crosshair to aim your shots more easily.

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle Deluxe is a casual game that takes fun to new levels, its objective is simple, but its execution can be frustrating. With 10 different characters, all with rewarding power ups makes this game a jem among dirt. Completing this game is an amazing sight, but the fun doesn't end there, once you complete the game you unlock Dual and Challenge mode.

Peggle Deluxe
It's a combination of pool and pachinko.  You can pick your shots with great accuracy or marvel at your luck with a casual shot.  Fun to play solo or while entertaining a group.  The melody of Ode to Joy" never had a better use."

In the last three days, this game will not start.  been playing for several years and is one of my favorites.  PopCap, please fix it and Peggle Nights!!!!

Peggle Deluxe
 MY BALLS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle has always been one of my favorite games. It is a game where you shoot balls at orange pegs with the help of the professors of the Peggle Institute, and if you hit all the orange pegs before you run out of balls, you win the level. It is fun and addicting, and is worth buying.

Peggle Deluxe
play it

Peggle Deluxe
Its all the fun, bright lights, and fantastic sounds of playing pachinko... without sitting in a smoke filled gambling parlor.  Also goofy cartoon characters.

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle is a fun pop cap game. This is a game thats very easy to play and most people can understand what it is and how to play. This is a fun game but it is a game you can play some were else for free like online on game sites so i would get it only if it is on sale. Other than that this is a fun shoot the ball hit the orange pegs and you will win. The colors are amazing and bright. This game can be played by all ages i strongly recommend this game!

Peggle Deluxe
hours of fun though beating all the challenges is a PAIN.

This game is pretty good.

This game is just so much fun ,this was a very difficult game to purchase on CD when we went hunting around the shops for it, then my son saw it on steam, and I just begged them to buy it for me ,I just love this game ,it's a great buy for sure : )

Amazing!

hej

Peggle Deluxe
Peggle Deluxe is the Deluxe version of Peggle. This already shows that it is the better version to choose to play and if you say otherwise  Shut up you ing idiot .

Peggle is a game that involves complex calculations and mechanical skill to ensure that the screen is cleared of small little multicultural dots. The dots vary from a cold-hearted blue, a tanned slag of an orange, and a nice combo of purple and green, thanks doc. By firing out your little ball, you can make it bounce around the screen, hitting these dots to build up a score"

Peggle Deluxe
Really fun and addicting game.
It's a good time waster if you feel like playing something simple and quick.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
One of the best Digital Collectible Card Games out there... until Ubisoft let it fall into the dreaded hands of the endlessly incompetent Blue Byte. After almost a YEAR with absolutely no support (including ignoring GAME-BREAKING bugs that any COMPETENT developer would fix in DAYS at most), they finally release the long-overdue draft mode.... together with an announcement that they wouldn't be developing any more content for the game, so it's basically dead (oh, but of course they're leaving the servers up so suckers can still buy cards with real money, because THAT doesn't take any effort). Hey, Blue Byte? YOU NEVER DEVELOPED ANY CONTENT FOR THE GAME AT ALL! Oh and just to add insult to injury, this last patch broke the blasted game, introducing more game-breaking bugs and crashes than they managed to fix! The uselessness on display is simply JAW-DROPPING! They took the game and KILLED it because they simply didn't care. A heinous display of incompetence by an utterly worthless developer squandered a potentially fantastic game. Damn you to hell, Blue Byte. Damn you to hell.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
If you are thinking to begin to play this game I suggest read what I wrote.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
>>>Before the recent update (heart of nightmares)

<Short Game Review>
Card game evaluation from 1 to 5

Mechanics 4/5
It has a grid on the field that is quite distinctive it has melee lane and shooter lane, gives 3 main types of creatures (shooters, melee and flyers along with hybrids) other than creatures there are fortunes and spells each have the ability to change the flow of the game. There are factions that all heroes of might and magic fans should be familiar with. Each faction has distinctive characteristics. There are also differnet spell schools which do determine your limits and openents battlefield tactics for example if you know they have fire spells you can assume they have fireball so you would avoid have any creatures near eachother. Mana is produced constantly by +1 each turn. It has heroes what is expected from might and magic. Life points that each hero has differs which makes it more ineteresting as it represents the idea that everything has a cost and to master the game you need to master your ability of making your deck efficient, which limits you in way since all decks will have a weakness, so you have to decide whether you want to invest more in rushing to victory or playing a steady slow game. Another thing that was intresting is that you can redraw your cards at the beginning, with consiquence which is weird to me, but I am staying neutral with it. I gave it a four because I feel like they could of added another lane, made it at least 5x5 instead of 4x4, so then it would five enough space to make it more strategic. What I mean by that there would be a middle row on both sides which would be harder to dominate since the center would be the most dangerious spot on the field. By making a small difference such as that it would increase the variaty of formations possible, not sticking to them would bring additional dangers to the player.

Flow/Economics 4.25/5
I was really happy with this game. Economics of it was most appreciated, since there was a daily reward that grows for 7 days and then is collected on the 7th day along with being awarded 10000 gold and 100 seals per level. There were also some achievements that rewarded in seals. Prices seemed reasonable to me except the fact that five towers set packs were not available for gold, which didn't make sense to me. If you look pass that then everything else is accessible each level as you go on (except the fice towers they are only accesible later when you have enough seals) cards in the game at a reasonable pace. I liked the fact that they have a sacrafice pit to recycle cards in a way but you need a lot to do that. Another thing that it makes it flow more is that there are such things as wild cards which you can use for getting specific cards in the altar of wishes, but first you hace to unlock them though by buying packs. It's a 4.25 because I think each set of cards should be accessible with gold and only the boxes should be priced with seals as they are now. Only when the set is really new it should be priced with seals for a month and then it should change to the ordinary price as the other packs.

Aestetics 4.25/5
It's organized each faction has it's own field look, quality pictures on the cards, nice log in menu background. There are also alternate art for some cards. The flying creatures move up and down, there is some other animation. I cannot give it a five though, because that would mean there is no room for improovements to be made. The aim of each card game should be to become more lively and more animated, so there would be movement and with it comes character of each creature. Everyone wants to see their creatures come to life and all spells become animated. I think even basic animations would be a start like one for each type of spell I guess. When thinking about makes you think about the ability to change the whole field and that change gives certain effects.

Story 1/5
I think there is something written on those 13 quests. I think it needs some story each hero at least to add more depth to the game. More quests some short animations or at least pcitures with writing on it or descriptions on cards.

Total: 14/20 I would recomment this game to all people that like card games and strategy.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
<<<After the update

Mechanics 4/5
Nothing changed that would have a huge impact.

Flow/Economics 1/5
There seems to be no more daily rewards just some daily quests and no award for leveling, it almost seems that they don't want to reward their players really for playing the game. All prices changed to seals which disguisted me. I think it is also not fair as other people that are further ahead get the advantage as they had the ability to earn more seals. If you start just now you will never go ahead of other people. I was really disappointed by their choices that they made in this area as they also removed the achievements that awarded seals. I mean how will you feel knowing that there is no way to catch up with people unless you empty your wallets. Before it was player friendly now it's not. From play to win to pay to win.

Aestetics 4.5/5
They added some spell animation for each type and menu looks cool. Event animaiton different.

Story 1.5/5
They added more quests. There were description on every one of them.

Total: 12/20 I would not recommend this game anymore after the update.

Final remark: They ruined the game after the update. Changed it from play to win into pay to win. If you want to play you will have to pay. Before the update I liked the game so much that I chose to support it by buying some seals as a sign of my appreciation, but now I began to regret doing so. I am very disappointed.

-Thank you for taking the time to read.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Was good.. Until this recent expansion... Now it's another money hungry Ubisoft game. Good job guys, You f***ed up another game

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
First of all, this game is now neither pay to win, nor unbalanced: reviews which say so are usually pre-Griffin Bane expansion, which immediately gives new referred players all six starter decks, plus tons of gold to buy cards upon completing the introductory campaigns, and  brings back all Factions to competitive levels.

More complex, varied  and ultimately satisfactory than Hearthstone, this game has very nice mechanics, with the board consisting of four rows and two columns (shooter and melee) for each player, spells which can affect single creatures, specific areas (squares, rows, columns) or even the entire board, and fortunes which usually manipulate cards and decks.
Creatures can be basic or have a lot of useful abilities (immune to retaliation, stackable, outmaneuver, etc.), including enter the board" effects.

Simply put

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I've been playing this game for less than a week, but I gotta say, it's probably the most fun I've had playing a card game in years. Now, granted, I haven't tried Hearthstone or Shadow Era or any of the other online card games that seem to be popular, but I used to play a ton of Magic: the Gathering and have watched a lot of friends play Hearthstone. Honestly? This game has just as much strategic depth as MTG, if not more, and both MTG and Duel of Champions blow Hearthstone out of the water if you like complexity in games like I do. The one thing that MTG has going for it though is that it's been out far longer and there are way more cards to play around with and collect (though there's no shortage of cards in DOC either). With a little more investment from its developers in terms of expanding the content and team, I can definitely see this game becoming one of the best/most popular card games around.

EDIT 10/12/15: Welp, they've just announced that they'll no longer be supporting this game with updates. Honestly, screw Ubisoft. They've proven that they have no idea what they're doing, and can't handle games that have potential, especially with how HOMM 7 turned out on release. Still holding out hope that eventually they'll turn it around with expansions, but definitely not gonna waste my money on it for now. Tl;dr: don't buy anything related to Ubisoft ever. Wait until it's in the bargain bin if you must.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Don't bother. The devs have abandonned the game, but not before releasing a final patch that broke just about everything.

The game now crashes more than my cat driving my car.

Sad end for a game that could've trumped Heartstone anyday if Ubisoft bothered enough to give it a dedicated team instead of leaving the commands to a  group of nobodies that didn't care.

Otherwise, best CCG when it works. Artwork is quality too.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
UbiSoft has gone UbiGreed... no more free seals :(

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
MMDoC is a digital Card Collection Game (CCG) with cards belonging to six different factions, each having their unique heroes, crreatures, fortunes and buildings. Each hero can use spells from 1/2/3 schools out of a total of 7. There are also 8 event cards in play from both sides. A duel is a fight to death between two heroes, each having 18/20 Hit Points. Each card uses resources. Spells, creatures, buildings, events and heroes have synergies. One good combo can change a 25 turn long game. Nearly every game for the first 100 games teaches you something if you are experimenting. Just imagine. All this, for free. Paying money only to get in game currency that buys premium packs, or buying premium packs as-is. The best CCG concept, with the most balanced and innovative F2P model.

Only I have any clue how painful it is to mark a thumbs down on this game; because, this is was hands down the BEST digital CCG ever. Don't get me wrong, it still uses essentially the same game mechanics - easy to learn, complex to use and difficult to master - that made loyal users and fans of a lot of players. But just when everyone thought Hey

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I have played this game since the early days, having 1500 hours more or less between the standalone client and the Steam client.

This game has been completely ruined by the greed of Ubisoft and the lack of effort by developers to maintain a decent game, with poor design of monetization.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
It's impossible not to compare this to Hearthstone or Magic, but I think MMDoC can hold it's own against these two other giants of the CCG scene and here is why.

Comparing it to Hearthstone:
-MMDoC is much deeper strategically.
-You are rewarded with a lot more packs by just playing the game.
-Much greater card variety.
-Automated tournaments.
-Three formats to play the game, open, standard and weekly (the latter is a bit gimmicky, but can be fun)
-Spectator/replay mode.

Comparing it to Magic Online (Duels of the planeswalkers doesn't really compare as it is just a dumbed down experience)
-Much better UI
-Can get new cards by playing the game
-Free to play
-Ladder
-Much more newbie friendly

Conclusion:
It's a shame that Warcraft and Blizzard have a much bigger fanbase that most people looking for a Free online CCG are going to gravitate towards it without even hearing about this game. Admitedly, I've always thought the art in Might & Magic games were a bit generic, but the artwork on the cards are excelent.

It may not be as deep as Magic the Gathering, but as a computer game it provides a far better experience.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I've used to play the non-steam version before, so my playtime here is inaccurate.
MM: DoC struggles with several issues that make it hard to enjoy in the long run.

Firstly, progression is very slow. Rewards for a single match are negligible and you're only rewarded with a reasonable amount of gold (basic currency) when you level up. The problem is, after the first few levels it will take you around ten hours of playtime to get another one. Some mechanics are in place to make the grind less monotone, but they have their own share of issues.

There's a PvE mode available in the form of campaigns. Each campaign consists of 5 missions that, upon being completed with one of the six available factions for the first time grant a significant amount of gold plus some experience points. Clearing the entire campaign with a faction also grants a free booster pack. The problem is, those free boosters are largely useless, since following an overhaul in 2014 most cards from older sets can no longer be used in ranked play. The gold rewards for campaigns also happen to have a nasty incident in their early history. Two weeks after being introduced those rewards were increased by a factor of five and this increase was not retroactively applied to players who already cleared the campaigns. Since the increased rewards were ridiculous - clearing 2 missions took next to no time and granted as much as a single level up normally does - pretty much all the players who weren't already veterans found themselves in a situation where it would simply be easier for them to start the game anew (which isn't allowed), even if they already spent money on it.
The previously mentioned overhaul also made it impossible to gain seals (premium currency) without paying money for the game, even though previously they were received upon leveling up and as a reward for 6 consecutive days of playing. Since every new card pack is only available for seals for the first few weeks, this also means that paying players now have an actual advantage over non paying ones.

There's also a lot of balance issues. Unless you manage to build a decent deck, which involves lots of grinding or spending several AAA titles worth in money on card packs then you'll struggle even against mediocre necropolis players, mostly because dark magic school is broken to the point where it enforces the meta (not worth it to use any creature costing more than 4, because otherwise casting Soulreaver or Death Seal will remove it for a lower cost, while casting Wither will make it useless). Necropolis isn't exactly overpowered though: it just isn't really possible to counter if you lack cards, so for the first ~40 levels or something around ten times that amount in dollars/euros.

If you bothered to read this wall of text, you might've noticed that most problems are nailed down to the controversial overhaul, that:
1. added PvE campaigns and then screwed over everyone who finished them
2. made over half of the cards in the game useless by excluding them from ranked play or the so-called 'standard format'
3. removed all the free ways of gaining premium currency, except for some achievements that are mostly hard or even impossible to get without paying for the now obsolete card sets in the first place.

Point #2 effectively negatively affected paying players by making some neat decks that require a select pool of cards useless and wasting their money in the process, point #3 made the game feel like a 'pay to win' for free players, while point #1 was a bad decision that screwed over everyone. What all of those points have in common is that the combination of these things irrecoverably ruined the trust in the developer that many players had at that time.

Even with those problems playing MM: DoC can be enjoyable from time to time, but as far as I'm concerned, major updates tend to create more problems than they solve, not to mention that removing what used to be half of the cards available in game from ranked play instead of actually bothering to balance them (and not even managing to tweak the remaining half properly) was probably the most lazy development decision I've ever witnessed.
If you're looking for a more complex alternative to Hearthstone, you might want to check out Infinity Wars instead.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
See how all the positive reviews are really old? The game is way too expensive and then they reshuffled things and made a ton of stuff no longer usable and it's just not worth your time. It's a shame because it was a good, fun game

If you aren't willing to spend a decent amount of money on a regular basis to buy cards in a game no one plays, then this game is not for you.

Edit: some people would like to point out that there are now various formats of play some of which will let you use (modified versions of) your old cards. I didn't mention this because it doesn't matter. The only way to get old cards is if you already have them, and so if you play the old style you will be playing pretty exclusively against people who already spent a ton of money on their cards.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game is absolutely worth your time . It has depth , quite a few cards to choose from (around 600) and one of the best F2P models I have experienced . I hope the community will keep growing now that it is on Steam.

EDIT : I am taking back what I said . The game does look very promising but it only gets worse as you level up . Your dependency on packs is not visible when you are a beginner , but when you try to face an opponent with 500+ elo , you WILL find a guy that has emptied his wallet on this game . More specifically :

- The lack of a trading system is killing MaM . It does not matter if you want THAT card .You have to buy a pack every time and expect to find it there . Most packs contain 10-12 cards . There are all in all 600 cards. You do the math.
And it gets even better . Most of the epic monsters can only be found in 2 card packs , which sometimes DO contain duplicate cards . So if you want one of those cards you are pretty much screwed.An alternative to praying to the godess of luck , is to purchase it directly with wildcards , a currency that you get with packs.

However the only sure way to have them is to buy packs with seals . You get 100 seals per level up (roughly 20 matches if you haven't bought cards with real money , as you will lose most of the time ).There are two packs ( essentially one )  that you can buy with seals.The ''normal pack'' costs 175 seals and gives 3 wildcards , along with 12 other game cards . The second one costs 225 seals gives 4 wildcards and has the same card pool with the previous pack , with the onl difference being that they are ...shiny.
So after 4 level ups (400 seals) you can get 7 wildcards , 48 random cards and all the gold you will have gathered by then. Well done ! An epic card costs 8 wildcards.After so many matches , you can not have the epic card you want.Now imagine what happens if you want to fit 10 or more epic cards in your deck  , which i assure you is the minimum to have a chance at higher elos.
If you do not want to pay for seals , and do not want to spend the ones you get by leveling up , you can use your gold ( the in-game currency ) to get packs. Sadly those packs have a mediocre 40 % chance ( at best ) to have ONE wildcard .And they most likely fill your card collection with dozens of duplicates. I believe you see my point.
And that concludes the bad moneytary system .

- Another probem of MoM is the matchmaking . The tournament mm that is . Are you a low level player that want to participate in a tournament ? Forget it. You will get matched with guys that have spent an eternity in this game , and more often than not have far better decks than yours .

-Finally any help you get on the game stops at the tutorial . There is no library , catalogue , list ,whatever you want to call it that can inform you of the cards each faction has . You must either visti the ( poor) wiki of the game , or suffer again and again as you are bombarded with effects you didn't know they existed , even after 200 games after you started.

To conclude this game is good for a while , but transforms into a cash sink later on.

EDIT 2 : Right now the only way to play with legacy cards is to pay real money . Open duels are officialy broken . Well played Ubo , well played.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
When you first boot up this game for the first time your instantly impressed, the cards are full of beautiful art, the gameplay is fun and you really feel its a well made game. You also get a nice bundle of free in game currency to buy Packs"....atleast YOU will think its alot...its only once you add a few new cards to your starter deck or throw out your cheap shop deck against players  online that you see this is a heavy pay to win game. Your freebie or cheap cards will be torn to pieces against someone who threw money into the game shop and bought all the decks/packs to get those OP cards. Some of the pay factions not optional for the freeble's are so much more powerful too and you will sadly see yourself looking at the shop and tempted to spend just to level the playing field. All in all its a ok game

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
It was good once, now it is just a pay to win.

Once you could buy all cards for ingame currency, now you just can buy the new" packs. All my old decks became worthless

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Definitely better than MTG. Aside from playing without having to pay any money... you still get to enjoy the same feeling when you play cards as those on MTG. Card collection and deck building is so easy. Getting enough play means you get tons of gold in exchange for packs of cards to improve your deck. I can't stop playing this since I started and now I'm having trouble sleeping... :D
Deep game strategy, deck building skills and lots of cards to choose.
Every part of the game is excellent. Thank you Ubisoft for building this game
for cheap players like me!!!

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
If you're looking for a competitive card game, then I'd recommend this to you.

I recommend this because the gameplay is quite innovative and also addivting for a card game. Game mechanics is quite complex, but when you get the hang of it you will discover that this game have a great game mechanic unlike any other card games.
Like other Collectible Card Games, you will have to either invest a lot of money or do some serious grinding if you want to build a decent deck. And of course, like any other card games, luck plays a major role both in game and opening a booster pack.
FYI, I spent 0 amount of real money in this game and I'm already in the top 400 worldwide. All cards are accessible without paying.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
If you are into collectible card games, this one is pretty good.  It is also quite possible to have fun with it without spending a dime, which is always a bonus.

The game play of this CCG is slightly different from others I have played.  The battlefield has a 2x4 grid you place your creatures on.  Melee creatures can only be placed on the front line, and archers on the back line, flying creatures can be placed anywhere.  Most creatures cannot attack outside of their row, nor can they attack the enemy hero if enemy creatures are in the way.  To me, it helps add a bit of the Heroes of Might and Magic feel to the game.

As far as spells go, you have the usual assortment of nukes, removals, buffs and various other deck manipulation tools.  Spells are broken up into their respective element, and each Hero only has access to certain elements.  This combined with the fact that Heroes only have access to neutral troops and the ones from their faction leads to a wide variety in the strategies you can deploy.

If you play through the short single-player campaign, you should get enough seals to buy 'The Box' which has 10 packs of cards to help get you started.  You can also look around on the net for some codes you can redeem for additional packs and rewards.

It should be noted though that this game is almost exclusively PvP once you have completed the campaign.  So if you are not into PvP at all, you might want to skip over this one.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
NOT PAY TO WIN & LOTS OF FUN:

PROS:
- Single player Campaign that takes more than a week to complete as it is hard.
- Lots of GOLD & CARDS earned from single Campaign.
- Deep strategy with LOTS of SPELLS
- Quick matches from 5 minutes to long ones of 20 minutes (that I love)
- AMAZING DARK FANTASY
- Levelling up gives you experience and gold to buy more packs
- It's FREE ( just try and see for your self)

CONS:
- It takes sometimes 2 minutes to get an adversary.
- It takes a few days to understand the mechanics of the game. (as it is complex, and GREAT!)
- Sometimes the randomization of the cards you get in your starting hand is flawed (getting 3 copies of one card 2 of another and 2 of another is strange when it happens a once or twice a day)

My past experience: I used to play MTG (I find it too expensive now days, so I use Work Station for free with friends), currently playing Hearthstone (I have most of the cards, only 4 legendaries to finish the collection)

I have been playing for a week TO DOC and I still have lots of fun!
The solo play is really good, it gives you LOTS OF GOLD to buy packs and some 20 packs. The only problems with the 20 packs is that they are from the old editions, so most of cards are not valid for standard game (only for open - for Pros)

What most of people complain is about the changes that happened from the old edition to the new. For me is ok, as I do not care about most of things they say. For example, you can only buy with seals (mostly real money) packs from old editions with cards that we can not use in the Standard game, so WHAT'S THE POINT!!!

COMPARE TO MTG:

Not as good. MTG is the King. Strategy in not as deep and versatile. But illustrations in DOC are better for my taste.
In MTG you can mix all the cards, in DOC you have classes and some general cards, very few. So it is limited in that aspect. But you can mix spells and there are 7 schools of magic, and many Heroes with abilities and mixes of magic schools that create different strategies.

COMPARE TO HEARTHSTONE:

For the moment I proffer the deepest of DOC and the extensive amount of spells. Hearthstone is great and I love it, but is all about minions and sometimes it feels a bit limited. I have been playing since close Beta and I'm a bit bored now. The brought only 30 new cards with Naraxxramas and the Meta has changed, but is more or less with the same cards, not so interesting.
I also prefer the illustrations and the darker look of DOC, but I miss the animation of the spells of HS.
HS is fast and great for any moment, DOC could be slower but deeper so more planing is requiered to play.
HS has Drafts in the Arena and is amazing, the best of all, maybe that is missing in DOC.

My advice is to try it and decide as it is FREE. If you want all the basic decks to start with, use my code as Referal: 8BKDTC

If you see a bad review of someone that has played more than 40 hours, read it careful, most of people do not like changes and get angry when that happens. There are reviews of people that has played more than 50 hours, even 400 hours and they are bad reviews. Tell me how someone that has played so much has not liked the game? They are angy with changes.
Don't miss the opportunity to try it!

Have FUN!


Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
The game mechanics themselves are enjoyable, but the paywall is much too high. After playing for a few hours, I've come to the conclusion that it is not possible to actually play the game without paying for it. If you want to run a successful pay to win game like this one, the game has to at least be fun and fast paced enough in the beginning to lure people into paying for things later. This game fails to do that as you are immediately faced with a paywall or easily over 20 hours of grinding with the same starter deck to even unlock even the most basic features common in modern 'free to play' card games. I stopped at about hour three. (Note that I started playing this game outside of steam, which is why I only have an hour logged playing on steam.)

It's not that the game mechanics are bad, in fact they are quite interesting. Each deck being bound to certain factions and schools of magic is a promising feature that unfortunately does not come out prominently in the beginning as you are forced to play with the same intro deck (you can make some slight modifications to it with your starting cardpool if you wish) over and over again. The tactical mechanic of positioning your creatures and having area of effect features is also quite enjoyable. This is the meat of the game's structure and it is well executed. The main problem is with the way the paywalls are set up.

There is a simple conundrum in these pay to win games. If you don't want to pay, you have to spend countless hours grinding, which is boring, but at least you are playing the game. If you are willing to pay, you have to realize that you are in effect paying the game company to NOT play their game. It is quite an achievement for game developers to create a game so boring that people are willing to pay to NOT play it. So then what's the point? This is the pit that many of these games fall in.

So what would make this game better? More variation. The game should give every player access to all the starter decks. This way as they continue to grind through the game they are encouraged to try new things which will keep them playing, rather than get bored repetitively grinding with the same low power decks. Also removing the level requirement for the card trade in system is a must. This will allow players to more greatly customize whatever starter deck they like the most which will also encourage them to keep playing and trying new things. As is, the lack of customization available in deck construction to the new player really dampens the exploration of the game. It should be set up so that playing the game intrigues the player into wanting to try new things and then maybe pay to help that along instead of making them have to pay before even the creative spark fires, not knowing what they really want to do. This puts out the fire of imagination before it even starts.

To sum up, this game does not offer the non paying user any encouragement to want to play the game - let alone pay for it. Furthermore, the first few hours of gameplay do not adequately sell the game's features to the user, leading to the user to doubt that the game would be fun even if they put in a few dollars.

For interesting mechanics despite a horrible paywall system and an unfun experience, this game has a lot of potential if a few minor tweaks were made. It shall therefore earn a 1/5 rating. I will not be spending any more time playing this game.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
All these negative reviews are old. Yeah the game had some problems some months ago, but they are working to make it enjoyable, they made so much progress!

- You can get all cards for free only playing, yeah it's grindy but that's normal since you don't pay a dime. If you want to speed up a bit you can buy more cards with real money and just that. There's no real diference between a paying player and a free player, the only benefit is the time spent.
- Lots of achievements that gives you cards, the various types of currency in the game and other fun stuff, another way to get the cards you want.
- 2 formats of dueling: the Open Format, for more experienced players and where you can play with all cards from the game, and the Standard Format, for beginners and where you have a tinier pool of cards that you can play with.
- Also there's a extra format of dueling: the Weekly Format, where every week the game choose some restrictions to put in the decks. Example: You can only play with Spells, or Creatures, or a specific Faction, etc.
- Campaign Mode and Puzzles: This one is great, you can learn a lot of things with it and get good rewards for doing it. Also the Puzzles are extremely challenging.
- Wildcards System: Since the beginning of this game everyone asked for a trade system, but the fact is the trade system would broke the game, so they implemented a way to get the cards you want by colecting Wildcards and trade it for them.
- Infernal Pit: This system help you to get rid of the cards you don't want. You just need a max of 4 cards from the same card in each deck so, if you have 5, 6 or more from that card you can sell" them to the npc and he gives some amount of money for it. Also there's a featured card every 8 hours that you can get by selling a great amount of cards

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
When I'm looking for something more complicated than Hearthstone, this is what I'm going to now.  Wish I knew about it last year..

I found it very confusing at first, but once I figured out that I can right-click a card and it will explain what the key words mean (charge, swift, quick attack, magic resist, etc... there's a lot of them) it made things a lot easier to pick up.  Also, the starter decks are all over the place.. Definitely make your own, simplified deck with a few good spells/fortunes and a lot of creatures, with a good resource-curve.. it'll be much easier to learn from.  Also, I recommend stronghold to start, I'm finding them the easiest to pick up as their minions seem to be really good.

You should definitely use a referral code because you get a free copy of the starter deck for every faction right off the bat.  Then when you beat that faction in quickplay, you get a second copy of the starter deck for that faction.  You can then make a much better deck for that faction with your doubled card-pool.

It doesn't matter who's referral code you use, but here's mine if you're looking for one: TNRMH1
If you do use mine, feel free to ask me questions in the game. I'm happy to help another new player with what I've learned so far and I could use the extra gold :D

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
The game was great in its day but its current status is abandonware. It is currently full of bugs and the devs are doing nothing and plan nothing for the future of the game. It's sad that they are still taking peoples money for a game they have ditched.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
M & M: Duel of Champions is a well-executed digital collectible card game, which is saying a lot -- I've seen abominations in this genre.

Gameplay is unique, inventive and has elements that can only be achieved digitally. The campaign is painfully short, but it does give you enough gold and seals" to buy a decent number of cards with which to expand your collection (I recommend buying "The Box" and avoiding premium packs -- you'd be paying more for shiny cards).

The deckbuilding interface is easy enough to use once you understand the deckbuilding rules. The way your cards can only exist in one deck at a time is a bit of a pain

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
*STAY AWAY AND DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS*

The game was fun and had a great model of f2p giving you 10k gold & 100 seals" /similar to RP in league/ per level which allowed you to buy packs with random cards for 20k gold or 1k to 1.4k seals. - after completing the pve missions and tutorials you were given enough gold & seals to purchase a deck + hero with gold & an expansion pack with a lot of "wild cards" used to craft any card you desired.

After the 3rd or 4th expansion however everything changed - A new "standard" mode was created for the less OP cards & combos.

Right after the update got live with the new expansion however you no longer received gold or seals for leveling /i stopped at 50 and had friends at 450+/ and the only way to get the new cards for the standard mode was to spend real money. Not long after my friend list of 60 online at day diminished to only 3 which made me abandon the game as well.

Few months later I decided to check on what's going on only to see nobody has logged in months and reading the forums full with posts "This game is abandoned" "The game is no longer being supported" "This has turned into a moneygrab" which in my honest opinion felt that way.

Only few players play and the ones that do are either in denial or have spend too much money to just "let go"."

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I love CCGs, and the Might and Magic universe, and I recommend this game, with warnings.

Overall this is a great game with lots of intricate strategies and very versatile card selection.  It's terribly frustrating.  I love the game and collecting as many of the different cards as I can, and there are some problems with the economy as mentioned in other posts.  I have logged over 900 hours, and 1700 duels.  I currently have 914/996 of the different cards.  Whether you like games like this for the sake of collecting the cards or are just trying to get that 4th Arcane Eagle for your deck, than you should expect to fork out some dough or become a total shut in and dedicate your life to grinding.

The game is very Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.  Luck is a significant factor as well as far as who gets the curse of having to go first.  I know that generally the first turn player statistically will more often get to also attack first, but the second player gets a card draw, a bonus card AND the first player doesn't get to boost their hero on the first turn!   Bizarre.

I like how there are separate 'standard' and 'open' game modes.  Open is for old school players that are fortunate enough to already have a good collection of the best legacy cards.  My mistake was spending so much time trying to grind in open.  Some rebalancing was done, and I am optimistic that there is more to come.  A lot of cards were recently rebalanced and introduced into standard mode.  While I would love to say that I want to see more of this in future expansions, this will bring me to my next point.

COLLECTING

I had set out with the crazy goal to try and get a copy of every single card from every set, as any obsessive collector would.  The only way to get the legacy cards now is by paying, aside from the wildcard farming (and infernal pit) or saving all your gold and waiting every 3 months or so for waiting for Emilio's packs to be available for gold.  Doing this presents a small problem though...

With each expansion, newer stronger cards are coming out that naturally players want to get their hands on as soon as they can to maintain an edge over their competitors.  Particularly, Sins of Betrayal and Time of Renewal especially have introduced a lot of powerful new cards.  So if all of the hard, hard, hard earned gold is needed for the newest, and priciest packs, than you need to decide whether your efforts are to work towards staying competitive, or getting really rare legacy epic cards.  (900 hours and i still don't have Eleonore, unfortunately I started not long before Base Set II came out) This wouldn't be an issue if legacy packs or Emilio's packs were always available for gold, or if you could still earn seals.

Regarding my collection, I'm roughly 2000 wildcards away.  About 800 booster packs...

ECONOMY

Overall, getting cards is slow.  Even with daily achievements (which sometimes take hours to finish), it generally takes a few hours just to get a single pack.

Seals are finite.  After your early achievements, I think you end up with a grand total of 1600 or something.  Enough to get a box and a couple of packs.  Seals are the only everyday way to get old cards and they only available for real money.  They recently became even more overpriced.

Ubisoft needs to reintroduce weekly seals in the login bonuses.  Not necessarily a lot, averaging maybe about 100 a week or so just so players can get cards a little quicker.   I'll compare this model to the Pokemon online CCG, which (up until recently at least) gave a booster pack for every 5 login days.  On login bonuses alone, DoC would get you a free pack after logging in every day for roughly 3 to 4 weeks.  Don't even think about skipping a day or you will reset the week and have to wait even longer for the coveted wildcards.

There are a few basic things that Ubisoft can and should do to drastically improve the economics of the game and put it back on top.

- Seals should be available in the weekly login bonuses, or they need to be WAY less stingy on the number of seals provided for $$
- Emilio's packs should be available for gold at all times
- The infernal pit should offer rares, epics, and heroes more often and way less commons from Base Set II and the timer should be 4 hours, instead of 8
- Better achievement rewards (banners?  ... seriously?)

Some economical improvements and continued balancing and this game would put it on top to stay for a long time to come.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I came back after a year, had good memories of the game. Now it has become just another P2W piece of junk....

Literally the ONLY way to get the vast majority of cards is with real money. Even other card games that are P2W give you the option to grind for ridiulous amounts of time to get cards, but this one doesn't even do that anymore......

I don't know what happened but I am sad to have seen this game so ruined....

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Somehow someone took the lane-based DCG concept and actually made a good game. Good solid depth, good interface, a lot of cards. This is a fun one.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I started playing this game not a while ago and fell in love with it in an instant. In depth strategies, advanced card mechanics and a chess-like deployment structure. While i was playing this i wondered why people even bother play other card games (maybe except magic) due to its awesomness.

Then it hit me. Devs stop adding extra content to this game.

Players shout out for the upcoming death of the game.
So little support for new players (aka wiki, more detailed faqs etc. which means u have to figure some things on your own).
Innumerable crashes leading to extreme frustration.
But the thing is that none of that let me down and i kept playing with the hope that one day the game will revive again and i will have a solid collections of cards to be competitive.
Then came death. Sudden and fast. Forever loading screen while logging in, which seems to be a typical (unresolved) issue, out of many, of this game. Ofc i contacted support but none of them gave a single .
So, there it is. If u manage to play the game i would tell you to carry on as it is by far the most complicated and smartly made card game out there, with the hope that one day will be great again (if Ubi decides to do something at last).
If u cannont play it due to constant crashes,errors and  then search for alts.

10/10 for the flawless game content
0/ 10 for its support

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
It started out as a good game
Now its just pay to wn
No more free cards and some cards and boosters can ONLY be unlocked with real money

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game is engineered to be addictive - beware! You start out rather weak and want to get good cards. But there are thousands of them and so you either need to put in a lot of time or spend money. So you decide to play drafts and accumulate daily rewards to finally get enough to buy a box of cards. Then you buy the box and get a ton of junk and maybe one or two good cards that actually make it into your deck. Why did I waste so much time?

And then there's the game itself. It's pretty easy to get to a somewhat decent ranking. But then you get stuck. What happens is that there are several broken" decks that are pretty much impossible to defeat unless you spend hundreds of hours playing or spending a lot of money. And sometimes the outcomes are pretty much random. Depending on what faction you are playing there are several other factions that will beat you nearly every time.

So combine the frustration of losses you can't do anything about with the frustration of putting in lots of effort for little reward and you realise that there are better uses of your time."

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
A friend introduced me to this game two months ago and I'm having a blast!  The art is absolutely spectacular and the mechanics are quite elegant.  The game offers just the right level of complexity and tactical depth; it's more streamlined than Magic: The Gathering and deeper than Hearthstone.  If you like collectible card games you should really give this a try.  I initially signed up just to play the single player campaign, but the game turned out to be so good that I jumped into the multiplayer arena to keep playing after I finished the campaign.

I read some reviews complaining that the game is buggy or pay to win"

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This is by far one of the best tradingcardgames to play. WAAAAY better than Hearthstone.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Really great TCG game. I've been playing a few TCG since I was a kid and this game has it all. It has great artwork, great PvP match making, and the game mechanics require a lot of skill compared to other TCGs such as Yu-Gu-Oh! and Hearthstone. Definitely something to try to get into since it deserves way more attention and hype.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Very great card game so far. The system is great, card's design looks good, BGM is awesome, Free to play, Matchmaking is good too.

However there are some hindrances in the game which make the game imperfect.

1.Some people abuse the system by surrendering intentionally in order to keep their ELO low and farm newbies. You may face very tough players after cross 500 ELO (ELO is the indicator of the skill of player, more ELO = more skill)

2.After playing for a while, if u don't want to spend real money, u will need an effort to obtain new cards but it is doable.

3.Price for using real money is too high.


Therefore, my score for this game is 8.5 out of 10, It's a fun game for a while, but after playing more than 20 hours, it will left only those who really love card game and love competing with other people or can afford real money.However, after 60 hrs so far without spending real money, this game is still much enjoyable for me : )

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game should be pulled from Steam as it is unplayable after the last patch due to game crashes part way through matches or if using certain cards.This is happening 100% of the time for all players. Pull this game as it has been stated on their forum they are not updating it anymore so should therefore be taken off Steam as they are still charging players for ingame items. A new player to this game could easily think this may be a good game, but as it stands it is unplayable so not even a 'game'. IMO there should be some kind of compensation from Steam for players that has had ingame purchases for this particular game as it is their site that is promoting something unusable as though it is something usable/playable.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
There are many extensive reviews down there, but let's make the long story short:
-The game has great and unique mechanics, it requires a lot of attention and a few OP cards won't really guarantee your victory.
-Runs smooth and without many problems. There are a few bugs here and there, but still nothing serious.
-It does take some grinding (or money) to build a decent deck, but grinding DOES teach you stuff and is worth your time. Haven't played too much, but it does not seem pay to win.
-Also a great single-player experience with a fairly large and rewarding campaign that you can go through and get rewarded 6 times (1 for each of the 6 factions) PLUS some neat mind-teasing puzzles, hope they add more soon!
-Music, design and graphics are a plus.
-It does need you to have a Uplay account, but well, so what? You DO NOT need to pay a single coin to play the game and have access to everything.
My opinion: If you like TCGs, give it a shot with no second thought!

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This is a very good card game with a high level of complexity and strategy. Despite what a lot of the reviews say, it is pretty easy to obtain new cards without having to spend any real money in the game- it is not very hard to get at least one pack per day (Increased gold reward from campaign is a huge contributor to that, but gold from dueling, daily quests and leveling is also generally sufficient).
Small complaints are:
Wildcards, the method for specific card acquisition, are a bit too hard to obtain (you can get 1-5 per week for logging in 7 days in a row, and [after you get to at least Champion I ranking] 3-5 per day from daily quests, which can be hard to finish if you get one that doesn't suit your cards. Rares/epics/heroes from the newest set are 15/24/24 wildcards each, respectively, so obtaining specific cards you are missing can take some time.
Infernal pit could give more gold for the cards you are sacrificing

EDIT: Pending the upcoming major update/expansion, wildcards will no longer be obtained from quests, but as an extra reward from sacrificing cards to the Infernal Pit. Quests that gave WC will now give gold. This may or may not be good- it will take 480 commons to get a recent epic/heroic. But if the gold reward scales evenly with current quests, the new quests should reward an equal amount of WC on average from saccing earned cards.

Legacy cards are virtually locked behind a pay wall. This is only a minor complaint though, because they are only usable in Open format, which isn't the officially supported" format and not usable in the main tournament (Road to Paris)

Other notes: Card artwork is beautiful

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Just look at all those people having hundreds and thousands of hours played, and changing their review to negative after what happened with BlueByte abandoning the game.

Don't spend a dime here, if you decide to play this game instead of one that actually has players and developers around.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
dead game

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This game is strongly starting to lean towards Pay To Win.. I decided to quit playing this game.
It doesn't have a thing to do wih Heartstone, I'm just unable to constantly keep up with new expansions and updates that completely change the balance; and then you have to spend many hours (and they hope money too) to update your decks to accomodate the changes..
And the changes are IMHO to the worse with every update :(
Six months ago I would probably recommend this game - not anymore, sorry.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
Probably the best TCG out there, best f2p one for sure, and i've played MTG when i was a kid. You can build competitive deck in matter of just few days without spending a penny (game is very rewarding in that regard) and reach high ELO" pretty fast if you know what you are doing. Card design is absolutely gorgeous and can really be compared only to the MTG one. Sincere recomendation to any TCG fan

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
A little easier than Magic The Gathering, more challenging than Hearthstone.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
This is a good deep CCG. Most of the Complaints are either false or have been fixed in the new patch. I have pretty much all the cards I want in the game and only paid like $0.06 for 2 steam puzzle/decks (100+ cards) in the market place. I think it's more giving than Hearthstone, I have been playing Hearthstone since beta and still have a bunch of cards i need. The campaigns give a ton of gold/packs and can be completed with all factions for more gold/packs! You start off with 1 deck but earn other decks as u beat their factions or start with all 6 faction decks if you start the game through a referral.

There are weekly promotions like this last week for every Wild Card (WC) you spend, you get 50% back after the weekend. WC are used to buy any cards you want in the Altar of wishes. The WC prices are fair. There is a login bonus system where u just need to log in and get free stuff every day. Playing a game earns you gold and exp. win or lose, and there are daily quests to earn more gold. Leveling up gives a nice chunk of gold enough to buy a pack. There is a Infernal pit where u can burn your extra cards for Gold, WC and if u burn enough you also get a card(the card changes about every 8 hr). Another way to earn packs, gold, WC, etc is to earn achievements, and there are many of them! Also be sure to search for some codes online which give free packs/gold.

It's more strategic than Hearthstone since you have 8 placements to put your creature. You can be offensive or defensive. You can only attack the hero if there is no creature blocking your way. There are 3 different formats, Standard (recommended for new players), Open (Every card can be used here but could be chaotic for new players), and Weekly format which changes every week. There is also 2 tournament mode: Jackpot (chance to earn gold) Swiss (tournament of 8 players where 1-2 place get 2 packs of the last to exp set and and random player that plays all 3 games will get a ticket and a bs2 pack)  I think you should stay away from tournaments until you have reached champion 1 level or think you have a good deck and grasp of the game.

The cards consist of Creatures, Magic, and Fortunes. Most cards have a requirement where you can raise 1 per turn for Might (Creatures), Magic. And Destiny (Fortune). It's pretty simple, the tutorial explain everything clearly. Each Hero has magic school(s) attach to them and can only use spells from that school. There is also Neutral Events where both players can use so pick those out carefully. Try to pay attention to the events, cause I forgot about them when starting out and lost some games cause of it.

Oh and the art work in this is great!

If you use this link, you will start with all 6 decks:
https://signup.duelofchampions.com/portal/index/DOC_world_02_0010_06_200_12_0614_00791SBN

So that's 12 decks you will have after beating all the factions once, and will have lots of extra cards to burn in the pit. You can add me too if u like to chat or play a game :)

I love this game in early days...
but unfortunately Blue Byte bought this game from Ubisoft...

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
One of my most played games until Ubi left everything and made it uplayable for now. I hate Ubisoft :(

Great game, but dead now

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I grew up playing card games, I dabbled with a bit of everything from Yu-Gi-Oh to Pokemon to Magic: The Gathering and so on. Naturally this game caught my attention and after playing it for a few hours, I'm hooked.

What I think makes this game so much more interactive and enjoyable to play is firstly the smoothness of the visuals, gameplay and cutscenes.

The asthetics in this game look absolutely gorgeous, right from the card images to the slick painted backgrounds. Heck, even little things like the smoke clouds that vapourize from cards that go to the graveyard look incredible.

The gameplay is as you'd expect, it's strategic and requires you to think three turns ahead of what's actually happening. There's a tutorial to help new players, (such as myself) into the game, and unlike many other card game tutorials, it's actually incredibly easy to follow and understand. The developers obviously wanted to try easing the player into the game, teaching one thing at a time and slowly building up to the more complex duels and they've done a fantastic job.

The cutscenes are another beauty, but the main thing that really appealed to me is there isn't an unesseccary cutscene after every duel, they're only placed at major events. It's a little thing, but it's a trap that many developers fall into in hope it will enrich the story aspect of the game. I've yet to play through the entire game, but so far it's looking absolutely incredible.

Might & Magic Duel of Champions also has some very nice features, simple features, but definietely welcome. The options menu, for example, includes features to stream directly to Twitch at a press of a button. There's customizable options to allow the player to toggle certain aspects of the game on/off, simple, but things like in-game cutscenes, fast dueling etc. It's simple I agree, but little things just make the game richer and more enjoyable to play.

The game also has some very interesting features in terms of how to manage increasing your deck size, or purchasing new cards. You can win the resources to purchase cards/boosters etc from the store from dueling, or you can choose to pay for the resources through microtransactions. Normally I would be highly against this, seeing as players could pour money into buying endless booster packs to build an incredibly powerful deck, but when the resources are as easerily obtainable from in-game playing, the need to purchase content with money seems like it would only be used by those 'hardcore' players who aim to collect every card. The beginners decks and the amount of obtainable resources in-game are generous too, it's not as if the developers have given you a horrible deck, only to go online and be destroyed. This kind of balance makes every duel, regardless of skill level a blast to play.

Games aren't without faults though, and this game has it's own. For one microtransactions to many will seem negative and as much as I'm ok with it in this particular title, I personally would have preffered the game a little more had it not been implemented. I understand why they've included it though and it does seem fair seeing as Might & Magic Duel of Champions is free to play, so that can be argued both ways.

The menu that greets you for first time play is a little daunting. There's buttons and menus everywhere, which after an hour of playing seemed perfectly easy to use and navigate, but for first time play it can through many players off from playing, so just be warned.

The in-game music is very nice as fitting, but after a while can become a little boring and dull. I imagine it probably becomes a little more varied late game, but for the most part I play this game whilst listening to my own music, perhaps a few of you may feel the same way.

I could continue to ramble, there is a tone of things to mention and talk about, but for the most part if you're either a fan of card games or stratgies, I highly recommend you try this out. Heck, just try it out even if you don't like card games. It's a very slick title with some of the smoothest presentations I've seen in a game for a long time.

Do yourself a favour, try this title out. It's an absolute blast to play.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/100. ~ A beautiful strategic card game that's easy enough to learn for beginners, but in-depth enough for veterans.

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
excellent ccg, been playing for 10 days straight!

gold and packs are plenty at the start - with all the campaign missions, achievements and quests,
its quite easy to build a good deck without spending money.

the wildcard mechanic is pretty nice as well - you can craft specific cards,
and you get those with daily quests! (as you reach champion level, like i did already)

tournaments are easy to access, balance seems a bit off like in every card game,
especially with editions focused on certain classes, but im having a blast so far!

Might & Magic: Duel of Champions
I have played various card games since 2004. Although many have been playing longer than I have I still feal as though I have the authority to review this card game based on the endless hours and dedication I've put into card games.

Accessability:

This is the easiest to get started free to play game that I have ever participated in. There are good rewards for a campaign mode that teaches the basics of the game, there is a crafting system, and there are daily rewards for playing. Overall, I have yet to spend money on the game, but I'm happy with my collection and deck I have been able to build. I have played for less than a month. You can use actual money to advance if you wish.

This is also a easy game to learn, Even as an easy game to learn, there are many options during every turn so there is a challenge using the most basic decks against real players and the later computer players in campaign mode.

4.5/5

Only a totally free all cards accessible immediatley type of game would be better in my opinion, but there are drawbacks to having everything at the start of the game. The game can be picked up quickly, but offers a deep sense of strategy.

Flavor:

The artstyle of the game is comparable to that of Magic the Gathering. They are comparable in that this game draws inspiration from a number of fantasy areas; mideival, japanese, and middle eastern are a few of these fantasy realms that are drawn from. Additionally, this particular game doesn't feature art that is as dark and hard to distinguish as Magic the Gathering. If Magic the Gathering was Diablo 1 and Hearthstone was Diablo 3, then this game is in between when concerned with the art assets.

5/5

This is a great aesthetic for a competitive fantasy game that wants to be taken seriously.  The art assets are memorable and work very well with the card effects.

Mechanics:

There are quite a few interesting, mechanically wise, things going on in this game that are not featured in many other games.

First, card zones matter. This is a feature non-existent in many card games, but as creatures may only attack opposing creatures that are directly across from themselves and because creatures can be made less vulnerable to attack by putting them on certain board tile players do best by strategizing how to move and initially position their creatures on the game board.

Second, creatures health totals do not automatically heal every round - creatures keep the damage that they take throughout the game. Creatures are also, as mentioned above, only vulnerable to attack in certain board positions. Together these parts of the game come together to create a lasting investment in the cards that have already been developed onto the board. Players may strategize how to keep their creatures around so that they may stifle a future assault or begin to pressure the opponents life total without engaging the opponent's creatures.

Third, attacking isn't always free. If a creature does not kill an opponent's creature with it's attack, then the attacking creature is vulnerable to retaliation damage. Attacking therefore becomes something more strategic than automatic.

Fourth, there are multiple costs to playing a card. Not only do cards have a mana cost, but they also have a threshold costs. There are three separate resources, other than mana, that players have the option of adding to every turn. Overall, these other resources add another layer of depth to card balance, deck building, and game play. Additionally, card zones and deck size are other limited resources that also may need to be managed during longer and more complicated games.

4.5/5

These are just the mechanics that I find most interesting. These mechanics are rare to find in a good card game, but they all come together well to create a challenging experience in this game. This game also has very good use of key words that facilitate the understanding of what cards do. The room for improvement here is a few rules based questions about not being able to always predict what will happen without having experienced the given situation beforehand.

Playability:

This game has curtailed some of the more annoying occurrences in card games with it's standard format and general card balance. Many times non-interactive combo strategies and rush strategies can be frustrating and impossible to stop in games. Although those types of strategies do exist in this game, they are not game breaking. The amount of damage that a player can deal in one turn, in a long back and forth game, is hardly unexpected. This is not Yu-Gi-Oh! or Hearthstone where players will be able to reliably leverage their card economy into fast and lethal damage.

This game gets deck and card diversity right. All too often do card gamers consider deck diversity to be an automatic good. All too often deck diversity comes with the cost of imperfect knowledge about the opponent's deck and degenerate strategies. As I said in the previous paragraph, most strategies are interactive in this game. There is a real focus on combat and life managmnt in the game. Additionally, players are limited from playing every single card in every single deck and therefore players will be able to reliably predict the threats that an opponent may have - the issue of losing because of the opponent happening to be using a different strategy than expected isn't a problem.

4/5

The point lost here is because of some balance issues. There are times, as in any game, where the opponent has a specific hand of cards that cannot be beaten. This is more of a issue with deck based games than this specific game, but there still will be a few games that will feel bad and that will be out of your control. The most recent set also has some very powerful cards that are difficult to interact with. This game does fall into the trap of allowing rare cards to be overpowered and there are also times when you will have no silver bullet available to use against the opponent, but, again, that only occurs twenty percent or a low amount of the time.

Total:

4.5/5

This game does live up to it's claim of being the best online free to play card game.

There are more things that I could have mentioned, but that would not have changed the score. Stop reading this review and go play the game already.

Play through campaign as quickly as possible as that has the biggest rewards in terms of free cards.

Once you reach a certain rank, then you will be given daily quests that are very generous.

Try to only use your wildcards for crafting heroic, epic, and rare cards. Also always uncheck hide duplicate on the crafting page so that you can find the lowest crafting price for the card you want.

If you get a referral link to play the game you will start with extra cards, but do not ask me for a referral link as that goes against the terms of my posting this review.

occasionally check the online forums for promo codes as they will be occasionally released and grant you free cards.

I still enjoy this game, but it IS pay to win. There is no doubt about that.

How bad IS this game?

I was previously part of the Development Team that created this game, we was previously working on a game called Project Decay. This game basically followed the trend of sh*tty simulator games trying to suck money out of you.

I got this for free from MoWah, a friend of mine who also was on the team. It has no future, no enjoyment and definitely not worth any of your valuable money. Do not buy this game, PLEASE.

Oh su funi and random eks di eks di. Okay, the fun's over. Absolute rock bottom. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind stupid ways to have fun. I even found Goat Simulator (at least slightly) amusing, because - say what you want about it, but it clearly included some work being done, the city was filled with easter eggs, stuff to do, there were achievements, workshop support, etc. The developer is claiming that this is not trying to be Goat Simulator, but I'm absolutely sure this piece of software tried to go the same way while completely missing the point, offering no fun, basically no gameplay and failing at being funny.

The developer of this piece software completely misuderstood the point of Goat Simulator and thought that [insert random word here] Simulators are funny, because they are poorly made and you can't do anything there. Also making this type of simulator" now is not even beating a dead horse

First off i don't know if I am missing something or the plus reviews are fakes.  Could go either way.  I normally NEVER review a game but after running this software (was no playing and definately not a game) and reading what other people say.  I loaded it up in every mode and for one I couldn't kill anything. I brought up the guns and blasted away But at point blank range it didn't hurt or even leave a mark on a cow or on the cutouts in the Shooting Range"
I ran around and it just ended after a few minutes in teh "classic" mode

This game is a piece of . Why was it Greenlit?
All you do as far as I can tell is walk around in the grass and maybe shoot a gun eventually. That's it. Nothing else. You walk around in the grass. It reminds me of an old default Windows screensaver, just walking around in a field. And maybe shooting targets. I don't know, I couldn't even get to that. I get terrible FPS on such a tiny game, but that might just be my computer. But I can run TF2 and DayZ better than this - both games I'd rather be playing.
This game attempts to be funny, and to be a joke, but it fails at even that. It's a complete piece of , not a game, not a joke, NOTHING!
Maybe, MAYBE at some point in the distant future this game will be worth $10, but right now - not at ALL.
0/10 I would never reccomend ever.

What the actual . This game" completely misses the point of simulator games. Surgeon simulator was fun because it was a satire on how serious surgery is.

There is literally nothing to do in this 'game'. Buggy as hell, unoptimized piece of junk. Even getting this for free I feel ripped off.

Please forgive me for helping this crap pass through greenlight for the promise of a free key.

Grass Simulator
The game has seven gameplay modes. They are:
-Wandering through a completely empty grassy field that has NOTHING to do
-A tiny shooting range with no scoring or other mechanics
-Staring at a flat 2-D image of grass that gradually gets bigger
-Standing in a field with cows that spin in place while one dubstep music track plays
-Wandering through a completely empty snowy allley that has NOTHING to do
-Standing in a field with static teleporting cows while one disco" music track plays
-Staring at a "searching for online server" screen that never goes away

If you play the game for any slightly extended period of time the game glitches so that none of the modes work until you exit the game (even the exit game button stops working)

This game is a joke that is not funny. I implore you: do not buy this game and encourage this idiocy. This is just crapping out something that only a cynical man would call a game and selling it as satire. If this game were a real joke

Do you LOVE MEMES?
Do you REFRESH 9GAG EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR FOR THE LATEST MEMES?
Do you BROWSE /HM/ (here are the memes) ALL DAY?
Then you'll still only play this game for a max of 30 minutes because just like all the other  sims it's really boring.
This  even flaunts that it is about grass and there are no features. Why would you spend money on this?
And on top of that, your non-content only works like 1/3 of the time.

This is the perfect example of a game that doesn't belong on steam. A game like this should be free atleast until it is finished, and Grass Simulator is far from finished.

Grass Simulator
This review is split into two sections; the first section lists pros and cons, and the second section features a short review.

Pros and ConsCons:
Extremely badly optimised, if at all.
Very boring gameplay.
Very repetitive gameplay.
Not compatible with all the resolutions it suggests it can use.
Bad menu systems.
Uses the default Unity launcher interface.
Pros:
The icon is cute.
ReviewWhy does this software, that's right I'm calling it software because it's not even remotely like a game, even have the words grass" and "simulator" in the title? It is not a simulation game at all and doesn't even try to be remotely satirical such as other popular simulation games such as Surgeon Simulator. Want to be satirical in your titles? You should have called this A Game rather than the title it was published with.

I dont even understand how this was able to get greenlit nor do I understand why its out of early access. I got this game for free and I still feel cheated.

I was extremely curious as to how this was able to get greenlit and so I did some googling. It turns out that the developer bribed members of a popular game gifting website to vote for his game in exchange for free keys.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ggs7CuUF18

Developers like this should be banned.

This is babys first Unity game and its abysmal.

tl;dr: If you want to play a better game I suggest you try Bad Rats."

It's not a game, it's not a simulator, it's just stupidity. Our? Because we voted for something like this and got it here? Or maybe somebody from Steam? Because they accepted this to their platform?
I remember that people used to release demos like that in internet and ask others what they think about it. Mostly on some tutorial forums, to show some progress that some begginer programmer or somebody else made etc. but this isn't even something that can rated.
Price label says it's 9,99. For what? Early Access with almost nothing. Few shoots, some music that sounds like broken fishing boat and most ugly grass ever. It just takes to add comedy/parody" to make it a whole different experience. Glad I got it like everyone

I really do not know how to feel about this game.

$5 is pretty ridiculous for what this offers and truthfully, it should still be in early access.
There's no real... gameplay. For real. There's no real gameplay.
I'm being serious here. Check this video:

I went through all the game modes and yeah. No proper gameplay.
Of course nothing else than this is really advertised as the game itself... but still...

It doesn't feel like game. It feels like an early, early beta for a survival experience or something.
I'm not meaning to be rude to the developers but it really shouldn't have been released in this state... That or at least the price should be brought down drastically. It's basically an open world made in Unity (or a similar engine) with some simple scripts, models and nothing much else. If the devs are indeed serious about this game and are working to make it better then okay... but if not: then this game doesn't really have a point and you shouldn't buy it right now.

Early Access Review

I mean, sure, it's a joke game but this game shouldn't be in early access, this.... early. You might want to save your money for now: Wait til this game eventually gets more content. That's actually worth.....playing.

Regardless though, I really can't help but wonder what the joke behind this game is. The idea makes no sense and while it sounds funny, it's really just boring.

If the devs really wanted to make this worth a lot of people's times, they should had began development long ago and released the game when it was complete.

As a supporter of the idea of a wacky and insanely strange game akin to Goat Simulator, I am really dissapointed. This could had been handled a bit better.

Lets Start off with posting the Positive things about this game ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ok now thats over and done with lets move onto the negative parts about this game.

You walk around in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do and nothing to achieve
When you decide to shoot a cow it takes about 15 shots to kill it and then it does the obvious thing that a cow would do in any other game when it dies and proceeds to explode.
Im not sure if this was a bug or not when i played the game but my guns would not reload after i used the 1st clip.

I was also part of the development team on their community forums for a number of months. The lead developer of this game promised me a key distributer job a number of months back and just ended up ignoring me even when the distribution was going on and then removed me from my moderator status on the forum for no apparant reason.

So to make a long story short

The Devs suck The Game sucks Dont buy this

Im honestly embarrassed that i was part of the dev team for this game

It also says it all that majority of the positive reviews are reviews saying stuff like: I love it because i like grass

It's stupid, and not the gloriously stupid of Goat Simulator, just regular disappointing stupid.

You walk around in a small area with invisible walls keeping you in the area and there's absolutely nothing to do at all.

The fact it's $10 and not $1 (or less) is . At that price it's genuinely irritating and not even something you should get 'for the lulz'. Spend your money on 10 copies of Bad Rats instead.

Although this game was very entertaining and very fun to play for ten minutes, all in all, based upon the content, it's a waste of money. It doesn't cost much, no, but you do have better games for the same price to spend your money on.

Classic Mode:
Has no objective at all. You walk around in a reasonably small world filled with a single cabin, grass, fences, trees and cows with buggy heads. Shooting the cows makes them explode but once you've seen that once and you've giggled - do you want to see it again?

Grass Mode:
Why would you even put this into a game? You don't spend money on a game to watch grass grow. You can't move or equip anything. All you do is sit in your chair and watch grass grow. Paint-Drying simulator will be the next release.

Dubstep Mode:
I laughed for about six miliseconds. Stingy cow animations with some tacky lighting effects and some terrible dubstep music. Putting two-and-two together, yes, it's just spinning cows dancing to music. Done.

Ranged Mode:
Um, this is meant to be a Grass Simulator"

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Guilty of being an impulsive buyer, this is one of the few games I've bought on a whim that has surprised me greatly. Fun and fast enough and mildly complex enough to keep me intrigued. It's cheap, buy it already!

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Lets start with what I didn't like with the game.
1. Controls:
-The Map interaction really shows that this was made for a touchdevice to begin with, it's a thing to get used to but annoying when you are new to the game.
- Combat is a just watching the game play itself as you will auto attack instantly and consistently as soon as an enemy is comes close. You have your Manual attacks that is an Uppercut or a Slam (downward) attack but they are weak unless you wait long enough for your auto-attack to build up enough rage (skulls on the top) to make them stronger. This is fine for a touchgame when you have a limited amount of buttons" to use to not disturbe you visual of the screen for the gameplay but a huge flaw when you have an actual controller to play with. For me this was a really fun draining aspect of the control.

Otherwise the movement is very solid and responsive and you can get a really good flow (wich is needed with combat mechanics mentioned above.

Graphics

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Before I start this review I'd like to say that I do like the work that Hexage does and have immensely enjoyed some of their mobile apps. I must say however that Reaper: Tale of a Pale Swordsman" looks nice

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Reaper: Tale of a Pale Swordsman has a lot of good things going for it, especially the price. It's an interesting combination of platformer and RPG that's addictive and will keep you hacking and slashing through level after level. There are only a few drawbacks that keep it from achieving a perfect score.

The Great:
1. The graphics are colorful and fun to look at.
2. The pacing keeps you going through the game, hacking your way through level after level.
3. Great sound effects and soundtrack help make the gameplay even better.
4. Excellent Price
5. Action-packed
6. Very easy to pick up and start playing!

The Bad:
The only major bad elements are related to the controls of the game. They're not terrible, but they can seem clunky at times. Every once in awhile you'll find yourself frustrated as a result, but this is a minor drawback to an otherwise excellent game.
I'm recommending Reaper, and look forward to what else the developers have to offer.

It's what you'd expect from a mobile port and then some - The controls are a bit clunky, but you get used to them over time. The plot isn't really there, the fighting is, at times, impossible (Screamer jumps are uninterupttable).

But the gameplay itself is so easy to pick up that I just find myself just... enjoying the experience. The ranking system gives a sense of progress, as do the constant quests.

I'd imagine that if a full-sized dev team were to take Reaper and flesh it into a full game, it would be amazing.

8/10, Slicing through everything in sight is awesome

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Reaper Tale Of A Pale Swordsman was a game made for mobiles. Once again, it shows. The art is beautiful, but the game runs at 30FPS and has that certain 'slow-mo' feeling sometimes. But it's not intentional, let me say that.

I've played it for a couple of hours now and all you're doing is walk from one point to another, while completing quests and defeating enemies. Quests consist of fetch quests and kill quests. Fetch quests have you run to several places on the map to collect stuff. But it's just clicking on the map. Your character doesn't have to do anything here. The kill quests, of course, let you kill enemies. These enemies range from simple to moderately hard. You'll be using your skills (quests grant you XP and allow you to level up resulting in several skills you can unlock) and the combat system to complete these. The skills usually let you have more health, or do more damage so there's not much variety here, but the combat system is a bit unique.

Walk towards an enemy and you'll be auto-attacking it. Auto-attacking gives you skulls and the more skulls you collect the more damage you can dish out if you decide to manually attack. I wouldn't say it's a deep system, but you have to use a bit of strategy to defeat some of the tougher enemies or if there are a lot of enemies spawning. Unfortunately, it's the only positive thing I have to say about this game.

Because it's clearly made for phones and the gameplay is just too shallow to be enjoyed on the PC I just can't recommend this game. Skip.

This is a very well polished and fun game with a lot of content at a low price.  I have a full video review here

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
There are a lot of things to like about this game. The RPG mechanics are wonderful - equips feel unique and useful, and the customization on level-up is very well done. Character design is cute, and the art style overall is quality. It seems to me that this game would have high replay value.

However, actual gameplay, the most important part of the game, feels clunky and unresponsive. The autoattack mechanic is inspired, but not executed well. I found myself using unempowered manual attacks for the most part. The worst part of the combat, for me, was that it rarely felt like it was my fault for getting hit. This is hugely important - when you take damage, it should be because you did something wrong (except special circumstances like trading hits), and you should be able to learn from your mistake and avoid it in the future. When I got hit, it rarely felt deserved. Melee attacks from enemies have wonky hitboxes, most notably, and avoiding them feels more like a battle with the game's design  than with the game itself. Dashing feels extremely clunky. The input (double tap a direction) provides too long a window, and I found myself dashing accidentally when I was only trying to adjust my position precisely. This led to frequent dashes off ledges (falling deals 50 damage, half of your base life) and just as often straight into projectile attacks, as dashing does not provide any invulnerability frames. This was really frustrating to deal with, and the rest of the gameplay just couldn't make up for this and other shortcomings.

I really wanted to like this game, and there were definitely many well-done aspects, but it failed to provide an enjoyable experience overall due to just a few small, consistent problems.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Last month Android and iOS users were treated to Reaper  Tale of a Pale Swordsman, a side-scrolling action rpg akin to Rogue Legacy on the PC. Reaper however plays a lot more like a traditional RPG than the aforementioned, forgoing the rouge-like elements of its inspiration.  While it does effectively utilize many rpg elements well, its definitely not perfect. However, developers Hexage of Radiant Defense notoriety arent kidding themselves and only ask $5 for their PC port. All in all its absolutely worth the time and money.

The core of the title is the combat, a 2d hackfest of the slowest kind. While you would imagine a title like this to warrant flashy moves and twitch gameplay, it has a very slow deliberate pace which can be attributed to its mobile roots. While your movement speed is upgradable as you level up, the game still sports a pacing better suited for a touchscreen than a battlestation. That being said once you get used to the deliberate pacing the game actually tends to open a little.
While we are keeping in mind that this is pretty much a direct port of the mobile title, there were a few gripes we have. First and foremost is the inclusion of an auto attack. For a mobile game this feature makes sense, but the fact that it was not made optional for the PC port hurts this title, especially due to the fact that its the catalyst of the games combat system. As you walk up to enemies without pressing any button whatsoever your character will be begin chopping away...

Played this game on windows store and loved the free version I am so glad this got green lighted

IM SO HAPPY :)

but realy try this game


Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Don't know how this game has mixed reviews. Mobile game in every sense of the word. In the game, you are this character that goes around this world map doing fetch quests and killing people for tribesman and guards. You load a straight little area and kill everyone on it and thats it. The game never changes. I was doing the same thing from the start to the end. You fight the same 10 different unit types. There are no new abilities, power, weapons, etc. The combat is the worst I've ever seen. You auto attack in true mobile fashion. You also have attacks that use rage, but to build that up you have to auto attack. Which means standing in range of the people that can attack you and trade blows. There is no dodging or blocking. You can use your other attacks without rage but not only do they do little damage, they suddenly don't have knockback or stun for some reason. This means you can't stop the enemies from hitting you right back, since they always do, but you can be stunned by them. So basically you have to stand there and get hurt in order to build up rage to hurt them......because you know, mobile game with sh!t design. The game evolves  by just adding more guys on screen to kill, and having them shoot tons of projectiles, and you dodge it like a bullethell. There are spikes and pits and fire and things that keep you from jumping and landing, and aren't there for any particular reason other than to be annoying. The objects in the background don't even make sense. There will be a tall stone pillar, and if you jump up onto the top of it, instead of standing on it, you do a little bounce off it, same with piles of rocks, because the develops were too lazy to program them differently than the weeds and thorns and everything else you bounce off of. There is no healing. You only get items from visiting the 1 blacksmith from time and time again, but the items don't look different and don't ever change, you always use a sword, and no items make a reasl difference other than a minor stat bonus. You level up and get boring upgrades like increased damage and health. My favorite sign of the amature design is the enemy types on the levels. I supposed to be fighting military guards, but for some reason along with them there were bees fighting me; oh yes I forgot the military employs killer bees to work for them *facepalm*. Or another level I was told to kill this evil bear in his lair, yet I was fighting boars most of the level; oh yes I forgot giant bears enlist the service of boars to guard them.....*facepalm*. They were both clearly done by just throwing random enemies on levels to make them longer.

Quests objective locations are purposefully on the other side of the map, so that you have to run there and back, making the long trek more likely to get attacked along the way, so they can pad the game length even more, a cheap tactic. And unlike any other game with random wilderness encounters, there is no option to run or get away or even die to stop from having to fight the random encounter, because you know, that somehow makes sense. Gold drops from people, but for some odd reason when people die it just goes flying to the sides of the screen so you can barely collect any. But no worries, by the end you will be ignoring gold because you'll have way too much and nothing to spend it on.There is no real story. You got around doing random quests that are incoherent in any sort of plot. You have to help locals and the invading men, for some reason. There are diologue options, but they amount to ask for more money" or "say no to quest" but even that is poorly done

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Had this game on kindle fire and loved it. got it on here and love it even more with controller rather then touch control. deffinetly worth the 5 dollors to get it

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game is a bit of a strange experience for me. I WANT to like it, but it constantly decides to be frustrating in exactly he wrong ways. I've seen reviews that say this game required skill, I found the opposite. Skill took the back seat, and instead luck was the ruler of the day. For those who don't want to read the long version, I'd say this: if I'd paid more than the $5 I got it for, I'd feel ripped off. As it is, this game is very flawed execution of a good idea, which still manages to have short stretches of good fun. The fairly unforgiving nature of the game, what with no real defense options makes it somewhat of a strange sell for casual gamers (which seems to be the target audience), but hey, seems to be working for a lot of people according to other reviews. Can't say that I agree with how many people recommend the game.

So it basically seems that Reaper was meant to be a bit like an RPG lite, where you could play a few quests and have a bit of fun, not having to get too bogged down in a really in-depth game. Well, right there I'll say that if you like the kind of complex stories that RPG's are generally known for, this story is gonna feel a bit like Plot

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
For me this is on my cool casual list - games that I play almost every day for a short time.

I'm not usually to write one of these, and that should show how strongly I feel. I'm not going to blindly rag on this game, the developers definitely did some things right and for $5 none of us should be expecting the next Shadows of the Colossus in regard to quality and originality. However, the fact that:

1. I am unable to block in a hack-and-slash RPG where I don't have range attacks
2. There is a too clear recycling of the same enemies for far too long, with very little different between enemy types anyway
3. Stale and repetitive dialogue/quests
4. Repetitive/unimaginative upgrade system and weak gear/items
5. No real immersion or reason that pushes you keep wanting to play

These things really are things that kill enjoyment of the game and seriously affect the gameplay and experience.

For its price I got a couple of solid hours of entertainment out of it before yawning and discarding it into the pile of games that simply weren't good enough to bother finishing, and I guess perhaps that isn't too bad considering its a low priced indie title. Either way, I expected more and was simply so very underwhelmed and disappointed.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Action RPG meets Sidescroller. But don't let that fool you. Simple controls, you can also use a controller if you like, but I doubt that would make much difference.

Single player story mode, and an increasing in difficulty challenge mode. You don't have your story mode gear in the challenge mode. Not sure if I like that separation.

Pros:
+ beautiful graphics and effects
+ very easy controls
+ cute hero :-)
+ auto-attack (it was a mobile game first)
+ real ARPG, don't let the cute graphics fool you

Cons:
- once in a quest, you have to finish it before you can do anything else.
- story is not the best out there, but not the worst either.
- challenge mode has separate gear
- getting the money from killed enemies is a challenge, so you don't always get what you deserve

Recommended for it's price. It's even cheaper now if you get it in the Humble Weekly Bundle: Brawlers" now."

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Anticipated this game since i saw it on greenlight, and i was NOT disapointed. Absolutely love the game!

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Nice fun little action RPG with pretty graphics and a decent story.
It kept me pretty engaged the whole way through with it's simple yet satistfying combat mechanics.
20 hours playing this game went by like nothing.
Plus, it's pretty cheap.
cool little game

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
It is a wonderful game! I never get tired of it... The runing around to turn in quests get boring, and I love how they give you random battles along the way. It really keeps the game fun. You might be thinking, $5.00 that must be some kind of, a trick... It's probably not fully featured. Has to be some flaw. I'm here to say to you, NO, it is a full featured game, wl awesome cartoony  graphics, yet they don't miss out on blood! I'd rate it, 8/8 because my favorite number is eight.(It is perfectly symetric!)

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game to me looks like a mentally limited offspring of Odin Sphere, except that the pacing of combat is boringly slow, and you get stuck in combat phases without the chance of / and because you can't wander off to muscle up.

And of course this is yet another mobile port on PC that seemingly didn't live with the opportunities of a bigger platform. The art is pretty enough but the dev could have walked the extra mile with some amateur voice acting. That only would made a big difference as it may have made the game feel more like a whole PC game.

I'm not hating the game though, I just see its existence more justified on a retro platform. It would have been awesome on 8-16 bit consoles/microcomputers where I expect less.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Picked it up on a whim.  Was not expecting much.  Happily surprised. Out of seemingly nowhere difficulty spikes aside- really am enjoying this little indie jewel. Haven't finished it yet, tho. 7/10

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
It's a mobile phones port, yes. It's not really gripping, yes. The fighting is always the same, yes. However the plot is kinda neat and also the abillities you can get are also interesting.
Well. This game is all the matter of your taste. It's rather a casual game and not everyone might enjoy it. Though I still recommend it.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
The first time I tried this game on my Android phone I was blown away, never before had I seen such a great game with such a colorful and excelent art style.

And naturally after playing the first 10 lvls, that were in the game, before you had to upgrade to one of 3 versions, i chose the 3 star version just to support the devs of the game. To my big surprise it was released on Steam and for me this was an instant purchase, no questions asked. It might just be a straight port, which does not bother me what so ever, because it is an awesome and fun game.

So instant purchase for me, well worth the 5

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
A hack and slash games with beautiful graphics and smooth 2D animations.
There is a story mode and a pure hack & slash mode. You can move around
the map in story mode and visit different locations and fight monsters.
You can by stuff at certain traders and there is a level up system which keeps
the game interesting.

The main core in this game are the randomly generated levels including random enemies.
There are different enemies with different attack pattern that makes the gameplay challenging.

The downside of this game is the lack of different features.
Well, it's a hack & slash game but it gets tiresome and boring
due to the pretty long gamelength.

I don't recommend this game for achievement hunters.
There are achievements where you have to spend a
ridiculous amount of time to get it.

Let's say in 10 hours you are done with the story mode but if you
want all the achievement you better invest +30 hours more :D
You have been warned.

All in all a decent hack & slash game with a reasonable price.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Great game, fun gameplay, amazing story, perfect controls on PC as well as on Mobile devices. I love it. Definitely recommended. Hours of gameplay. Hexage delivered!

old school style, nice art, easy to play but hard to stop playing. Really good game 8/10

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
I had so much fun playing this game! I've played about 10-20 minutes of it and I'm already addicted. It's very simple, but I'm really having a blast with it. I recommend it to any side-scrolling, adventure/fighting lover!

I did a little video on it too, heres an idea of what to expect in the game! (If you want to have a look) :D

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This is quite an entertaining game. For an indie game, it does provide a decent amount of gameplay time. Controls are simple and the difficulty is not too frustrating. Definitely something I would play to relax.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game is incredibly fun. I thouroughly enjoy every aspect of it. Highly recommend.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This is a great game. The artwork is good, gameplay is good (ie the story isnt slow, it doesnt get too repetitive), and the controls are alright. In my opinion, it is a great sidecrolling RPG. I think for a price of $4.99 this is a great game.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Reaper is an absolutely beautiful game in every sense!
I saw this game on greenlight a little while back and I knew right then that this game was gonna be great

I don't even know where to start on praising this game!

For one, right from the start the game is gorgeous. The hand-drawn art is amazing and the soundtrack is even better. The atmosphere of the game is just so cool.

The gameplay is also very entertaining.
One of the things I really dislike about modern side-scrollers is that they're all way too easy - but this isn't at all the case for Reaper. This game has the perfect amount of challenge to it - not so easy that you get bored right away, and not too hard that you hate yourself after dying about a hundred times. The controls are very unique and very easy to get used to.

I cannot stress how great this game is!
Everything this game promises, it delivers.
And it's the perfect prce at $5!

I give this excellent game a 9/10
Must buy

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game can get addicting and it is very simple to play. The game is smooth and everything looks beautiful. This is so worth the 5 bucks i spent. 9/10

This game was an impulse buy for me and OH MY GOD it is so worth the $4.99.  I've only played about an hour and am already hooked.  It's a good fun time waster.  Just buy it already, you know you want to.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman is an interesting take on the action-RPG genre, with elements of 2D brawlers and choice-based narrative thrown into the mix. But how well does it combine all those elements, and can a mobile game really live up to the standard of similar titles for the PC?

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
I wish steam would offer us a rating system rather then a simple; recommend yes or no. As i can't simply give this a yes or no is it worth playing. I guess if you looking for a cheap game to while away the hours of your life...then yes it is worth it. But if you like a bit of substance to you time waster games then i say your in the wrong ball park all together find sir...or madam.

It is a pretty looking game, its art style is very nice and is what drew me to this game in the first place but when we get to the game aspect...well its a little sloppy. If you are using a control pad the two screens that show you whats what is jumbled and makes it a little hard to figure out what to press to do what. As well as the quick tutorial bit seems pointless. At first i though this was going to be a button masher but the joy of button mashing was taken away from me as you simply walk into enemies to kill them.Sure you can jump around like a monkey on crack to get out of the way of the many spamming attacks of the enemy. Or you can spam you very own spinning sword of death move to victory. As i have found be the case of the game.

As for story? well what story. You are a pale swords man who wakes up in a cave (presumably a grim reaper) and the first few dialogues happens and i lost interest. The story does nothing to keep you with it and is dull. The few times i stopped to try and see where this was going. All i saw was the pale swordsman just sounding like he was shouting at everyone, since all his lines are in caps. An no matter what you say, you just sound like an uncaring . Though this could be some witty portrayal that death is cold and uncaring and doesn't chose sides. That or im looking to deep into a game that seem to have no point what so ever....like life one could say.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
If I had to compare this to any other game, I would say it is most similar to Dust. Sidescrolling hack and slash platformer with quests and random encounters on a world map. Haven't explored other game modes, but exploring the wilderness and playing the story is pretty fun. Good art.

This game is lackluster at best, you can see its mobile game roots very fast in the game play.

It's worth the 5 bucks, but don't count on it being worth it for that long.

Worth a try, but don't expect much from it.....


Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
If you want a challenge, here you ing go. Jesus Christ. I wouldn't say the game is too hard for me, I just get stressed very easily and this game is by far one of the most insanely frustrating games with some of the most annoying enemies that I have ever seen. After doing entire fights late in the game and getting whittled down to a few health then just barely dying on a red soldier level and having to do the entire 20min fight over again, I've had enough. One of the most frustrating games I have ever played besides Teleglitch. Probably even more frustrating than that game. Everything is fine until you get to a level of tons of red soldiers and then you get to see the game's wild difficulty spikes. It's getting so frustrating and repetitive that it's not funny. The graphics are good and the controls are good but the problem comes from there being a screen full of projectiles and enemies and your guy is just a damage sponge with no armor or block value. You have block value but it only counts towards melee attacks. So late in the game if you don't have the ability that lets you get 1hp per coin picked up, then good luck on a level that spawns in a ton of the floating blue tribal masks, which are one of the most annoying enemies I have ever seen since they float away from you while doing dmg to you. The levels with the red soldiers would take too long to explain why they are so frustrating so just wait and you will see what I mean.

Tons of unblockable ways to take dmg, incredibly annoying enemies, and mind bendingly repetitive gameplay. What you do in the tutorial is basically what you will be doing for the rest of the game. The game isn't too hard for me, just too annoying. When a game is this repetitive, having to replay the same very long stage with the same incredibly frustrating enemies gets old real fast. It also feels like playing a Mass Effect game because you will do as much reading as actually playing. If I would have read all of the pointless text in the game up to this point I would probably still be back at level 15 instead of 32. The one really cool point for this game which is really brilliant is that it automatically auto attacks when you are close to an enemy, saving a lot of wear and tear on your thumb. Every button masher should do this. Every single ing one of them.

I got it in a bundle for a dollar and got about 8 hours out of it and that is plenty. So it can be fun for a good while, but I don't need any more because frustration aside, it is just way too repetitive. Probably the most repetitive game I've played in years.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This is a brilliant game, so glad I spent my extra $5 on this game! I'm also thinking of doing a giveaway of this game on my Youtube Network. :)

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman

Simple, Fun, not demanding of your pc to be able to handle, and best of all affordable! Totally worth 5 dollars for this title!

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
very good, lacking in some areas but addicting, 9/10

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
this game s incredibly fun, well polished, magnificent art, and a great story. the random ambushes somtimes can be a little annoying but its not that bad. the only thing i ask is that a sequel will be made because the story...man.the pale one must continue.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Umm, does someone wanna go ahead and uh, find the image of the Greed tarot card? Yeah, that'd be great.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
Unbiased point of view that has pros and cons.
Pros: A great story line and it is fun for a 5 dollar game
Cons: No options thta most games have, feels more like an app game then an actual pc game which is what the game originally was( an app). Controls are delayed sometimes like the space space combo lags no matter how fastly pressed or if the Reaper is not moving or not.
Overall I rate it a 6/10 it is fun and I enjoy playing it but it should of had better pc controls and options that a pc user wants to use.

Reaper - Tale of a Pale Swordsman
This game is good for people who loves mmos and rpgs. The controls may be bad but you will get used to it after you played a little of it. The soundtrack is good but the gameplay might get old and boring but I recommend you play this game

The Talos Principle
If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.

I can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.

It takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the main" puzzles.

The graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially "indie"

The Talos Principle
In todays world of microtransactions, games releasing before theyre finished, glitch-ridden open world engines, and games that overall fail to live up to their artistic vision, sometimes there will come a game thats so perfect that its hard to believe it even got made.

The Talos Principle is a single-player puzzle game made with full triple-A production values, arguably leaving Portal 2 in the dust at what it does. I liken it to Dear Esther, but twenty times longer and filled with actual gameplay, while keeping the beauty of the world and the philosophical overtones intact.

The game consists of walking through majestic-looking outdoor areas to find closed-off puzzle areas, then solving puzzles using only a small handful of simple and easy-to-understand machines. The puzzles themselves are eloquent and very well-tested. There are over a hundred of them in all, but each puzzle introduces a new idea or uses old ideas in new ways, so they never feel repetitive or stale. The games environments are simply breathtaking with their huge draw distances and ridiculous detail, while the puzzle areas feel aptly like claustrophobic rat mazes while never losing the areas sense of atmosphere. The puzzles get very challenging near the end, but expert level design makes them all very rewarding to solve. And if youre particularly clever, the games third ending requires you to figure out how to break the level design and take items out of their designated areas to find secrets hidden in closed-away or out-of-bounds places. Its rather mind-blowing and something that Ive never seen incorporated into a game intentionally before.

The icing on the cake is the storytelling. The story is that youre a robot who wakes up in a garden and follows the commands of a god-like figure constantly talking in your head. It quickly becomes apparent that the whole world may or may not be a virtual reality simulation, which may or may not have been programmed by humans for a specific yet unknown purpose, and you are given the choice of blindly following the gods orders or trying to unravel the mystery of who exactly you are and what lies outside of the simulation. The game has three different endings, and you will find whatever answer you seek if you search hard enough.

The game poses a few difficult philosophical questions and studies them from countless different angles. I know that some people will find the philosophy pretentious and trite, and I know its completely up to personal preference, but for me it really, really worked. I was hooked on the story the whole way. I think that even if some of the games lines fail to impress you, theres enough material here that youll find at least something that will strike a chord and challenge the way you think. Besides, if you dont like the story, its easy enough to skip everything by ignoring the computers, but you might miss out on the brilliance of some of the games endings.

I give The Talos Principle a perfect score. Its got sublime puzzle design, mind-blowing secret collectables, gorgeous environments that put Dear Esther to shame, above-average voice acting, a professionally-written and well-presented story, nearly zero glitches, and depths and depths of content. Its truly one of the best games Ive ever played. Go play it if you haven't already; you might come out feeling like a different person.

The Talos Principle
A computer terminal in the game asked me why I wanted so much to prove I'm human. I spent like 10 minutes thinking, unable to answer.
Thought this was just puzzles, ended up on one of the most philosophical rides a game has ever taken me. 10/10

The Talos Principle
HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!

The Talos Principle" is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding gaming experiences I've EVER had and I've been playing video games since the Atari 2600 days.  There is a reason why "The Talos Principle" is a hit among critics and the player reviews are "Overwhelmingly Positve." For me this is a new classic. A game that catches lightning in a bottle.  One of those games that scratches an itch I didn't even know I had.

NOTE: If you think you might get this game

The Talos Principle
A first/third-person puzzle game with beautifully themed environments and captivating original soundtrack.

You solve world puzzles to collect Sigils (Tetris pieces, essentially), and you use those collected Sigils in Sigil puzzle locks (which unlock doors or new puzzle mechanics.) To solve a lock you must arrange the Sigils in a preset rectangular pattern. Along with Sigils there are collectable stars which are used to unlock more difficult content. The stars themselves are often fairly difficult to collect, but are very satisfying.

The game plays at your own pace, as puzzles are solved with theory and execution as opposed to timing and platforming. Due to the design of puzzles being self-contained experiences, you can play casually, only completing a few puzzles during a session without worrying about losing progress and having to redo a bunch of them. You can't manually save in the middle of a puzzle, but progress is saved as events get triggered, and your last puzzle/world location is kept track of, so it's easy to continue where you left off.

The game does not hold your hand as you play... you aren't told how to use puzzle mechanics, but rather you learn how to use them through natural play and experimentation. The learning curve is very gradual but you will find yourself dealing with fairly complex puzzles later on in the game as you become accustomed to the mechanics. The game isn't a linear progression of puzzles so if you get stuck on a puzzle you can skip it and come back to it later (and often solving it after having an epiphany.) The only barriers are Sigil Locks, which do require you to collect at least certain  easy" Sigils before advancing too far.

The story of the game is conveyed through various means... through ELOHIM (the voice in the sky)

The Talos Principle
The puzzles are good, if perhaps very slightly too easy, and it's definitely the most competent treatment of philosophy I've ever seen in a video game* (speaking as someone who 1. has played a lot of video games and 2. has a PhD in philosophy**). Definitely worth buying, if not necessarily at full price.

*If you ARE a philosopher, though, or are philosophically inclined, you might suffer some mild frustration at being limited by multiple choice answers to complicated questions - though again, the options you are presented with are generally better than you might expect from a game.
**Please forgive me if mentioning this makes me seem like a d**k.

The Talos Principle
Comparing The Talos Principle to a game like Portal is unfair, but immediate. The first time I manipulated a gadget to set off a part of a puzzle, I muttered how much it reminded me of the amazing and witty Portal 1 and 2, and that trying to replicate it was unwise. However, I removed my premature opinions and discovered a whole new world of puzzle and story, placed perfectly in what is called The Talos Principle.

The game starts out in ruins, immediately piquing interest and curiosity. This first person interaction makes it impossible to know who you are, or what you are doing in the deserted grounds of what seems like Rome. The land is littered with broken pillars and faulty statues, most of which are missing their heads.

Very shortly after running around, an all powerful voice beams from the skies, introducing himself and welcoming you to his garden. The puzzles ahead are a test to see if you are worthy (of what is unclear) and to strengthen your faith in him, ELOHIM."

Possibly the most existential game I've played. Though it is, at it's core, a puzzler. The puzzles are often complex, a few head-scratchers, but sometimes require a more reductionist approach. What may seem complex at first may turn out to be very straightforward. At times it requires you to question the assumptions it has itself given you. Good exercise for the whole brain, as it doesn't train through repetition but demands both creativity and reason, both abstract thought and technical logic. Along with the puzzles a story gradually unfolds. Concepts of self, place and time begin to dawn while another mystery deepens. I like that the story is only hinted at and alluded to, so that you formulate the idea on your own. It makes it that much more meaningful and powerful. It is likely the most existential and eternally relevant topic one could imagine, and the story itself would make a fascinating novel or film. My only complaint is personal, that the game seems to make assumptions concerning beliefs, more specifically, that having them is a universal quality of humans. But this is not at all the case. At times it seemed as though the authors had an agenda to express their own beliefs, but perhaps this was just my suspicion of beliefs in general. The dialogue trees where multiple choice and never once did I actually agree with any of the choices. So it felt like being pigeon-holed and I ended up arguing for a point I didn't actually think was correct. Other than that minor brow-furrowing frustration, I really enjoyed spending time in the beautifully rendered game world. The music was lovely and atmospheric. Extremely smooth play with a good variety of menu options. It's rare that a puzzle game addresses both hemispheres of the brain as well as the subconscious mind. I strongly consider it a work of genius. Oh, and if you decide to play it, I left some messages for you. ;)

Edit for dlc: While a bit on the pricey side for a dlc, it is well worth it. For those seeking greater challenge, many of the puzzles in RtG are considerably more difficult than in the base game. With greater challenge comes greater satisfaction at solving them. Themes from the base game are carried over, and somewhat expanded upon, in a way that I found both humorous and enlightening. It seems to me nothing short of a mirror held up to human nature itself. My earlier point about feeling pigeon-holed in the interactions is rendered moot by new understandings and realizations. So it goes with real learning, when something this worthwhile makes it's dawn across the mind, all one can do is smile. :)

The Talos Principle
Bought this game during Winter sales because there's a kitty on the cover.

Turns out this game is a masterpiece!

Morality: always trust kitties.

The Talos Principle
OverviewThe Talos Principle is a puzzle indie game developed by Croteam and is in my opinion one of the best puzzle games out there and although not comparable to games such as Portal, it's certainly not too far off. The game is well-polished, with a great storyline that will test your brains even when not completing puzzles.

The Pros: Many Puzzles - Probably the most important aspect of puzzle games, and where, unfortunately, many disappoint, is the length. Not here. This game rocks a whopping 129 puzzle levels, enough to keep you busy for several hours! The trickiest part is the bonus Star Sigils" that are hidden or hard to reach

The Talos Principle
JUST PLAY IT NOW!!! (or read below if you're in doubt, ofc)

I don't use the word lightly, but The Talos Principle is TRULY a masterpiece!

This game is definitely among the top 3 I've played in my life. Actually I can't remember any better game from the top of my head right now, so, yeah, that's a lot.

+ This game is DEEP, mainly in a philosophical way, and that's where this game really shines (don't get me wrong, the puzzles are awesome). Really, not the usual superficial philosophy you usually get on videogames--real philosophy! You'll spend quite some time reading files and listening to records, discussing theories with a computer terminal, proving your point, being contested etc.
+ The story is very rich, and obscure, and starts making sense little by little, not having to resort to plot twists, which tend to be a little too clich.
+ At least 3 endings that I can think of.
+ Will keep you entertained for many,many hours (my first playthrough was like 30h, the second was about 5h).
+ Very nice puzzles (and a lot of them, over 120), and they usually escalate in difficulty very smoothly. But they're all solvable with enough effort. Also, they're probably where you'll spend most of your playtime if you're not checking guides.
+ Tons of side-quests -- easter eggs, secret stars, hidden levels, which will also keep you busy for a long time.
+ Music and graphics are pretty impressive, too.
+ Easily customizable settings and controls for the perfect experience.

WARNING: To fully enjoy the game, you'll have to read a lot. Of course, if you just want to go through the puzzles, you can do that, and ignore all the text files and recordings. But, seriously, don't. =)

I payed about 1/3 of full price, and I have to say it's well worth its full price.

Serious review
This game isn't like other puzzle game wait no, this game isn't like any other games.

Yeah, Portal 2 is phenomenal, but it sticks to the Valve alternate reality. But this game? This Talos-effing-Principle? This is something else. Puzzles are the same awesomeness like Portal games, but it gives you a different perspective. Not to spoil the things in-game, but there are questions that (imo) will get you thinking about the game AND the universe itself. Not the game's universe, but ours. This isn't a fourth-wall-breaking game like The Stanley Parable , but (again imo) it feels like it breaks not just the fourth wall. It breaks reality.

And if anyone asks for scores:
10/10 for those who like first-person puzzle (platformer?) games

The Talos Principle
Due to the fact that The Talos Principle is a science fiction based first person puzzler, its hard not to make comparisons to Portal. However, while Portal is a more lighthearted game, the Talos Principle is more somber and thought-provoking. Drawing inspiration from writers like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. D*i*c*k (Apparently Steam doesn't like his last name), and John Milton, as well as a number of philosophers, it takes a much different approach to the puzzle genre.

With heavy philosophical undertones, you will find yourself thinking beyond the puzzles as the very world around you is questioned. This, in combination with a visually stunning environment, creates one of the most wonderful and unique experiences that I've had in a game.

Playing as an android, you must solve puzzles while at the same time being posed a series of increasingly introspective questions about your existence. I am going to refrain from saying anything more about the story so as not to spoil anything. This is a highlight of this game and is best experienced by going in to it knowing as little as you possibly can.

The puzzles are very unique, with various elements being added throughout to provide for an experience that never once felt repetitive to me. In these puzzles you will collect sigils using boxes, jammers, crystal prisms to connect lights, avoid mines, and float high up in to the air with fans. The most notable tool at your disposal is undoubtedly the ability to record yourself, allowing you to create what is basically a clone of yourself, which will act out your previous actions while you work with it in real time to solve the puzzle at hand.

The puzzles are very scattered in difficulty. Most were able to be solved in very little time, with a select few that I found myself having to really think about. If you want some more difficult puzzles, or youre like me and want to squeeze every second out of this game that you possibly can, then I highly recommend doing the extra puzzles which are marked by the stars. These are not required to finish the game, but I found them to be some of the most enjoyable ones to complete as they can be more challenging and mind-bending, forcing you to really think outside of the box (or designated puzzle areas).

The world is huge, often times even a bit overwhelming. There are quite a few secrets hidden around, so you will be rewarded for exploring. There are also messages and words scattered throughout which provide backstory as well as give you insight to other characters. These can be found on computer terminals, audio logs, and QR code graffiti, and really do add something special to the story. I really enjoyed finding these, and felt that it added a nice touch.

Not only are the graphics superb but the music is lovely and perfectly suited for the various environments as well as puzzle solving.

There is also a huge amount of customization available in the options menu, which is always to be appreciated. This allows you to change the size of the game hub (or remove it entirely), remove cross-hairs, change from first-person view to third-person, etc.

This is a lengthy game, and at my time of completion of the storyline I have clocked about 37 hours of playtime. For this length and the high quality of this game, I feel that the current asking price is more than fair.

10/10 would erase from my memory and play again.

The Talos Principle
Simply wonderful, one of the finest games I've ever played.

Puzzle mechanics are straightforward but brilliantly implemented and iterative, providing just enough challenge. An intruiging story is played out using text snippets and great narration.

If you enjoyed the Portal games even a little, there'll be something here for you to love.

The Talos Principle
A terminal kept making valid arguments against all my beliefs. 10/10 would question my own existence again.

The Talos Principle
*Since this review was getting more attention, I decided to add to my review down at the bottom.*


The best thing, hands down, about The Talos Principle, is that it runs on my piece of junk laptop, and it still looks beautiful. So, if you're worried about your computer not being able to run the game, then fear not. I have a crappy integrated graphics card, and I can still run this game and its silky smooth.

Now, lets get to the gameplay.

As others have said, you are just dropped into the world, and expected to figure things out for your self. There is no 'tutorial' on what objects do what or how you are supposed to solve a puzzle. You just figure it out.

One of my other favorite things about the game is the little QR codes that are strewn about the levels/world. Past 'test subjects' would leave notes for future 'test subjects'. Now, you can point your cursor at the QR code in game and it will display it, but I decided to download a QR code reader on my smart phone and scanned it with my camera and it reads it. Which I find is a really nice touch.

All in all, this is a fantastic and beautiful puzzle game. If you are a portal fan, then you'll deffinitely want to get this game. And remember, it will run smoothly on the crappiest of rigs.

*Addition*

-Since this review is gaining more attention, I decided to add a little more to my origional review of The Talos Principle.

One of the things I failed to mention the first time, is how the game is sort of non-linear.
There are 3 'for the sake of this review, lets call them sections' sections. A, B, and C. in each section, there are multiple worlds. In each world, there are multiple puzzles. If you're stuck on a puzzle, and can't figure it out, then you can just walk away and go to a different puzzle. When you're in the worlds, you can solve the puzzles in any order that you want and at your own pace, which I find really nice.

Make sure to fully explore the worlds as well. There are many hidden QR codes and terminals and secrets to discover.

The Talos Principle
Believe the hype. Believe the 10/10 net reviews. They are the truth.

I hadn't heard of The Talos Principle and frankly can't remember where I heard of it. I think the PC Gamer RSS feed. No matter. I'll be the first to admit that puzzle games aren't in any way my genre of preference - I'm much more likely to be found playing games such as Unreal Tournament, Mechwarrior Online or a hard-core flight sim. Puzzle games, until now, really haven't captured my imagination or interest.

The thing that drew me to the Talos Principle was the notion that it combined a puzzle game, and a beautifully rendered one at that, with notions of the meaning of intelligence, the question of how life" can be defined

The Talos Principle
It's phenomenal. It's a first person puzzler, so naturally there are comparisons to Portal.

Basically it's Portal with some different tools at your disposal and instead of making you laugh, it makes you question your entire existence.

10/10 would quit my job and cry in a corner.

The Talos Principle
This game is awesome.
Great puzzles that are fun to solve.
Love the story
the music is so calming
I am enjoying every minute of it.


The Talos Principle
If you haven't played Portal, go and play it first. Because if you play The Talos Principle first, Portal will then seem much less awesome. ;-)

The Talos Principle
do you like portal? do you wish portal was about 10 times longer and took itself really really seriously? Then this is the game for you!

The Talos Principle
Ive been pleasantly surprised by games before, but never have I been so biased against a game prior to its release then subsequently impressed by every aspect of it upon playing. From the developers of Serious Sam, one of my least favorite franchises. I bet I will really enjoy this, I sarcastically said to myself when the pre-order page went up. I did enjoy it. It is wonderful. It is easily one of the best games Ive played.

The Talos Principle is one giant existential question that can be answered through solving over one hundred smaller, physics-based puzzles under the guidance of your maker, Elohim, whose intimidating voice attempts to influence you from above at every turn. This might seem a strange way to label the games genre, but its accurate and the story manages to never feel at all pretentious despite addressing philosophical subject matter. While the majority of your time is spent solving the smaller puzzles, it always feels as if youre doing it for a higher purpose or to unravel the larger mystery looming overhead, so the game successfully maintains a careful balance where both the story and puzzles are one and equally important.

This journey takes you through several temple-like environments, each containing a number of doorways leading to distinct worlds. In each of these worlds, youll find several self-contained puzzle areas that can also occasionally interact with each other in an advanced way to reveal secrets, and you'll access computer terminals to gradually uncover lore, important context and bits of the story. Completing puzzles rewards you with pieces used to solve tetromino puzzles that unlock doors to new environments, even more puzzles, and new tools used to steadily increase puzzle difficulty and prevent them from becoming stale.

Solving puzzles requires manipulating and avoiding mobile mines, turrets, laser beam connectors, fans and cubes, as well as cooperating with recordings of yourself replaying your actions, but it never gets frantic and youll never feel hurried. Theres no real dexterity or speed requirement here, so you can relax and figure things out at your own pace.

Initially, puzzles arent very challenging but youll come to appreciate how increasingly clever they are. At some point, I thought Id outsmarted the game only to discover later this isnt possible and it was always meant to be so open and unrestrictive. The most difficult puzzles are only required if you want to find all of the secrets within the game and discover as many answers as possible, which is highly recommended and completely worth the effort.

The Talos Principle takes itself seriously and explores concepts like faith, free will, humanity, loyalty and purpose, with your journey unfolding much like that of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden: In the beginning, you don't know or question much and simply follow instructions but, by the time you wander around and have your first taste of knowledge, you may develop a thirst for it and begin to question everything around you. It's easy to become completely engrossed in the setting.

If you don't enjoy reading in games and skip through text, you'll miss out on a lot of what makes The Talos Principle more than just another good game, but it's still worth playing even for the puzzles alone. On a technical level, the game is impeccable: graphics, sound, voice acting, controls and optimization are all top-notch, and there are even settings for proper AA and field of view. The environments are beautiful, as is the soundtrack.

On a final note, QR codes that reveal text are left behind on walls by NPCs and friends who have played the game before you, and you can also leave these pre-written messages for your Steam friends. One of these messages claims youve discovered the most beautiful spot in the game and, as there is a number of beautiful landscapes, I had been trying to decide where to leave that message for quite a while. I had been playing in first-person the entire time and ultimately left the message somewhere I never expected to: next to a mirror I encountered late in the game. Its something that will only make sense if you end up loving the game as much as I do, but it was completely appropriate.

The Talos Principle
The Talos Principle is a puzzle game developed by Croeam and published by Devolver Digital. It was released on Steam in December 2014, before later being released on PS4 in October 2015.

The game play within Talos could be considered very similar to that of Portal. You can play in either first person or third person, as you are presented with tons of puzzles on every stage. Each stage you complete, you unlock a new tool that you will need to use in some form in the following stage. I really liked this way of introducing new mechanics to the game as it lets you get to grips with the previous set very easily before dumping a ton of new stuff on you again. The puzzles start off quite easily as you would expect in the game but they soon take a very high difficulty rise, meaning I was completely stumped for the most of my play through. There is an element of trial and error with a lot of the puzzles as there is a quick reset button to use that takes you right back to the start of the puzzle and you will end up having to do this a lot.

Graphically I was very impressed with The Talos Principle; it looks clean and fresh with extremely high production values. The lighting and weather effects in the game are stellar and really take it to a new level of quality. I was playing at 4k with the majority of the settings turned up to the max, apart from antialiasing. I did however get motion sickness whilst playing in first person view; I think it was a mixture of the speed that the character was traveling at and the motion blur. I had to eventually switch from first person to third person and this solved the problem. The game runs on Serious Engine 4  this is the only game to use it so far, but it is almost identical to serious engine 3 and 3.5 which were used in the latest Serious Sam titles.

I found the plot to be very interesting, having really enjoyed Greek mythology from other games, my interested was peeked from the get go. There are a lot of extra bits of plot and lore to learn about through collectables and computer terminals for you to access as you explore the different levels. I took a lot of time to seek them all out to learn as much as possible.  The game has various different endings as well depending on how you progress throughout your play through.

Like I said above, the difficulty really scales quite highly as you get past the first or second stage of levels. I had to use walkthroughs to even come close to finishing the game and even then I struggled and had to refer to videos as well! Whilst I found the game play to remind me a lot of Portal, the difficulty is certainly on a different scale compared. If you plan on playing this game without the aid of guides or wikis, then you are in for a real brain twister as some of the solutions to puzzles are so far out of the box that they were not even on my radar.

I finished the game in just over twenty hours, so there is a lot of content, even for someone who thought I was completing the puzzles quite quickly with the guides. Not to mention the games various different endings you can explore too. There are a lot of achievements you can unlock in each of the puzzles throughout the game, which may add some replay ability on as well.  Personally I find myself not wanting to go through again purely because I am normally not a massive fan of puzzle games.

I didnt have any technical problems apart from the motion sickness issue as noted above, the game runs very well on 4k resolution at 60+ fps. It looks to be a very well optimized engine that I will be eagerly anticipating what else comes out of it. The game can be played with a controller but given the movement and preciseness of some of the actions you have to take, I would strongly recommend using a keyboard and mouse.

My conclusion on The Talos Principle is quite simple. If you are a fan of mind bending puzzles with really obscure solutions to them, then you are going to absolutely love this game. If you are like me and are only going to manage the first two stages without a guide, you may want to err on the side of caution with your purchase. Whilst I am going to recommend this game, it definitely gets a lot of bonus points from the extremely high productions values on show from the start right until the final scenes. As someone who has the brain like a sieve and finds the puzzle side of the game to be difficult I didnt enjoy it as much as other games.

The Talos Principle
If you told me at the start of the year that a puzzle game with philosophical undertones from the developers of Serious Sam would be one of the years best titles, I probably wouldnt have believed you. However this is very much the case as The Talos Principle is a fascinating and mentally invigorating experience with clever puzzles and a highly intriguing philosophy laden science fiction backdrop. The game slowly generates an atmosphere of mind-bending contemplation unlike anything I have experienced before in games thanks to a potent mixture of clever writing and music that starts to get under your skin. I think only 2001 A Space Odyssey has given me the same feeling before.

The puzzles themselves are the star of the show however with a good difficulty curve and consistently excellent design. Some puzzles which have you dodging floating mines can be annoying, but the vast majority require clever thinking rather than quick reflexes or good timing. The puzzles are short but require you to use existing mechanics in new and surprising ways. The game lets you figure almost everything for yourself, from the story to the mechanics, but the world and puzzles are laid out in such a way that this is generally not a problem. There are loads of secrets/optional challenges that help add further substance to the game after you finish working through the main set of puzzles. I did not spend a lot of time going after these and finished the game in about 15 hours, I would say it is well worth the forty dollar asking price.

If you have even a passing interest in puzzle games and dont mind confronting some heavy philosophical/nihilist ideas (among some more hopeful ones), I cant recommend The Talos Principle highly enough.

The Talos Principle
Game recipe" so far:
--> "Portal 2 memories are back"
--> a lot of great riddles - starting from easy to hardcore
--> different kind of riddle types like the linear ones

The Talos Principle
I don't write reviews for games much.
I don't finish many of my games.
I don't usually go back to games I've finished to get all the endings.
I don't normally get heavily invested into storylines of games too much.

This game changed everything.
This game was awesome.

The Talos Principle
This game is amazing - it's my favourite puzzle game (even above both Portals).

PuzzlesThe puzzles themselves were fantastic - just the right level of challenging for me. Some I breezed through, some required some head scratching, and a couple required coming back a couple times with fresh perspectives - and all felt good and rewarding at the end. Super satisfying.
That's just the normal puzzles, though. The gold star puzzles wrinkled my brain in a good way - I'd say I got maybe 60% unassisted, and the rest kicked my  (most of them in a good way, although there were a couple that I never would have gotten). A fantastic stretch if you really wanna go the extra mile.
And the last layer on top of the puzzles and gold stars is the easter eggs - they're everywhere. Some are easier to find than others, but oh man, they're everywhere, very clever, and stealthily hid. I found three out of I can only assume dozens.

PlotA puzzle game is all well and good, but how is it tied together? Portal did so in a comedic meta way - Portal 1 was pretty much all comedy, where Portal 2 did have a bit of a plot to piece together. The Talos Principle has comedy, but each puzzle draws you closer to piecing together the whole story, which is very compelling. It's a clever premise well executed that absolutely adds to the mechanic.
And I really did love the story here. Plenty of little bits and pieces to keep you interested, building the world as you went. From reading texts to hearing audiologs to reading QR codes left by others, it all merges together to make a fantastic experience.

And yes, I cried at the end. While there are games for which this wouldn't be a surprise, this one did surprise me. It's a puzzle game! But the whole thing was so artfully executed I couldn't help but get drawn in. Beautiful and poignant and sad and hopeful and amazing.

I look forward to playing it again. <3

The Talos Principle
Portal + Myst + Philosophy + Ruins (+ Skyrim???) = The Talos Principle

One of the best puzzle games to hit the market since Portal. Are you a fan of Portal? You'll love it! Are you a fan of puzzle games in general? You'll love it! Are you a fan of anything? You'll love it!

If you liked the Public Test, then you will love the full game! But don't take my word for it, play it yourself :)

9.5/10

The Talos Principle
Its just as good as first Portal. If you like that game - you are going to love Talos.

Lots of secrets and references to other games, movies and sci-fi novels (even Philip D*i*c*k!), lots of puzzles, good music and graphics, as well as deep and meaningful story.

You just have to own it if you are tired of playing dumbed down RPG's, unfinished strategy games or boring shooters.

Finished in 29 hours with every single achievement. GIVE MULTIPLAYER DLC!

The Talos Principle
Easily the most thought-provoking game I've ever played. I enjoyed the story and philosophy much more than the gameplay. Although the core mechanics are solid, it felt like the game was too long. The sheer number of puzzles felt tedious at times.

The story is interesting and does a good job of revealing itself at a good pace, always keeping you curious and trying to figure out your character's purpose, the world itself and the story of why it was created. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending.

The game foreshadows issues and ideas around artificial intelligence that could potentially become very real in the next century or so, and for a game that's very impressive. Ultimately how much you take away from this game depends on how much you know and care about AI and philosophy, but I thought it was awesome.

9/10

The Talos Principle
My favorite game by far in 2014 (and in the last couple years, probably), was The Talos Principle.  It was as if this game was specifically made for me.

The most important things for me in single player games are:

- the quality and inventiveness of the mechanicsand whether or not I can manipulate them in a meaningful way
- immersion (which usually means first-person perspective, excellent sound design, etc..),
- the writing/story

Regarding mechanics, combat-focused games are the majority in the industryespecially on PC and especially in first-person gamesso those that arent centered on combat often must work more creatively to be interestinggames like Myst (1993) and Portal (2007). This is also true of games which have combat, but also offer non-combative methods to play through the game (stealth/sneaking, for example)ie., Deus Ex (2000), Splinter Cell (2002), and Dishonored (2012). These are my favorite types of gamesespecially the latter, perhaps because the avoidance of combat adds a further complication to the mechanics of gameplay. So, I was really excited about the First Person Puzzle design of Talos when I played the demo at PAX Prime 2014. It was love at first sight in the demo booth. I had trouble getting through the last couple demo levels on my first try, but it was still extremely satisfying and fun. As I sat struggling with the connectors and fans and boxes, of the fellows from Croteam warned me the Enforcers were coming to run everyone out of the Indie Megabooth, but told me to come back the next day to finish the demotheyd get me back where Id left off. So I went back the next morning, finished the demo, and gushed to Croteam about how interesting I found the game and how excited I was to play it on release. I tried to explain that it reminded me of playing Deus Ex and System Shock 2. Its hard to articulate exactly how Talos relates to these types of games, but they all give me the same kind of satisfaction upon completing an area, even if the mechanics and design are quite differentthe end feeling as a player is similar, so theres some kind of overlap in how the gameplay works on the player. And the first-person immersion helps with that. (I should note here that you can play the game in third-person and easily switch between first- and third-person. I simply prefer first.)

More on gameplay: the puzzles were great. I found the most satisfying bits to be finding the optional stars because I had to find ways to break the game (or at least The Great Voice in the Skys intentions hehe) to get them. The puzzles in generalsigils, stars, and easter eggshad that kind of excellent satisfaction to themsome of them were teaching the player the possibility of the mechanics, while others encouraged the player to break beyond the narrow way in which puzzle/first-person mechanics usually work. As I mentioned, in some ways Talos really reminded me of experiences playing the original Deus Ex and System Shock 2; there were ways to play those games that literally did break them, just because of the limitations of game development/AI functionality at the time. Thats not to mention that they had multiple routes to play the levels built in already. Talos also achieved the same type of feeling that the Half-Life games produce where it feels like youre breaking the gamepulling one over on the level designers and outsmarting the gamebut in reality that is because levels were designed so well. They were built in a way to teach you to break the limitations and expectations of regular gameplay. I remember the first time I got stuck in Half-Life and after I searched every possible route out of the area, realizing I could climb on the pipes to escape where I waslike, I was so shocked that there was platforming in my FPS! I remember feeling as if I was outsmarting the game, but looking back, of course there really was no other way to get out of the level. Yet it was built in a way that made that fact satisfying instead of frustrating.

Another thing worth mentioning: the QR codes. Without saying much, there is functionality built into the game to leave messages on the walls for other players (people on your Steam friends list) to see later. It might seem like a small thingbut it really was a great little touch and made the game even more immersive.

So I was super hyped for Taloss gameplay, and it still delivered beyond my expectations. But I gotta say that the writing and storyline was on the same level, in really impressive ways. It was subtle but powerful, andwithout saying too muchI liked how it played with the ideas of free will and game-imposed confines of choice. I guess what I mean is, the gamemechanics-wisewere already top notch quality and impressive. But the storythe character development through audio logs, the slow revelation of the story through classical literature and other text artifacts, the QR codes, the interactions with the terminalsmade it even richer. Basically Talos combined all of my favorite aspects about video games in a really fresh, great way. And it also took advantage of some of the best avenues that science fiction opens up for those ever-important literary questions... What is the world like, and what does it mean to be human in that world? Despite the rambling nature of this post, I actually double majored in Literature and History at university. So this game just... I feel like this game was made for me. And I was made to play it! (All that saidif youre not interested in story, you can completely ignore and not investigate any of that and still enjoy the game for its excellent mechanics. But Id still recommend getting into the story!)

All in all, I recommend it 100%. Well designed, highly polished, and super cool devs!

The Talos Principle -      Croteam

The Talos Principle
There are plenty of well-written and thought out reviews for this game already present, and I think you should read them. I just want to quickly tell you why this game is easily the best game I've played in a few years.

-The graphics are astouding
-The environment is built so carefully and thoughtfully that you could spend hours wandering around and enjoying nature.
-There is an unbelievable amount of content in this game, and it will likely take you between 15-20 (or more) hours to do everything.
-Replay value is extremely high
-Puzzles are well crafted, and the learning curve is balanced
-Ultimately you get to choose what you want to do and when
-There is a well made hint system that actually ties in with the game
-Puzzles can interact with each other, and are not always confined within a space
-Voice acting is intoxicating
-Sound in general is well done
-Music is perfect (I'll probably be buying the ost)
-The story is very enoyable and mysterious (A game hasn't pulled me in like this since the early myst games)
-Your thoughts and views on the world and what it means to be human are constantly questioned
-This game in general makes you think (a lot)
-There is a HUGE amount of background information in the form of text and audio logs

I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time, and I have not been disappointed with it at all.

Please please please do yourself a favor and buy this game if you are into puzzles games with a good story. Normaly I really think about whether or not I want to spend the money to buy a game, but I can tell you that this one is worth it, and I have no regrets about getting it.

It really has been nothing but an amazing experience.

10/10

The Talos Principle
We have a winner here people! This is one of the best games i have EVER played. I believe it's a must-have for every fan of the puzzle genre, Croteam did an outstanding job with this one. You can see from the very beginning how much they cared about their game, how much they wanted it to succeed. This is nothing like the uninspired, unoptimized cash-grabbing console ports we are used to nowadays.

But let me correct myself. This is not just a game, it is an experience. The talos principle will make you question your existence, your purpose in life. Even if you aren't really into philosophy, it will make you go look up some quotes of famous philosophers.
Every aspect of it is superb, the riddles, the visuals, the atmosphere, the music, everything works out.
Don't expect it to hold your hand though. The puzzles may seem easy peasy in the beginning but as you progress they will become harder and harder. There are some really difficult ones later in the game, so get ready for the challenge!

In conclusion, i can't recommend it enough. This is a masterpiece. I bought it at full price but it was worth it. No regrets!

The Talos Principle
Very nifty and unique puzzle game, best of its kind I've played since Portal. Definitely worth checking out if you want a smart game that'll actually challenge you to think (outside the box too). It's actually rare to find a game experience like this nowadays that isn't all about linear action or a single goal" but more progressing at your own pace and provoking thoughts about the world you're in. Well optimized with great graphics too.

Difficulty is lenient unlike in many other puzzle games and you're not forced to complete every single puzzle which is a huge plus. Instead

The Talos Principle
One of the smartest puzzle games you will play. This is not a puzzle game where reflexes are important; the placement of items, using all your tools efficiently and remembering previous solutions is crucial. Puzzle devices are excellent, from the laser prisms to the record function. Youll move boxes, deploy jammers, connect laser beams, avoid mines and float into the air before squealing with satisfaction. The record function is worth noting, as it allows you to interact with your previous actions to solve puzzles in real time. Watching your old self falter is thematically perfect and syncing moves with this recording is out of this world.  It is rare to see a game build healthy mechanics and deploy them in such a clever way, but The Talos Principle does it with elegance.

The Talos Principle
This game has everything to become a cult classic. I have never played anything like this.

The story is amazing and beautifully written. Although you seem to be alone with your creator in a mysterious world, you have a lot of characters and stories to follow. It has amazing scenery, beautiful photographic graphics together with a gorgeous fitting soundtrack. Every single detail in the world is perfectly crafted and it feels good just to be there, exploring. And exploration plays a big part in this game, just as big as solving the puzzles. That is why this game is so special: this is not just a solve-puzzles game.

You explore. You find secrets. You play a role. You are an important character. You have choices and consequences. You are part of something mysterious. You are in a story that will, maybe, make you question your own existence.

I wish I hadn't to talk about Portal, but I will say this: the gameplay is only similar to Portal in the fps puzzle genre, altho the puzzles are, I believe, more engaging, challenging and fun to solve than Portal.

Please give this game a chance if you like to be submerged into compelling stories and worlds. This is a very special game.

The Talos Principle
This is a very fun, very engaging puzzle game a la portal.  The puzzles range from just walking around doing them without having to think to complex brainteasers.  luckily you don't need to complete every puzzle to advance so if something is just taking up your time with no progress you can come back later.

The game is about being an android and solving puzzles for god, while questioning if you really are 'alive' or not.  I'm not going to spoil anything about the story except that there are multiple sides.  The game does require a significant amount of reading if you want to understand what is actually going on, and while encouraging exploration through the various mini-hubs there is no actual need to.  Still its got some beautiful environments and I enjoyed just walking along the beach at several points.

While in the puzzles themselves you can see the difficulty rating, the only time that I became frustrated at the game itself was in the hardest difficulty rooms, though stopping and coming back to them after calming down helps fix that.  The green and yellow puzzles are all very intuitive and yet very satisfying to complete, while the red ones atleast for me can become slightly tedious every now and then.

Once you complete the majority of the game and are just left with red puzzles to solve It can be frustrating, though overall the game is a very rewarding experience that I have not had since portal, the game takes a more serious stance while providing a very calm atmosphere and interesting philosophical questions to ask oneself.

DISCLOSURE: I received a review copy of this game,  I do not believe it has affected my judgment of this at all but I like to let my readers know.

The Talos Principle
Most brilliant puzzle game I have ever played, I'm happy Croteam made this before they continued to work on the next Serious Sam because it shows that rather than give everyone what they wanted, they completed a task that THEY wanted to make. If Developers make a game because they WANT to rather than everyone else wants them to, the project will recieve the most love possible. As a result this game has amazing storyline and challenging puzzles to complete. Worth every dollar and I hope everyone who reads this feels that it is worth to purchase this game. 10/10

The Talos Principle
A bit reductive but - the gameplay is very similar to portal, but the story telling is completely different.  Where Portal is hilarious and upbeat, this game is nostalgic and philosophical.

First game I actually take the time to reccomand on Steam.

The Talos Principle
A lot of people are rightfully comparing this to the Portal series.  But, in reality Portal pioneered an entirely new genre mashup that had never been done before.  So, yes, The Talos Principle is in the same genre.  Once you get past that, the overall experience of Talos is unbelieveably entertaining, unique, and frankly mind-blowing.

Some highlights:
+ Puzzle difficuly progression is engineered to perfection.   Just like Portal! :D
+ The graphics and ambiance aren't state of the art, but they are absolutely perfect for the game.  Art direction is Oscar worthy.
+ The story from start to finish is a masterpiece of expectation engineering.  You think you know what the point is.  But you really don't.
+ If you've paid attention to all the details of the various story arcs, you will walk away from the game feeling like you just experienced three distinct but bound stories.  This game is like getting three experiences in one.  It's a hell of a deal.
+ There are fascinating side game mechanics that are really rewarding if you decide to spend the time.
+ You can cheat.  But it's as if the engineers designed the cheating mechanics on purpose.  It's possible to get lost for hours trying to find ways to hack various challenges.  In other words, don't assume there is only one way.
+ It's been a LONG time since I've played a game with refined movement mechanics and keyboard control of this caliber.  It's unbelieveably well thought out.  +5000 to the QA team for working this all out.

Number one reason to play:
If you REALLY take the time to ponder what's being suggested during the game, you will literally walk away from the game experience with an altered perspective on reality.  For the better!  IMO, this type of effect is priceless in a game.  A legit philosophical education wrapped in an unbelievably entertaining package.  Wow.  I wish more design houses would focus on the Portal genre.






The Talos Principle
I believe every single human being on the planet should play this game.

Don't be fooled by other reviews, this game is not Portal. It is far greater.
(Did you know puzzle games existed way before Portal, kids?)

The Talos Principle
Croteam, after their hallmark series Serious Sam managed to create the first puzzler game on the level of Portal 2, which was unexpected, to say the least. After having played through the game, it is definitely my game of the year 2014 for various reasons, which I'll break below into several sections:

PlotAt the start of the game, you awaken as a android which is tasked with solving puzzles, for which Elohim - your maker, promises you eternal life. The story is told mostly through logs found in terminals scattered around the world, but also serve for communication with Milton, a library assistant and an intelligence with which you discuss some intriguing philosophical dilemmas. While Elohim encourages the player to explore it's creations, he explicitly prohibits venturing into the tower, which soars into the sky. As the story progresses, Milton encourages the player to act independently, and motivates him to enter the tower and find out the truth for himself.

GameplayThe game starts slowly by introducing gameplay elements (some of which are unlocked by solving specific puzzles) and the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up pretty fast, but they are never unfair - even if some of them may be excruciatingly hard. If there is a situation where the player may get stuck, it's because some specific mechanics and uses of elements aren't expected or explained beforehand. Example: some puzzles utilize your own body for intentionally blocking lasers, which the player himself might not think for some time. One thing that may get on some player's nerves is the reset ability, which you will use at some point to unstuck yourself from an unsolvable jam. It resets the entire room along with all the progress you might have made, which can be somewhat annoying in longer puzzles which take some time to progress through. Once you do solve a particularly tricky puzzle, you are glad you persisted and managed to solve it on your own. On most puzzles there is a shrine you can use to get a hint if you get stuck (although some hints are too vague and don't help as you might expect), but getting that hint requires solving some hidden puzzles which are not a part of the main story, but are worth exploring any ways as they have the most beautiful locations in the entire game. If you find yourself a bit short on hints, you may want to play Sigils of Elohim, a free companion mini-game in which you may get an additional 3 hints.
There are four worlds in the game, which go as follows:
Mediterranean - ancient Greek/Roman themed world
Egypt - puzzles spread out in the desert, borrowed aesthetics from Serious Sam 3
Medieval - typical medieval style with ruined castles in a forest
Tundra - the main" world in which the tower and the three other hub worlds are located

You start your adventure in the Mediterranean world and gradually unlock the Egypt and medieval worlds with puzzles

The Talos Principle
It is like Portal if Portal asked you what it meant to be a human.

The Talos Principle
I usually don't write reviews on games but I have to say something about this game.
I read a bit about it before I bought it but I never imagined a game could play mind tricks on me.
It's one of those games that have a higher purpose of sort, a game that is made by a developer who thinks of games as an art form.
Can a puzzle game be an art form? they sure try to make it so here.

First of all the game world itself is beautifully rendered and it's pretty big, each area is big and there seems to be a lot of areas in the game - after playing only two hours and opening only 2 areas I realize there are a lot more areas to open...
But, about the size of the areas, it's keep on puzzeling me, why are they so big?
We already know that an FPS puzzle game can work (Portal 1 and 2) and their world wasn't that big, but in this game the areas are way bigger then they should be and it drives me nuts! I feel like I'm missing things in places where I shouldn't" reach.

Second of all

The Talos Principle
Enjoyment = True ; Dissapointment = False

The Talos Principle
This game makes you question everything. I'm not even sure if I'm a person anymore. 10/10

The Talos Principle
Ah, christ... this game, this ing game... I don't think I've ever had such an emotionally exhausting love-hate relationship like this with any other game I've ever played. It was like being in an abusive relationship. The first 10-15 hours of the game were exhilarating, narratively interesting, and created a strong motivation to see what was in each new puzzle room/world, but over the next 10-15 hours it gradually descended into a painfully dull, repetitive, utterly frustrating exercise in endurance. Towards the end I kept going back *just* to complete it, because sometimes it was *still* fun (and I was desperate for narrative closure), but most of the latter half of the game was just mind-numbingly frustrating, like nothing else I've ever played. I almost wanted to cry in frustration during the final levels.

So... at the start, the game sets up the world and teaches you the mechanics of the puzzles extremely well. The graphics are beautiful, the voice acting is superb, and the story is slowly unveiled to you through terminals and audio logs found throughout the world, which (initially) gives a strong motivation to explore everywhere in the hope of discovering little secrets about the overarching story. Each few sets of puzzles introduce new tools you can use to solve the puzzles, which keeps the puzzling entertaining and fresh during the first half of the game. I felt a real sense of progression and reward, and was itching to see what was in the next room and on the next terminal.

Problems start to begin somewhere in the second world, about 10 hours in. It becomes clear that there are just WAY too many puzzles with too little variation. There is a very long time where no new puzzle solving mechanic is introduced, where it begins to feel like you're doing the same thing for almost every single puzzle, albeit in a slightly more complicated fashion each time. It's also during this time that the story starts to become stale and predictable. I won't spoil it, but believe me: very little of note is revealed to the player after the first half of the game. The exact same themes are covered over and over again, but the themes aren't exactly *that* complicated to begin with. It starts to feel like a prolonged philosophy 101 seminar debate. What is life? Are robots alive? What is consciousness? Can robots be ethical? Is God real? Should you obey God? Interesting questions the first time they are discussed, but pretty dull after being re-stated over and over (and believe me, they are re-stated so many times with so little variation). Also, the overarching point of the game world and the (main) ending are extremely obvious quite close to the start of the game. By the time I eventually completed it, I wasn't even slightly surprised. It felt like an obvious narrative going through the motions to reach it's obvious conclusion.

All of this is a monumental shame, because the first 10 hours were an absolute joy. I would have given this game a glowing review had I written this 15 hours ago. But now... I just can't. I never want to see another ing connector, another fan, or another jammer again in my life. The developers took a beautiful thing and ran it into the ground.

How to Survive
edit: updating review. evidently its getting some attention, so I figured I might as well expand and clarify.

tl;dr edition: neither good nor fun. do not buy unless its deeply discounted.

I can not refer this game in good faith. There are 2 major things wrong with How to Survive.

Firstly, take a look at the DLC. If How to Survive truly is an indie game, control of the project has been overtaken by greedhead corporate dumb think leadership. Someone (likely 505 Games) has opted to make DLCs out of basic features that should have been part of the basic game. Examples are an extra harder difficulty and a hardcore feature. Other DLCs (Heatwave) resemble what would have been unlockables for games only a generation ago. Lastly there are the DLCs that suggest the core game was released unfinished taking the cutting room floor scraps and selling them off as DLC when they got to them later. I don't know if the nickel and diming customers business model bothers you, but it sure as hell bothers me.

The second problem is the game itself. Its not good. How to Survive is a perfect example of the tidalwave of schlock being put out by the burgeonning indie industry. It is an inferior imitation of mainstream titles like Diablo and Torchlight. It tries to be unique and original with additional survival features like hunger, thirst, and sleepiness, but they're implemented in a way that make the game tedious and annoying. The quality is painfully amateur and inconsistent. Struggle as a melee character, but have 2 triple bladed boomerangs and you're so golden the game gets dull. The content is particularly slim. Each island is painfully small. And the game itself manages to be as repetitive as Diablo and Torchlight, but in the most flat, boring, and completely unrewarding manner possible.

How to Survive lives up to its lousy meta score. No idea why this game has such an overwhelmingly high positive customer review count. The $15 asking price with the lazy DLCs is crazy to me. Other games How to Survive is trying to be are the same exact price and offer more and better quality content minus the annoying survival gimmicks and DLC. Specifically either of the Torchlight games.

Honestly, my recommendation is to not buy How to Survive at all. If you absolutely must take the plunge, as stated in the tl;dr above, buy it when its 80-90% off. That way you won't feel too ripped off when you find out how painfully below average it is.

How to Survive
Now first lets get the positive out of the way.
The games graphics are fine for what it is.
The story can be funny sometimes.
The co-op challenges can be fun with a friend.

Now lets get to the real review where we look at what they promised and what they delivered.
The game is an ok size however it's extreamly limited in size for it's price.

If you forced yourself to go slow you would take maybe 6 hours to finish this game.

Another problem  is the content  the guns,melee weps, mutants ect is all really limiting.
Some might disagree with me there but think about it theres maybe 8 guns, 3 chainsaws , 6 melee weps and 1 ammoless total op wep.

Now for my Largest disapointment with this game it's promise  experience for zombie game veterans"

There is NOTHING veteran about this game it hands everything to you on a silver platter.
There's sleep areas at night prebuilt impervise to any zombie attack that you only need to clear out once.

Night creatures are as deadly as a new born kitten.
Ammo is WAY too common i had 2

How to Survive
Once Bitten, Twice Shy
A fun, 'Diablo'-esque Third-Person RPG, How to Survive" caught me a little off guard. At $2.25 (Summer Sale 2014)

How to Survive
Don't get tricked into thinming this is a 3rd person zombie survival. It's like dead island but in a 3rd person perspective, giving us a barebones diablo clone with no enemy variety. You talk to NPCs and do quests, you can craft many weapons, but as long as you get the bone shurikens you should have no trouble.

The cutscenes for the how to survive" book are sometimes clever and funny. But it's far from enough to save this game.

If you would have to get it regardless

How to Survive
I get the impression that I don't understand How to Survive.  The number of legitimate looking positive reviews indicates that whilst others have enjoyed the game I haven't.

The survival element from which the game takes it's name seems tacked on with little effect on game-play.  In the hours I've played I've never come close to starving or dehydrating.  A little message pops up telling you that you're becoming thirsty or hungry and that's solved by drinking or eating one of the many things in your inventory.

There are wells and bottles and canisters everywhere; I've haven't felt any tension or had to go on an epic quest to find water.  There are also edible plants everywhere so whilst meat might not always be on the menu starving is not going to happen.

Sleeping is ... strange.  There's no building or reinforcing shelters and no bedrolls or similar.  There is one special shack per island that has a closeable door.  That's the only place where you can sleep.  If you're 51% tired you can't sleep but if you're 49% tired than you must.  There's no wait command so sleeping through the night won't happen unless leave your character to get tired.

As survival games go there's no real element of survival in 'How to Survive'.  Fallout 3 with Primary Needs or State of Decay will give you a much better experience.



How to Survive
This game starts fun. The graphics are decent for the top-down style. Good lighting and water effects. Day and night cycle where night really amps up the challenge by making you watch your back constantly. A diverse crafting system. Decent skill tree options. Some of the voice acting is funny (I think intentionally) and unique.

I liked the survival aspects, which is the point of the game. You have to monitor your hunger, thirst, rest, and health. It's all manageable. You can collect empty bottles to store up water reserves, hunt animals and collect plants to cook at a campfire for food, collect herbs and create bandages to restore health, and secure a bunker to sleep in.

The combat is solid. The controls are easy. You craft increasingly strong weapons as you progress and different weapons have unique advantages. The machete cuts through plants and carves arrows from sticks, the bow is powerful and the arrows recoverable, the gun is rapid fire with plenty of ammo on the islands, the boomerang is very powerful but not as smooth and fast as the bow, etc. Melee combat animations are fluid with just enough variety--more than I expected from a game with this visual style.

While the gameplay mechanics are very solid, the storyline becomes more of a chore than fun unfortunately. It's a series of fetch quests that take you back and forth across the maps. Every time you pass one direction and clear the large amount of zombies, you have to then fight them all over again on the way back due to a fast respawn rate. This turned the game into a slow fetch quest grind for me and I lost interest about halfway through. If you make a wrong turn, it's even worse, because now you're fighting respawns over and over and you're not even in the right spot of the map.

You can't save the game except at story checkpoints and that can take a bit of time. Perhaps, if I could save at will, I could have tolerated the grind in smaller doses.

Maybe it's just me, but I had trouble with the quest early on where I had to collect meat from a deer. I kept wandering the map looking for deer and could never find them. When I finally would spot one, I would have to clear hordes of zombies to clear a path to it and these actions usually scared the deer away, leaving me to wander yet some more. The worst is when you're hunting deer at night and the extra zombies come to chase you down. You need to keep your flashlight on these nighttime zombies to keep them at bay, which makes focusing on the fleeting deer more difficult. The game says you can track the deer once you injure it by following blood on the ground. It's not that easy to do when the ground is already covered in excessive blood from slaying zombies. I eventually caught the deer and made the mistake of cooking the meat, which didn't complete the quest, so I had to repeat it all over again.

I really wanted to like this game. I actually told my friends how much I enjoyed it at the beginning. Then the grind just beat me down.

There is also inventory issues. Some of the crafting recipes call for 5 or 6 items. You're already stocking ammo, weapons, water, food, bandages, quest items, etc and the 25-item inventory fills fast. I don't really consider this a negative, because it more accurately reflects the reality of surviving on these islands. It might frustrate some players though. 25 slots is still considerably more than some games permit.

One small nitpick when it comes to resting: you aren't allowed to unless your rest meter is low enough. One time I was by a shelter at just over 50% fatigue. I couldn't rest before setting out on the next leg of my journey. That's just silly, because you can make adjustments on the other survival factors whenever you please.

As much as I would like to recommend this game for all its positive, interesting concepts, I just can't because the story is a major drag.

How to Survive
I bought this game on sale, thought, what the hell.  What a pleasant surprise.  It's like Diablo 2 gameplay, with zombies/mutants as your enemies, and one of four survivors as your hero.  The gameplay is very fun, although it does get a bit stale with a lack of diversity among the zombies/mutants.  Couple the lack of diversity with a completely OP weapon (cough, triple boomerang) and you've got a recipe for boredom.  If you want the story mode to remain challenging, I highly recommend avoiding any boomerang, as they are fast, powerful, ammo-less, and there's no such thing as durability in this game.  Killing zombies with a shotgun made out of a tube and duct tape is much more rewarding anyway, right?

Still, easily worth $15 and a play through or two.  The challenges are were the challenge is (play on words intended).  You get your character dropped on an island with no equipment, a real out of the freezer into the frying pan" kind of experience.  The challenge is reaching your escape under the allotted time

How to Survive
This review is coming from a stand-point of about 7 hours of solo play.

Do I like this game? It's okay, I mean, it's nothing special, it's a twin-stick zombie survival game with a somewhat interesting crafting system.

The game-play, it's basic and easy to understand as all twin-stick games are. Nothing new. Which is totally fine, I mean it's a tried and tested system.

The story, I haven't finished the story, simply because I hit too many BDN (Board, done now) moments. I just couldn't do another fetch quest. That's all this game is, fetch quest after fetch quest after fetch quest. When did I hit my limit? When the drunk pilot wanted his cargo, where was it? All over the islands... All twenty pieces of the damn stuff. I quit, I was done with the game from then on. The characters were, eh. The only person that interested my in any way was Kovac, mainly because SPOILER ALERT he's apparently the one crashing the boats into the islands SPOILER ALERT OVER. I say apparently because I have no idea if he is or not, though if that was him on the radio at the start of the game it makes sense as he seems to have a radio station at the top of his island. I digress. The characters are cliche to say the least, oh no a mother and daughter that are split up on a terrible island, the friend who was bitten but has the thing you need to get off the island, the crazy old lady, the apparent friend who is actually the villain, the disabled knowledgeable one who spends all their time tinkering with your escape rout and the drunk.

May as well look at this games big point, the crafting. It's okay. I mean you can make things, cool yeah, okay. I never bothered with the potions. The guns? Didn't bother with them either. Melee weapons? Rusty machete all the way. After I built the boomerang I just didn't need anything else. Nothing. And when I upped it with the red stone, nothing else would do. Now when I say I didn't bother with it, I mean I built every combination I could within 7 hours of play. Tested it, and still found the boomerang to be the best thing to use. Chainsaw? Nope. Flamethrower? Nope. Shotgun? Nope. Boomerang. Always.

Survival. Pha. My biggest problem surviving was diverting my attention from my current fetch quest to trek to water holes, or where I knew deer were or to safe houses when I got a little tired. Fuel for bombs was the biggest problem for my survival". I had so much food on my person I could have fed all the survivors I had found with ease. Three jerry cans of water kept me going for days. Ammo was of no concern

How to Survive
I really tried to give this game a fair try.  It simply wasn't as interesting or enjoyable as it appeared to be in the Steam store.  The premise is neat but the execution is lacking.  Crafting could be cool, but most of the time your tiny inventory is full up with junk.  You have no homebase so there's nowhere to store excess stuff.   Also, where you sleep for the night is highly limited and really annoying.  There is usually only one secure bed shack per island.  And for some reason, when you go to try and use it, a red light and alarm goes off every time, alerting tons of zombies to your location for no real reason.   The most entertaining aspect of this game is watching the short Kovac's rules" videos.   Save your money and buy State of Decay instead for a much deeper zombie survival crafting game with a better plot."

How to Survive
Personal Rating: I'm having fun killing zombies and running for my life
Classic Rating: 

Pros:

 Story and characters (main game has 3 but you can add Nina with a DLC): You have to escape alive from some zombies' infested Islands. Every character has their onw skills, perks and final attack blows.
 Gameplay: very well implemented twin stick shooter from a top-down perspective.
 Crafting system: one of the best aspect of this game, you get many different ways to craft items, stuff and food.
 Weapons: lots of weapons. My favourites are bow and boomerang - you can fire feathered and fire arrows with the bow, while the boomerang is very useful with a few enemies (it hits when coming back too and you don't waste bullets").
 Graphics: I find this game to be very detailed and aestetically pleasant.
 Sound effects are a bit reapeating over the time but they help a lot to understand incoming enemies.

Cons:

 Lots of quests require you to go searching for some missing "part" and go back once you get it - I'm not really complaining though.
 It's a bit hard to find items scattered on the ground if you don't walk over them (that's how a popup appears and tells you what you found).
 Saves are a bit tricky because you only get one slot

How to Survive
Well i really enjoyed this game and have just finished it,all the time i have added up is actual in game time and i enjoyed every moment of this well made and entertaining game.
Ok you start by picking a character so i choose ABBY (thought she would be faster and have more stamina) and of you go,the graphic's in game are good and the ZOMBIE'S (if thats what they are) come in variou's form's from you standard walk and run and chase (and they really do leg it after you) to other varietie's thet i will let you discover for yourself (allway's best to find thing's out for yourself so no spoiler's here),i will say this there are about 6-7 different type's and i wish there had been more.
The music in game is good and you really do know when something is coming as the tone change's and then LOOK OUT as its usually something you havent seen before.

The script is really well written and my most memorable character is KOVAC,he has been stuck on the island (island's i should say) for some time now and his HOW TO SURVIVE GUIDE" is probablly the funniest thing in the game and the animation that goes with it had me laughing out loud a few time's.
Now dont get me wrong the game isnt a "comedy survival game" at certain points its more "survival horror" as in you have to manage resource's and keep an eye on what you have but KOVAC'S ranting's add a real comedy overtone at certain point's in the game (usually when you find one of the aforementioned "how to survive" pages from his book)
As the game progress'es you come across path's that are blocked and shed's that wont give to your weapon or anything else you are carrying

How to Survive
TL;DR  - This game is boring and repetitive, but a couple of the DLCs will make the game a lot more fun. The Kovac's Way DLC is a MUST HAVE! Without this, the base game is trash. If the difficulty is too hard for you, get Hello my name is... Nina. DLC, her skills make the hardest difficulty more manageable. El Diablo Islands DLC will adds a lot more content if you liked the base game.


DISCLAIMER: I bought all the DLCs, and all my playthru and review is based on my experience of having all the DLCs activated.

WARNING when buying DLCs, the Heat Wave DLC - x 3 pack is the same as Heat Wave DLC - Kenji's pack, Heat Wave DLC - Abby's pack and Heat Wave DLC - Jack's pack combined! DO NOT REPEAT PURCHASE!


The game is quite interesting at first, but it gets boring and repetitive very soon. The game consists of fetch quests from start to finish. While fetching items, you got to take care of your other needs other than health.

During the early game, you might need to spend some time gathering food and resources, but once you venture into 2nd island, food water and sleep are just things that take up some of your limited inventory space. And if you are playing solo, inventory space is VERY LIMITED! I play co-op with my friend, and yet we are still struggling on holding all the quest items and crafting ingredients.

Crafting might seem complicated at first, but in fact there are only a handful of recipes to do.

Playing co-op have their pros and cons.
- Co-op have a very lousy camera. Both players share the same camera, therefore when both players wander too far away from each other, off-screen zombies become very dangerous.
- The connection is quite crappy, it will de-sync every couple of minutes, ruining a lot of fun. Also, the desync will cause the joining player to take a lot of damage sometimes.
- Quest rewards will only be given to the host player, so if the reward is a good gun, only one of you will get to use it.
- Food and drinks must be shared.
+ You have double the inventory slot.
+ You have double the health, so when one is dead the other can try to survive and revive the dead player without having to reload checkpoint.

The other game modes are a waste of time.

If you collect 100% achievements, you will need Kovac's Way DLC, Barricade! DLC, One Shot Escape DLC, and El Diablo Islands. You will also need a lot of patience and luck.

How to Survive
I picked this game up full price, from it's description it sounded like the type of zombie survival game I always wanted to play. Sadly it was a major disappointment, it's survival aspects in name only. All the elements are sort of there, the open" map

How to Survive
An incredibly boring, unbalanced game, that fails to deliver anything meaningful.

First, the crafting: This is the game's only true strength, but it's still lacking. There's only a handful of weapons and minor upgrades to them for you to create. A weak machine gun, an average machine gun, a strong machine gun. A rifle. A wooden bow, a metal bow, two upgrades to add onto them. Everything boils down to a couple of tiers of equipment that do the same thing.

Second, balance: The difficulty curve is all over the place. At the start of the game, you will get mauled, guaranteed, by all the zombies. You'll only have a stick to defend yourself with, which is slow, weak and inefficient against the sheer number of zombies. Then you can finally get a ranged weapon and the game becomes yawn inducing, followed by the second island, where helmeted zombies might actually land a hit on you if there's several of them.

Then you get to the third island and, despite further upgrading your bow AND gun, find that neither are all that effective against the zombies there. How ineffective are they? It takes two perfect head shots to take them down, assuming they don't have a helmet. They also come at you in droves and your movement is slowed by the swamp.

Then you find the recipe for an upgraded boomerang. This weapon outperforms bows and guns quite easily, in terms of speed, damage and lack of ammo consumption. It's only weakness is that you have to wait for the weapon to come back before you can throw it again, but this didn't cause me problems at all. Between the long effective range, high damage and hitting twice, it's often able to take out multiple zombies per throw and the delay is actually pretty low.

Third, the enemies: There is nothing remotely interesting about any of them. There's regular zombies, progressively faster and stronger zombies, fat (explosive) zombies, head crabs and giant zombies. Nothing new to report. Oh, and there's also zombie deer and what I believe are emus. The birds just zerg rush, so they're also boring. The deer attack by charging and can stun you, which makes them one of the more interesting enemies, if only because their speed means they'll actually hit you.

Fourth, the plot and characters: The plot is bland. You're marooned on an island and have to survive. The characters are all varying degrees of insane and unlikable. I'd guess that the game was aiming to be parody, but it's just so unfunny and overall dull that I honestly can't tell if it's being sincere or not.

Fifth, the quests: Every single one is a fetch quest. If it's not a fetch quest at first, it will become one soon enough. Also, get used to failure, because it's guaranteed. Unless it involves getting to another zombie infested island, you're not  actually accomplishing anything.

And then there's the monkeys. With pet parrots. Who give optional fetch quests, because clearly we didn't have enough of them already, right? These are what make me wonder if the game is meant as parody, because they so clearly break the bleak mood of the game. Unfortunately, all they accomplish is changing my mood from apathy to annoyance. The squawking really gets old.

Sixth, bugs and nitpicking: One bug I keep running into is that, after I took the skill that showed certain plants on the map, some of the plant icons would remain after harvesting while others wouldn't. A similar problem I kept running into with the skill to see animals on the map was sometimes the icons for them didn't show up, despite the deer being close enough for me to see its antlers.

Also, there's a sound bug with the boomerang. Sometimes after throwing it, the sound continues even after it returns, which gets annoying very fast. Usually it happens when I open the inventory menu while it's still airborne, but sometimes it just happens.

And one last, little annoyance, of no real significance: The voice acting doesn't match up with the dialog boxes, like they were using two different versions of the same script. The ideas are all the same, but the words are different.

How to Survive
How to Survive... Hmmm. This game has much to be said. JOIN ME BELOW *swooooosh*

PROS
- Nice graphics (doesn't require a beast computer)
- Cool finishing moves when killing zombies
- Really nice crafting system (simple yet complex)
- Good sounds (althought it could use some different zombie sounds)
- Nice camera view (in the sky" view like league of legends

How to Survive
+ Crisp, minimalist UI
+ Excellent tutorial; fun, interactive, and does a good job of displaying some of the charm of the title
+ Voice-acting was of about average quality
+ Minimap is functional and easy to read; objectives and points of interest are clearly marked and hard to miss
+ Very detailed environment; the design and amount of inclusion is meticulous
+ Foraging is wonderfully implemented; by doing away with bold POI markers in the overworld, you find yourself constantly searching for familiar leaves, shapes, etc.
+ Except for a few small qualms I had with the crafting system (noted below), it is largely excellent; there are a refreshingly large variety of combinations
+ You have the option to 'uncombine' items that you've crafted, thus freeing up the materials for re-use; this little quality of life feature is incredibly useful, and I feel that many crafting systems throughout the gaming world would have benefitted from it
+ An appropriately moderate variety in creatures
+ Some crafting recipes are only available for certain characters, thus increasing incentive to replay
+ Exploration is both rewarding, and very much encouraged throughout the title
+ The story did a suberb job of managing to not take itself too seriously, without falling into the classic pitfall of being cringey and annoying
+ While the hunger and thirst meters fit well into the game, it was the fatigue meter that really stood out as a breath of fresh air; this added a bit more challenge and a greater feeling of urgency to the game
+ Hunting was very fun and challenging; tracking wild game through a monster-infested island could be quite the rewarding challenge
+ Nighttime operations were very well-handled, in that a setting sun very much puts you on edge if you're out in the open and far from a campfire
+ Melee combat was solid and satisfying

- Zombies are largely generic copies of only a handful of models
- During daytime, inventory is slightly too transparent; this results in a fair bit of squinting, but wasn't an experience-killer
- You cannot craft stacks of items
- Aiming (I used mouse and keyboard), while for the most part excellently designed, could occasionally prove frustrating and unreliable; picking specific targets out of an oncoming horde (something you will NEED to do) is difficult when you're cursor is constantly jumping between several front-rank targets
- Could have benefitted from a larger, more comprehensive skill tree

How to Survive
I tried to get into this game and like it, but the myriad of negatives overshadowed the few positives in the game. More often than not, I felt like I was fighting the clunky movement, mechanics and horribly designed UI more than I was the zombies. Not even the saving grace of co-op could make the horrid combat worth my time.

I've been told once the game pacing picks up and you begin gearing up the game becomes more bearable, but I'm not one to slog through several hours of bad gameplay to do so.

How to Survive
This game is actually very good, and I'll be buggered if I know why it wasn't more popular.  After all, neither the zombie" or "survival crafting" genres seem in much threat of extinction at this very moment

How to Survive
This game is fun, albeit short. It may be fun to play in a group, however i played it for the campaign and it only took me about 2 days to complete. If there was more to the game i would heartily recommend it, i still wouldnt give it a bad score, it just seems like it needs more content. Also there was some issues with throwing molotov cocktails in the game, the aim was really wonky and a few other bugs that were sort of annoying. With that being said though its not a terrible game, just not a truly amazing one.

Im going to vote no on recommending this particular title because of the lack of content. The building your own weapons was an interesting component but it still wasnt enough to save the game imo.

How to Survive
-Quick Review-
Atratzu's Rules: Chapter 1, this game is excellent.
How to Survive is a zombie-survival game developed by EKO Software and released October 2013.


-Detailed breakdown review-
Story: As with any zombie apocalypse story there's only so much you can deviate from the status quo. You wake up after a shipwreck, find you're on an island with zombies, need to go do a number of fetch quests while all the wimps hide and you bring the carnage!

Gameplay: This is where the game impressed me, but before I jump the gun and explain what I like... the controls are very basic, use mouse buttons to aim and fire/swing, ASDW to move, the game is played from the third person fixed above view camera.
(Atratzu did some research and learned that this view is known as Isometric view. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's the term you're supposed to use. Isometric-fixed-camera?)
Now to explain the fun part, like most survival games these days, How to Survive has a Crafting system. I'm a sucker for crafting, I feel like it gives me one of the strongest sense of progression...But I'm also biased and desensitized to it (translation: if you don't like crafting, don't touch this game). You need to scavenge various materials to make weapons, tools, and food. There are different types of herbs, sticks, animals, various junk items that become useful later, and more.
The other main feature I would like to point out is the leveling system, mostly everyone is familiar with this concept by now, in this game when you level, you get skill points that you can spend to get different perks and abilities.

Achievements: How to Survive has a total of 43 achievements. There are four categories: 1) Completed while playing through the game on you first play through (about 7-12+ achievements, depends on how thorough you are when you play). 2) Complete these special abilities/conditions. 3) Difficulty related achievements... These are always the roughest achievements to get in the game because it requires Mastery and stubborn determination. 4) Lastly, there are DLC achievements so if you want to go for 100%, you'll need the DLC (about 6 achievements).

Price: How to survive is priced at $14.99 This game will definitely earn it's value from gameplay, My personal preference is that I always want a game to last one hour for every dollar. If you'd like a better deal I recommend waiting for a steam sale; be it summer or winter.
I also need to mention that I didn't actually buy this game, it was gifted to me by Eyriana (other names: Decimaeya and Unreal), so thank you for the gift!

Conclusion: There is one more feature that should be mentioned before I wrap up my review; there is multiplier and local co-op, but I haven't played those modes yet.
To quickly recap, the story was stereotypical, the gameplay was crafting + looting * Zombies, the Achievements are generally hard earned + DLC, and the price is fair because of how long you'll play the game.
I recommend this game to anyone who likes the following genres: Zombie, Survival, Crafting. Thanks for reading my review!

How to Survive
A neat little game, short but entertaining.

Best thing about it is the easily accessible crafting system. Gather stuff that you find all over the islands and combine them to powerful items. Manage your character and limited inventory space, find water and food so you don't starve, find shelter to sleep when you are exhausted and protect yourself from the creatures on the island.
Kill hordes of Zombies with your ever improving crafted weaponary and armor and find a way off the island.

This game is not hardorce survival horror. More a top-down shooter.

How to Survive
NOTE that for the record I use a Xbox 360 Controller for this game 100% of the time. There will also be a bullet point Pros/Cons review near the bottom of this.

How to Survive is in my opinion a well done game to say the least. The game has a simple yet elegant combat system that I found satisfying, it takes patience to truly master zombie slaying as you must take time to zero in your aim for those rewarding headshots. This is better then many other games as it adds a touch of needed skill to it. The game also contains a decent variety of zombies to slaughter including some undead animals that prove to be quite scary when encountered. Many zombie types also require you to change up your strategy as a nice bonus, while you normal zombies can be dispatched with melee weapons, zombies such as Fatties require a ranged approach as they will otherwise blow up in your face upon death.

One issue I had here though was running zombies tend to get spastic when right on you and I found it hard to aim at them as they attacked while running circles around me. The island settings also do nicely, between varied terrain and well done lighting the game's presentation is both beautiful and terrifying. One of the game's strongest points is its well done crafting system, playing the game I constantly found myself wanting to find new items to combine to produce more deadly weapons and armor. This is further expanded by crafting and adding attachments such as scopes for homemade guns to decrease aim time or pulleys to give your bow more damage. Another nice mechanic the game has is a day and night cycle where at night an abundant number of more mutated and aggressive zombie type foe come out to play, what really sets this apart from other games is your ability to fight these off by simply staying in the light. With a campfire your safe and to travel you can simply grab a torch from the fire, however you will drop the torch to the ground if you need to use any other weapon, and while you can use a flashlight with a weapon it is a directional light, so if your not careful these creatures can come up from behind you and attack. The game also sports a decent Hunger/Thirst/Sleep system that adds just a little more spice to the difficulty, however if you acquire both skill perks to double these meters you'll find yourself rarely having to maintain them.

The game contains a few different character to play as each with different stats and available skills to acquire. A couple of which have a unique ability to craft a specific item only as them. As said the game does contain a leveling system in which each level grants a skill point of your choosing, however out of the 12 or so skills I had playing Jack I only found 4 or 5 of them to actually be worth something. While the story isnt the best it was still rather entertaining and when taken the time to scavenge and keep yourself properly equipped the main story ran about 15 hours for me across 2 days of constant play. Now though the game lacks any sort of structure building mechanic the game does allow you to drop items anywhere and will never disappear which really came in handy as I tended to have a hording problem in this game. I have a friend that I got to also get the game and together we found the multiplayer gameplay just as fun, you can either to a simple challenge which is essentially an island with a single goal such as finding a plane to escape. You can Co-Op the story, this part was especially cool as while my friend was just starting his story I was well into mine and I retained both my stats and all the items on me allowing me to easily aid him in his story. All in all I'd say this game is worth trying especially for any fan of zombie and/or survival game, to those of you I'd say you wont be disappointed.

So in a nutshell:
Pros:
-Satisfying combat system
-Addictive crafting system
-Well done setting
-A decent story both in quality and length
-Enemy variety
-Day/Night cycle
-Hunger/Thirst/Sleep systems
-Level and skill progression
-Multiple playable character
-Rebindable Controls

Cons:
-Zombie AI can be a little wonky but rare
-Camera style made some areas extremely difficult to navigate
-Some what low variety of melee weapons
-Controls for aiming seemed to be off at times (Xbox 360 Controller)

One final note is that I found that getting information on more advanced stuff was hard, especially seeing how typing How to Survive..." in an internet search engine usually found unwanted results.

My finally score for this game as a long time zombie and survival game lover is a solid 8/10

How to Survive
Disapointing Co-op. Console Influence shows with the 2 players stuck on the same screen which is really clunky and frustrating.

The game gives you the impression of being full sandbox open world at first sight, but really you're stuck on relatively small Islands the whole time. The Islands themselves are quite cagey, mostly a succession of narrow spaces.

Crafting is simplistic. Suriviving isn't really hard and playing story mode feels almost entirely linear.

Lackluster option menu, especially as far as graphics are concerned.

Wasted money and Waste of good potential. There are too much decent zombie games out there who do what this game tried to achieve, but better.

How to Survive
I tried to like it.. but I just can't. It doesn't looks/feels bad, but why do I feel taste of s..t  in mouth after playing this? Here is why:

- UI is terrible, full controller support game, means: no hotkey for windows, some ugly scroll skill/use skill" buttons. 90% of my deaths in game is because of panic and inability to switch weapon.
- inventory is crap

How to Survive
Gameplay: 7/10

How to Survive
You are shipwrecked on an isolated island, a desperate castaway in a total freakshow world.

How will you survive?

Yes, how will you survive this mediocre action-survival" game

How to Survive
Updated on 26.10.14


I really don't know why the game How to Survive managed to get that low MC score.
It's really beyond me .If I would believe in conspiracy theory I would have said
that competition was involved in helping to put How To Survive on the very bottom...

Let's get back to the game itself.

The graphic is really cool .The terrain ,swapms ,trees ,wreckages and characters are
design beautifuly ,and there is no one bad thing to be said about gameplay either.
Everything works smoothly as it should.Even sounds and other special effects
are created with precision and they sound...real!

Two things that strike me while I was playing How to Survive was :

Very interesting crafting system allowing you to craft almost anything by combinig
items you have found or salvage from surroundings .
Example :if you combine Rusty Helmet and bones you will get spiky helmet ,
or combine a bottle of water and lemon and you will get quess what...? A lemonade!!!
You may find car tires ,metal sticks ,or piece of hard rock and create some very
usefull stuff.
There is another interesting aspect to your quest for survival I forgot to mention :
some items such as raw meat or fish ,need to be cooked first ,otherwise you will get sick.

The second thing that need to be mention here is guy named Kovac (such a character!!!)
who appears here and there giving you best advices called Kovac's Rules" to help you
survive your mayhem .
Kovac is smart and very funny in his simplistic way and he is superb additinon to How To Survive.

So...maitain you health 

How to Survive
I've played this game for six hours so far, for $3 its a great game. This game is a 3rd person shooter type of game, the only thing I felt the game lacked so far is that you can't pan the camera around your guy; this makes it a little hard to see how many zombies are going to come running after you next.

The game has still been allot of fun to play through so far, I think I am probably about half way through the game at this point and I have not gotten bored of playing it yet. You start out with a stick as a weapon, then you find better weapons or craft better weapons by finding Bluprints to create them.

I think they could have done it a little differently in terms of sending the player out to fetch things, so far there is this one guy who asks you to do all kinds of things and I just get this feeling that the guy is a lazy bum; who doesn't lift a finger to help you out in the least.

They could have really improved that aspect of the game allot, the game is already pretty good; if they would have done something a little different with the quest line the game could have been exceptional.

That plus the inability to pan around your character take something away from this game. Its still worth playing so far, more so than some of the games that are allot more polished and higher priced.

How to Survive
Don't let the low metascore fool you.  This game might not be the best zombie/crafting/survival game ever made, but it has a lot to offer when playing co-op.  Even if the game feels as though it could have been bigger.  The idea of keeping your character fed, hydrated, and rested while exploring zombie infested islands and crafting useful items from scraps is a fun idea that is implemented well with this game -- the world, items, and crafting options just seem a little lack luster.

The survival aspects of the game, eating, drinking and resting, are presented simply.  Safe houses must be discovered and cleared out for the character to have a safe place to rest.  This part of the game works well.  The safe houses get progressively more difficult to clear, and they are spaced appropriately throughout the game.  It would have been nice if the islands were larger.  The player must search for wild edibles or hunt for food.  Foods can be cooked and combined, but a lot of the times there is little to no reason to do it.  While it's fun to make a dish a Fish 'n' Chips, there is no difference from that and just a cooked fish.  This part feels as though it could have used more work.  Maintaining good hydration is another survival aspect that is done simply and effectively.  Fresh water can be found around the island, and the player can store water in different containers.  These containers can be re-used for water again, or for storing other liquids.  Various fruits and items can be mixed with water to make mix drinks."  This part of the survival felt as though it got more attention.  Every new drink that was discovered had different effects

How to Survive
How to survive  more like how to not get frustrated :D

-Before a friend and I could even play the game we needed to restart the game 3 times and even during the game it would freeze and a restart was needed. For example talking to character made the whole game freeze so we didnt try to talk to the character again :D
- Another thing that really annoyed me was that you are not able to save the game in the Main Menu. You need to wait till you get to a checkpoint or something similar. If you die before the checkpointyep playing everything again. Frustrating.
-The looting system in the coop mode is horrible. If one person picks an item up only one of the player has the weapon so on. Also if you get a reward, my friend and I had the problem that only he gets the rewards and I get nothing. And that at the beginning of the game. Frustrating.
-Your character has 4 needs: Health, hunger, thirst and exhaustion. So you always need to make sure you have food and something to drink. But if you play as a pair its not easy to have always enough food for both. Having these needs gives the game a realistic touch but I found it frustrating :D

But even if the game is having some bugs and so on I had fun playing it.

+The crafting system is nice and easy to understand.
+I liked the bird's eye view of the game. Its something different from what you normally play.
+ The game is about Zombies. So yeah.fighting zombies is fun :D
+The animations looked sometimes really weird but I still like them. For example the character has different finisher moves.

If you dont have high expectations the game can make a lot of fun,especially if you play the coop mode. And I think if the developers take they their time and erase those bugs the game will be even better :)


How to Survive
Game runs smoothly, I didn't encounter any bugs and after you're done with story mode (I obviously am not), you can try to play in local co-op, co-op and multiplayer. There are several modes included and hardcore difficulty will make you cry (even normal one has its tough moments). Incredibly deep crafting system makes you craft something completely useless and this is the first time I saw something like this in any kind of crafting games.

How To Survive is an indie gem that looks cheap, feels cheap and plays lovely. Basically, this is one of those games you've dared to love before huge web portals and trend-fueled magazines told you it's not OK to love these kind of games because of I don't know what reason.

I recomend to all my friends...so get it now and embrace the zombie survival :D hooooooooooo yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa

How to Survive
pros
Great game for local coop
Nice gameplay
Nice graphic and sound design
It often goes on sale @90% (for ~1) it's REALLY worth it
Kovac's tutorial (well you must play to know what I mean)
cons
How to DLC (imho it's not really worth to buy them, I bought the Storm Warning Edition during sale for a few cents extra)
Apparently while player2 (joypad) is moving, player1 (keyboard) can't use the menu

How to Survive
How to Survive is one of the Best Survival games I have played so far [24/3/2015]. It is about surviving [Duh] and finding many ways to Escape off the Island/Place that you are at. You can either play online, offline [local co op] and co op with a friend [counted as online].
There are alot of weapons you can design and make, to fight your way through. There are zombies that are weak, boomers and Mutant Giant zombies that have like zillion health.
You can meet survivors all across the map, and they are asking for your assistance.

This is a very fun game, I recommend and really consider you to buy it.

Rate: 10/10

How to Survive
How to Survive is a game you can easily sink hours in if you like the genre.

The controls feel fluid and are easy to remember with Gamepad.
Combat doesn't feel clunky(even have finishers). There's a simple yet solid crafting system.
You actually have to drink, eat & rest in this game(Some ppl may or may not like that)

The story has some humor in it, but mostly found myself mashing 'A'.
Skills are a bit bland (eg.''+X% exp at night''), but the different weapon combinations
more than make up for it.

7.5/10

The price is a little steep, but it's a must-have when it goes on sale.

How to Survive
There is plenty of truth to what people are saying about the story mode / vanilla game being incredibly dry, fetch quest ridden, and poorly designed both from a character growth and survival mechanics standpoint; as well as the complaints about buggy online mode and the general lack of difficulty.

*however*

The Challenge and One Shot Escape modes are fair challenging and reasonably engaging, and imo make better use of the survival mechanics.

My advice is not to get the vanilla game and to go for the DLC package when it's on sale and enjoy a some play time with a roomie or significant other (basically someone that you see every day that you can just like, casually pick up and play games with) and to not take the game too seriously.

Must-play if you like quirky, stupid, and broken games.
The ragdoll physic glitches will have you in stitches ~

How to Survive
How To Survive is a very decent action game with pretty graphics and a nice, extensive crafting system. But after a few hours it's just that; pretty graphics and crafting, in addition to killing zombies. The killing feels satisfying by the way, but you basically go from one point to another, all across an island, doing basic quests. And if you're done on one island, it's on to the next one, which is basically the same as the previous one only bigger. If it were only more interesting. Giving the player more to do would've definitely helped this game out, especially since there's so much stuff to craft.
In the end it's just ok-ish, but still worth a look.

[Rating: 70/100]

How to Survive
Very boring and tedious game, gets repetitive very easily. The islands are really small, the monkey quests are a pain in the  and just stupid, the survival features like thirst and hunger are unique but annoying. Combat is mediocre, if you play as melee you struggle a lot, play with ranged weapons and wreck everything. The level system is just pathetic and there are less than 20 skills to level up, some of them just being completely passive and not helpfull at all. On top of that, the game wasn't really designed for mouse and keyboard. Paid like $1 for this game so not too much to worry about but I wouldn't recommend it anyway, it's just boring.

How to Survive
Frustrating and just too bland. Crafting is limited and the game play is amateur. This has been my opinion, if you do not like it, form your own.

How to Survive
I had a fun time with How to Survive up until the final battle. Then I had to rage quit about 10 times before I finally lived through it.

-The narrative by Kovac keeps the mood fun and entertaining.
-There are a cool variety of monster types and weapons to build.
-The crafting system isn't overly burdensome although the few number of inventory slots made it a chore at times.
-I found the aiming to be a little inconsistent with a controller, especially for the boomerang which happened to be my favorite weapon.
-The story does end up to be a lot of fetch questing, which gets old fast.

Fun? Yes. Does it make me want to buy the sequel? No.

How to Survive
Pros:

+Interesting crafting system
+Funny Dialog
+Comical Tutorial
+Local and online co-op
+Nice, but simple looking top down graphics
+Kovac (NPC)

Cons:

-Skill tree bland
-Semi-Linear gameplay
-Extremely limited inventory


You have ship wrecked and when you awake you find yourself surrounded by zombies and you quickly pick up a stick and the carnage begins.

How To Survive is a twin stick shooter of sorts with survival elements thrown into the mix.  The survival aspects in this are like you'd expect.  You will need to find and drink water, find shelter (and rid zombies of it) to sleep and kill the local wildlife to eat their meat so you don't starve to death.  You can even make fishing rods to fish as well.

There is a crafting system and it was somewhat unique and fun in my opinion.  You gather up resources you find throughout the island(s) and you can craft things like axes, bows, body armor, guns and explosive devices.  You will also be finding plants scattered about and you can combine them and make healing items.

Herbalism ranges from making healing items, tonics for shields, better aiming and so forth.  For the most part all I ever used were the healing items.  Making shields and what not only lasted you 15-30 secs and it's gone.  There wasn't much threat throughout the game unless you neglected to upgrade your weapons.

Threats on these islands range from your normal zombies to zombies in full tactical gear to giant Resident Evil Nemesis creatures.  Even the wildlife can turn and cause more problems than the zombies do.  Zombie deer?  You bet'cha!  If you happen to die you end up leaving a tombstone on the ground.  There's nothing for you to retrieve, but once your friends log in they can see where you've parished.  I saw plenty of people I recognize dead all over the place.

There is a story throughout your adventure and your goal is to get off the island.  There are other people stranded which act as quest givers.  Quests are mostly just fetching items or off to see your next NPC that always comes with funny dialog.

The DLC consists of challenge modes, the barricade mode and an extra story line that takes place on El Diablo Islands.  The challenge modes are just that.  Complete certain game functions without dying and nothing in your inventory.  Barricade mode is you build a base and keep the zombies out of the base to protect a wounded friend.  You run around and pick up wood and make barricades".

The base games story mode took me around 14 hours to beat and El Diablo Islands takes 3-4 more hours.  Max level is 15 and you can respec the skill tree 4 times.  The full game runs around $20 (including all DLC)

How to Survive
This is a fun small game to play. I bought this on a really good sale and for the price this is a very entertaining zombie-killing hack-n-slash. Skill trees are not very complex, but the game has a variety of weapons and items you can craft. I think this game will be even more fun playing it co-op, which you can do even locally

How to Survive
Pretty good game, but camera work ruins whole gameplay in a cooperative mode. It's just annoying. It really bothers me and many other players too (i have seen a few posts about it, players actually begged developers to fix this). However, single mode is interesting and provides fun for couple of hours and i think that if you like zombie survival type games (and playing alone also) you will like this game. Is it worth buying? For single playing only, yes.

How to Survive
So, I played 3 hours of this.

It is a nice game. I bought it in sale for 2.19 the whole pack which was worth 21.99.
I think I got more then what I payed for. 2 first hours I discovered the game. Good mechanics. The fights are interresting. One of the best part for me is the crafting side" and as I've not even been through more than two hours

How to Survive
Addicting. Stayed up all night playing this with my husband. We lost track of time, so he got 3 hours of sleep for a 12 hour day of work.

10/10

How to Survive
I wanted to like this, I really did. I really TRIED to like it, but it was really a disappointment.

This game is simply mediocre in so many ways. Don't expect a deep survival experience here. Don't expect much at all. Even the humor feels forced at many points.  (Though once or twice will make you smile a bit)

There are a lot worse games out there, but this game just really doesn't deliver on what it hints at in the trailers and previews.
If you want it, do yourself a favor and pick it up on sale.

(I also don't understand why it keeps popping up on the new releases list.)

How to Survive
After so many hours of playing this game I can only recommend buying this when on sale or if you have some extra money you want to spend and have good friends on skype or teamspeak to play this with.
It really is fun and all but some bugs can be pretty annoying for some people. Achievement bugs, two cursors, zombie bugs, item bugs etc. Look into the forums to see what I mean. But their are also a few game breaking bugs which make you restart (Sanchez Packages not stocking).

Anyway I break it down to this

Pros:
- lovely mixture of survival, zombies and crafting
- the koop is the best way to play this!
- El Diablo, Barrikade are lovely additions to this game even tho I prefer El Diablo over the other because new island, new items, new extra storyline
- different zombie types
- lots of BOOOOM
- looting and collecting while abusing the A Button... just give me all the stuff
- crafting all kinds of different weapons and figuring out what does what
- Bumerang <- best weapon ever followed by burning stick
- different characters with different abilities and weaknesses
- animals, plants the whole environment looks lovely but the fog is a pain in the butt
- KOVAC! this ing character has a lovely voice actor and beats everyone else. His guides and rules are also pretty fun.



Cons:
- The game contains some game breaking bugs which can't be fixed and need you to restart from the beginning.
- bugs, funny bugs, helpfull bugs but yes some bugs like standing zombies, stillwalking when dead zombies, stuck zombies
- some pretty much unbeatable achievements
- weird target system

As I said, if it wouldnt be fun I wouldnt have played it for almost 75hours by now.
If you love killing thousands of zombies with axe, bow, gun or just a ing stick, collecting items, solving quests, looting and crafting, you cant do anything wrong with this game.


How to Survive
Thanks Kovac, you taught me a lot.

This game prepared me for the apocalypse!
Now I know that lightning can struck me at least 5 times before I die.

How to Survive
Sometimes my biggest fear is that I will end alone...

Nope...
I don't mean alone because I'm not able to find the love of my life
I don't mean alone because all my friends will leave me
I don't mean alone because there will be no more ingredients to make a nice carbonara again

I mean that I will woke up, I will do my things, I will go out and I will find the total absolute nothing.
And the moment when, with all my fears coming true, I will go round the corner...suddenly...the light...

A russian guy that will approach me and he will tell me No worry my friend...I will teach you how to survive"....

Because this is what will happen in this game

You was planning to spend your summer on a small lonely island full of amazing wonderful girls (if you are a boy) / boys (if you are a girl) / sheeps (if you...well...nevermind) but suddenly a huge octopus will push your ship to hit some rocks and you will end into the luna park of zombies.

But the thing that will really creep you out is not the fact that every step you will do there will be a group of zombies trying to eat you...is the fact that you will find a russian...A SOBER RUSSIAN.
That is a thing that you should really be scared...in fact even the zombies tries to avoid him...remember...if you get bitten by a zombie you become a zombie...if you get bitten or bite a russian...you become a russian.

But apart for this...this is a really really really really underrated game.
Yes I know you will say "IT WAS REALLY CHEAP SO IT IS CRAP!"...no it isn't. Developers put a lot of passion inside this game and you can clearly see that after the last patches.
The game itself is not only improved but they have added some quite good stuff...from weapons to game modes to achievements...all stuff that will make this game more enjoyable day after day.

The gameplay is quite simple and original. It is a mix between a crafting game a survival horror and a RPG.
Crafting because all your weapons

How to Survive
Very competent isometric zombie survival aRPG with a lot of depth and challenge. Its by no means perfect, for me the biggest issue was the excessive level of padding. For instance why cant I just use this one boat to travel to all the other islands and instead need to move to different locations throughout zombie infested islands to reach different boats in order to get to other islands? Padding that's why. Where HtS really shines though, is in the crafting department. There's a lot of stuff you can craft and improve as you discover new recipes books or just by experimenting with the stuff you have in your inventory.

The combat system won't turn any heads around, but its not too shabby at all IMO, especially the ranged combat mechanic. Now, the lackluster skills tree and the clown mobile safe houses mechanic was a little weird and slightly detracted from the experience, but not by much. I'm definitely looking forward to completing the Story(which was surprisingly cool with a nice twist at the end) mode on the highest difficulty and playing some more coop(which is pretty sweet btw) with my buds.


Better Than DayZ/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
I love Spiderman. He was the first superhero comic I ever picked up as a kid. I own more Spiderman comic books than any other series in my collection and have been reading them for eighteen years (5 yrs-23 yrs). I've also played every single Spiderman video game since back in the early 90's and i'm here to tell you...

I went out on launch day to buy this game for PS3.  I beat it with my brother in law after only two sessions of playing - about 8 hours total. Mind you I was playing around a lot of that time and just exploring the city. I thought maybe I was just too hype on the game and it didn't meet my expectations...So I decided to give it another go on the PC.

Now keep in mind this is an open world game, but there is little to nothing to do! The city just doesn't feel like a real complete city. I still play the older titles and compared to this they all have way more to do and a lot more diversity in their levels, which is sad considering you're supposed to progress. Almost every single main mission takes place somewhere underground. Which at first is real cool...until you realize all of the missed potential that's just sitting there above you. Laughing at you. Mocking you. There are a few missions above ground but they are seldom.

There are plenty of side missions - Like crimes to solve which are inanely repetitive and overtly mundane, nothing like they used to be. I'm not even trying to be that guy that's just stuck on the past nostalgia, but if i'm still playing those games today (which I am) over the new titles they're dishing out...somethin' ain't right. Sure the missions in those games were all repetitive too, but at least more diverse and way more fun than Stop that car!" "Catch that runner!" "Stop that gang!" "Now stop that getaway car!" "Catch that mugger!" "There's a gang on the loose!"

No matter how you clothe a sheep it is still a sheep.

This is my review of The Amazing Spider-Man. I found this game to be <<CRASH>>

This is my review of The Amazi<<CRASH>>

This is my review of The Amazing Spider-Man. I found t<<CRASH>>

Annoying, right?

The Amazing Spider-Man
This game was so terrible I beat it very shortly that includes getting all 700 comics.. Only a person who is really bad at gaming. ...who isn't a real gamer.... has low expectations would love this game. Their is no challenge to it that is the very definition of what a game is the challenge. Since it didn't have a challenge I don't consider this to be a true game. The game is also broken on a technical level. It has glitches, bugs, and will have you restarting your pc or it will just flash out and close itself. Notice the people below who try to discredit me. Some of these people wrote reviews only one hr of playing a game and not completing them. I'm sorry kiddies I was born in the era of NES and Atari and been gaming way longer than you peons. My experience makes me better than you new generation spoonfed gamers where every task is given to you. The AI in this game is dumb. The bosses are all the same and offer no challenge what so ever. They don't learn or do any new strategy from the next.

When you look at this game it seems to have potential but looks are decieving. Lets start off with the kick they did to pc gamers as a punishment to not buying the game on console, and waiting for pc. So instead of snapping 7 spider signals to get the suits you are made to collect 700 comics, and complete tasks. You get most of the new suits when beating the game. Its like why after that.
The suits also offer no stat differences or powers.

Technical issues. Aside from webbing through the city, running up walls, and climbing them is a glitchfest, the webbing doesn't feel as fun as in past spiderman games. It also feels inorganic and articficial as you can just hold bottom R trigger to keep webbing. You'll be using the first r1 button because its more responsive and accurate. This also has its flaw as the indicator to where your travelling is only slightly more golden or yellowish.

The game constantly crashes on you. No bug fixes or patched have yet to be released. Making the game even more painful to play through its glitchness and instability.  People with rigs like mine that are up to date, and high end memory, and gpu's have had the similar painstaking problems, I have had. If I wasn't a power user I swear the ordinary user must have a real bad day troubleshooting this piece of hellborn spawn. The lack of support for this game, and no more added content, plus all the problems make it a no buy. Until they fix all the problems and make it playable I do not recommend buying this game.
Its a shame Marvel let this bad pc port over like this without testing it fully, and fixing it up.

All of us Spiderman fans are waiting for all the other games to come to PC. Marvel you're losing money not investing, and properly investing in us.

Again it looks decent, but no because it doesn't function properly. My biggest complaint comes with they came out with dlc fast but not with the patches the games needs so drastically.

Just look at these Steam Forums
http://steamcommunity.com/app/212580/discussions/0/864951657868730063/

Thoughts after finishing the game. It still is a mess. The controls are bad, the story is lack luster,
and the boss battles are repetitive, and feel like a cluster of organized randomness. They did not port this at all well for pc, and never fixed any bogs, released patches. It could have been a great game, but all of these combined make it a fail of a choice. You won't regret buying this particular spiderman game trust me. The games combat system is super easy, and you will get to it too quickly. People who have no gaming skill will love this very easy game filled with glitches.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I had fun but it's not worth the regular price.  PROS- Looks cool, nice unlockables, and an okay story. CONS- Repetitive gameplay, awkward camera (stealth), crashing, and lag for ATI/AMD users (I'm not the only one).

THE REPETITIVE PARTS:
The missions have the same formula: beating up generic thugs/guards, going through vents, and using stealth. All bosses (except the Rhino) can be just defeated by spamming the combat button and dodging. New York does not have many things to do except chasing the same cars and fighting the same crime scenarios. All thugs dissappear after you defeat them all.

Only get it on sale, if you really want it.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I'd like to begin with a little song.

 Crash again, Crash again,
It crashes to desktop whenever it can.
Loads a cutscene, or just a level part.
Doesn't like it, it's too hard
Look Out!
Here comes a crash again. 

At its best, Amazing 1 is a game that reminds me a lot of the Arkham games. Spider-man controls smoothly and combat can feel very satisfying with striking from behind, retreating to the ceiling, and then quickly moving to a new spot to strike again.
The open world (Manhattan) is nicely detailed and is filled with collectables so you always have something to do while web-slinging from mission to next mission or random crime event.

Unfortunately there are a lot of points where Amazing 1 stops being fun. Despite Spider-Man's strengths lying in jumping away and being able to use high ceilings to his advantage a lot of the missions put you in a tiny, enclosed space where this is not possible so you have to rely on the combat. The combat tries to be Arkham with combos and smooth flowing from one enemy to the next, but this doesn't always work.

The web-slinging isn't as nice as it could be either, which I think is mainly due to the game's locked FOV. You simply lose track of where you are headed. When I first started playing this and got to Manhattan, I actually got a bit nauseous at first until I got more used to it. Fortunately there is an alternative by web-rushing using the R2 bumper everywhere, which basically automatically picks a good spot to get to.

And then there's the absolute biggest issue... the game is horribly optimised. It crashes at least once each half hour for no good reason, and while the game does autosave, you can get unlucky enough to have this occur during a boss fight so you have to redo a part of the level and the fight again.

Voice acting is okay, not good but not cringe-worthy either, and graphics are passable.

If you can pick this up for less than /$ 10, I'd recommend it. Skip the DLC though, that's all based on more combat and therefore not really fun.
It does NOT get a recommendation at its current full price of %/$ 30 or even the 50% discount which is still up as I write this.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Ok, I do recommend that you buy this game but I would say only buy it if it is on sale for about 7.99/$9.99. I really do not think it is worth more than that and I will tell you why.

First the bad...

This game crashes a lot. This is well known at this point and all of the fixes" that have been discussed simply did not work for me. I am a Windows 10 user

The Amazing Spider-Man
Kinda feels like cheap Batman-Arkham-games imitation, but:
a) it has it's charm
b) it's Activision, so it won't be cheap.

While I recommend it for being playable and fun, Batman feels like better game.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Swing and crawl above and beyond Manhattan sounds like fun, right?Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.

----------------------------------------------------------------

[ REVIEW]
The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 action adventure video game, that revolves around the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. Developed by Beenox and published through Activision, it found its way on Windows, X-Box 360, Playstation 3, Nintendo DS & 3DS, Wii & Wii U, iOS and Android.

The story is based a few months after the events from The Amazing Spider-Man movie and can be hold as an alternate epilogue to it. Yet, it is not necessary to watch the film, in order to follow the story from the game.
It starts with Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, who sneak into the restricted areas of Oscorp. Gwen has suspicions that the company still works on so-called Cross-Species, virus-mutated humans with special powers, after Dr. Curt Connors became The Lizard, who sits now in a mental facility. Both get caught eventually by Alastairs Smythe, who does not deny the work on the cross-species, just for a little longer until they all will be destroyed, as he says. Since Peter Paker is a cross-species himself, all of the other still contained species react to him, become insane in their behavior and manage to break out of Oscorp. The virus, which these species carry inside, is highly infectious when bitten and so the virus spreads around Manhattan. It is up to Spider-Man to rescue the whole inhabitants of Manhattan, bring justice to Oscorp and of course to find an Antidote. Dr. Connors could be a help to develop an Antidote and so Spider-Man has no choice but giving him assistance to break out the facility. With Connors on his back, Spider-Man is on his way into his apartment and so a race against time begins.

Gameplaywise, The Amazing Spider-Man has to offer a lot, as expected from an open world game. From RPG elements to endless swinging, everyone will get their money worth. While being outside Peter's apartment, the player can either continue with his main missions or help the citizens of Manhattan. For this purpose Spider-Man owns an Osphone, which he obtained from Gwen in Oscorp. The map of Manhattan is accessible through this device, where also main and side missions can be found. If one of the points is selected on the map, a red beam appears somewhere in the city, showing up the accurate location. Side missions can be for example beating down thiefs/bullies, helping the police to catch criminals, locate and investigate hidden places and so on. If the player is not tired after completing all of them, he can go on a comic collection hunt; 700 pages in number have to be found. Some of them are placed in the city, some of them in each main level. They can easily be spotted through their golden shine and sparkling sound. After progress in the game, Spider-Man will get a camera, with which he has to take pictures about suspicious events. However, all of these side missions are optional and contain additional experience points.
Speaking of which, experience points are used to strengthen Spider-Man's Skills. A hurricane made with webs or being able to stealth kill two enemies at once sounds like fun, right? And damn, it is. With every new skill -11 in number-, Spider-Man is even more fun to play and offers new ways to battle against the foes. And as if this is not enough, there are also so-called Tech-Upgrades, mechanical tweaks for his web shooters. Unlike the normal skills, the player needs to collect scrap pieces in order to upgrade them. Rapid fire will teach the enemies the meaning of fear, wall blast sticks them at the nearest wall and much more.
Main missions are the common threads. The game is segmented in 12 different, but connected chapters, including a 13th chapter to roam around or finish bypassed side quests. Inside the apartment from Spider-Man the player has the choice to replay any mission he wants. A special feature that might be worth mentioning is the possibility to change the Spider-Man outfit. They can be unlocked by different tasks inside the missions, such as Find all comic papers or Finish the game on the highest difficulty. A list which skins are available and how to unlock them can be found here.
That being said, The Amazing Spider-Man contains so much additional side missions that players can easily fill around 20 or more hours.

The controls have their ups and downs and show shamelessly straight, that this game is a console port. It is highly recommended to play with a controller, since keyboard and mouse feel very clunky and unfinished. However, when played with a controller, Spider-Man's skill to swing, jump and crawl all over the place turns out to be very enjoyable.

When it comes to the graphics, The Amazing Spider-Man shows its prettiness. Manhattan's streets, sewers and interior of buildings look very detailed and the day and night cycle with the varying ambient lighting effects are truly well made and even after around 4 years pleasant to look at. The different suits do look stunning on the highest graphic options, including even minor details such as small pimples all over the suits and in-depth shadows to show of Spider-Man's muscles. Definitely nothing to sneeze at, considered its age.

Unfortunately, this shiny coin is not as golden as the player might think by now. The Amazing Spider-Man suffers from a tremendous game breaking bug: Random Crashes. There is no known source why these crashes appear and with that no known fix for everyone. Some found a downloadable fix, some reported that turning off Anti-Aliasing helped. There are a lot of tweaks around the internet but none of them are the very one everyone is searching for. A huge letdown for an amazing game like this.

The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the better games that contains a famous hero and connects itself to the end of a movie. The huge content spiked with RPG elements and an interesting combat system known from the Batman games, fills hours of hours with fun, if it would not crash so frequently. Still, for those who can stand this problem will find themselves slinging and crawling around in The Amazing Spider-Man!

Recommended when on sale.

For this review I played through the game a second time and did not get tired of it. RPG elements are always something I love to see in games and the spider-like acrobatic skills from Spider-Man made the game even more enjoyable. I caught myself very often, that I just swung around Manhattan without any objective or mission selected. Purchase on sale and have a lot of fun!

[ TL;DR]
[] Highly detailed graphics
[] Great storyline with many side quests
[] RPG elements (leveling up, upgrading skills, unlockable suits)

[] Crashes often, nVidia & AMD likewise (no prober fix for everyone available)
[] Crawling on walls from time to time disorienting
[] Controls clunky, when played with keyboard and mouse (controller recommended)

The Amazing Spider-Man
A fun game for every spidey loving gamers out there. This game will get you flying through the streets of Manhattan with cool acrobatics which Spider-Man is mostly about for me. You can unlock different costumes after a while, but after completing the game I had only unlocked about 3 out of 6 or so.

It also has a good story but reveals something that most likely will come in the new movie.

After the story is completed you can still swing around in the city and save citizens from small crime, or just swing around for fun and listen to the epic Spider-Man music.

However there are some things that I did not like about this game.
When you swing around in the city, it doesn't seem like the web is hitting any of the buildings, it goes straight up into the air. Which I think is really sad and lazy beacause I remember a Spider-Man game back in the day on PS2 where the web actually hit the buildings and you had to swing in a different way because of the way the web hit the building. This game kind of goes back to PS1 where the web just goes straight up, but you still gotta swing where there are buildings close to you of course.

Most of the combat and missions happen inside sewers and buildings, which doesn't give you such a great feeling of being Spider-Man, very few missions are outside. Most of the game is spent inside something.

But even though I got some negative things to say about this game, I would still recommend it (although it's pretty easy).
It gives you the feeling of being The Amazing Spider-Man. I had fun completing this game, and I would play it again if I had forgotten the whole story.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I have always been a Marvel fan, and when I saw The Amazing Spider-Man I just had to get it.  First, the good news.  It has some fun moments, good voice acting, and pretty good spider powers.
Now for the bad news.  The game crashes, and it does it somewhat frequently.  I can almost handle the checkpoint save system (typical console port), but to combine it with crashes is unforgiveable.  Also, as you will read on the forums, the game suffers from poor performance.  It's not a matter of how good your hardware is, it's a matter of how poorly the optimizations were done in the port.  In fact, the performance problems are so bad that it takes a fast reaction scenario and turns it into an unplayable mess.  If it were not for Spider-Man's ability to slow time, some of the fights would be frustratingly unwinnable.  Not because it was necessary to use the power, but because you can't keep up when you are dropping frames.
If you want a better alternative, play Batman Arkham Assylum or Arkham City.

The Amazing Spider-Man
The open world is a hub for the main missions, and the random" crimes have a limit and are not random. The story is OK but the combat is not as smooth as they were hoping for when making it. The swinging is by far the worst in any open world Spider-Man game and is just pathetic. The graphics look great

The Amazing Spider-Man
I think this is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played, still, as Spiderman fan I enjoyed it.
It's really bugged, it's almost unplayable if you have Antialising and some high" settings enabled :/ And after messing with the config still crashes often. I think the only time I quit the game because I wanted to was when I finished it.

I only recommend this if you like Spiderman and you get it really cheap

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man takes place directly after the movie. After the events of the movie, Alistair Smythe takes over the cross-species experiments when Curt Connors is taken to a mental hospital. Things eventually go wrong and cross-species creatures such as Vermin, Scorpion and Rhino break out of OsCorp and into the city. The cross-species contaminate the city and it becomes Spider-Man's mission to find a cure with the help of Connors.
The game does an amazing job of making the player really feel like Spider-Man. Swinging around Manhattan looks gorgeous, despite the fact that there is no Spider-Man 2 style web swinging, the web lines just sort of stick to nothing.
The combat in this game is very good. It is a more basic version of Batman Arkham series' combat system. There is a designated attack button, jump and web moves are available. Once your combo reaches a certain number and an enemy is in a dazed state, you can do a signature move which automatically KO's them and usually involves some acrobatics and webbing.
A problem is that it is quite repetitive at times. Quite a lot of the time, it is much easier to stealth take down any enemies than to get into an actual fight, and if youre spotted, you can web rush around a little until the enemies lose sight of you and then try again.
The levels in the game are fun. However the game suffers from a lack of different environments. The main missions take place in a few areas that look a lot alike. All the major missions take place indoors. Almost all side missions take outdoors. Side missions include beating up muggers, challenges, car chases and photo missions. The boss battles are ok.
Overall, the graphics look good. Some of the character models look strange, but it is only noticeable if you are talking to them. Enemies look good. The city looks great especially in the night. Spidey's different costumes all look very nice.
The Amazing Spider-Man is a slightly above average attempt at taking a movie and making a game adaptation. The free roam, which should be a staple feature in a Spider-Man game is fun and can be quite addictive when getting down to collectibles and the camera angle used makes for some breathtaking web swinging moments.
The Amazing Spider-Man would be amazing if the game would be a little less repetitive and would have real web-swinging.

Sounds 8/10
Graphics 8/10
Gameplay 7/10
Atmosphere 8/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
NOTE:: I'd give this game a neutral" review

The Amazing Spider-Man
At first look, this game looks like a cheap cash grab into the currently shining Super-Hero games industry, and that's because it is.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Personal Rating: 3 of 10

NOTE: The low rating given was due to bugs which causes the game to be unplayable.

This game is awesome, when it works flawlessly. It is everything you expect it should be being Spider-Man and being such a hard-hitting, action and open world game, it really manages to differs from all of it peers at a level on its own.

The game starts slow and I did thought is that all the game has to offer at first; mindless mouse mashing. Several chapters into the game, it actually expand the content and also combat capabilities. Levels are replayable so you can take your time to explore and complete the collectibles. No pressure there.

You may need to get used to the camera and mouse and keyboard input capture at first but as you proceed with the game, you will slowly take your mind off them. All in all, this game is really awesome and not just some money-grab to follow the Spider-Man trend.

However, all these only applies without the bad hardware support and constant crashes. The game jerks horribly specially in the open world. This is not due to hardware performances. If you just do some research, you will know this game is not compatible with RADEON cards. I tried to resolve the problem without avail since none of the solution does not promise a 100% success rate. The game also constantly crash at random times. Fans has been discussing this issue that seems to occurs to RADEON and NVIDIA users. Most of the solutions provided are again not confirmed as I have tried them all.

If you really enjoy such open world games, I do highly recommend this title. You will definitely not be disappointed. But it comes with a huge gamble if the game actually worked or not.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I have been a HUGE spidey fan since i was a young boy. This game is one of my top favorite ones to play, if you are a spidey fan even in the slightest i recommend buying this game.

The Amazing Spider-Man
This game... wow. I wasn't sure when I picked it up at first, as Spiderman seems to have an inconsistent track record when it comes to games, but this game really hooked me. It tends to have a technical issue now and again that may have booted me from the game a couple times, but I always went back for more. Not only are the combat and swing mechanics fun and easy to pick up, but the story gets f-ing crazy as well, taking Spiderman to what felt like an apocalypse scenario by the end of it. I can definitely recommend this one as a pick-up if you're jonesing for a Spidey fix. (Also, turn up those speakers. The robotic worm fight worked my bass quite a bit. :))

The Amazing Spider-Man
**First off. I write this review not using the AMD GPU.


This was my first Spider-man game I've played since the PS1 and PS2 versions. I saw this on sale and said why the hell not. I haven't indulged in a Spider-man game for awhile, and I always remember enjoying them.

Right from the start this game brought back all the fun and excitement that I remember from the old. Same simple commands and fast paced third person fighting action.

Pros:

-fast paced fighting action with smooth movements and very responsive inputs(very useful while dodging!)
-simple open-world, not too big, not too small
-long play time(even on easiest setting)
-very user friendly phone/map interface
-enjoyed the Web-Dash

The Amazing Spider-Man
The whole time I was playing this I was convinced I would feel like writing about it afterwords. I did write some things in my head. Now that I am here I kind of don't have anything to say. Let me just list some things see if it sparks something.

First things first. I really like Spiderman. So now you know I'm biased but lets get into it.

What I didn't like
- Manhattan is boring. At least in this game it is. It looks boring and it feels boring.
- Everything looks feels old. The UI looks dated, the city even with the game running at maximum 1080p usually 60fps (the game seems to bog down for seemingly no reason a lot) the city looks dated and the draw distance seems to favor fogginess. Also the button prompts are ridiculous.
- It launches twice sometimes and crashes because of that (happened like 7 times)
-There is very little variety in the side missions
- There are too many collectibles

What I did like
-You get to be Spiderman


Okay, I'll say more.
Traversing around feels great. Now given that Spidy swings on his web that attaches to things thats not always the case here. HOWEVER, in reality the mechanics of that and having to react to that in addition to fighting would be overbearing. The swinging feels great. You are Spiderman. Not, figure out the best trajectory while fighting a giant robot.. man. The fighting feels pretty decent. Its a little over animated but again, you're Spiderman you still need to fight accordingly. Its very responsive and in no way out of your control.

Stealth is very fun, you can look through your mask while time is slowed and choose a location to zipline to and prey on your foes very tactical like. You know he can stick to walls and ceilings right? Think about it.

Even though there is not much in the way of side mission variety the things here are fun. Races, petty crimes, helping the police by going behind enemy lines or ending a car chase. Of course there is also taking pictures of crap. I mean, its not like he works at the Daily Bugle or anything. And all of these activities repeat with some variation between the main missions. There is also picking people up (escaped mental patients and infected people) and taking them to the appropriate place. Which is fun because swinging around is friggin awesome.

There are comic books EVERYWHERE and grabbing them out of the sky is super fun because again getting around very liberating and fluid. Its an absolute joy to snag a collectible and proceed to fall and then swing in between two cars at ground level.

The voice acting is actually very good which surprised me, then I recognized and looked up to confirm that Nolan North (Nathan Drake and every other male character not voiced by Troy Baker) and Ali Hillis (Liara T'Soni and Lightning from FFXIII) are in the game.

If you like Spiderman you'll like this game, if you don't, this game won't change your mind. I guess I had more to say than I thought.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Massive optimisation issues, doesn't even launch properly :(

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man (ASM) is set after the events of Columbia Pictures' film and like most movie-based video games, ASM falls short in technical support and voice acting. The game in its current state has random crashes, but it is still is an outright blast. If you're in the mood for some web slinging acrobats and an open world to explore, ASM should provide some satisfaction.

The Amazing Spider-Man
There is only one word for this game: Amazing! First of all the graphics are amazing in this game. I played a lot of open world games mimicking New York City like Grand Theft Auto IV, Prototype 2 or the previous Spiderman game Web of Shadows and this looks by far the best! Swinging around in the city is absolutely fun but when it comes to fights in the air with robots i.e. this becomes pure awesome action. The boss fights are well made and among the best I have seen. What I like too is the cool patter by Peter Parker. When listening to it you get the feeling he's a really nice guy. Very good game and everyone who enjoyed the comics or movies (BTW: this game has nothing to do with the latest movie ;) ) should get this game!

The Amazing Spider-Man
Simply amazing game,as the titles already says,good graphics,well contured characters,but somehow thes story is a bit unsatisfying.Overall a very good Activion game.

The Amazing Spider-Man
i enjoyed this game the camera sensitivity is to high so make sure to change that it the options before
starting the game. when given the launch screen make sure to put everything on high except your shadowing
that should go on medium so no matter what computer the game will run pretty smooth
so the game play is a little hard to figure out at the begining but they do sink in after a while.
the storyline is fun but its alot better just to swing around and collect items

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man - (PC)Final Grade: C+
(Decent, but has significant flaws)

The Need To Know
Graphics options cover the basics, but not much more than that. You can adjust them in a launcher that opens prior to the game starting up.
It took me about 20 hours to complete the game (With All Side Missions done and most of the collectibles found If you're powering through the story missions, you're likely looking at around 8 hours of gameplay or so.
This is a movie tie-in game with The Amazing Spider-Man reboot movie that came out in 2012. It will spoil signficant plot elements of the first movie if you haven't seen it. However, it does NOT tie-in to the events of the second movie.
Reportedly crashes often; Check out this thread for more information.
Capped at 60 FPS.
Not optimized for ATI or AMD Radeon cards. Expect significant stuttering if you have one.
Has a Stan Lee cameo and optional Stan Lee DLCSo, The Amazing Spider-Man tie-in game is a decent little action-adventure that's fun to play, especially if you haven't had a Spider-Man fix in a while. There's a lot to it, and most of it is handled pretty competently, but in my opinion, it's still not quite as good as the now famous Spider-Man 2 tie-in video game. Still, it's a decent amount of fun, and worth the 10 dollars I spent on it.

Narrative

The video game follows almost immediately after the events of the first movie, throwing you in the role of the titular Peter Parker,  helping Gwen Stacy inside of Oscorp and watching as teams are dismantling and disposing of Curt Connors' cross-species research. Unfortunately, the mere prescence of Peter causes the mutated cross-species monsters to react extremely violently, eventually breaking out of containment and spreading a lethal, contagious virus among the scientists, and eventually New York.

It's not a bad premise, and I like the idea of building up on the premise of the previous movie and using it to fuel new ideas. The cross species contamination has resulted into familiar animal-themed villains, such as Scorpion, Rhino, Vermin, Nattie,  and a few more familiar faces show themselves as well. The development for a cure even ties into Peter Parker's own nature as Spider-Man, which I found to be pretty clever.

The characters are all reasonably well-rounded and interesting. Gwen Stacy is a major player in this one, although those who saw her in the movie may be disappointed that Emma Stone does not reprise her role in the game, instead opting to use... well, some other girl. In fact, none of the movie actors show up here, and the voice actors they chose aren't really trying to act like their movie counter-parts. (Oh, well. I understand. Have to save money somewhere.)
The characters themselves are probably the best part of the story. Connor's is a man striving for redemption by destroying the monsters he has created. Smythe is egotistical, but not unsympathetic. Even Peter himself seems exhausted by the constant weight concomitant with being a superhero.

Some minor complaints; the introduction of uber-powerful robots and Mass Effect levels of technology, stretches my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. Apparently Oscorp's idea of dealing with the beginning stages of a viral outbreak is to send out a Reaper. I'm not kidding, it's a Mass Effect Reaper. It's like the first boss, too. I don't mind some science fiction, but given the relatively grounded first movie, I think it's silly that we can go from Modern Day New York" to "Giant Robots" without even a pause for breath. And they never stop coming

The Amazing Spider-Man
I once also read reviews about this game, and what I found was mostly negative.
But I still decided to get the game and I didn't regret it. Sure it has some flaws and it crashes quite often, but despite that I had a lot of fun. The story sets after the first Amazing Spiderman Movie, but it doesn't really matter if you didn't watch it. You start of by doing your first mission and after that you can choose between swinging around in the city or continuing the storyline.  The sidequest makes you earn special features like concept arts etc. Although they are repetitive, it's fun just to swing around the city and finishing them. I played this with a 360 controller and the controls are something you need to get used to.

The story itself isn't mountain moving, but it isn't completely bad either. There aren't a lot of reasons to replay it after one playthrough, expect going for achievements (beating the game on different difficulties). The graphics could have been better, too. 5/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
If I was rating this game based on Spider-Man's toned butt and chiseled abs, I would give this game a 10/10.

But sadly that is not the case. This game isn't the worst I've ever played, but it certainly isn't the best either. And this is coming from a diehard Spider-Man fan. I was so excited for this game. I wanted to love it! But truthfully, this game is just not fun. There are a lot of reasons for this, but ultimately what makes it fail is its repetiveness. Everything about this game is repetitive. The side quests are all exactly the same. Every single one. The main quests are all also the same. You're almost always either in the sewers or Oscorp, and each location basically plays out the same way. Even the boss battles are all the same. You are either fighting a cross-species or a giant robot. Sure, swinging around the city, stopping crime, and trying to save New York is fun in the beginning. But it gets old fast. It got to the point where I had to force myself to finish the game because I wasn't having fun anymore.

There are some good points. The storyline in general was okay. Was it a little repetitive too? Yes. But at least it brought some intrigue to the game. The voice acting was excellent. There were quite a few one-liners in there that had me laughing. I definitely have to give them props for bringing in a Stan Lee cameo. The graphics were pretty good too.

Once again, is the game horrible? No. But it certainly isn't worth $40. Luckily I got it on sale, so I don't feel like I wasted my money. Ultimately I can't recommend this game for the price it's listed. So my advice to you? Wait for it to go on sale. It's worth it if you don't spend too much for it. But don't buy it for $40. You will only find yourself disappointed.

The Amazing Spider-Man
The primary problem is the port from console was not error free. Almost...unplayable. I could not build up continious play time, experiencing crashes no less than every every 15 min. Wait til it's cheaper to check if it works with your rig.

The game itself, plays well, cutscene heavy with button presses during and the rest of the time fighting bosses or in an open world. The world is a decent size, typical collectables but the series events were enjoyable, like some of the powers they give you to play. However, the world events seemed sparse, you have to wait for the next event to unlock.

Common battles are not too tough, but some boss battles take a sec to see the strategy. Then again of course, be ready for your button presses during the cutscenes. Reminds me of Batman playstyle, different world, powers, and events.

Decent game overall, just a little derivative, not that there is anything wrong with it. It is a good formula and it executes minus the almost unplayable errors for the PC/Steam version. Worse off, I check back a bit and no updates.

The Amazing Spider-Man
THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN REVIEW .
+ Nice story
+ Fun web-swinging
+ Gr8 combat

- Boring side missions
- Missions are repitative

OVERALL - 7.5/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
When it first appeared, i loved this reboot of the Spiderman games. And I still love it now. There was one major game breaking inconvinient: Every 2 hours or so, the game crash, independent of what you do, and you have to restart it. However, during my playtime, no saves were corrupted, so don't worry. On with the review then:

Graphics: The Graphics are nice for a 2012 game, Spiderman's character model being the prettiest looking thing in the game, as well as the other Spiderman Suits.

Audio: The Voice acting is really nice, and the music is perfect for each situation. When you are in combat, the music is adequate, and a big plus is the free roam music (8 different tracks which all feel fresh).

Story: While the story is predictable, it is very well tied in and doesn't feel bland and boring. The Ending is also nice and the intro is also fine. All the different cross-species and robots you fight feel very suited for the mission.

Gameplay: The Combat is basically punch - dodge - evade - retreat, taken from the Batman games, but it is nice, and the acrobatic moves which Spidey does keep the battle satisfying and it doesn't get boring very fast. The Free Roam is very nice, the new Web-Rush ability lets you go from point to point very easy and fast, making you in control of Spidey's every move. The Web-Swing, some complain that Spidey ''swings from the sky'' which is true, but if you're not a perfectionist, you won't mind it too much. You also have different web abilities, like web shoot, web grab, the standard spidey moves. There is also a menu where you can customize Spiderman, or his web abilites, which is kind of rewarding. The Boss Battles are pattern-like, every boss has around 3 type of attacks which you will learn REALLY fast. This is a minus from me. By doing several activites (like collecting comic books, finishing the game) you will unlock 5 to 10 Spiderman Suits which are surprisingly eye-appealing and nice. A complain from me would be that most of the main mission take place in Oscorp, or the Sewers, only 2-3 taking place in New York. This was a minus from me. At street level, there isn't much to do, but once you get in the air, the fun begins (because swinging in New York is fun).

Last Impression: I recommend this game to everybody. While it isn't a game changer or some sort of Game of The Year, it is nonetheless a nice experience, and i would play this game again at any time. So, what are you waiting Web-Heads? New York is your playground!

The Amazing Spider-Man
Fun swingin' and beatin' up , but the since it's ported it needs to be better optimized.

The Amazing Spider-Man
Had to delete a file just so I could click launch game from the graphics settings.

Resolution wouldn't change. Looked for fix, found 5 different ways to try, none worked.

If I wanted to play this game on the resolution of a calculator screen, I'd turn it upside down and spell out boobs" with numbers instead.

nvidia users beware.

[TL;DR]
Spend your money on a calculator."

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider Man.  Not exactly amazing, yet it is lighthearted and easy to play.  Addictive although riddled with crashes.   Repetitive indoor scenes that make you yearn to swing around the city again.  It lacks the depth and story telling that the Batman series has despite the amount of attention this superhero has had over the last decade.  I would put this as slightly better than average game with a reasonable amount of content for a sale price.  Don't expect it to have much in the way for replay value even if you're trying to earn the achievements.  The annoying crashes and ridiculous amount of comic book pages strewn throughout the city and indoor maps won't have you drinking your favorite energy/caffeinated beverage and threatening to miss an important event.  I give it a 6.5/10 for fun with flair despite obvious shortcomings.

Update:  The story does seem a little less hokey once complete, but I still feel empty for having finished the normal difficulty.  The achievements on Steam only update when the game decides you can finish a certain number of achievements.  It's not a fully open & live world.  Things become available for you to do as chapters unlock so in a sense it's really a forced linear progression with optional challenges.  There aren't random wandering villains doing things on their own for you to take a break from the story.

The Amazing Spider-Man
I wish I could play this game but it crashes to desktop everytime I try to run it on a setting higher than low". I would have tried playing it on the low setting but it chugs like I'm trying to play this on a wimpy computer. From what I've read it's an issue with AMD cards. So I guess avoid this game if you have an AMD."

The Amazing Spider-Man
This game is wicked fun! I am and always have been a huge marvel fan spidey being my favorite. I have played every imaginable game possible that includes spider-man. I dunno about the bad reviews, I guess not a game for them. I like the story, the voice acting is great and I quite enjoyed the missions. Some state the game crashes all the time... get a new computer or something, cause it never crashes for me. And I mean never!

The free roaming is awesome, but like ANY free roaming game it will get boring, just normal. The graphics are great in my opinion and this does not feel like a bad port at all, I have seen much much worse. I think it handles the Keys and Mouse very well, if not the controller will work too.

My only disappointment was some of the DLCs. I like the Stan Lee pack (king of cameo). But The other ones were meh! SImple chanllenges and can'T really do anything more than that.

Anyways AMAZING GAME! 8/10

The Amazing Spider-Man
I have an AMD processor, and this game was nearly unplayable. If you have an AMD processor, make very sure that Amazing Spider Man will run on your processor before you buy

The Amazing Spider-Man
NOW IT IS MISSING EXECUTABLE, WHAT IS THAT? WHY IS THIS HAPPENING, IT IS SO STUPID I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! >:(

The Amazing Spider-Man
Kind of interesting game, but optimization ruins all fun you can get from it. Regular crashes approximately every 30 minutes make game almost impossible to play. Typical for Activision, try to sell a game without even testing it. Of course

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man?  More like the Amazing Spider-TURD.  This game is bad.  I wasted so much on this and it's insulting, too.  You literally go around beating up mental patients.  They aren't even demon possessed or anything.  They are just people with mental illness that you beat up with a sort of Batman Arkham action gameplay, but much less smooth.  I was excited for this game because the boss battles looked great and I thought that it was going to be like the great Batman games only with Spider-Man.  Nope.  Game is frustating and somewhat buggy.  It's crashed on me so many times during the game.  There is no style to it and the plot is very stock.  I guess it would be alright if it was like 5-10 bucks but it's overpriced and lame.

Stay away from this game.  Save your money and buy much cheaper and much better games.  You could get 4 games that are far superior to this for the same price.

The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing" part: You get to play as Spider-Man!

The "Awful" part: Virtually everything else!

Seriously

The Amazing Spider-Man
the launch game button doesnt work after the stupid graphics setup, so i cant even play it!!

The Amazing Spider-Man
there is fix that worked in the past but now it no longer does for me and some others link below. I have an HD7970ghz 3GB amd fx-8350, and 16gb of ram. And now the The Amazing Spiderman 2" is out but there still has been no patch to fix this..... considering that I'm not the only one that this game doesn't work for and it would seem to be centered around ATI GPU. There really should be a warning on the games page at the least that this game is not supported on ATI cards not a "Hey it works on those cards" ie "Recommended: Graphics: NVidia 8800GT / AMD ATI Radeon HD4830" . yeah you will lose some money I get that but this is false advertisement the game doesn't work. I have half a mind to submit a class action lawsuit for this issue it's pure negligence. even if it's to show game developers that you can't just release a game that doesn't function I mean even games in alpha and beta on steam warn you and are like "hey were not promising anything". I shouldn't have to use a third party work around to just get the game running. (that now doesn't even work for my card and others I see.) considering now the game simply crashes the instant I click to start the game. I mean seriously that game has been out since 6/26/2012 and it's now 5/7/2014 that almost two years that it's been broken even going to activision for support gets you nothing. they just tell me to do things I though and did a dozen times before ever contacting them about this in attempt to fix it to no avail.

Lags like hell on AMD cards, unplayable. You may have better luck if you're not using one, however.

The Amazing Spider-Man
CAUTION!The game is broken and unplayable.

Couldn't play the game when it came out because of bad optimisation. My last PC used to be crap but it was able to run Battlefield 3 and even Witcher 2.
The PC was crap but it should have been powerful enough to run THIS game on medium settings at the very least.
But bad optimisation is the least of it problems.

The following is 100% true for Windows 8/8.1/10

Fast forward to 2016. I have a new PC now and I finally decided to give The Amazing" Spider-Man a go.
As a first surprise the launcher told me that I don't have enough memory to play this game. This is of course a filthy lie. I have more memory than I need.
After looking around for a bit I found a solution: Delete the VideoDetection.dll file and you're good to go.
I did that

Better than The Amazing Spider-Man 2 thats for sure

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Well, I will start with the good things first. This game is fun, its very easy to pick up and its interface is fairly user friendly. Its tutorial could be a bit more in depth, but all in all if your looking to enjoy a game for a few hours and it is free this is a good way to go. I say a few hours and I dont recommend this game because thats all it takes to get from tier 1 to 4 in the ships... then at tier 4 is where the problems begin and i mean serious problems. Like world of tanks this game uses a tier system for ships with relatively weak ships at low tier and strong ships at high tier, At tier 4 you will start to see tier 9 to 11 ships, this basically ends the game. These ships have double your hp, do double your damage and have double your view range. Prepare to be destroyed over and over again.

As this game has a small community 95% of games will be like this, every so often you get a rare gem of same tier ships in a game and for me this simple but engaging game is great at times like that. But having to work your way thru game after game of no contest destruction by ships much higher level is tedious at best. This then brings me onto the second problem with this game, and for me the more important issue. The people in the tier 9 to 11 ships, the games veterans. There is two sides to this and I can see both, there appears to be very few people reach these high tiers so without being placed in games against low tiers they would never be able to play these top tier monsters. But this has the knock on affect of no one will reach high tier because of what i said above.

The other side is the attitude of these veterans, they are toxic and rude people. If you dare to point out the inbalance of this matchmaking their attitude is disgusting, and so I am sad to say that for once a game is ruined by the people who play it. They are rude, offer no assistance and generally a nasty group of people. So let them have their high tiers thats fine, and hopefully people will read this and heed my warning to not play this game, so eventually they'll  be left with a ghost game and maybe then they'll see the consquences of there actions.

In short a decent fun game thats easy to play. But awful matchmaking and TOXIC COMMUNITY VETERANS.



UPDATE FOR IN RESPONSE TO STYLER27

Styler27 how am I an angry ragequitter, I clearly state on multiple occasions the game is good it just has flaws. I dont understand your aggression towards a player who has played the game at entry level as everyone has to and had a torrid time, To help clarify as well my WR is 51%, so it has nothing to do with what I won and what I lost it was my experience while playing. Pay to Win doen't bother me either I never even mentioned that system in my review. Finally Styler27 just to make it abundantly clear in my 20 hours I reached Tier 6 destroyer, tier 5 Cruiser, Tier 6 Battleship, Tier 5 Heavy Cruiser and Tier 5 Aircraft Carrier. So yes I did experience the game, and anyone who has read our little exchange can see what the NF2 community is like, you represent them perfectly. I have offered constructive and objective criticism, I have even expressed areas I enjoyed. Then you wade in with your personal attack, NF2 community please welcome Styler27 to prove us all wrong. Thank you styler27.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Great concept of a game, terrible game company, terrible administration, terrible execution.

No team play, no balance, no end game goals, terrible support, poor game dynamics.

Navyfield was able to run for 10 years, despite their managers (Game Developers and Company Management) doing everything they could in order to make it fail. Up to this day they make the worse decisions ever and out of the blue they are nuking their most loyal players from the game without any sort of explanation.

You just have to check what is going on with Navyfield to get a feeling of what you will go through with Navyfield 2. Players who have purchased subscription and items are being removed from the game without breaking any rules and are losing all what they have invested. This fabulous concept has turned into a scam to lure people into giving money only to be removed from the game days later without any possibility of getting their hard earned money back.


It is a South Korean company run by North Korean mentality. I suggest you stay far far far away from all this. The game is not worth the drama and terrible customer support you will undoubtedly go through while playing with this game company.

Seriously, don't even think about playing this game. NF2 is just a money scam.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I have played both Navyfield 1 (started mid 2009) and Navyfield 2 since launch. I have 3 level 50+ captains in NF2 so ignore what steam says about me not playing for very long.

I'll try to be as in-depth but at the same time I'll give you the straight truth on what's going on with this game...

Box art description: Navy Field is a game about WW2 naval battles where you choose a nation, decide which ship line to go down, then play out sea warfare in glorius 2006-era graphics. Where the game lacks in graphics, it makes up for in strategic combat that can actually be quite thrilling if you're into this sort of game.


THE GRIND:Now let me get this out of the way first: This will be the make or break the game for most of you out there.

There is a term for what this game puts you through and that term is Grind". This game will require days of your life in order for you to play ANY ship beyond Tier VII. There are 11 tiers.

The good news is that the first 6 tiers are fairly easy to get to by playing normally without any sort of booster or Premium(More on this later). The better news is you can get to every single ship class by Tier IV so you can try all different playstyles before you uninstall this game because of the crazy grind to Tier X.

THE P2W:All in all

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I was a fan of Navyfield, i've passed a lot of time on it when i was young.
I hoped that Navyfield 2 could be that cool, but i was wrong.
They basically made navyfield in 3d, and simplify it to the bone.

Progression like world of tank, no more shop with different cannons with different stat, now you progress throught 2-3 cannons that are barely the same.

No more armor add like it was, now you buy the slot in the ship and than you can buy armor buff token that last 7 days.

Pay to win, try to stop a full buff shopper, all the team need to focus him, and he will oneshot everything.

No more officer trading.

Cant name the ship.

They speed up every ship like twice of Navyfield1. Smaller ship are like speedboat that drift throught the ocean, also even the torpedo are twice the speed.

The matchmaking is fu**ed, when i hit tier 4 i faced tier 7 ships in every match.



Sorry nexon, but you made a flop, this game is comparable to a tablet game. All you had to do is to udpate the graphics, not to change it to a super simply pay to win game.
Stick with navyfield 1 guys.


Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I was a big fan of NF1, and I'm dissapointed by how much less depth the replacement has.

In NF1, ships had weapon mounts of a certain size and you could put any gun that would fit onto them. Deciding if you were going to specialize in anti-ship, anti-air, or anti-sub meant physically re-fitting your ship with the appropriate equipment you preferred. Now, ships are un-moddable objects with a couple unlockable upgrades for slightly more accuracy or speed.

In NF1, games were custom lobbies. Hosts could choose game-types and maps, as well as auto ballancing or manual. Now, there's only a matchmaking button. CO-OP games against AI have been removed too. That makes practicing manual firing mode tough.

There are many more aspects of NF1 that are removed or dumbed down for NF2, those are just the biggest two that stood out in my first few games.

Finially, and this is just my opinion, but I liked the high detail 2D graphics of NF1 more than the low detail 3D graphics of NF2.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
What could have been a good game, has turned into a piece of garbage.  It is deffinatly a PAY TO WIN game, that non wallet warriors have little chance of success. It seems like it is following every other cash grab games plan.

The game play is interesting enough, but the science fiction that it incorporates is VERY dissapointing...I still cant get over how games can scew up HISTORY....This one is no different......a few examples.

1. teleporting of ships....REALLY???
2. Desrtoyers (wallet warrior) that can take 8 Long lance torpedo hits (most Destroyers could not survive 1 LOL)
3. Landing Craft that can outrun a Light Cruiser with armor to rival a Cruiser (they look like PT boats they are so fast)

Then we can get into the downtime of the game as of late...not good, with them changing their minds like their underwear on issues they are trying to fix"....ends up WORSE!

I gave it 3 weeks of play before writing this review to be fair....Just fyi.

I had really hoped for it to be better."

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Wasnt sure at first if this would be better than NF1 though I highly doubt it.

Thing is, it just doesnt matter. The game has P2W elements. I dont know why the other reviews say no P2W. (they obviously didn't check the shop/they think no sane person would purchase them when thats not true for people with jobs)

Few examples: %5 less reload time with ingame credits. %10 less reload time with real money. Theirs different types of this like repair rate ect. On top of that they all weigh less on your ship as well. (less decreased speed on gold purchased upgrades) PLUS: They stack up as well on your ship.

Morale boosts with real money so you can make sure you are having close to 100% of your sailor stats or you can easily go negative or just not reach there without a grind of wins.

Also you can get gold officers which start with +31 of a specific stat. Ingame credit officers start with all 1 stats and will most likely cap out without the 31 bonus that gold officers get only.

Theres just no excuse for having this type of monetization. Should of kept it to skins and premium time. Do you really want to support P2W features and have it snowball back to style like in previous Korean games?

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
If you want good Naval game don't bother with this one. A little history behind this game and mine statement:

I have played this game few years ago when it had been released by Nexon and it was bad. Game was closed after few months because it did not have player base and why? Because it was unbelievable Pay To Win - just few examples: premium captain, premium crew members, premium ships, premium account, premium armour, premium upgrades and what had been the best? Everything had been time limited for 1 week or 1 month EVEN PREMIUM SHIPS!

So as I mentioned it have been closed. But then the original developer of NavyField 1 and Navyfield 2 decided Hey

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Okay, I thought this game was bad because of steam reviews. But the game isnt bad at all. Sure the graphics are a bit outdated, but graphics dont make the game. And it really is a free to play. I didnt have to go to my wallet for any boosts or buying ships.

The game has factions of WW2: USA, Japan, England, and Germany. It has all kinds of ships. battleships, destroyers, aircraft carriers, light and heavy cruisers. Even heroic ships, the USS Nevada, Duke of Wellington i think it was,  and the legendary Bismark. Now this game is very easy to learn and get into really quickly. You can work your way to your first battleship in less than a hour.

Now the gameplay itself focuses on two sides:alpha and bravo. Each side has a flagship, so losing the flagship is like losing the queen piece in chess. And once you die, you die. So there is a ton of strategy depending on your role.

On the bad side, ugh took too long to make an account, and if you're new, you will die a lot, but least you get good points and xp. And when it rains, totally screws up your LoS sometimes. And the submarines will take sometime to master.

Overall, it's not bad as the people say it was, you should check it out. Good luck and have fun.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I'll keep this short and simple, this is a game that comes on from a great legacy in Navy Field. Navy Field was a game which rewarded skill and practice, learning angles, timing torpedo runs, hiding from the enemy fleet as a submarine. It was a truly fun if a time consuming game. Each ship had a role and they all worked as a combined unit

Navy field 2 is none of that, its too arcadey. Ships are far too agile with Battleships easily turning and slotting through torpedo runs when turning in them should be a large effort, they act more like Destroyers in Navy Field than Battleships. On top of this you have Carriers, all ways fun in Navy Field as they were strong but any ship which could slip in could kill them easy and submarines were there bane but in this they are pretty much freexp, torpedo planes can drop and arm torpedo's from 2 meters and this makes Dive Bombers pointless and fighters are not worth the time as they cannot kill Torpedo planes before they drop there Torp run.

Overall if you want an Arcade warship game then turn to World of Warships or Battlestations: Pacific, if you want a fun Sim type navy game then try Navy Field but this tries to be both and succeeds at neither

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I really wanted to like this game. I had my own fleet in NF1 and I was really hoping that this would be as good. Sadly it isn't.

It feels clunkier, and manouevrering seems unrealistic.

Increasing the ships' speed is unnaturally fast, I mean if a ship accelerated at this speed, you'd have to scrape the crew from the inside of the stern.

The interface on NF1 was built using sprites but even though this is an outdated way of developing games it somehow worked. The upgrade to the new graphics has done nothing to make the game feel better than previous versions.

Like another reviewer says, I don't want to compare this to WoWS but the developers or NF2 could get a better idea of how to improve this game by looking at one or two things from those games.

I'll try this again in a few months and see if things have improved.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Ive played this game alot, the only thing worse than the matchmaking is the lack of teamwork that leads to spending 15 minutes in a battle to literally get nothing but a repair bill.

Its an interesting game that i did actually enjoy a bit until the player base expanded more. The community is becoming very toxic with little to no moderation and as others have said, it is extremely easy to win with your wallet.

the tutorials and menus are terrible but once you get the figured out its not so bad, alot of the text and tooltips are severly lacking and sometimes are just an outright lie (some ship add ons say you cant have miltiple and others say nothing about it until you try to use it and then can only sell it back for half price).

I was using this as a relaxing time waster but now its just a lesson in futility.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
best uninstaling sumilator EVER.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Go play World of Warships.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Fun game, arcade style combat isn't what I like but, overall I approve. Tons of ships to play, nice game design with base capturing, seems very balanced. The balance part is good and bad I think, My first game I sunk a BB with the starter dinghy, which seemed like it should be impossible, but was fun.

Plenty of P2W items, but limited item slots so P2W gets a small bonus that others cannot get, this is the games biggest negative. All the p2w items have double the bonus of the ingame currency version. Elite $ crew get 30% bonus compared to currency version.

The 2nd biggest negative, no tooltips or some other mechanic explaining what everything does, and the menu is poorly designed; it can be hard to figure out what exactly items do , how to equip them etc. Without testing you don't know if there are caps in place for crew skills etc (does it help to have 3 max lvl repairers, or does it cap at 1 repairer? who knows...)

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
First, I am not going to compare this game to what will (or might be) WoWS, or the WT version of naval battles, as those are different games with a different aproach. I will try to give an objective review of the game and not its competition.
Second, I won't review balance, or what I think are temporary issues. The developer is fairly reactive and each weekly patch brings a lot to the game in my opinion. There are still issues, but I judge a game by its fun and its potential.

Pros:
- Gameplay is fun. Very fun. It is fast paced, team-based, strategic, and skill and positioning are a huge part of the game. You'll never get bored during a game. Guaranteed. Too much to do and think about.
- Gameplay is varied. Playing a BB (Battleship), a DD (Destroyer), a CV (Aircraft Carrier) or a SS (Submarine) is very different, so that you can add variety to your gameplay from one game to the other or just find your playstyle. Each ship has its role (even 2 CLs can have very different roles depending on their loadout). You constantly switch between weapons (guns, torps, planes, mines, depth charges, AA, ...) and try to make the most out of it while navigating your ship. Significantly different maps. Game is surprisingly deep.
- Beginning progression is very fast so you can get any class of ship within hours, and then you have to invest your time to get the top tiers. They just boosted permanently XP and credit gain by 2 and 1.5 respectively, for everyone.
- Game makes it in a way that a tier I can take out a tier VII if played correctly/smartly. Very rewarding.
- NOT Pay 2 Win. Premium account gives you the usual XP and Credit boost for faster progression. Some real money items give increased (temporary) stats in game but to the order of 10% max; which is definitely overcome by skill and teamplay. It is more P2W than games with a pure cosmetic cash shop, but I strongly believe the advantages are not significant.
- Developer is its own publisher/editor, on this instance of the game, which means faster development cycle and patches.
- Easy game to get into (simple basic controls, basic goals, immediate action, ...) ...

Cons:
- ... but difficult to actually understand. Poor documentation and tutorials forces you to discover things by yourself, or ask the community, to understand better how to play. Community is decent and people will answer your questions. This problem sometimes leads to frustration, but it is rewarding to get to know the game better. Lots of Eureka" moments.
- Linked to the above

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I've played this game a few months and have about 900 games under my belt.  If you're looking for a free-to-play naval game with arcade like gameplay then you should give this game a shot.  I only recommend it as such though, do not expect 100% realistic gameplay or you will be dissapointed.

Pros:

1)  Ship types are not only useful but neccessary for a team to win.  A team with 10 Battle Ships will lose to a mixed force that plays the map properly.

2)  Similar to World of Tanks there are smaller vessels that exist in high tiers.  Think of it as light tanks or medium tanks at high tiers except with ships.  They all have their role on the battlefield.

4)  Personal skill means a lot.  You cannot simply stomp someone just because you have a higher tier ship.  If you rush in without care then you will see lower tier ships mop the floor with you.

5)  Rock-Paper-Scissors balance.  As stated above you need a mixed force however you can get hard countered by certain ships.  Submarines are able to take out Battle Ships and Aircraft Carriers with ease if the Destroyers and Light Cruisers do not hunt them down.


Cons:

1)  As in World of Tanks or War Thunder there will be games you just cannot win due to having a team that does silly things.  Personal performance can only carry you so far and some games are just unwinnable.

2)  Aircraft have no fuel gauge so if you plan to roll up the CV line you better have good micromanagement skills.

3)  Some people say the game is insanely grindy.  In the past that has been true however the XP gains have been adjusted to reasonable levels.  This makes it possible for anyone to get into ships earlier than they probably need to be.  It only took 400 games to reach Tier 9 in the CV line but then again most people would say that's too much for an arcade like game.  XP has been doubled since then so hopefully that issue isn't around anymore for newer players.

4)  No physics for ships.  You can stack all the ships together and have them occupy the same space.  If anyone shoots they'll hit the others which leads to people never crossing" eachother to avoid accidentally blowing up the ally who cut across them.  A very cheesy tactic is to move your ship into the same space as the enemy ship so that their team cannot help them without blowing up their ally.  Meanwhile you can just pound away at their ship from within their footprint in the water.  Some ships have no way to lower their guns and cannot hit targets that close... all they can do is hope the smaller ship inside them runs out of ammo as they die a slow painful death.



Is this game good?  I think so.  I'd pay $20.00 for this game if they asked since it's on par with the quality you would expect from a $20.00 game.  The matches do not last very long

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Like going to the finest restaurant in town and finding your water is served in styrofoam cups, the flaws in this game do make you roll your eyes, but always over something that doesn't really matter. The core naval combat game seriously rocks. Zaggat rated 5 stars.

Battles are 15 minutes long, if you survive that long or decide to stick around and watch the end after you are sunk. Ship on ship combat is nearly perfect, though the boats move a bit too fast for my taste, but you do get used to that. Graphics are nice except for anything written. They use some font that doesn't work well on my PC. Legible when tweaked, but not great.

The pay-to-win elements are truly kept in check, unlike most games. To me, this speaks volumes about the devs. They actually understand that a well-balanced game will bring in more money. Every P2W element gives a slight advantage, but this game is so heavily skill-based that those slight advantages can be easily overcome by superior skill.

There are 2 main gaming areas: the Battlefield and the Shipyard. The Shipyard is where you get new ships, put equipment on your ship, train your officers, etc. The major flaws in this game have nothing to do with battle. Battle is great. I mean it. Great. The flaws are with peripheral things like: It is hard to register to get the game started, there is no steam overlay (at least for some users currently), when I started the game, I couldn't read anything. Their FAQ page said to make your GUI bigger in Game Options if you can't read the font. The real solution was to turn down my screen resolution one level. Everywhere you look in the Shipyard will be phrases that were obviously translated into English by a computer translator, and then never proofread by a person who actually speaks English. Much of the instructions are tragically non-sensical. Fortunately the wiki is getting bigger everyday, and the forums and guides are good. And players in chat are helpful (which is another nice change of pace). So the Shipyard can be a bit difficult to figure out, but nothing there is real-time. You can always stop and ask for help when confused in the Shipyard. But that's it for flaws. Minor flaws that make you roll your eyes, but nothing that affects the core gaming experience, which is happily rock solid.

Lots of newbies think this game is too hard, but it's usually because they don't understand that their small fast low-level ships can get to the enemies' big ships quicker than their own big ships can get there. Then they try to fight the big enemies without the back-up of their own big ships who won't arrive for another minute. This is a thinking-person's game. This game relies on understanding your role in a complex team, which few people seem to get. Then they complain that matches are made that put them up against top tier ships. Well guess what? You have the option to run away! Just at the start of battle, look to see the names of the players in high tier ships and avoid them, noob! It is a fun challenge if you don't play it like a boxing match where if you see an enemy you attack without thinking! There are things for low level players to do besides fight, like capture npc bases to give your team an airfield or something. Sheesh!

8.6/10 Would sink while desperately trying to dodge depth charges in my sub again.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Terrible game. No team play, no balance.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Navy Field 2 is a good game in the sense that you're never bored.  Sure, the grind to the highest tier of ships can be boring at times, but not every game is the same.

Let me break the game down really quick and justify why I can recommend this game.  Each game takes 15 minutes to play and every class has a use.  Destroyers can take down Battleships with good torpedo placement and kill subs, Light Cruisers can hunt down Destroyers and aircraft, Heavy Cruisers are very much pocket Battleships and Battleships, well, deals tons of damage from afar but have limited maneuverability and sigh.  Carriers are just as important because you're constantly fighting off enemy aircraft, providing your fleet with line of sight, and bombing other ships.  Sometimes the matchmaking will get a little wonky and put you in games with higher level ships, but I've had games where my lower tier Destroyer will be able to drop a high-tier Battleship so I'm not complaining.  Not too much anyway.

The game is not as Pay to Win as most people make it out to be.  It's more of a grindfest more than anything, and the Premium account will make it easier to grind.  It's as simple as that, since there's nothing that's actually limiting gameplay.  Sure, you can spend gold and buy a few Officers and whatnot to edge out on higher-level opponents, but for the most part they are not necessary for the game.

So let me go back to the 15 minutes per game part.  Even if you lose because you got blown out of the water, you can quit the game with some reward and begin your next game immediately.  The combat game itself is fantastic for this regard because there's always something to do.  Every second I'm managing my ship's speeds, dodging torpedoes, shooting off torpedoes of my own, training my guns for an effective angle and lead, and being aware of the map at the same time.  Having played RTS and MOBAs competitively, I would say this definitely ranks up there in terms of active things you can do to improve your game.  This is where the skill of the player comes in, and comes in in a big way.  A player that can take full advantage of his ship will be able to come up in a big way vs. a player who doesn't, regardless of tier.

Overall, I definitely recommend players give this game a try.  It's fast-paced and can be unforgiving at times, but that's what I look for in a game that's designed around leveling up and tiers.  You need the combat to be highly engaging so the grind doesn't seem endless and that's what Navy Field 2 does very well.  The one thing that the developers needed in the game was proper documentation.  I feel that the game right now is a lot of bro-science.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Tons of issues. For one, your income is fixed per game.

You earn same exp and credit if you do 50000 damage or 500000 damage,

or if you spend 5 min on a game or 20 min on it.

Do not bother with this game it becomes a match of hide in the dark and shoot quickly. You can never have fun because of this and its extremely unrealistic and unbalanced. It makes carriers the number 1 ship because of this.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Question #1: is Navy Field 2 a fun game? Absolutely.

Question #2: is Navy Field 2 as good as World of Warships? Not in a million years.

That really is the truth of the matter. World of Warships beats NF2 in pretty much every category. It has superior historical accuracy, it's more immersive, it has a larger player base, it has better support, more map and game mode variety, and overall is a better game. NF2 is a top down shooter with arcade models; WoWs is a graphically beautiful simulator with serious ships. There really is no contest. If you have a good enough machine and graphics card to play WoWs, stop reading this and go download it.

...aw hell, that would be too easy. Okay then: here are four things that NF2 does better.

1) NF2 has more ships. A LOT more ships. The US Navy, Royal Navy, IJN and Kreigsmarine are all featured, whereas WoWs is still in open beta and only has the US Navy and IJN. With the occasional exception (no King George V-class battleships), all of the notable ships are there-and yes, that includes the Yamato. And yes, those 18 inch guns hurt like hell.

2) NF2 has subs. WoWs does not. While some destroyers in WoWs can be savage little ninjas, you only get true stealth in NF2. It is actually fairly well balanced to boot. It's not easy to use a sub well, but when you do, the rewards are spectacular. Equally, it takes time for destroyer drivers to learn how to hunt a sub. When an experienced sub and an experienced destroyer meet, it leads to a tense game of cat-and-mouse.

3) Unlike WoWs, which puts similar tiers against each other, there is no such limitation in NF2. It is entirely possible to play your first game in a massive 15v15 match, with a Yamato and an Iowa blazing away at each other which you whizz about in your pokey little beginner destroyer. You really do have no idea what you'll run into when you hit the Battle button, and the possibilities for emergent game experiences are substantial. While that can lead to some difficult games as you fight against higher-tier ships and more experienced players, it can also be quite fun.

4) NF2 has decent community, overall. It is absolutely advisable to join a Fleet; like all multiplayer games, it's best played with friends. Doing damage to a Yamato in your tier 1 destroyer is great; distracting a Yamato while your two friends in their battleships sink the monster is even better.

I hope that helps. NF2 is fun-just don't expect it to be as good as WoWs.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Navy Field 2 is on Steam now, its pretty neat really. it looks nice visually (at least in comparison to the first game), the gameplay feels a bit different from the first Navy Field game. Otherwise its clearly a Navy field game.  I honestly dont have tons of experience with the series, and I know it mostly through friends who play, and have played it. I was glad this came to steam though so I could give it a try. I should say through there are still some kinks to be worked out, that for sure. Mostly 'quality of life fixes. Really though if you like "navy" games then you should try Navy Field 2

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Well, simply I just love warship games. I would like to play World Of Warships, but I dont have invitation code ;( . Kantai Collection is unreachable for me too. Only Battlestations left (but it's not on multi anyway), so for me only avaiable MMO warship game is Navy Field. I've played NF 1 long time ago, so now it's time to test number '2'. After first hours of gameplay I must admit that second NF is somehow odd for me. I mean game looks better in matter of animations and 3D view, unfortunately ships details are really badly drawed. Very poor compared to NF 1. Another thing is that game is more simplified than NF 1, by saying this I mean, there are much less modifications and items for ships unlike in NF 1, where was plenty of it. Well... automatic aiming is somehow better in version 2. Generally game is average, but for warship fan like me it looks quite more interesting. Anyway, I recommend for try. It's kinda funny.

Just more of the same free-to-play shovelware with microtransactions, to better separate idiots from their money. Just another glorified mobile game ported to the PC. Skip it.

the first on was better. now the match making sucks because no one plays and no one plays becasue the match making sucks. has less content  but looks alot better. the skill system is genaric so no more amazingly planed out crews. if you want a boat game go to the original navy Field

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
There's a low play time on my account because it just got released on steam.  That being said I have been playing this since December and have several high tier captains along most all of the branches.

This game is fun, and frustrating at times. For example when it rains your accuracy goes to nil in the bigger ships, and it rains a lot so it's very annoying to not be able to hit anything while you are this big ship that's nearly impossible to miss.

The items in the store are much too expensive, though they seem to be balancing that. For example when the game first released a premium sailor was somewhere near 1200 gold, now it's better at 300 so I think they are working on that.

The game is easy enough to pick up and learn, but a little more difficult to master, especially carrier game play.

All in all, the game has it's flaws but it's a fun game to play now and again.


3 stars out of 5 could be better, could be worse, it's all about where they take the game from here.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
That game had so big potential and what they did? Tier system like in WarThunder or Wargaming's games, removed all ship customization options and gave ships with useless upgrade tree, no possibility to make your own ship and play it you own way. They removed feature which made this game so special and interesting, feature which force players to think about their ships and crews. You had to plan your progress to reach well developed ship in later game.


PROS:
- now its clicker for players who want to play easy game and kill some time
- matchmaker which makes finding games easier
- interesting base capture system

CONS:
- tiers and upgrade tree killed true NavyFields spirit
- lack of armor customization - you had to buy armor increase for 7 days, really?! :D
- lack of engine customization
- lack of armament customization
- lack of ammo customization
- lack of crew customization
- lack of ANY DAMNED CUSTOMIZATION - just follow stupid schemas and have brainless fun

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Where to start...

The game is free-to-play, which also means there's a pay2win aspect somewhere in the game. However, unlike most others, you don't pay to get ships, you need to earn them. The only thing you're paying for (or at least want to pay for), would be the premium 50% boost that helps in the grind through ship tiers later, the officers for an extra boost, and/or extra ship slots to keep more ships (honestly, you don't need more than 5 if you plan on sticking with one or two classes). Otherwise, everything is obtainable through just playing normally.

Now, the matchmaking. Yes, it needs some tweaking. You're not always going to be placed against people of your tier level, but I believe there's a good reason behind this, being that you get to experience fighting against different types of ship classes. And remember that the matchmaking puts you against a fleet (not clan fleet, just a fleet) equal to yours, meaning if they have Tier 9, you have buddies who are Tier 9 as well (or Tier 9 equivalent). The downside? You get wrecked if you're not careful.

Best advice for new players is to capture islands, sub detect and provide AA, while trying to support your team from behind and survive. Everyone starts out as a Destroyer so you don't get to do much unless you're really good with your torpedoes and shelling first hand (I've sunk Battleships, just saiyan), it's pretty easy. Heck, you might even manage to land a kill steal and get that huge amount of XP.

Eventually you'll reach Tier 3 in a few battles if you try to power through all the upgrades and not invest in any of your ship equipment. My friend did it in less than 30 minutes. You CAN face against stronger enemies even at low levels, but that relies on teamwork, not charging into everything.

The community. I haven't really talked to many, so I can't really say, but I've had battles won with teamwork where we were outnumbered, some cooperative, some not. It happens.

The grind. I'm a fairly new player myself although I've played since February (before dropping it for a while cause gemes), so I have yet to reach that part of the game. I'm still at Tier 5, using Destroyers, and I can tell you the amount of XP and credits you accumulate increase based on the ship tier you're using, so you might get like 300 or 400 at say, Tier 2, before getting 2000 to 3000 at Tier 5. Then again if you think the game's fun and all, it might not be so bad to invest time to grind, but if you're not that kind of person, better decide now whether you want to drop it.

Graphics? Ship docks look good. Actual game? Not so much. What, were you expecting some WoW or WT tier graphics?

My opinion? The game isn't nearly as close to frustrating me. I just like naval games and try to have fun. :v

Should you play it? Well I mean, just because there's a lot of mixed reviews doesn't mean you shouldn't try it out and see for yourself.

(NOT SPONSORED BY NAVYFIELD 2)

EDIT: So after countless battles, I am now at Tier 7, with ships of different classes also at Tier 7. To be honest, the game isn't really that frustrating once you get used to it, since you win and lose (although you lose more and that's kind of a good thing since XP gain is much faster with losing compared to winning).

The grind, however, becomes increasingly harder. And it's more around the amount of XP required for each upgrade before you get to the next ship than the XP gain itself. For me though, it's not a problem, since I enjoy playing the game either way. It gets a bit repetitive here and there, but eventually I managed. With 4 ships at Tier 7 equivalent (under 2 weeks of grinding; 1-3 hours a day), what's to not get bored of?

Psst, the maps.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
Login, forums, support, and even creating an account are all f***ed. Despite my countless tries to fix my issues. Such as unable to retrieve a password because my email has not been registered, well it would be great if i could register an email to send my password to. But no, I have to know my password first! Tried creating a brand new, non-steam account but there was no Create Account" button to be found!

DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME!

They released this game and the website prematurely. These devs are the worst at linking Steam with a website. I tried and decided to stop wasting my time to figure this sh*t out. Oh and don't bother trying to make a new account VIA steam... Unless of course you want to make a brand new steam account!

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
The game as a MMO offers good team-working gameplay.
As a  historical simulation game set in certain period of our history it excellently simulates 2WW-Era naval battles,
giving real difference among certain ship classes and their role in battle.

There are ofc real cash paid items, as in every freemium games, but they are giving you only a slight advantage.
What matters the most is player skills - both tactical, and manual. This scecond plays the bigest role, when you decide
to use - in my opinion  the best feature of the game - manual keyboard ship gun aiming control. (in WW2 there were none point&click aiming systems!)

The game has some disadvantages, nothing and nobody is perfect,
but the devs had shown, that they are really listening the community, making changes that goes straight along players wishes.

Fun game until you get to the end of tier 4.  At that time, it goes to 31/32 times more grinder for each new ship.  Fun for a few days, worth downloading till tier 5

An action/tactical shoot-out with the big inch guns of the Naval fleets.

Has four different countries with mutiple classes of ships, giving a big variety of gameplay.

Matches are generally large with good sized maps to contain the players within.

Highly recommend giving it a chance.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
The game isnt that bad, they could have done much better though. Many NF veteran rather play the old NF over this, i do like them both, but it seem alittle off with realism and balance. Here you have women on board, so many torpedoes for small ships, there no telling what will happen with women on board that sailors (men) get distracted and sank the boat itself.

If you liked Navy Field 1 you will probably like this.

End of the day its a pretty fun game and its free so your really not losing much to try it out.
I think as long as you enjoy things like world of tanks / war thunder then you will probably enjoy it.  If you hate those games still give it a go unless you have download limits your just losing your time if you hate it.

I played the first version in the early years and it was good.
They improved the graphics, made the customization easier and added some new functions.
I prefered the waiting room like the first version instead of waiting matchmakings in the dock though.
The game is good but I'm losing every game because lack of teamwork.

Navy Field 2 : Conqueror of the Ocean
I personally enjoy this game MUCH more than the first in the series because it simplifies it mcuh more. Where in the last one i would have to look up lot's of tutorials on how to even start off, this tells you pretty much everything you need to know at first. The ships are also much easier to see what exatcly you're putting onto it like guns and specific ammo. One gripe I have is that the Guns don't have an all" fire group maiking it hard to do full on broadsides in Battleships."

This game is really good, do not look at the negative reviews and think its a bad game, instead try it first and you'll be surprised!!!

A.K.A a poorly made Meat Boy. Controls are clunky, the so called Bob slips off playfroms while standing, bad angle, momentum and gameplay made this game look soo bad.

Brilliant Bob  A Steam Review
[Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes]

The good

Cartoony graphics
Short levels
The not so good:
The jumps are mostly guesses, since you dont have a shadow under you to see where youll land
There is way too much momentum for the player and the moving platforms, youll never know when youll fall from them because they changed directions or smth. This is even a problem when youre trying to select a level, most of the time youll overshoot your target.
It feels like the menus were made 20 minutes before the game was released. In the first cinematic you can see the tops of the trees from the menu.
The conclusion:
This is an example of a game that wouldve had a lot to gain from doing a beta or early access release. All the problems wouldve been observed and maybe fixed before the release. As it is now, its pretty unplayable. On top of that, the high price should make everyone steer away from this.

Brilliant Bob, isn't as brilliant as it could have been. The camera is static, while the side scrolling is in 3D, making some of the movements awkward, especially when trying to jump on ledges or boxes. The puzzles are pretty simple, not a lot of depth to the game. There doesn't seem to be a story of any kind, no reason you are put through puzzle after puzzle. I wish I could find something positive to say about the game, but it felt like a big let down when I played it.

Idiotic Bob Review

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is cancer, it's barely playable... here are the pros and cons

Pros:
the music is nice
(that's it)

Cons:
Slippery controls
Horrible cutscenes (the 1st cutscene you see looks like CGI meatboy ripoffs on an MS paint built background)
No loading screen yet it stops responding when it loads... so you just see a freeze frame of what last happened
Broken level select (you have to walk into a portal thing of the level you want to go to... and I could only get to level 2 when I wanted to go to level 3)
Bad double jump physics (if you walk off an edge you get 1 jump to save yourself and that isn't enough)
the game lags when around enemies (and my computer is great and runs on the brilliant" graphics just fine)
Bob looks like a super meatboy ripoff character...
"powered with Unity" 'nuff said there
and many more cons

This game gets a 0.0000000000010/10 (aka don't get it)

I wanted to find it fun because it's simple and easy, but I can't because of it's graphic, poor Camera Angle and the controller won't function well, also game crashes ~.~

Brilliant Bob
This game feels like someone's  university project. There's little to no reward for completing any part of the game (unlockable skins don't really do it for me), annoying, repetitive music, an uninteresting and very unoriginal story which includes dull characters and rounds off with generic and poorly executed gameplay mechanics. This game unfortunately, did not reach its potential to be a fun and quirky little platformer. However, the developers only have themselves to blame as basic game testing from an external source could have easily pointed out some of the game's biggest flaws (e.g. camera obscuring your view, poor shadows to make jumping inconsistent and difficult to assess, momentum effecting Bob's placement etc.).

Conclusion: Tries to be Super Meat Boy 3D ends up as Pointless Purple Block of Turd 3D. Do not purchase.

Brilliant Bob
This is one of the most ridiculous game on Steam and should be removed from this platform ASAP. Incredibly bugged, glitchy and user-NOT-friendly jumping simulator. Your biggest enemy is... camera! YES! Movement around puzzles is one of the hardest things that I've seen in last few months in games industry. I thought that I will break down something every time when I rotate the camera. I don't know why games like this costs 10... I simply can't understand the level of stupidness, it's worth maybe 1-2. Guys, please. You gave me a key for this game... but it's just so stupid and overpriced that I've decided to ATTACK you for making this game! SRSLY!

Your feet are slippery, easy to slide off the platforms. Cameras are bad. Adjustable but still not quite what's needed sometimes.

The graphics style in this game gives you a nostalgic Wii-like feeling, the music is nice and calming for
all the times you will inevitably die. The story, however, is complete crap, basically you're a cube who is happy and an
alien tries to take away you and your family's happiness, but instead you just wreck his ship and your parents get stolen,
leading into the concept that you have to save your parents. Apparently that calls for jumping on a lot of vanishing platforms that the dev simply couldn't get enough of, but whatever. Overall, I recommend this game when its on sale, but don't waste $10 on it.

Brilliant Bob
Product received for free

i wouldn't recommend this game.

i can give you many reasons for it but the most important one is how you control the camera. you can only control it with Q/E to make it pan to the left/right. this gets annoying very quickly because it takes away the speed you want when playing a game like this. if you were able to control the camera with you mouse it would already be a lot better.

Not enough vanishing platforms -3/10

I never had so mcuh fun trowing boxes for 7 min.

Much of the game is heavily based on jump timing, and it's responsiveness is a bit random.
The camera movement is also quite awkward...
All in all, it's close to being decent, but far from great.

I'm certainly glad I got it on sale for just a few cents.

I don't want to write an entire review, so I will just paste a chat I had with my friend while playing the game, which basically covers what you can expect in the very first few minutes of the game.

I can't figure out why this game has so many bad reviews. Granted, I haven't put that much time into this yet, but with over 1300 games in steam it will take a while before most of my games have respectable playtime. The controls feel pretty good to me, and the environments are nice to look at. This game has a simplistic feel to it that reminds me of some of the n64 games of my childhood.  I only have 2 issues with this game, but with the $1 I spent on it I can't complain.  The first issue is the music, which is repetitive and restarts with each level. The second issue is the story. I figure this game would be better without a story than the one showcased when you launch the game. Some might call this a quick cash grab with unity assets, but the gameplay is fun for a few bucks. Its one of those games that I goof around with on one monitor while watching TV on the other. -PR0XIDIAN

It is a good thing that I got this on sale for $0.29. Otherwise, I would've gone into a deep depression knowing that I had spent $10 on this.

Brilliant Bob/Not so Brilliant Bob - we won't grapple over the title.

What we will grapple with, however;

- Level Depth

There does not appear to be any actual story once you begin the game, nor purpose to any of the levels.

- Camera Controls

Ever played the original PS1 games  where you pan the camera with the joystick? and it waves around like a hula girls hips? Yep.

The camera controls are terrible, to be found here, and due to being presented in 3D, the frustration levels may cause you to bust many holes in your wall.


+ Soundtrack

The soundtrack is the only positive point that I would allow, the only reason I almost spent a full hour playing.


Overall, I do not recommended Brilliant Bob to anyone. It takes a lot for me to say it, but this game is awful.

The unplayability overall makes it virtually impossible to progress. It feels incomplete and could definitely use a few tweaks here and there.

Brilliant Bob
Well, I guess they found a cure to cancer.
It's called the refund button"."

Brilliant Bob
feeling suicidal? play this game to finish yourself off

Brilliant Bob
This Game has the same Assets as Woodle Tree Adventures so typically Free Unity but other than Woodle Tree this Game is no Fun, because all what you do is jumping from little Plattforms to little Plattforms, that move or vanish. You never explore the other bigger Landscapes, they are only for Decoration. And listening to the same boring Music is also not fun too.

Then also Game Mechanic suxx, the Double Jump sometimes work sometimes not and the vanishing Plattforms are not visibly different then normal Plattforms, so no way to anticipate. Also it's even worse, they vanish even if you touch them from below or from the side and not if you actually land on them, which is simply buggy.

And if you are standing on those moving Plattform they slip away under your  and Air Control also lacks Control. And the Camera is awful, should be mapped to right Stick but is mapped in LB/RB and not a real Camera, it's more a turn left, turn right, no free Cam so not really useful for 3D.

This Game could have been fun, but seems execution was messed up and it also looks unfinished, perhaps a glimpse at Woodle Tree Adventures would help, it's not an ultra great Game either, but use the same Assets and at least offers some fun.

This Game is only frustrating and boring, so i'm sorry but i'm forced to move it to the Scrapyard.

Brilliant Bob
Brilliant Bob? More like Cancer Carl.

Brilliant Bob
There is nothing brilliant about this.

Stay away at all costs. A complete waste of your time.


Brilliant Bob
This game is awesome. The character is called Bob. It's a purple cube. It has sunglasses. It's parents were taken by an evil alien with a gun. You need to save your parents. I guess so. I bought this game for cards, played it for a while, then I said  this "

Brilliant Bob
it's terrible. Not even a so-bad-its-good bad game. It controls like slippery poopies and it's just so cheaply made.

it's not worth 50 cents, I know it seems like a good joke game, but it just isn't. You'll play for about 10+ minutes and laugh maybe once how dumb/bad it is then just be like wow nothing changes ever and there's nothing new to make fun of even.

SORRY THANKS BYE

Brilliant Bob
This is a 3D platformer in which you can't move the camera with your mouse. You have to use the Q and E keys instead of them, so you can only turn your camera at one specific speed which is too slow for this game, not only this but you can't look up or down so it's difficult to tell the distance of the platforms, when you turn your camera it is not centred on the character but offset so if you turn your camera whilst jumping it will ruin your jump.

The main challenge in this game is being able to jump off the timed platforms whilst your camera is facing the wrong direction because you are not given enough time to adjust it with the Q and E keys. There are also more things I don't like.

1.Disappearing Platforms start to dissapear before you have even landed on them, you only have to be near them. - If you clip the edge or the bottom of a platform it will begin to vanish.
2. When moving platforms change direction they knock you about and can even knock you off the platform without you pressing anything, this feels pretty clunky in my opinion.
4. The game sometimes doesn't let you double jump making you die. More Frequent on the Spinning platforms and disappearing Platforms
5. There are far too many disappearing Platforms

I don't understand why the game doesn't allow you to turn the camera with a mouse, or automatically adjust it for you.

Brilliant Bob
Brilliant Bob you say? Not so brilliant at all actually. So story is, some mad scientist from the other end of the galaxy stealing happiness, he also stole your parents and you go after them... By jumping on odd platforms. Story aside, the gameplay is just brilliant! Just kidding, it's very bad. You have to jump from platform to platform. The thing is that you don't know where you'll land due to the very crappy camera angle which you can change with Q and E only. Oh and the turning is so slow that one some levels it's impossible to get all of those cubes. So no point of even playing it, just frustration.

Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

Just get postal 2

Postal III
Postal and Postal 2 taught me to regret nothing, and I took that to heart.

Then I tried playing Postal 3, and now I know nothing but regret.

Postal III
It's a great torture device! The american agent told me everything after I forced him to play this.

Postal III
Get Postal 2 instead.

Postal III
This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.

1. A broken melee system: Postal, true to the franchise, offers many different tools of the trade to dispose of your enemies. And some of the tools include a sledgehammer, machete, fire axe, and something else I can't remember. But none of that matters because the only one that works is the ing machete. It is extremely difficult to land your blow on enemies with other weapons, including your kick, but it doesn't matter because the fire axe and sledgehammer don't even do any damage.

2. Abysmal Gunplay: Would you be surprised if I told you this is the strongest gameplay element? Cuz it is. Is it because it's fun? No. Is it because there's cool weapons? No. It's because guns are pretty much the only gameplay element that functions. A headshot kills any enemy instantly. So, if you don't want to deal with the awfulness of every other tool of the trade, guns are the way to go. And don't bother with the shotgun or the MG. They're both garbage.

3. Awful Humor: Postal 2 got it's humor from satirizing both social issues and video game tropes and controversies. Postal 3 doesn't do this at all. Instead, it goes for stupid humor and shock value. Like terrorists dressing up in giant novelty moustaches and sombreros and sneaking across the US Border. Or firing man juice soaked tissue clumps at Sarah Palin in a porn shop full of men jerking it to monitors. And I'll admit, I laughed a few times, but it wasn't because I thought it was clever. Quite the opposite, in fact. I laughed because it was so utterly stupid and random that it just brought out the inner caveman. And that's the problem; Postal 3 is offensive for all the wrong reasons. There are a few times when the developers want to get tongue and cheeky with you. But it's hard to find it funny when the game keeps kicking your  every chance it gets. Sorry Postal 3, but you can't kick me in the nads and then give me a piece of cake. It doesn't work that way.

4. What-The- Scale Performance: Do you have a decent gaming rig? Do you have an ultra powerful rig? Well neither matter because Postal 3 is terribly built and optimized. I can run mostly anything on max settings, and yet this game chugs when things get going. And even setting it to low didn't change the performance one bit. It's amazing how you can mess up so bad on an engine designed specifically for non-high end machines.

5. It's Linear & Catharsis Sucks: The entire game has you follow a very narrow path of the dude going about his day just trying to earn some money. And, as you continue, you get to make moral choices that alter which missions you do. This would be fine, if it wasn't Postal. Or, you know, at least done properly. I wanna be free to explore the city and do what I want and attack the story at my own pace. When you beat the game, you unlock the entire city to go around and play in. But when you start it you see just how bad the direction really is. They basically took what they made of the city, and then stitched together the other set pieces from missions into the mix. There's no sense of where you're going at all. It's apparent they did not design a city and split it accordingly. They just made random crap, stitched it together with duct tape, and said, Here this is Catharsis." You know it's bad when you walk up to a highway offramp and end up at the gay rodeo. Oh

Postal III
Postal III is a perfect example of what happenes when you let drug-addled russian mod designers handle your beloved franchise. Avoid like the plague.

I got this game for free from RWS, but i think they only did that because they wanted to violate me somehow.

How to play Postal 3

step 1. Never buy it
step 2. Never play it
step 3. Never ING play it EVER

My god. MY ING GOODNESS GRACIOUS, what a waste of money, even on sale. not even worth $1.99. This game is absolutely horrendous! The sounds are rancid, the controls are broken, the glitches are nasty, the camera has tourette's, the story is ing stupid, the new postal dude style is so ing ginger, the new voice is something to frown upon, the music is garbage and random, the cast is meh, the menus are bland as , the weapon choice is so , the frame rate is worse than the Xbox one; need i say more? Not only is this a failure of a Postal game, but this is one of the worst games i have honestly ever played in my entire life. I never in my entire life uninstalled a game 1 hour in. There is not single positive thing about this game at all. It does not deserve the title of Postal and now i can see why Urinating on the Postal 3 case in Postal 2 gets you an achievement. Even Running With Scissors acknowledges that it's a   game, and that's why they continue to update Postal 2 and pretend Postal 3 is just some spin off.

Do not buy this piece of  unless you either
A. Want to play a game that is the equivalent to Foodfight! on Heroin.
B. Want to play a game to torture yourself from start to finish.
C. Want to buy it for someone else to make them contemplate suicide.
(that's actually how i got this game)

So please, don't ing waste your time with this piece of  ed from another piece of .

Postal III
I spent actual money on this, because I am not a very bright man.






It's actually really quite awful, and that's saying something. Forced third person, glitchier than hell, none of the  charm of Postal 2.

Postal III
Okay, after finally playing the first and second Postal games, I finally decided to give the third installment another shot. Even after learning the backstory of the game (RWS Inc. hired an underfunded and tyrannical game developer company from Russia to code the game), I decided to give it a second chance. Sure, I wouldn't get all the extra little achievements like I did with the first two Postals, but I'd at least beat the game and give it a fair judgment from that, right?

Wrong. I had completely forgotten what it was that had kept me from playing this game in the first place. It wasn't the linear levels (Postal 1 had linear levels). It wasn't the stupid jokes or the weird weapons and minigames (Postal 2 had stupid jokes and weird weapons and minigames). It was the gameplay. Yes, Akeela Software (or whatever they call themselves) had suffered through a Russian economic crash and in suffering fired their competent, cooperative developers and assigned this project to a group of Prima Donnas who not only couldn't correctly string a game together even if it was coming out of their own , but also deliberately altered the structure of the game against the wishes of RWS Inc. (you know, the people who wrote the game series and own the rights to them and CONTRACTED Akeela TO DO MAKE THE GAME THAT RWS had envisioned!!!). Not only that, but Akeela also refused to release the code to the general public because they didn't want those loyal gamers to make MODs or anything, even though RWS Inc. wanted them to. As a result, the gameplay is sticky, jagged, the graphics go photo-negative after 15 minutes of gameplay and glitches flood this game. For example, I had to restart a level because the game wouldn't let me open a door that was integral to the plot, and the escort mission with the segways was almost impossible. All in all, it kept me from enjoying this game not once but twice, which is a shame, because otherwise, I thought it could have been an enjoyable game.

*SPOILER ALERT* For those still interested in knowing, the game pickups where the second one left off: after detonating Paradise, Arizona with a nuke, the Postal dude drove to the next closest fictional town in Arizona, Catharsis. There, a wealthy Ron Jeremy owns and runs everything with a pretty open mind. The problem is that he's constantly being undermined or even flat out attacked by Eco-terrorists, Al Queda, God-fearing hockey moms (led by Sarah Palin...wait...why is she in Arizona?!) and other satirical and colorful characters. The Postal Dude, just trying to make a buck, is given constant choices as to whose side he is on, or at least which side he wants to flip flop to and from. While the levels are linear, your actions do choose the course of the game.   Unlike the last game, the third Postal gives you a Max Payne type of third person layout and aiming system, and you get most of the weapons from the previous game, plus a few new ones like beehives, a shopvac (filled with questionably stained tissues) and the badgersaw.

Like I said, it could have an enjoyable installment to the series, but the Russian contractors completely ruined it to the point that RWS Inc. even tells people to stay away from it.

Postal III
This is the Adam Sandler of Postal titles.
You know how Adam Sandler has talent and doesn't use it?
This game kind of works like that.

It had potential to be great, but it didn't bother.
Blame the guys in Russia who had done most of the work and decided that it was okay to publish the Bubsy 3D of 2011.

Postal III
There are no words to describe how awful this one is. So I just want you to imagine a depressed 47 year old man with a massive drinking problem hanging himself by the sunroof inside of his trailer, only to have it break causing him to fall and then start crying until he dehydrates his whole body to death over a course of three days.

Postal III
Installed it  to uninstall it.

Basically just avoid this page entirely and go buy Postal 2 instead. It's for your own good.

Postal III
I got this game for free, and I still suffer buyer's remorse.

Postal III
Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.

The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.

This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.

While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.

To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.

Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.

Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.

Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't  as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.

Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?" Well

Postal III
This game is so bad the devs needed to make DLC for the old game to make up for this catastrophe.

Postal III
I wouldn't even poke this game with a stick.

Postal III
Its not fair to say that the darkness consumed me, for it was I who enveloped myself in it, there was no coercion involved, only my own maddened curiosity. Another Postal game was released? Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose?
Sometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked Add to Cart. Its more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.

I wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as acrid, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome Nobody Will Ever Love You. I cant though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didnt even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know thats exactly what its meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.

In the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.

Postal III
Terribad.

Nothing like Postal 2, the controls are clunky as , and there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS. Seriously, there is one stage where its just you in a room waiting to push a button, be prepared for many many one off scenes like this. There is no real explorable world to mess with, its just isolated scenes you do a single mission per scene.

The combat, holy ing christ the combat, how do you mess something like that up ? Theres a scene where you fight these crazy soccer moms, but making them leave" is almost impossible as they seem to take 10 fully charged stun gun shots and NOTHING HAPPENS. The vagueness in the combat system and missions are laughable at best and after so long get annoying as hell. This is also the first game I have encountered where the crosshairs are completely useless

Postal III
This game is about as good as you could expect for a game that was coded in a weekend

Postal III
Sack of . It's one of those games where you constantly have to babysit NPC's who are so  they can't even follow you to the objective (meaning you can't win.)

Waste of money, and I paid $5 for it.

Postal III
Postal 3, a third sequel to the cult classic, POSTAL franchise. This game, developed by Akella, NOT Running With Scissors - sees the Postal Dude rigth after a Nuclear Bomb goes off in the previous city, crosses a zombie infested bridge and is now forced to find a job in a new city, Catharsis, where a matter of chaotic events occur.

The game features a branching Storyline System ala Mass Effect's Paragon system, but more black and white with it's execution, it does make the game differ greatly with it's content and is a highly welcome addition imo - the rest of the game however... is terrible. It is a third person shooter that barely plays at all, it was built on Valve's Source Engine way back in the day, this game pretty much controls terribly and loosely,  has music falling out of loops, AI bugging out occasionally and much more that just scream unfinished.

I should mention I do enjoy this game for what it is (a fan of the POSTAL franchise and the kind of macabre humor it uses) but from extremely buggy set pieces (Doors closing on you halting chapter progress.), horrible performance issues (Game is NOT enabled to properly run on Multi Core PCs and PhysX feature do a LOT more harm than good), spotty AI and just overall terrible loose mechanics, the game is most definately a skip to those whom are not willing to put up with the game;s shortcoming - those being dang near everything else - considering the game is buggy to the point of it being borderline unplayable.

Postal III
Postal 2 was great, but Postal III is just awful.

Postal III
I like this game but nobody else does so its possible i'm just completly mad.

Postal III
If it weren't for the fact that this game is an unstable piece of  that crashes if you so much as look at it funny, I might have recommended it anyways in spite of its design problems. The game itself is just the right kind of awful to mock and poke fun at, it's just a shame that getting it to work requires no less than sorcery and blood sacrifices.

Not even for free would I recommend this.

Postal III
Broken, broken, broken. I'll admit that I had fun for a little while, I laughed a couple times, but in the end, the bugs get in the way of this one. Load times are irritatingly long, animations are broken, and it's just not something you'd expect after the better half of a decade of waiting.

If you catch it under $4.99, go for it; it's worth five dollars of fun. Otherwise, keep looking.

Postal III
I bought this for $59.99

Postal III
Rather than repeating every other review on here (either saying it's a laggy, buggy pile of , or sticking up for it without any support), I'm just gonna point put the pros and cons of POSTAL III. I personally enjoy this game, but I can see why others don't. Many people ask if it's really *that* bad, and if they should pass on it or not... I think you should TRY it, especially if you're a fan of the previous games. But don't fart around, try rushing through as much as you can - that way you can still qualify for a refund, which you may want.

Pros:
+A good amount of weapons. Not as many as Postal 2, but more than most games.
+Though generally very cheesy, it has plenty of comedic moments.
+Goofy brand name refrences. A video game store with a game called Left 4 Bread, a coffee shop called Lotsofbucks or some , etc.
+Sticks to the usual Postal story. The Dude is broke, has troubles holding a job, and doesn't get his hard earned cash.
+Ability to choose whether you're good or bad (or neutral). This changes both gameplay and story, and gives you different missions.
+Pee simulator - part two?
+Neat soundtrack. And it suites the game.
+Boss fights are pretty solid, and can provide a challenge.
+Tons of ing blood and gibs, as well as vulgarity and some dark humor.
+Tons of replayabiliy, as usual.
+Fun gameplay, though for some people it may get boring.

Neutral points (some might see as pros, while others see as cons):
N) Not in first-person as POSTAL 2 was
But then again, let's not forget POSTAL 1 was a top-down shooter.
N) Bizarre weapons, such as AIDS infested cats, a badger that acts as a chainsaw, and a vacuum that sucks up small items and shoots them out (non-leathal, and barely ethical to use).
N) You have to unlock Free-roam by completing the game.


Cons:
-Not made by RWS. Hell, they don't even make money from this game!
-Bugs. Big bugs! We're talking tarantulas and genetically-altered cockroaches! You and other people will get stuck in certain spots, game crashes (I've rarely had this, though other people seem to have major issues with that), freezes from time to time, and many more. Some are smaller, and some... not so small.
-Lag can be a  at times, and the frame-rate can drop to -10 FPS.
-Repetitive story. You start your job, you and/or your employer get attacked, you defend the area, the boss doesn't like that, you don't get paid, and on to the next one.
-No trading cards.
-Since it's developed by a Russian company, the English isn't very good. Poor grammar and what not.
-No Rick Hunter, but the new Dude repeats gameplay phrases used in P2.
-Physics are all over the place. Sometimes when you shot someone in the head with a pistol, their head will pop off. Other times you'll use a ing machine gun, and they'll just drop dead with no gibs. If you tase somebody then pour gasoline on them, they occasionally set on fire. See what I mean? The physics aren't consistent.
-Achievements are glitched. Which ones, you ask? Depends on how unlucky you are. I've heard some people have issues with certain achievements I don't have issues with, and vice versa. Sometimes an achievement is apparently locked, sometimes doing the necessary tasks won't add up. I've spent half hour lighting people on fire, killing dozens of people, but my achievement progress was only 4/50. No, I don't mean 4 out of the 50 remaining.

Postal III
What a piece of . I bought this game out of morbid curiousity, and now I regret it. Postal 3, or the Russian Postal, was a game developed by a Russian publisher called Akella, after they told Running With Scissors that they would fund and develop a third Postal game. Development was going good for the most part, until Russia was hit with a recession, forcing Akella to fire the A-Team, and get some less-experienced programmers who would work for cheaper. Akella had to change a lot from RWS's original plans to compensate for the new programmers lack of skill (like removing mulitplayer, switching the game to third-person, and switching from Unreal to Source (mainly due to budget, however)). What came from this development mess was a buggy-as-hell game that tried to be POSTAL 2, but failed miserably. Even if the incredible amount of bugs were patched, the game still falls flat due to boring level design. Almost every level is nothing but a kill-a-thon. Just kill X amount of enemies, and that's it. There's the occasional unique mission, like the Theigway level or the patrol missions, but there's just not enough variety. They also tried to implement a cover system, which fails dramatically when the enemies you're trying to take cover from just walk up behind you. One of the biggest issues of the game is that it's just not optimised. The game runs on the Source engine, but if I set all the video settings to max, the frame rate will go straight to . Compare with Portal 2, released the same year, on the same engine. If I set everything to max, it'll run great. How did they manage to screw up something like that on the Source engine, easily the most optimised engine out there? The only really good things I can say about the game is that the graphics are pretty good (at least compared to POSTAL 2), and the soundtrack is absolutely eargasmic, but that's really it.

Also, if you're running Windows 8.1, don't even bother buying this game. The DRM won't let you play for some reason. RWS doesn't have the source code for the game, so they can't patch it out. There might be an unofficial patch, but you should probably look into that BEFORE buying this game.

Postal III
It has SO much missing potential, but unfortunately, it's a bit of a letdown.
Doesn't stop me from modding it, though. It's pretty flexible in that department.

Postal III
As a part of the Postal series this is a failure.

Apart from that, this is a reasonable game.
Yes, it's short, poorly optimised and bugged. But it's still fun.
Got this one on a sale.

I regret nothing.


Postal III
If you liked Postal 2 don't buy this game, it's terrible and nothing like Postal 2.

Postal III
the postal game that RWS technicaly dousen't own

I'm a RWS fan, and I respect Vince Desi, so it pains me to say - don't buy this game. if you have to find out what its like, find someone who has it and play their copy for 15 minuets. find a lets-play, do something, just don't buy this game. this is a train wreck and everyone knows it.

Unless something changed in the past two years RWS is not even making money off this because of the shady coding house they did business with to produce this. that company gutted the script, gutted the features and hurried the alpha out the door as a final game and screwed Running With Sissors out of the rights to the code.

this is an official game but one that RWS can't support and likely a game that they are not making a dime off of. wait for the next chapter of the game because I'm sure the postal dude will dismiss this one as the nightmare it is. Like mario's dream that was Super Mario Bros 2, Postal III might as well not exist in the catalog of this franchise.

I do no exagerate in saying that this game is completely broken, unbalenced and not fun. a total waste of $20

buyer be ware- This is a steaming pile!

Postal III
This game is not good

Postal III
Horrible, horrible game. I like Postal 1 and really enjoy Postal 2. The open endedness is what I especially enjoy and it's totally missing in Postal 3. I played for a short while, to the part where I'm supposed to pick up used" tissues. It was at this point I realized the entire game was going to be like this; they stick you in an area with a specific goal and can't do anything else. It's more like a bunch of mini-games. Totally dissappointed and regret spending money for this game."

Postal III
Just when I tought nothing could possibly be worse than the movie (Uwe Boll? Seriously? As if he didnt slaughter enough franchises already...), along came part three.

Plain and simple: This is a very, very, very bad game. Oh boy, is it bad...

If you wonder how bad, just bear in mind that even the original devs (P3 was made by... I dont know, some studio I never heard of) mocked and retconned it in the latest Postal 2 addon. Thats how bad it is.

Go play Postal 2 instead.

Postal III
Play Postal 2 instead of this garbage

Postal III
Poorly optimised, and doesn't live up to the glory of Postal 2.

Postal III
After so many years, Postal 3 is released... BUT... by the aptly named Trashmasters. The game, while it has an awesome themesong you can hear in the trailer, has agonizing load times, insufferable missions, awkward controls, and forcing you to sit through all this for the sandbox option, make this worse than a disappointment.

Running With Scissors has completely disowned with installment" and with good reason. Stay far away from this. This is not a "game

Postal III
I'm a huge fan of the Postal series. I have been for a long time. The last game I came across in the series was Postal 3... not even developed by RWS. Confused, but enticed by the Postal" title

Postal III
Get Postal 2, stay away from this game. The devs act like this game didnt exist, thats why they made paridise lost to make up for this  game.

Postal III
I love the postal series don't get me wrong but I just think they did a horrible job on this one it just felt slow and the game got you scratching your head. I recommend you buy postal 1 and 2 not this one sorry.

Postal III
No... just no.
Poor performance, third person postal, no cool weapons and missions

Postal III
0/10

One of the clunkiest, ugliest, and most senseless sacks of garbage that I have ever come across. I am absolutely ashamed and embarrassed to own this piece of ! I would pay money for Steam to remove this off my history forever so that I never have to be reminded of its existence.  you Postal III!

Postal III
I got this game for free, but I cant shake the feeling that I got ripped off somehow...

Postal III
why god why did this happen oh god no

Postal III
I'm gonna get a lot of hate mail for saying this, but, I really enjoyed Postal III. It still had the RWS spirit even if it was mostly touched by another developer. There were the big flaws such as being buggy, wasn't as Open World, and yes, I wish there was some way Rick Hunter could've voiced Postal Dude (he did in the beta Postal III interestingly enough). However, the game did offer some interesting gameplay mechanics, its crude humor did get a chuckle or two out of me, and it did (for me) feel like a Postal game. In the end, its definitely not as great as Postal II, but still a decent game that I would play again. Too bad we'll (probably) never see any Mac/Linux ports...

Postal III
13 hours pain 13 hours screaming and beating my keyboard 13 hours of nightmare
+ I think i got ebola and cancer from this.

JumpJet Rex is a very challenging  2D platformer that stays true to video game classics with its music, gameplay, and visuals. You are the Earth's first Dinonaut and you recieve an urgent call telling you that a meteor is heading to Earth. You must go back home to save your planet.

Gameplay
Through my playthrough I have used a controller. The levels are well designed. However, I have run into a few bugs that ruined my experience. The bug I found was on the first boss fight where I would glitch into the boss and be stuck, or glitch under the map and be stuck.
The levels are challenging and fun and the music is amazing. After I beat the first boss, I saw a difficulty curve appear as levels get much harder to beat.
Through the game you can collect $$$ to buy customization items for your dinosaur. You will be able to play the game for hours upon hours. This game is one that will cause rage in certain levels. Throughout the game there are collectibles hidden throughout the map which you can find and they will be added to your room.

Consider buying this/ not buying this if
Consider buying this if:
- you like the classic feel with videogames
- you like 2D platformers
- you like a challenge

Consider not buying this if:
- you do not like rage games
- you hate dying (most likely you will die a lot)
- you hate pixelated games or 2D platformers

Rating
Pros
+ many hours of gameplay
+ customization
+ music is very well done
+ gives an authentic classic feel
+ difficult and a challenge
+ many collectibles
+ dino basketball

Cons
- may glitch
- may have random lag spikes ( it did for me at random moments within this game)
- huge difficulty curve
- may become slightly repetitive
- only local co-op

Final Thoughts
JumpJet Rex is an amazing game with a magnificent soundtrack and a perfect old-school feel. The huge difficulty curve is annoying and you sometimes will run into bumps. However, overall as a game I am impressed with JumpJet Rex and am happy to have played it.

Early Access Review

This game is RAD.
I'm not the kind of person that likes to play platformers - I usually get bored and frustrated by them really quickly.  This, however, is GREAT.  It's like Super Meat Boy met Flappy Bird and gave birth to a dinosaur with jetpacks on his feet.  Eww

JumpJet Rex
Introduction            	JumpJet Rex is a fast-paced and retro styled platformer. You can play the game just for the story, or you can be the perfectionist by beating the time and not dying at all. The story is not to be taken serious, but it is very funny and cute. The gameplay is tons of fun and it can be very challenging when you are trying to get all the stars throughout the game. I had a blast playing JumpJet Rex; from the audio/visuals to the gameplay, JumpJet Rex is a nearly perfect game. Im sure if you have the chance to play JumpJet Rex, you will have a blast throughout the whole experience.
Pros
Amazing gameplay
High replay value
Really cool hub-world
Perfect audio
Cool retro style
Funny and cute story
Great mechanics
Controller support
Gfx options and rebinding support
Cons
Fairly short story.
Nothing else wrong it (I couldnt think of anything of else wrong)
Conclusion
JumpJet Rex is a nearly perfect retro platformer. It has basically everything you would want in a Retro Platformer for PC (Amazing gameplay, High replay value, really cool hub-world, Funny and cute story, Great mechanics, Controller support, and Gfx options and rebinding support). It was very hard to find anything wrong with JumpJet Rex and it really deserves more attention. I would highly suggest you to pick up JumpJet Rex as soon as you can.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

A really fun platformer.  The unlimited air jumps and dashes feel really great to control.  If you're only trying to beat the game, you can do so very quickly since the levels are short with multiple checkpoints.  But if you want to collect all the coins, all the hidden items, make the best time on any given stage?  You'll be replaying and practicing quite a bit.

Speed run versus against friends seems like it'll be a lot of fun too once more people start playing.

JumpJet Rex
I think this game is a piece of art.

very simplistic controls but still very fun to use.
every level is perfect to speedrun and fun to do so if you are in speedrunning.
even a casual playhrough its a blast.

I do reccomend this game if you are in to platforming/speedrunning.

Still needs some smoothing out but this early release game is looking real nice,

Fast-paced, simple, and addictive. IL friendly with tight controls and suitable for both casual gamers and speedrunners. Looking forward to the final product

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

Ever since I was a kid, I loved trying to clear levels as fast as possible. This is what drew me to racing games, I would try and beat my friend's highscores by trying to perfect every corner.
That's what JumpJet Rex feels like to me. It can be enjoyed as a regular oldschool platform game, or you can really sink your teeth into it and try and beat your own or your friend's scores.
Great games need to have both depth and solid gameplay. JJR aces both.
I'll be playing this one for a long time!!

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

As an avid platforming fan, I am often very cynical/analytical when it comes to playing new ones. I'm stuck in the past, rarely do I find a platformer that I feel can stand up to the SNES era.

JumpJet Rex though, took me totally by surprise. I didn't expect to fall so hard and fast for this game.

I always look for specific things in a platformer, a formula for perfection if you might:

Difficulty - Is the game challenging? Will it make me shout profanities but still make me eager to go back for more? Check. JumpJet Rex is no easy ride, though the difficulty curve put in place is sublime. Not too fast, not too slow, excellent pacing.

Controls - I can get really wound up about clunky controls in platformers. There is a certain feel" that needs to be reached. I have no qualms about the controls for JJR

JumpJet Rex
Just picked this up, insta-buy for me. Graphics are spot on, music and sound effects are awesome, game play is fast based, casual. But it's the type of casual that you can invest hours into and really lose the hours.

Awesome! Keep up the solid work, Indie dev power!

JumpJet Rex
Very high quality platformer, you can tell they poured their hearts into this title.

Every little mechanic and animation is very well done, other platformer developers can learn a lot from this game.

The steam release is excellent as there are a lot of additions which you do not see every day, like choosing a member on your friends and try to compete against them for a high score and even see their ghost in-game to race against.  It takes the normal super high quality platformer and adds in tons of replay value.

JumpJet Rex
Since this game has many reviews relating to how it is as a casual game, I would like to look at it from a speedrunner's perspective, since much of this game seems to revolve around that part. I've spent almost all of my time on this game speedrunning it rather than trying to go through and 100% the game, so I feel like this would help people looking for something fast to play.

To begin, this is basically platformer, except you get to fly around so there's no actual platforming involved. Much of the challenge comes from a few enemies and obstacles scattered around. The amount may vary from no enemies and only a couple thorny bushes to 50 lasers shooting at you at once. Each map is a course where you must go through rings to complete the level.

This game offers fairly simple movement in the form of flight that is nice for casual runs, but it can be very fun to utilize to its full potential in speedrunning. This is obviously subjective, but the movement is extremely fluid, making it so the only reason why a person would fail would be due to their own ability.

Once you move into the actual level design, that's when things get a bit murky. I don't want to talk badly about the levels since anything can be speedran if you put effort into it, but some are extremely difficult and require a great deal of time and patience to do at the speed of top runners. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something to think about if you're just looking for a fun and easy game to run. This game focuses quite a bit on ILs, so getting top times on each level could take quite awhile. I would say there is massive variety in the levels so I would also let that be known.

This game offers a ton of things to collect in each level if anyone ever wanted to attempt to speedrun 100%, so that's a plus for dedicated people looking for some replay value. I wouldn't say it's to the point of obnoxiousness, but some of the levels are fairly difficult to 100% complete, which is where the speedrunning part becomes a lot more challenging to master.

Overall, I think this is an excellent game with an active community and plenty of room to improve on. It has simple mechanics that take time to master and a hefty amount of content to explore, which is great for people looking for a lot of replay value.

JumpJet Rex
I enjoyed this game thoroughly.
It is cute and simple 2d platformer.
The graphics are nice
The music is good.
The level design is interesting.

I would advise this to anyone who is looking for a short platformer that is relaxing.
(Except for the very last level)

JumpJet Rex
A ton of fun! Very fast paced with great obstacles and almost perfect controls.

Pros- T-rex with jet boots.

Cons- There isn't more of these kinds of games.

JumpJet Rex
To claim this game is shovelware is to lack understanding of what that term even means.  It might not be the style of game you personally enjoy but it's extremely obvious that it has had a ton of care put into development.  Very refreshing well executed nostalgia trip.

Soooooo if your looking at this game wondering huh this looks kinda cool. Well thats because its made by the cooliest people ive had the pleasure of knowing and just imagine a world wear u can customize a dinosaur.

Early Access Review

Lots of references to the old platforming games of the SNES. The music and graphics are amazing and fit the gameplay very well.

Very easy to pick up, but very difficult to master.

It's a great game to pick up and play and put some time in.

JumpJet Rex
An excellent platformer that gives you more degrees of freedom in regards to movement than you'd expect from a game of this type. It had a focus on speaking, but it's by no means necessary to progress, but it is quite precision based as one hit will send you back to the last checkpoint.
Great pixel art, a fun physics system and a snappy soundtrack otherwise punctuate a great little 2D platformer that stands out from the crowd

JumpJet Rex
love the game, sunk so much time into it the moment I got it, and I plan on speedrunning it more when I have the time.

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is a 2D retro platformer with NES-style pixel art graphics. You control Rex, a tyrannosaur astronaut whose job it is to save Earth from an incoming asteroid. The gameplay consists of navigating your way through a number of 2D levels  40 to be exact  plus four boss stages.

The core gameplay is fairly simple  the central premise is that you have a pair of rocket boots, meaning you can jump an infinite amount of times in the air, boost yourself straight up at a high rate, boost yourself sideways at a high rate (which launches a mid-range projectile in the opposite direction), or do a butt stomp to deal damage to something below you. You also have a bicycle kick which deals damage in all directions around you.

There are a number of enemies. Some of them can be killed with some of your attacks, while others can be temporarily stunned. More interestingly, most projectiles can also be destroyed by your attacks, allowing you to defend yourself from them.

The bosses all have large numbers of hit points; three of them are fairly standard large hit point gauge bosses, though each of them has a way to be killed much more quickly. The final boss has two phases, and the first phase regenerates, making it easily the hardest boss in the game.

The primary goal is of the game is the three stars you get for completing each stage; you need a certain number of stars to unlock more stages, and getting the proper ending requires you to get almost all of the stars in the game. One star is awarded automatically for completing each stage; this is generally not a terribly difficult task, as there are checkpoints in the levels and most of the stages are pretty generous with them. A second star is awarded for completing a stage without dying, and a third star is awarded for completing a stage within a certain time limit. You dont need to accomplish both optional tasks in one run to get all three stars, but on many of the stages, the time limits are tight enough that you cannot afford to die, or can only die once, to get the time. Because the stages are persistent after your death, there are times when dying and respawning closer to where you need to go can cut down on the time needed to beat a level, and a few levels require you to do so.

There are optional bonus levels and collectibles in almost every stage which unlock cosmetic improvements to Rexs home base. In addition, each stage contains a large number of coins and gems which can be collected in order to purchase cosmetic items; collecting all the coins gives a coin bonus, and eventually, an achievement for doing it in every stage.



Only the very final stage in the game does not have checkpoints, and it is a borderline platform hell level, making it pretty annoying.

Overall, the game is pretty tough as far as such games go; it took me about 7 hours and 40 minutes to 100% the game according to the in-game timer. It is nowhere near the difficulty level of, say, a game like Super Meat Boy, but it is still fairly tough. The real challenge mostly lies in the speed runs, though in a few levels, not dying is the more difficult challenge.

By and large, the levels are decent enough, but it is hard to shake the feeling that, for the first 3/4ths of the game, there isnt much to denote your progress. The stages get gradually harder, but only the final nine stages really feel all that different from what came before. The game never gets too difficult (save for the final, checkpointless stage which is a borderline platform hell level, which is a bit frustrating) but apart from the final area there is little sense of progression.

The game mechanics and level designs are decent enough, but the stages arent terribly pretty and are pretty bare-bones functional, as is typical in such retro games.

In the end, I cant really recommend this game, but not because it is bad. It is not bad. It is decent enough and I didnt feel bored while playing it. What the game suffers from is being mediocre. Theres nothing wrong with it, but it is pretty much exactly enjoyable enough to keep the player from getting bored, never so good that you get actively excited about it. You just arent missing anything by never playing this game. And if you arent missing anything by playing a game, why give up eight hours of your life to do so?

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

Very promising oldschool 2D platformer with interesting, challenging and varied level design, which also allows for quick burst game play. Always pleased to see one of these games that's happy to tailor itself to all sorts of ability levels and not just limit itself to hardcore gamers. Being someone whose considers themselves as a fan of this genre, but as a midrange gamer skillwise, I feel it's the kind of thing that will challenge me, and even if some of its speedrun/perfectionist objectives may be out of reach for me, I'd be happy to play it until I get as much out of the game as possible. Nailing some of those early speed challenges is incredibly satisfying! A pretty decent soundtrack to boot.

JumpJet Rex
Great game for the young ones.

Bought for my 4 year old and he loves it. Controls are simple and limited, though the game can still get pretty challenging at times... I can say that it was a little to hard to resist giving him a hand on some of the harder sections when he asked and I actually had a lot of fun with it too.

I also liked how you got awards for completing levels quicker, which can be tricky and dying can even be a strategy for speed at times. My son liked changing the avatar up by buying new heads and stuff - and there are A LOT.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

I love this game! It's fun, challenging, and awesome! The soundtrack and artstyle lead this tough but rewarding platformer, where you control a small, customizable T-Rex. If you enjoyed games such as Super Time Force, Super Meat Boy, and other tough platformers, then you'll love this game! You will keep replaying every level to beat your high score and to find the screts within the level. Anyways, this game is a steal for $10.00, and I really recomend it if you want something to play something that you'll have fun with. Rage, laugh, and enjoy: JumpJet Rex!

JumpJet Rex
I really like JumpJet Rex,  there is a lot to do and unlock, and the controls are tight

JumpJet Rex
I love this game! It reminds me so much of old gameboy/GBC games I used to play as kid but with smoother, less clunky controls. I was happily surprised to find the game mechanics and feel were nothing like flappy bird although the game's controls were inspired from it. I'm glad I did not pass off this game like I initially did with Hotline Miami and Papers, Please.

JumpJet Rex
If you like to beat leaderboard times and/or speedrunning, you might like this game. The game has an interesting 'speedrun' mode with the objective to achieve the fastest time possible. Though the game is fun playing casually, I found more enjoyment in beating people's times on the leaderboard.

If you are looking to play the game casually, it's a very fun platformer where you are speeding through levels as a T-Rex with booster shoes! It also has a nice soundtrack that matches the game's nice 16-bit graphics. But it IS a short game(2-3+ hrs) and depending on how loose your wallet is, $15 might be a steep price to pay. I recommend this game and if it ever receives goes on a discount it would definitely be worth it.

TL;DR

Great but short platformer. T-Rex in space, Chris Pratt would be proud.

JumpJet Rex is a 2D platformer that puts you in control of a rocket boot wearing T-Rex on a mission to save the world from an incoming asteroid. The game consist of racing against the clock while navigating through increasingly difficult levels while collecting the power rings that unlock the gate at the end of the level. All the while youll be dodging spikes, missiles, robots, and zombie like plants from a variety of settings such as space, ice, and jungle worlds. Upon completion of the level you will be awarded stars that are required to progress the game further and unlock the next batch of levels; you are awarded one star for simply completing the level, one star for completing the level without dying, and a third star for finishing the level within the given challenge time limit. Along the way you will be able to collect numerous coins that can be used to purchase adorable cosmetic items for your tiny dino hero.

The game boasts a gorgeous hand-drawn 16 bit retro art style that harkens back to the old days of the Sega Genesis. The game thrives on its fast paced race against the clock and one hit heart system that combine for at times, quite the punishing experience. The controls are fluid and responsive, whether you are jumping, dashing, or rolling, if you happen to die you wont feel cheated because the controls were at fault, something that is crucial for a 2D platformer of this speed and difficulty. If you get frustrated easily or hate repetition then this is not the game for you, as you will quickly learn the ins and outs of each level as you repeatedly die over and over again. This game does not hold your hand and mistakes are not forgiven, the satisfaction of finally overcoming the challenge of racing the clock and completing the level without taking a single hit is a very rewarding feeling.

All in all the game offers a fun, fast paced, 2D platforming experience that that provides a high level of challenge as well as a high level of replayablity.

If you're looking for a great platforming" game in the mix of all the new space age shooters

JumpJet Rex
Lots of fun for both coop and solo. I'd recommend skipping straight to normal mode since the difference between easy and normal is that in easy you get 2 hitd before you die.

This game is also lots of fun for speed running. To really optimize you may have to change your control scheme.

One helpful thing I didn't realize one could do is to cancel your horizontal dash with your drop" (b button on xbox controller). This is useful when jump-cancelling would kill you."

JumpJet Rex
Nice little game with old-timey feel. It is not hard to learn the basics, but hard to master and beat levels in fast pace. If you enjoy old platform action games, this might be a good choice.

JumpJet Rex
Fun little speed-run oriented platformer.  Easier than something like Super  Meat Boy, more of a time waster/personal best focused sort of game?  I dig it.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

I think someone sumed it better then I could have calling it a cross between flappy bird and super meat boy, the graphics and soundtrack are wonderful, the levels are fun and short so beating them is relatively easy but mastering them can be challenging. a nice little game.

Early Access Review

JumpJet Rex is a fun and challenging game. The game controls smoothly, and the difficulty level is just about right so that you know that when mess up, it's your own fault. The main method for success in each stage requires you to learn a fairly simple pattern to maintain fluid movement.

For anyone looking for an enjoyable platformer, I'd recommend this game.

Glad for infinite continues this game is tough, Game seems pull a bit of influence off Sega's knights and Capcom Megman. I'd reccomend to anyone who wants a throwback to a retro platformer or any of speed running community in genral. The controls are very resposive leaving you abilty make split hair manuevers for completion of level. You'll be finding yourself casualy running level till ultimatly memeorize lay out in hopes achieving the high score.

JumpJet Rex
this is a great game. I was expecting level design to be repetative, but each level felt fresh. cool character, cool game, keep up the good work treeforest games.

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is a solid casual jump and run.
Unfortunately with a few flaws.

Pros:

- Nice retro setting.
- Nice retro music.
- Good control concept with the jumping jet boots (although it feels like flappy bird sometimes).
- A lot of secrets.
- Weird but nice and supershort story.
- Super Mario Style" amount of coins. Which you can use to buy skins. Nice!

Cons:

- Engine: One main problem is its performance. I play it on an i7 quadcore with an ok gaming video card.
In a ridiculous resolution (1280x720). And the game lags in huge levels. I even got the feeling

Dying in this game doesn't even matter.

Oh my god I love this game.

It's like the megaman X dash/jump boost was turned into a game with cool dinosaur art and music.

Had to configure the gamepad manually despite the Steam Store claiming full controller support, and the game's website claiming my controller to be compatible. But other than this minor inconvenience, heck yes. This game is awesome.

100% Historically accurate

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

First review hype aside, I think Jump Jet Rex is an already decent game with great potential.  It was updated recently (showing that it's not yet abandoned) with the last set of levels and clear plans for the forth (and seemingly final) boss so has much of the game completely built therefore.  The new update also included one of the most crucial things required by all games, a.k.a. an extensive settings menu that (finally) allows players to escape full screen mode and alter sound within the game engine.  The settings themselves are rather basic, but that is passable in this case due to the basic nature of the game.  Despite being basic, this game WILL kick your bum time and time again if you are a casual player.  It is because of this that I recommend the game only to cautionary players who are aware of it's potential difficulty.  It is one game which is hard but in fair ways, so pros at games like Dark Souls may not be phased, but normal players can expect a challenging game with much to find and more awaiting for those patient enough to wait for each update.
*****That said, THIS GAME IS INCOMPLETE and therefore I advise extreme hesitation as you may not get your money's worth if the project fails.

JumpJet Rex
Early Access Review

Update [Spoiler Alert... Skip to Early Access section to avoid]: I beat the game in speedrun mode, took over two hours straight for me to do. I was behind in the race I was doing at first, but I quickly took a lead in the earlygame as I went through all the levels I knew beforehand in a flash, giving be this big star lead over my friend.  But when I finally did get to the home stretch, my friend took the lead and ended up getting to the asteroid before me. I managed to catch up within 10-20 minutes, and I actually found the path before him, but I gave up on the path as I assumed it was the wrong one... Then he ended up just telling me because we were both taking so long on the level.  We both took a snack break, pausing our games at the same time, and after we continued, I lost.  I kept going though, as I wanted to see how long it would take me to finish my run.  Yeah... I actually liked the experience, but the fact that a single mistake would cost me anywhere between fifteen seconds and nearly a minute really added up.  (Anyone else just kept jumping into spikes? I know I did. Alot.)  I'll be playing through the regular mode 100% before I modify this to be a full review.

Before we go to early access section, just remember this.  IF YOU GET THIS GAME, IT WILL BE TOUGH.

[Below was in Early Access, before the first boss was moved and some modifications to levels were made.]

Jump! Dash! Jump! Dash! Die! Repeat until level is complete!

Yes, this is a 2D classic-style platformer with a lot of hidden references.  I'll warn you this, it gives you infinite jumps.  Now you may think that's overpowered, but remember, the obstacles get pretty hard, and your afterburners are your only way of dealing damage other than ramming your head into some of the enemies.  One hit and you die.

This game is EASILY speedrunner friendly, and unique.  Heck, they even let you test out the controls on the title screen!  I love it when games let me do that.  Gives me a convenient way to warm-up pre-run.

You can customize the T-Rex you play as. (Spoiler alert: Mine already has a Megaman helmet!)  From colors, heads/helmets, boots, heck even to your boots' trails, it's all customizable.  The shop mixes up every 15 minutes of playtime after you leave the Dinonaut Base, so be ready to rush to the store and check it out if you have 2000 coins or so already!  (This timer includes time used resetting the level, from what I can tell, only time spent in the shop seems to not count.)

The difficulty? Oh, yeah, it's quite unforgiving, but only if you want that no death star...  Otherwise you respawn at checkpoints... UNLESS you play on the harder mode--it even has rage quit in its name... Listen, that mode gives you 3 lives and no checkpoints for the ENTIRE game if I understand it correctly.  I've only played up to the first boss so far, though, so I don't know exactly how hard it'll get.

From what I can tell, it gives you 3 singleplayer save files, so you atleast don't have to delete all progress files every time you restart the game.  Not sure if the files are seperate in Coop or not yet.  The controls are VERY accurate.  Once you input a control, it feels basically instant responses, atleast with the Xbox 360 Controller that I was using.  Oh yeah, did I mention?  It supports controllers directly!

The soundtrack is excellent, infact if the soundtrack doesn't come with the game, I'll probably go ahead and pick up the soundtrack if it's cheap enough.  It's not often that I actually listen to the game's music/sounds if I'm not streaming my run, excluding certain games of course...  But this game easily passes to a point where I'll probably barely ever not listen to it.  Infact, this is probably one of the first platformers to make it on that list of mine.

You can directly challenge the WR IL times if you wish, thus if you just want to try to hit a IL record, you can easily get ready to do so through that.  You also can challenge your PB--infact it does so on its own if you already have beaten the stage before apparently.  It took approximately 1.2 hours for me to get through the first set of levels and the first boss in total, if you include trying to get the 3 stars in most of the levels and the time spent shopping/adjusting to the controls. (Which I got in all of them except the boss!)

I'll likely come back and update the review if possible after I have more gameplay.  But seriously, it's 20% off until the 30th, and you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free if you get it during early access?  It's easily worth the price tag for how much you can do in the game.  See you when I update this review, and if I end up not updating it, in the next review I do!

(Rating of the game that I consider as of reviewing: 10/10, as I can't see any flaws so far, aside from the fact that there's a few things not in the game just yet, but should be in the game soon considering full release is upcoming!)

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is a fantastic new take on the precision platformer genre. The first few levels aren't fantastic but they let you get to grips with the controls and prepare you for the faster paced, more dangerous levels to come.
The main focus of the game is to use Rex's foot mounted jets to stay off the ground and keep a solid momentum while jumping, flying and propelling forward through each level; collecting coins and jumping through rings along the way. Level design is very creative and although the levels are short the game encourages replaying them by offering rewards for no death runs as well as speederuns. Those are optional however so more casual players can still enjoy the game.

JumpJet Rex isn't perfect, however. The soundtrack is quite good but a bit repetitive and the controls could be just a little tighter. There are upgrades to be unlocked as well but they're all entirely cosmetic. I think it would've been nice to be able to buy a few upgrades to jump higher or move faster.

Overall I'd say it's worth the low price as the gameplay manages to be both unique and familiar at the same time, not to mention an absolute blast to play.

Early Access Review

At the time of this review I am appoximatly 1.5hrs in and I really like this game.  It has all the correct elements for speed running, the level designs are fun and so far are very different. After completeing the first set of stages and FINALLY beating the first boss I can see my time on this game only increasing.

Early Access Review

Do you enjoy Dinosaurs, going fast, kicking rad music, clever secrets and playing dressup? Then this is the perfect game for you! The levels are well designed, the progression is fair and frustrating, and the speed is real. Seriously it feels amazing getting the par time on a level that has been destroying you for 15 minutes.

TL;DR I was able to dress my dinosaur up like MegaMan and run him into spikes. REX/10.

BEST GAME EVER!!!

JumpJet Rex
If you like the classic Mega Man games then this game is worth all your money then more. Actually, just throw your wallet at the devs, they deserve it.

JumpJet Rex
fun, cute and snappy game.

gameplay is tight.

humor is cute and fun.

i got this on the humble bundle monthly and would have bought if i knew about it before hand.

plays like a great 16 bit platformer if you are looking for one. love the music graphics and animations. good job.

JumpJet Rex
Such a fun and at times frustrating game, but that's what makes it so fun!
Great controls, and even though i'm not into speedrunning, i find myself trying to beat my best times.
and who doesn't like a cute dinosaur in rocket boots?
If you get the chance to play this game please do! You won't be disappointed!
I've only just started but I can't wait to keep playing when i get the time this summer.

JumpJet Rex
JumpJet Rex is an absolute gem of a game, a speed runners dream.

The game runs superb, have seen no control issues or frame rate issues which is perfect for a game like this. You know if you dont beat a time it was on you not a glitch or bug in the game.

The levels are varied and graphics hit the mark. There is a challenge there for everyone and being able to load up ghost runs of other playes works like a charm.

The amount dedication the developers have put into the game really shows in the end product.

Must buy if you like platformers

Heres my original review for RRDDD:
Disco Dodgeball is a game that grabs you by surprise. You first try it out and don't expect to like it all that much but then you look and it's been nearly 30 minutes of you throwing glowing balls at robots with moustaches. Seriously addicting and I cannot wait to see this game come out of early access."

~Version 1.0 Review.~
Holy hell the game has changed a lot.

Early Access Review

Disco Dodgeball is an awesome example of Early Access done right--every update brings huge, beneficial changes, the game is STABLE and remains fun as heck.

Highly recommended!

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This game is like if Tron, Unreal/Quake, and Dodgeball Advance had a child.

+ Game is super fun
+ Soundtrack is great
+ A good variety of game modes to make sure it doesn't get stale
+ You can even customize your robot a bit with mustaches and sunglasses!

- A lot of flashing neon lights which can be annoying for some
- Game can get frustrating while trying to adjust to the controls/physics

Definitely worth the buy if you're looking to play a game that's just fun, no DLC required. 9.5/10

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Arena shooters is not a genre that has received much love in the recent years. 1999 spawned the best two games of that category, Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament, and since then there have been little to no changes to the formula. Unambitious games with little tweaks on Quake 3 and new coats of paint on Unreal Tournament.

Strangely, the most unique spin on the arena shooter formula comes from this game with a ridiculous title: Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. Instead of weapons there are insta-kill balls to throw (they can be caught), and the movements are on wheels which give some momentum, fluidity and... skill. Predicting trajectories and movements while aiming and moving leaves room for a lot of exciting action, rewarded by a commentator naming the specific skill shot (flying squirrel!""zombie!" "quick draw!").

The fluidity of the game itself ties in with the atmosphere. There is some cool electro/techno music playing while panels and lights on the levels change color according to the beat and the movement of players. Really enthralling.

Even if the game has a huge skill ceiling

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Early Access Review

I've been following this game since it's beta, long before it got greenlit.

RRDDD (or just Disco Dodgeball) is an easy to learn, hard to master multiplayer game (or singleplayer, against bots) that I loved since the first time I've played it.
The game basically consist of silly robots playing deadly dodgeball in several arenas. Different game modes add a lot of variety. For instance: classic deathmatch, FFA modes, hoops (think dodgeball mixed with basketball), elimination, and more.
There are also different skill shots"

**Key was donated from the developer to review**

Introduction            Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball may give the idea of a cheap indie game thats goal is to just take your money, but this is not the case. I didnt expect much going into this game and was incredibly surprised with the amount of polish and depth in this game. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has nearly every feature I like to see in games like this and more. (See pros list for a more list of the cool features) The first thing you will notice once you open Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is the amazing soundtrack, and if the techno dance music isnt your thing you can add your own music. Along with the soundtrack the visual style goes perfectly with this type of music and will get nearly anyone hyped up to play. While playing solo I had tons of fun and the challenges were great, but I did have some problems with connections on the online multiplayer. People were teleporting around, but I do think this was due to those players connections. Overall, I would highly suggest everyone to check this game out.

Pros
Awesome Music and You Are Able To Load Your Own Tracks
Several Game Modes
Well Made Crafting

Unique Graphics Style


Cons
Connectivity Issues. (I Had A Few Problems with People Glitching Around While Playing Online, May Not Apply To Everyone)
The Crazy Colors May Be Too Much For Some People
(There is nearly nothing wrong with this game and I am pleasantly surprised with the amount of polish this game has. AMAZING Developers, I would love to see more from them)

Well here I am, my 80th birthday and my wife has seen fit in our budget for me to afford one of those nice new indie games on Steam. Well here I am on Steam and I come across a colorful lookin' game on sale. My eye doctor said that vivid colors would be good for my vision. So my wife said what the heck is that?" and I said it's "dodgeball" and so she said alright.

I thought I'd ask the man that made the game his opinion on it and he seemed like a pretty nice guy.

Early Access Review

The best multiplayer game I have ever played. Gameplay is really fun (like Unreal or Quake), soundtrack[82apps.bandcamp.com] is AMAZING. Buy it. Play it with friends, friendly community, or just with bots. You will enjoy this game.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
I have always been a fan of fast paced physics based shooters but I haven't found one that wasn't too high of a learning curve or just plain bad. I saw this game from a youtuber a while ago and I thought it looked great so I decided to buy it. If you can't tell by my hours on the game I have been enjoying it ever since.

It has a very unique feel and having to actually pick up each shot you fire is a small thing that makes it very different from other shooters. There are also many skillshots you can preform which give you more to do once you get better at the game. As of writing this review the game has one of the best communities I can think of, I currently run a group that organizes events for the game and am having a blast. The developer is a great guy who clearly cares about and works hard on the game and its community.

The games multiplayer is very entertaining with a good amount of gamemodes and maps and the singleplayer has a lot of good content too. As of writing this review an arcade mode was just added to the singleplayer that is a great timewaster for when I don't want to deal with other people.

I would definitely reccomend this game and I think you can easily get your 15 dollars out of it. You probably won't play it as much as me but everyone I know that picks it up says it was worth their hard earned money.

UPDATE FOR OFFICIAL RELEASE: *happy screaming*
This is everything anyone would want for a release. The arcade mode, as a highlight, is pleasantly addictive and the updated levelling system makes my inner completionist squeal its head off. There's even a bunch of steam cards now which, for me, was a happy surprise when I checked the announcements. This game is just great. Buy it already.

Onto actual review:

Whenever someone asks me what my favourite games are, I always smile and then start blurting off about the Portal series, how Stanley Parable is like the best thing ever, why they should start playing SCP Containment Breach like right now and how Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is possibly my favourite game of all time. When my mates and I get past the whole, Wait

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Pros:
- Great Multiplayer Component with countless gamemodes.
- Great Singleplayer Component with gamemodes such as horde, arcade and more.
- Fun gameplay.
- Strong replayability.
- Good amount of customization.
- Upbeat and fun soundtrack.
- Nice colorful graphics.
- Developer is super cool, dedicated, and listens to feedback.
- Bots are pretty strong.

Cons:
- None

Final Verdict:
This has to be one of the best games to come out of Steam Greenlight and Early Access! Everything about the game is fantastic. If you enjoy multiplayer you'll love this game, if you enjoy high replayability singleplayer games you'll enjoy the game aswell. This game is well worth more then the $15, for a indie game this game surpasses most multiplayer FPS games. Overall I cannot recommend this game more. Well worth the money.
10/10.

I Have nothing to say to you, in order for you to decide whether or not to buy this game.

Instead, look at the amount of hours I have on record on this game to see just how good I think it is, and how good you might like it

Flashy Arcade-Style Fun!An Early Access game that graduated with flying colours.

Let me start this review off by saying I've got 97 games on Steam and this is my most played game.  If that doesn't peak your interest, feel free to read on.

Intro:

This game is special.  When I say special" I don't mean mentally handicapped

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This is a fast-paced first-person dodgeball game from the future complete with robots, an (amazing) voiced announcer, and synced visualizers for the music.

At its core this is a game I *highly* recommend for those that enjoy the FPS (especially instagib) genre, but want something a bit different... yet still familiar. I won't be so bold as to say a digital dodgeball game has never been made before, but this is the first I've ever played to really go all out with it. It's so brilliantly simple, yet took this long until someone decided to make it... AAA marketing departments: fire yourselves.

NOTE: THIS GAME HAS A DEMO YOU CAN TRY! So... try it! (I don't know if it's up to date... but the gameplay is the same regardless)

Graphics:
I love them! The best way to describe them is a minimalist TRON-themed rave". The music plays a big part as the level coloring/brightness/etc. is hooked up to a visualizer system. Different music will give you a different feel

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Early Access Review

Definately one of the better examples of Early Access done right. Regular updates, a very involved dev are what the game has going for it on the outside. Inside the game, you have maps and gameplay that may evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of old arena FPS games.

RRDDD sports a kickass soundtrack that brings with it both pumping beats to get you into a fugue of awareness and dodge ready, and softer tracks to wind you down when you need a breather. The Gameplay is fast and so are your armaments, dodgeballs. All hits are one hit kills, no health, no second winds. Catches, Long Distances, Flying Squirrel are just a few of the trick shots you can pull off. Perhaps you could even become God-like in the good variety of gamemodes.

For a low price you can have a lot of fun bashing in your fellow mustachioed robots's chasis in with discoball dodgeballs online. Is it silly? Perhaps. Is it fun? Definately.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Incredibly fun, satisfying yet lighthearted multiplayer game. Variety of diverse game modes whether it be your classic team deathmatch or capture the flag/cube or more zany ones like Hoops.
Sweet sountrack and aethestics.

Great game to just jump in and have some good old simple fun.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Early Access Review

This game is one of those rare gems that comes along and puts everyone on a level playing field.  The concept is so humorous alone that the game just oozes good vibes.  You can really see how much the developer loves both his game and the game's community in this one.  It's perfect for both casual play and competitive sport.  In fact I have not met or seen a person yet who has played this game and has not had a good time.

The graphics on this game are simple but they suit it.  The designs of the different arenas really compliment the fact that you're a robot with one wheel rolling around.  The pulsing and moving lights really sell the idea that you're a night-club arena and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard to a game.  Visually the game gives you what you need, and none of the fluff.  This is why Super Mario Bros. was so popular.  Visually it was nothing like we have today but it was fun to play!

The game does have an experience points system, but it's geared towards getting cosmetic upgrades, not towards making you more powerful.  I like this because it means new players have chances to improved without constantly getting slaughtered.  Also like many multiplayer games, there's sometimes lag, but with 4 to 12 people throwing dodgeballs around in every direction imaginable, it's so much fun and so chaotic that nobody really seems to mind!

You know a game is fun when you're laughing and yelling at your friends over voice chat, having a great time even when you're losing!  It's definitely one of my favorite games of all time; I highly recommend it for one of the best times you will have with your friends, ever, online.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This is another hidden gem on steam that would give Ricochet a run for it's money. Robot Roller Dodgeball is dodgeball that knows no boundaries and puts everyone playing at risk. Such an extremely simple FPS" game made with care and precision.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
I was quite skeptical seeing all the positive reviews while seeing the mediocre gameplay.  All the lights and effects seemed like goofy attempt at covering up the junk underneath.

But after getting the 4-pack during a sale and playing with some buddies, I came right back and bought a few more.  For those that enjoy arena shooters, this is an arena shooter done right.  Every shot that hits feels so satisfying, I crave to play more.

The only major downside is the steps it takes to actually set up a LAN party.  Due to the limited experience of the lonely dev, he resorted to 3rd party technology, thus the requirement to download a server program from an external website and a bit of tweaking before one can play with friends, even if everyone is on the same router.

After having done so, I see it is relatively easy despite the daunting number of steps on the wiki, so don't be afraid to give it a shot.

Also surprisingly, playing solo with bots is actually pretty darn fun too.  Don't let the flashing lights blind you, this game delivers a very solid package.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys arena shooters.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Seriously, this is one of the best multiplayer arena games to come along in a long time.  You will see that I own many of these types of multiplayer games, and this has esports written all over it.  I cannot believe there are not 5,000 people playing this right now.  I bought this thinking it would be OK for a couple of hours, but wow....everyone in game is saying the same.

Honestly, this is the kind of game that could benefit tremendously from a free weekend of sorts.  Once you play it, you will see that it is pure skill.  It has tons of game modes that are all fun.  I never really write reviews on Steam, but with this one, I just had to to try and get the word out.  I urge everyone to stream this game and pass the word along to friends to keep this one alive.  It has sooo much potential and....well, stop reading this, just buy it now.  better yet, but a four pack for your friends as well!!

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
I havn't played a game that got me this excited for many years.  It's so energetic and exciting and kinda rekindles how games used to feel for me when I was younger.  It's a lot of fun and definitely worth picking up.

You and everyone else are robots that zip around various different rooms and try and blow each other up with dodgeballs.  It's fast paced, and me and some friends have been playing it together lately.  Me and one other in particular pull some crazy stunts against each other, it's great.  The level designs are great, there are quite a few game modes to choose from.  The soundtrack is really good.  There are powerups you can pick up around the room as well that will effect your movement or the dodgeball.  You can play with real people and/or bots.

It's just pure awesome.  Really refreshing title here.  Worth every penny, if I spent a penny on it (it was gifted to me).

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Upon reading the title, three things can be learnt about this game.

1) It has robots.
2) It involves disco.
3) It's about dodgeball.

And if there's anything this game is guilty of, living up to expectations is not one of them. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a competitve primarily multiplayer first person shooter filling the fairly empty and unexplored niche of a dodgeball game, one I'm frankly suprised nobody thought of before.

GAMEPLAY
Gameplay is easy to learn; find a dodgeball, hold the mouse to shoot (Oh

Early Access Review

I was fortunate enough to win a copy of this game in a giveaway, and I was very happy to have had a chance to experience the awesomeness found within this crazy, intense game.

If you like first-person competitive gameplay, dodgeball, electronic dance music (EDM), and vibrant, colorful battlefields, then you will really enjoy this game.

The aesthetics are fantastic - each level is basically a light-show-heavy rave, further enhanced by a very good electronic dance music tracklist. I especially loved the fact that the track playing in the menu screen would continue as the in-game music (something that I really appreciate because I don't have to desynch to the music when a new track suddenly interrupts the one you had been initially listening to). You can customize your robot character's appearance a fair amount, with the option to unlock more pieces as you level up your account. The announcer's praise for unique moves you do (ex: air hits, bounce hits, denials, etc) adds to the intensity of the game, which is reminiscent of the fast-paced action typically experienced in games like the Unreal and Quake series'.

The controls are easy to grasp and helpful pop-up tutorials remind you of your keybindings for things like e-braking, boosting, etc. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with first-person combat. Even against easy bots in singleplayer, you will have a very fun and challenging time familiarizing yourself with the game. During combat, you truly need to appreciate battlefield awareness because it is extremely easy to be hit from behind by a dodgeball. Furthermore, carelessly throwing your ball at an opponent may result in a catch, with auto-kills you and (even worse) brings back a downed opponent. You cannot catch twice in a row (you must throw a ball to reset your catch allotment), and this helps ensure that people do not simply camp and wait for their opponents to throw the first ball.

There are a variety of different levels, each with their own distinct layout that may result in you changing up your strategy (for example, one level consists of many pillars, so weaving in and out to dodge/juke your opponents attacks is a much more viable strategy here than, say, a level with large, open ground.

Pickups also litter the battlefield, adding advantages like homing dodgeballs, a temporary jetpack, fast/tighter maneuverability, or even laser (straight) shots. The powerups are random (much like Mario Kart's mystery powerups), so you may have to pick several up before you end up acquiring your favorite one. My personal favorite is the jetpack, since it really helps you achieve those beautiful death from above" hits.

this is the only good game

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
These days it seems like developers, especially the giant AAA companies, have forgotten why we play video games to begin with:  TO HAVE FUN!

THIS GAME NAILS IT.  This game is just pure fun.  It is definitely a throwback. The engine is simple, the physics are fantastic, and... I mean come on its DODGEBALL WITH DANCE MUSIC AND LASER LIGHTS!!!  How the hell can you not enjoy that?

I highly recommend buying this, you won't be disappointed.

For 11.99 this game is a steal.

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
Wow. I was not expecting this gem.

Where do I begin? I got it last night when my friend finally paid me back, and after a 5-minute install, I booted it up. After tweaking the settings so it'd run smoother, I started the tutorial. No surprise, I sucked. Really, really badly. So, what did I do? I joined a random multiplayer game. And I got wrecked. But I also fluked my way into getting a few kills. Not skillshots, mind you, but kills. Anyways, after about 30 minutes since starting the game I get off to eat dinner.

Except, it hadn't been 30 minutes. As I stood up, I glanced at the words next to the 'Play' button. 'YOU'VE PLAYED: 90 minutes'

I spent an hour and a half getting blue and/or red dodgeballs thrown at my face by mustachioed, unicycling robots while rocking out to the badass music, and didn't even realise it.

And I have to say:

11/10

Would get balls thrown at my face by robots with mustaches again.

If there was a 'Highly Recommended' button instead of a 'Recommend' and 'Don't Recommend', I would use it.

Easily game of the year. This game has so much more to it than meets the eye. I began playing this game in beta, and it was amazing! It has easy mechanics, easy objectives, and unfathomable entertainment. There are so many things that I love about this game.

First off, unlike most other fps games, it's balanced. All players are equal, and when you die, there's no excuses. The other player was either better than you, or was able to use the map and powerups better than you. It's straight forward hit or miss gameplay. Also, the powerups are balanced. The big balls will help you hit more robots, but they are so much easier to see, and unlike the homing and laser, you can't hide having the powerup. When you're holding a ball, it's always big and noticable. The homing is amazing against bots at long range, but is so much harder to use close up. Also, when you lose it, you're so used to seeing the tracker that it disorientates you for a moment. Laser is fast and great for ricochets, but it messes up the way you're used to playing, being the ball has no drop. Jetpack is great for capturing points or swooping in like an eagle, but you can lose vertical momentum, making yourself an easy target. Pogo is good for navigation, but if you fumble, you're an easy midair target. Super boost is great for hit and runs, but really hurts your finger pressing shift. I find that when you use superboost, you start going in a lap pattern, which makes you a predictable target. You also get disorientated in close combat. The balance in this game makes it such a more entertaining game because you're just as capable as the rest of your team to achieve the objectives.

Second, the soundtrack. Where do I even start. It's amazing, and really is. The game wouldn't be the same without it. Hell, I'm a person that doesn't even like dubstep, and I can't play this without the music. It just gets you in the mood to kick , or just stop and listen to it. Best soundtrack of any game I've seen (or heard).

Third, the simplicity. At first glance, you may think you'll just be getting into some futuristic, complicated sports shotter with a ton of exposition. The title alone is complicated! But when you start playing, you realize just how simple it is. There's some balls. Go get a ball. Take that ball and hit that jerk over there in the face with it. Oh, by the way, keep killing those guys so your team wins. Or be fancy about smashing their smug toaster of a head open, because you're getting points for that. It's easy to learn, easy to master. I've never played a multiplayer game like that before. THe only real thing that separates experts from beginners is knowing your keys and mouse.

Finally, my favorite thing about this game is the development. It's ridiculous. Like I said, I started this in beta, and now it's ready for launch in a little under a year. Erik's the hardest working dev I think there is. Here's some new maps you can try out. Some more gamemodes. Here, a ton of more graphics options! Fixed some bugs that were reported 2 hours ago. Want singleplayer? Here's singleplayer! Hell, when 3.2 came out, I remember joking about 3.7 coming out. And it's now here! After a few short months, you've made 5 milestones in the development of Disco Dodgeball! Congratulations! Not only have you evolved, re-evolved, and revolutionized the game itself over and over again, but you've done something which is what all devs should do. You listen to your community. You actively engage with us to find what we want to see in your game. Is this causing lag? Fixed. Want more gamemodes? There you go. Catching too easy? No problem. You've even made a demo for players to try it out for free! I've gotta say, this wouldn't be nearly as fun of a game if Erik wasn't such a great developer.

So what are you waiting for? Get the game! You will not regret it. It will probably make you a better person, and help with stress. Better hurry, friday's only once a week! In case you don't know, we have game nights and tournaments every week! You'll quickly get a good group of friends from the community. You'll meet new people, and have a ton of fun hitting them in the face with an exploding dodgeball! What's not to like? Doesn't matter, Erik will fix it!

Seriously, this could be the best multiplayer game of 2015!

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This is an amazing game. Its fun, its differnt, and most of all, your tripping while listening to dubstep and disco.

What more could you want!

Forget CS:GO, this is the new first person shooter.

You get moves like a flying squirrel. Its just so good and amazingly well done! I reccommend to EVERYONE!

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball
This game is THE . Very fun, bots are fun to play against if you're having trouble finding online games, it has customizable game modes, simple mechanics, the physics based movement is fun to play with, and the game is aestheticelly pleasing. Definitely worth the money.

I have very few minor complaints about it:
- The UI could use a little polishing
- The game is a bit stingy when it comes to customization unlocks. Drop rated for crafting parts is pretty low, but thankfully you can buy parts in the communnity market for cheap.
- The sliding mechanic is a little weird; it doesn't seem to offer anything in terms of advanced movement outside of recharging your boost (whch is all I use it for)

pro/con - You can save replays, and they are directly saved as .gif files, which is really nice. The bad thing is, the gifs are short, so it's hard to capture cool moments perfectly. I reccommend binding the replay capture button to the 'q' key (Default F5)

Please don't let these few downsides turn you away from this game. It's quite an experience.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
UPDATE: The bug I mentioned below has now been fixed in an update. I've also finished the game and there are no substantial issues with the game, or any real changes outside of the fact that the stealth sections have paths on the minimap showing you where to go now in order to make them easier. The game's last moments still leave a bit to be desired, but the majority of the story is good enough that I would definitely recommend this.

As a word of warning, at the moment this game seems to save your game based on your steam name. What this means is that changing your name causes the game to forget where your save is, and if you have any quotation marks, question marks, or any punctuation that isn't allowed in a windows folder name, the game just freezes after you choose your language at the start.

I haven't played the game past the opening yet, but I finished the original Indigo Prophecy and the original Fahrenheit release from GOG and assuming they haven't broke anything it's a great game aside from the ending so I'll leave the recommendation at a yes anyways.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
At $10 regular price this isn't bad. I remember playing the demo for the game when I was younger and always being intrigued. Having played the whole thing now I can say I was a little disappointed.

+ Story holds up well until the final act
+ Port runs very well. Maxed out and only had a few weird FPS drops in cutscenes.
+ Acting is pretty solid all around
+ Gamepad support
+ Uncensored version :)

- QTE's in this game are ANNOYING, simon says stick moving that goes on forever or controller breaking button mashing
- Like I said, the story kinda falls off towards the end
- Awkward camera

$10 is a fair asking price for this game, but if you're on the fence, wait for a steam sale

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Short version: 64%Imagine a DVD player which is powered by you playing Guitar Hero on Expert mode with a mouse. Combine it with a terrific thriller to get Fahrenheit: a horrendous video game hiding a great cinematic experience.

Long version:When it came out in 2005, Fahrenheit offered something new by focusing exclusively on the narrative and nothing else. It was a true interactive movie with cinematic techniques like split scenes displaying the same events from multiple points of view (like in the TV show 24).

The plot is entirely character-driven and focuses on three main leads: Lukas, a murderer on the run; and Carla and Tyler, the two detectives on his trail. Their stories are split into more than thirty chapters on two separate threads that eventually meet in one big finale.
A finale about superpowers, Mayan prophecies, an artificial intelligence, and somehow preventing the freezing of the planet with a martial arts showdown against an immortal priest. If you thought the end of Matrix: Revolutions jumped the rails, it has nothing on this game.

Sadly the derailment of the plot is vastly overshadowed by gameplay issues. The controls are horrid, no matter what control scheme you choose: for example, basic actions like picking up something require at least four-five mouse or stick gestures with bad movement detection. The few puzzles make absolutely no sense, and all key scenes are progressed by playing a double quick-time event that obstructs the entire screen. By the way, on easy mode, this minigame leaves roughly a quarter of a second window for each action before failing.

I have no doubts that Fahrenheit was one of the best things ever in its time, but it aged horribly. If you missed it originally, you are far better off just watching a longplay than trying to suffer through its controls.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
I've beaten the game 3 times and I still don't know what the hell is going on.

11/10

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
this game is cool.. and then gets entertainingly weird, definitely worth playing

Not much of a 'remaster' though.. at least it's cheap

+Points for continuing the trend of being able to switch to old graphics and back at the touch of a button in re-releases

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Thought I was playing an interesting detective thriller with some spiritual tone to it.
Turned out to be a Wall-running, Kung Fu, bullet-time, super jumping Matrix game in which you fight enourmous fleas while trying to succesfully complete the longest quicktime events in videogame history.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Do not expect drastical changes when you see Remastered" label. Yes they have done quite lot of works but remember this is a game from 2005 and originally released on PS2. Of course you can switch between HD and SD version by pressing F9.

I got a copy of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy (GOG version

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
During the closing credits, the only thing in my mind was: WTF did I just play!?"

Indigo Prophecy starts with a huge potential. Cool set of characters

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
in 2005 this underrated game was a blast for me ( still got the old disk ) , story rich game with choices and consequences + different ending depends on your choices .
- when it comes to the plot (best thing about this game) its start as a detective thriller game , you committed a crime and try to run from it and understand what really happened and in the other hand the police try to identify and catch you ( you play with 3 characters all linked to the same plot) but in the middle of the story everything changes to a dark maya fantasy/ kung fu/bullet time/superhuman/cyborg game ,kinda remind me of matrix .
-graphically , the remastered it and they did a good job and you can see the difference by just pressing F9 in gameto switch between old and new Graphics but sadly a lot of people didn't understand what remastered means( this one is a remastered game not a remake which means the core game with updated HD textures ).
-gameplay ( the bad thing about this game) , keyboard and controller are ok ( didn't have any problems ) but there is a lot of ridiculously long QTE that becomes boring and annoying ( and if you miss you have to start from the beginning) so if you hate qte then stay away from this game, mini games.
-perfect voice acting , great music and sound effects.
-some crashes ( 4-5 in 10h of my playtime).
- bugged achievements ( won't unlock them in the legit way) , sadly if you're an achievement hunter like me then dont bother , the devs are aware of this problem and they are working on it.
Update : the devs fixed the achievements ;D <3
-no steam trading cards
if you're looking for a story rich game where your choices do matter than this one for you, worth the money but you can get it on sales
8/10

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Edit: Save file glitch tied to Steam name and most startup issues have been fixed. 2/2/15

Nothing much has changed, textures have been slighly updated but are still blurry in some areas, controller support was extremely well done however. 10/10 in that department.

Sure, you know the usual complaints of how the story gets a little in the meh" side as the game ends

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
This game makes no sense and I totally recommend playing it.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Do you like games that focus mainly on the story such as The Walking Dead (or every game by Telltales)? If so, you should like that game. Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy is a point-and-click adventure in which you control Lucas Kane, a guy who wakes up in the toilet of a restaurant with a knife in his hand .. and a body on the ground just next to him ! Also, you control two other characters, the two cops that are in charge of the investigation for this murder.

First of all, the gameplay. It plays like a regular point-and click adventure game but an important part of the game is the cutscenes . The problem is that in some of these cutscenes, you have to do QTEs (Quick Time Events) in the form of 'Simon Says' with 2 pad of 4 arrows. Sometimes, it's just useless since there is no action at all and it's distracting. Some other times, it might be too hard and unforgiving for some people (I had no problem with that but read a lot of bad comments about that). The game is quite easy. You won't be stuck anywhere since the characters always tell what to do.

My favorite part of the game was the story. Really interesting story. It starts out as a thriller. Why did Lucas did that? Why did he mutilated himself in the toilet before commiting the murder? Why doesn't he remember? There's a lot of questions that are answered later in the game and I won,t spoil anything. It's better that way. I had no idea what this game was about and was pleasantly surprised at the end. There is also different endings depending of the different choices that you make during the game !

Another really good thing about this game is the voice acting. It sounds like a movie and it's definitely a good point. In French (don't know about the English voices), the voice-over is perfect and really intriguing. The music is really great too. It's mysterious and it adds up to the atmosphere of the game (and you can buy some good songs with bonus points in the 'bonus' section !)

Last thing that I really liked was the camera angles throughout the game. Sometimes, you'll see 3-4 views at the same time to show more informations of where the people are or where to go next. Really fun and useful !

In conclusion, if you don't mind about the QTEs, get this game. The story is amazing, the writing is engaging and you'll definitely want to know what happened. Also, it's long enough to be well worth the price of the game (Took me 6 hours to complete it)

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Turned on the apartment stereo and the game crashed.

But that's okay.  I get that way too when I hear Theory of a Deadman.

10/10

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Don't expect miracles when you see 'Remastered'. Remastered in this case means visual improvements that are not really vital.

Fahrenheit is about an ordinary guy who's been randomly chosen to do unusual things, involving very much the whole world. Not only that you'll play as this super natural hero, there are two other main characters that you'll control and making choices between all three of them is really fun. You feel like you can really influence everything that happens although the reality is of couse different since the game can't possibly have more than a few multiple endings at a time for only 10. Some people critisize this game for going a little crazy after the first half but I believe, that's the way it was meant to go and against all odds I enjoyed the crap out of it. The action scenes are very comfortable with both keybord and controllers, maybe a little more with the analog sticks than arrows. I loved the older version and wanted to support the devs even now that it's returned to Steam, either way it's getting 9/10 from me.

Fahrenheit is the reason I began to love and hate QuanticDream at the same time. I love them dearly for making awesome games that make you feel like your choices matter and the way the stories are told. But I do hate them for keeping their new titles like Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls exclusive to consoles, they also never bothered to make Omikron work for the new technology.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Fun fact: I played this game way back in the day when it originally came out on the PS2. Back then I knew it as Indigo Prophecy, and my teenage self was intrigued by its emphasis on cinematics and interactive storytelling, so I rented it for a weekend. I didnt finish it during that rental period, and needless to say, I didnt rent it a second time. The games story was just too weird. I think it was about the time that the main character began developing superpowers that I decided to let Blockbuster keep this one. So, ten years later and here I am playing this game again. Ten years older, ten years wiser Ive aged pretty well. Can the same be said for Fahrenheit?

The game gets off to a bad start when Im greeted by French menus. This isnt a big deal, but its a weird, lazy oversight, and it sets the tone for whats to come. Its especially weird considering this is supposed to be the definitive remastered edition of the game, but it just ends up feeling like a lazy port of a previous PC release. It does feature some updated textures for the new HD resolutions, but I honestly could barely tell any difference. Also, in another weird, lazy oversight, the game mode that features HD textures is actually the one with the old, low-res text and menus. I dont know how the developers in charge of the port messed that one up. Anyway, after switching to English, Im quickly reminded of director David Cages quest to create interactive film when, instead of New Game being an option on the main menu, theres instead the option for New Movie. This, coupled with the games tutorial consisting of an in-game, low-poly version of Cage himself in a virtual movie set directing me, the player, through the games controls and promising a world where anything can happen creates an annoyingly pretentious vibe. Why must Cage remind me at every turn that this is an interactive movie? Cant the product just speak for itself? Shouldnt a game, or an interactive story, or whatever you choose to call it stand on its own as an experience instead of relying on the strengths of another medium?

I have to admit that I do like the games engine and core gameplay, though. Quantic Dream came up with a pretty good control scheme and game mechanics for a title focused on storytelling. Interacting with the environment and selecting dialogue choices is all done with the right stick or the mouse pointer, which is both intuitive and immersive. Holding left to slide open a closet door to the left, for instance, feels natural, and actions that require holding a direction longer, like turning on a light, do a good job of putting the player in the characters shoes. Its simple, but it works. With this engine you could conceivably tell any film-like story interactively, with quick-time events provided for action sequences or scenes in which characters must exert themselves physically. The characters are also all well-animated due to extensive motion capture, and are generally well-voice acted. David Gasman in particular gives a grounded, believable performance as main character Lucas, which is actually saying a lot given the ridiculous material.

Thats really where the problem lies. Despite the game functioning fairly well and providing a good system for telling an interactive story, the story itself is, ironically, the games downfall. Its just poorly conceived. Cage is ok with dialogue and basic character emotions and relationships, but for some reason he isnt content with just telling character driven stories. Fahrenheit is full of supernatural nonsense that only serves to alienate the player from any connection they might have felt to the characters. Full disclosure: I still havent finished the game, even after writing this review. I honestly cant bring myself to; its such an unenjoyable experience. As a kid I stopped when Lucas developed superpowers; this time I couldnt make it past the giant termites. I wish I were making that sentence up. Every now and then I will indeed feel as though Im in the shoes of a character, making dramatic decisions with consequence in the film of their lives. I like the scene where Lucass estranged brother Markus gives him a call. Its legitimately dramatic and interesting, and then its immediately ruined when Lucas tries to explain that he only committed a murder because of some magic mumbo jumbo. I instantly stopped caring. The vast majority of the time spent playing Fahrenheit feels like this; it feels like playing a stupid video game.  A poorly written one that takes itself too seriously and comes across as pretentious for it. I find this quote from Cage extremely ironic and extremely telling:

During development, I discovered that this everyday facet of the characters was in fact the most interesting aspect of the gamemuch more than the supernatural side.

Why couldnt the game have just been full of moments like this, like the phone call between brothers who havent seen each other in years? Simple, relatable moments between real people with real problems.

Because of this I cant really recommend Fahrenheit, even to fans of the adventure genre, except as maybe a historical curiosity. In the end, Fahrenheit is an admittedly ambitious, but extremely flawed and ultimately unenjoyable experience. It is interesting to see some of the strides it made, and its lineage can indeed be seen in modern adventure games like The Walking Dead, but in a genre thats all about storytelling, and with a story as uneven and poorly-executed as this one, you may as well just watch a real movie instead of this cheap virtual knock-off. Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered is the pretentious poeticals of a college freshman.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
This used to be one of my favorite games ever, about ten years ago. I loved the concept of the game - you're a man who has murdered someone but who was not in control of his actions and you must find out who or what has done this to you. Meanwhile, the police (who you also play the game as) are hot on your trail. Will you figure out the mystery before the police catch up to you? It's all pretty exciting...though recently I bought the game again, however, played through it twice in a row and began to realize how completely full of plot holes it is and how certain decisions that the writer of this game chose just don't make any sense at all. Luckily, it's pretty short - after two playthroughs I've only clocked in about 16 hours.

If you're not a fan of quick time events, you definitely won't like this game, since that is all the game uses in order to proceed. There are QTE's for fighting, QTE's for talking, QTE's for damn near anything. It never really bothered me all that much, though I did start to realize that at times it can be kind of hard to focus on what's happening on the screen since your eyes are focus to a game of Simon.

Overall, I'd recommend this game simply because of it's intriguing concept, cool fight scenes and short length...though that may just be nostalgia talking


Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Well, I must say this was a experience iIl will never forget. I will start this review by stating that this is a must play if you are a fan of Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. Now, This game has everything, from a murder mystery, to the apocalypse. Fahrenheit has a incredible cast playing a incredible set of characters that you will NOT forget. The atmosphere is just breathtaking as you get deeper into the story. This is a must play 11/10. keep it up David Cage and Quantic Dream

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Commit murder
Switch roles and investigate the murder you just commited
Switch roles play a lil guitar, bang the ex girlfriend, then murder ex girlfriend
Switch roles continue to investigate your crimes
Switch roles bang your other role

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Definitely an underrated game. I started it today and played straight 11 Hours. Now forced to go sleeping because tomorrow I am going to work..but it's definitely an amazing title, I would say comparable to telltale games! ;)
The only negative thing I could say about it,  it's the excessive QTE, otherwise the rest of the game is fantastic - the story, the characters, voice acting, soundtracks. Can't wait to keep going on playing tomorrow ^^

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
This new steam version of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, is both cheap in price & with better resolution. This is also the uncensored version, which is a big plus + I would never have bought it otherwise. This is a story of - Mystery, Horror, Love, Suspense, Sex, and Violence, also great repetitive gameplay.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
PROS:

+ Story has huge potential, it's really good.
+ You decide whats gonna happen; different possible endings.
+ Very creative scenes which have lots of tension and excitement.
+ There are sex scenes :D

CONS:

+ Lots of long, boring and unreleated QTA's and minigames.
+ Very bad camera and movement controls for keyboard&mouse.
+ Mental health concept is useless and have certain bugs.
+ Some scenes are very unrealistic, it would be better if the game was more realistic instead of being fantasy-like.
+ Game is not challanging at all.
+ You cant skip cutscenes even if you replay the chapters.
+ None of my achievements unlocked despite the fact i accomplished them.

VERDICT: You must buy it when it is on discount. Great story and movie-like story telling. Very good game for its price.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
A great interactive movie. I've always been a sucker for games with a great story and reliving this classic from 2005 has been something I've wanted to do for a while and I can't tell you how happy I am now it's been rereleased. I don't want to say remastered" because if I'm entirely honest

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
-game crashes while streaming.
-game crashes when tabbed out.
-game wont load with 2+ monitors running.
-game crashes if you use the hd button
-game breaks if you change your name.

The only part of this game I found that was truly 'Remastered' was a small album, but this game is still the best dumb game I know, and I'm glad to be playing it on the PC...Poorly. Now that David Cage has gotten enough money off of porting his game he can get back to making his next big hit, Beyond 3 Souls 2.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
This Game. It started off really great and I couldn't put my controller aside. But then.. just the end. The last fifth.... The story is just so weird. It all doesn't even make really sense. All what happened before doesn't even really matter. So only get this game when you either
1. Only want to play the part before the finale.
or
2. Don't mind getting frustrated because of how bad the ending is written

Also I should mention the high amount of Quick Time Events. And let me tell you that these QTE are not even that hard. But if you need to get all QTE in that 10 minute scene perfectly correct without a long pause then sometimes they become at least annoying.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
david cage is a fraud

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
MASTERPIECE.
Don't pay attention that this is an old game.

Never knew something like Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls could exist for the PS2 or Xbox classic and released in the year 2005, that's waaay too much. I never played a game like that, and i finished it in 4-5 sittings i think.


If you are reading this, and it happens that you own it from the Humble Bundle you bought, i feel sorry for you for activating that as a +1 thing. Do not underestimate that game, install it and play.
Yes, play it. You won't regret it! Or if you don't have it, buy it! Or pirate it, whatever, i am sure one day you will actually buy the geniune version (Doesen't always have to be on Steam, you can get a second hand console copy for affordable price, even if you don't own a console), becaused you loved it so much :).

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Plot: 10/10
Carla/Sam: 10/10
Insane amount of QTEs: 0/10

Another classic I totally missed back in 2005, a dream fulfilled now. This game deserves at least a sequel, in my opinion.



Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Indigo Prophecy Remastered is a failure of the game designer.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
...David Cage is weird...

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy is an adventure game from the prestigious David Cage of Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls fame.

Despite its original release in 2005 and this remaster released  in 2015 the game still very dated. Not in a performance or visual way but in its overall feeling or vibe. You can use gamepad or mouse and keyboard, typically I don't bother to bring this subject up but other than the obvious differences. The game actually plays quite differently. As in you have direct analog control with a gamepad and should you choose to play with mouse and keyboard (as I did) You will be greeted with tank controls. Which can be a bit jarring when camera control is taken away from you and to the games credit it when it is taken away the camera seems to direct you in very helpful ways as to not get you lost but does indeed take some getting used to try and find your roots again with tank controls.

The game has this feeling of Resident Evil mixed with Eternal Darkness. Both because the general horror nature of the game and Eternal Darkness because there is a mechanic in which you must monitor your every action as it effects the mental fortitude of the player character.

You play as 1 of 3 characters. Lucas Kane, Carla Valenti, or Tyler Miles. You switch in between them after their specific sequence is over. In the beginning it feels a bit odd. As if you are being forced to take a side. As you probably know, its in the trailer, it happens in the first 5 minutes, this game is old; its not a spoiler but Lucas Kane murders a man in a bathroom. Carla and Tyler are the detectives assigned to the case. So right from the very get go you are given subtle clues as to which side you wish  take as well as have plenty of character moments. This is a David Cage game after all and every little decision means something down the line.

The main interaction with the game is walking around and finding clues or talking with people. Action sequences are either directional quicktime events, a sort fake simon says game or a test of endurance by pressing left and right a bunch. There is also a couple of sequences which I didn't find very enjoyable and tested my patience quite a bit. Without saying anything explicit, it involved moving very slowly, regulating your breath and searching for a clue relevant to the situation.

There is also some VERY strange sequences with licensed music. Specifically with the band Theory of a Deadman, a band I listened to in High School. It felt very strange, maybe a little forced but in all honesty is wasn't the first time the game started to feel a bit campy and stop taking itself so seriously.

THE GIST
Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy is a very good adventure game, though in all honesty my ending did not feel very satisfying. The story goes places I never would have guessed and in my story one character had a very dramatic change of character that felt incredibly forced as if it was just something people expected from a blockbuster film. It made zero sense and I'm completely baffled by it. However its more a of a sub plot thing even though its alluded to as otherwise.

Very old feeling adventure game but with some modern convenience. Sort of tows the line between nostalgia and something that telltale might do. Voice acting is well done but some of the sequences repeat if you ask too many questions I couldn't tell if it was a bug or just to reiterate things so you didn't forget them.

The games has some problems but the story is engaging and the characters are rather interesting so the small issues it does have can be overlooked.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
If you are into the games of Quantic Games (Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls) and missed this one, it is a must.

History: 9/10
Gameplay: 7/10
Music: 8/10

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Developer Quantic Dream, makers of Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls, made this gem too, if you played any of those before then you will know what to expect here. if you haven't then beware, this isn't the regular type of action game you know. it is more like an interactive movie where you have to make choices and do some QTE (kinda like Telltale games) to progress. I found this to be an immersive supernatural thriller, introducing Quantic Dream's unique brand of interactive movie" gameplay that they do so well.

There's an overall cinematic feel to Fahrenheit that lends a unique atmosphere to the presentation. This is evident from the very beginning

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
I played this game 2 or 3 times back when it came out and, being way too young and naive, absolutely loved it. And I must say that I still do. Well, at least about 3/4 of it. Those 3/4 are still simply amazing. It starts with what is probably the greatest opening I've ever seen in a video game, continues with you trying to figure out what happened from both sides of the fence ('cause you get to play different people's timelines) and ends... ah yes the ending...
In my opinion, the ending is more than disappointing. It's full of reeeeaaaally poor design and writing choices (  ing superpowers, flying, running along walls, suddenly appearing AIs that are trying to take over the world, an extremely unnecessary romance which pinpoints the illogical character development and a really anticlimactic finale  ) which ruin pretty much everything that you worked for the entire game. Because when you find out what's going on you just wish you hadn't.
Nevertheless, remembering the mentioned first 3/4, I still have to give this game a thumbs up. Not just because I loved it 10 years ago, but because the story still ties me to my chair. There's apparently a lot of thought behind the whole story, and maybe the ending is simply not to my taste. Maybe someone else loves it, who knows?

Despite my disappointment towards the end, I would recommend this game to pretty much everyone who is into story-based adventure games and hasn't yet played it, and if you have played it, just grab that sweet feeling of nostalgia on sale.

P.S.: If anyone of you guys actually liked the ending please comment, I'd really like to know why :P

The true story of one man's struggle against bad guitar controls as he attempts to win back his ex-girlfriend. Also, hilarious sex scenes. And weirdly out of place basketball destuction of one of your co-workers. Otherwise, an endless stream of quicktimes events and some mediocre plot involving Mayan doomsday prophesy wank.

It has its moments, but those moments come at the expense of endless dull QTE flicking around. And when I say endless, I mean ing endless. You sometimes even have to do QTE events to make your character think harder. The ?

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
This is one of those games I use to play as a kid on the PS2 multiple times not only to see the various outcomes but also because I got so much into the story. Now before people buy this thinking it is a psychological drama" will be disappointed. I went in originally expecting just that but instead got a over-the-top but engaging sci-fi thriller. It grew on me and I really came to enjoy the game for what it was worth.

Also please note if you're looking for next-gen graphics or a massive improvement of the old graphics you will also be disappointed. The graphics were never the prettiest to look at

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
I have this game on DISC; as FAHRENHEIT, of course :-) I bought it when it first came out (a few years back), it had a BIG influence on me at the time.
I find myself divided on what I am looking at playing out before me, BOX shaped paper-bag-like-heads, & I thought this was HD :-)"

-It made me think games could be deep

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Murdered a man, got super powers, got laid, got good ending. 10/10

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
This game is....interesting to say the least. I'm not going to explain the story simply for the fact that it gets pretty insane the further you go. All I will say is, it is worth the ten dollar price tag. If you can, pick up this game.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Story driven game full of mystery, quick time events and dialogue choices. You take the role of 3 of the main characters which helps you understand both sides of the story reaching to an epic finale. The only game that made me scared and have nightmares (I was young when I first played this).

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Overal rating: 10/10

Good:
+Story
+Mini games (part of the actual gameplay)
+Interaction
+Awesome narration for such old game
+Tank" movement

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Fahrenheit garnered critical acclaim when it first came out 10 years ago: its QTE events and story were something seldom seen before and more than made up for its shortcomings.
Nowadays its innovation is lost of course, and the game hasn't aged well but it is and always will be a classic.

PROS:

-a good cast of characters,all fairly interesting

-a compelling story, the beginning is especially very strong and makes you want to know what's happenening

-the various game scenes feature a nice amount of variety

-great soundtrack

-good voice acting

-nice cinematic cameras in certain scenes

CONS:

-story starts to become a bit too surreal towards the end, several different elements also seem to have been introduced just to try and make the mistery more complex

-the over reliance on QTEs is more distracting or annoying than anything else, some QTEs are also too drawn out for their own good or require inputs way too quickly

-having a limited number of retries for each QTes is annoying and feels out of place in a game like this one

-despite the HD treatment the game clearly shows its age with bland textures, fairly simple models and low res effects

-somewhat sluggish controls paired with a camera view that can sometimes get in the way

-wooden animations

-certain character interactions feel too sudden and forced just to further the plot

- a few glaring elements left in the release really made me wonder, examples are a stretched texture on one of the main char's face (in a couple of levels only, luckily), the game client quickly dropping back to windows to refresh itself when loading a level and no dpad support

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=455665544

Fahrenheit surely shows its age then, and this re-release basically just put a new coat of thin paint on it: the game's shortcomings are even more obvious in our modern gaming age and its reliance on QTEs can often annoy the player.

That said it's also easy to see why Fahrenheit was so successful and paved the way to games like Heavy Rain and Beyond; its strong story and interesting characters are still worth a playthrough after all these years and those who havn't played it back then owe it to themselves to pick up this piece of gaming history.
Just have patience if the gameplay can feel awkward and shallow, the tale this game tells is worth it.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
The qtes are painfully annoying. this game has terribad controls. yet i love it. love hate relationship!
(Story starts out amazing but kinda falls off the rails by the end. still love it)
I would only buy this if you haven't played it yet. As others have said it's not really a re master. Just higher res support and it recognized my controller. :/. This is the same price as the original on PC tho .

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
I've waited so long for this game to return to Steam. And it was well worth the wait. The controls are decent now, just like the graphics. Sure, it has a lot of QTEs, but at least they're managable. Since every decision impacts the story's outcome, multiple playthroughs are to be expected. You should definitely buy this game as it's the only of its kind on Steam!

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
It's pretty much the same as I remember playing it the first time around a couple of years back. The story is still interesting if a little crazy at times. The more adult" moments in this game are still  as bad as I remember..... HD doesnt do that side of things well I can tell you. Still a fun game/movie that I still wish had a sequel today."

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Fahrenheit: Quick Time Event Prophecy"

In Summary:
I am played this on SteamOS and it's a mixed feeling overall. You can't fault the game for being how it was designed years ago. I think Aspyr did a great job on polishing up the graphics for what they were (High Definition != High Detail!!!).  The sound seems to crackle a little in-game

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Great game with nostalgia and updated graphics. With the price of $4.99 you can't go wrong. Story is amazing and game play will have you hooked in minutes.



Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
I normally don't write reviews but for this game I can make an exception. This was an absolutely fantastic game. It was a blast to play it, I personally just interacted with every single thing and wasted more time than I should of from time to time. But it was really fun to do so. The story line was pretty good as well. It really had me thinking about how it all pieced together, especially with the choices you have to make. Over all I thoroughly enjoyed the game and I believe it is definitely worth a play or two to see what you could do differently. 10 out of 10.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Though I didn't play this game on the PS2, I really enjoyed it.

I never thought at first that I'll be engaged to this game but what I've learned while playing this game was to not judge this game by it's graphics, because the story telling was excellent.

This game feels like you're just watching a movie with the PS2 feels (with enhanced textures).
Buy it! I recommend it.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
Okayish story but bad gameplay elements. The quicktime events get really annoying after a while. Game crashed about 5 times during my 10 hour playthrough (Windows 10 64 bit). Still, it's a pretty entertaining game. It intrigued me enough to finish the storyline. I recommend getting it when it's on sale.

Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered
I played this game back in 2005 and I replayed it now.

The Good:
-Looks okay for a Game from 2005. Now with HD Textures
-The first half of the game is tense, interesting and has a nice mystery atmosphere.
- English Voice-actors are doing an awesome job
- It is a very unique experience

The Bad:
- The HD Textures can look a bit out of place
- In the second half/last third the game falls completely apart:
--The Story becomes an insane mess with deus ex machinas,
--Characters have information out of nowhere as if stuff was cut out,
--and a complete change of tone. The QTEs become absurdly long and all the really nice puzzles" from the beginning
are gone.

So what to do?
You kinda have to play this. The first half to see what you can do with David Cages Idea of Games. How interesting and working his concept is. And the second half you just have to see. It's fascinating to watch something become so absolutely stupid and over the top. It's "bad sonic fan-fiction" absurd. it's like if "Se7en" would have ended with a big DBZ Style fight between the main characters and 2 more characters who just came up in the last 5 minutes.

So buy it

Pro Gamer Manager
Warning: DO NOT BUY!

This game doesn't need a complex review, all you need to know is this: nothing matters!

As far as I can tell, winning and losing are strictly random and take nothing that you've achieved, chosen or upgraded into consideration. Your stats don't matter, your equipment doesn't matter, your living conditions don't matter, and your choices during the games don't matter.

If anything, the developer of this game has a sense of irony, encouraging players to grind and grind and grind for stats, gear, higher ranks, etc, while never achieving anything; just like real pro-gamers! Well played you sadistic s!

If you love butting heads against a random number generator or reading sub-par english then this is the game for you!

Personally, I'd just recommend getting a pair of dice and screaming ODDS" or "EVENS" at every toss..."

Pro Gamer Manager
promised multiplayer, promised live match simulations, promised tons in the old website. Now all removed and out of Early Access. Good Job.

Pro Gamer Manager
As much as it has improved since release...

1st - The English is still really, really poor; I cannot take a game like this seriously with that in mind - surely someone could have fixed the English in the game? For free, even?

Like: HOW is it still so bad?

2nd - It is still far too game-y" and gimmick-y for my taste

Pro Gamer Manager
Summary: Nice idea, released too early.

Pros:
- Fairly original concept where you manage either a team or an individual in the world of e-sports
- The cartoon-ish graphics is reminiscent of Game Dev Tycoon.


Cons:
- Very little information, particularly if you don't play Dota2 or CS.  For example, do you know what an AWPer is?  Tough luck, the game will never tell you.
- There are tactics and player stats... that have seemingly zero effect on whether you win or lose a game.  It is completely random to the point where this may as well be a clicker game.
- You can join a team but you'll never be picked (at least, I wasn't in the 3 hours I played)




Pro Gamer Manager
At first I thought the game was similar to the Game Dev Tycoon, but I was VERY wrong. It follows the same art style, but that's where it all ends.

- The game has NO TUTORIAL. Which means from the very first minutes of gameplay you have to figure out everything through trial and error.

- No GLOSSARY OF TERMS. I like to play Dota2 on occasion and I haven't the slightest inclination to ever play a MOBA for anyhting but fun. I'm not interested in ranked stuff AT ALL. Thus, I hardly no any of the terminology that most active players know and use.

- The game determines victory by coin toss. The stats and grinding in this game are pointless it doesn't affect the outcome AT ALL. This means that all the stuff you buy and learn are 100% useless.

All in all, the concept is great but the execution is crap.

Pro Gamer Manager
- Game doesn't have a tutorial
- Need to have some basic knowledge of either CSGO or Dota/LoL in order to play the game
- Seems like a game of luck more than anything tbh
- Terrible game menu designs, extremely confusing and having white font on a white background

Early Access Review

Meh out of 10!
This isn't a bad game and has the ability to be a really great and fun game. My main criticisms at the moment are that stats don't play that high of a role in the game. You winning a match is purely random. There are also times during a match you'll be asked do you want to attack the objective or help your team. At no time does it say if that was a good or bad move. It's not that it needs to state if it was a good or bad move, but there should be something like you helped your team fend off the attacker or the attacker killed you but your team mate killed them or the attacker killed everyone and destroyed the tower. The problem is just that there is not a lot of feedback of what you do right and what you do wrong.

Pro Gamer Manager
TL;DR
Released from Early Access way too early. Features and mechanics are not fleshed out, game decisions rarely matter and seem completely random, probably due to lack of any type of visual feedback which is crucial in this type of game. Great idea, but poor execution.

The Idea of the game is pretty solid. The game is split into two parts, the first you get to take control of an amatuer gamer and turn them into a pro either at FOBA (the game's version of MOBA) or FPS. The second part involves leaving your old life behind and managing a team instead.

I'm gonna break down into pro's and con's for easier reading :-

Pro's
Very unique idea

Turn-Based, the game uses an energy system that allows you to make a number of actions each day. (Can be seen as a con too, but I prefer turn-based for this type of game)

Ability to stream to make money

Runs on most toasters
Con's
Lack of feedback from most aspects of the game. This is the biggest problem with the game that has been mentioned countless times to the devs but yet nothing has been done about it.

Too random. This is somewhat tied in with the point above but outcomes of matches/tournements seem totally random, even if a similar strategy is used. This makes the game extremely tedious as you have no idea why the outcome is how it is. Stats, research, champ choices in FOBA and weapon choices in FPS don't seem to matter.

While they did add some features that the community asked for, they didn't flesh out most of it out and it just feels tacked on. Gear is a great example of this, all this does is give you a passive stat once you reach certain conditions (basically achievements). Could have easily have made a PC shop that gave us the choice on what parts to purchase to increase certain stats or what not. Moving into new, more expensive houses, have zero benefit whatsoever.
The game came out of Early Access WAY too early. Unless you want a very casual, randomized clicker I would stay clear of this game until they flesh it out properly.

Update
So it has been nearly a month since release and the game is still in Build 175, I'd just like to point out that this was the lastest build back in the 19th of April, a week prior to release. The fact that we had no new build on release, no patches whatsoever post-release and no sign of the devs in response to any of the feedback since then, leads me to believe this game will no longer be supported. :(

Pro Gamer Manager
Early Access Review

Not bad for an early access but still could use a lot more work. For example, I would like to have

-List-
1. Name your own peron *A must*
2. Chose where he/she lives *A must*
3. Chose my own role from the start * A must*
4. Chose my own team name * A must*
5. A way to train the people I recruit to my team *A must*
6. Chose my own team brand *would be nice to have*
7. A way I can steam while I am on a team *would be nice to have*
8. More detail about which person I should put as a shot caller *would be nice*
9. Chose to name people that join my team *would be nice*
10. A way to chance out champions that I have mastered. * A must*
11. A patch note up date that could tell me which champions my team should be working on. *This would add a new layer in the game*

These are just to name a few thing that could vastly improve the game.

Early Access Review

At this stage, PGM just can't be recommended. I honestly think it was released to Early Access too early.

The core concept: A single gamer growing through the rankings, creating a team and eventually winning at the highest level is a fun idea... But everything beyond that seems to be mired in bad design choices.

I know, that sounds unfair... but let's examine the first few minutes of gameplay.

Alright, I've started a game. Oh, hey, my player has been randomly generated. Name, appearance and nationality. Well, that's okay. At least I got a name I can pronounce. Okay, so we play FOBA? We FOBA player now.

Huh, this pick/ban phase is a little strange. There are three bans between two teams, and the layout makes it impossible to ban out AD champions. Huh. I guess that'll make more sense later on, when I start running the pick/ban phase myself.

Wow, these champions look a bit silly. Still, that's understandable, it'd take far too much effort to come up with a ton of unique champions. Hell, they're probably randomised too. Everything else seems to be so far.

Alright, I lost the game. It's okay, everyone loses their first game. Especially when they have to play support. But still, I'd like to know more about those champions...

Wait, where's the champion info page?


I think you can see where this is going... And it doesn't get any better. Nothing about FOBA is explained. All I can assume is that we're supposed to guess at how the game it played based on our pre-existing knowledge of MOBAs. Which is reasonable for a player like me, right?

What, for instance, is the difference between a Chaser and an Initiator, or a Soaker and a Protector? What do these choices do to alter the game? NOTHING is explained about the results of your games, either in the soloqueue stage or in the later team stages.

Ah. The team stages. Okay, bear with me, this is gonna get a bit meta.

Pro Gamer Manager is realistic.

No, really. In PGM, during what I'll call the 'bedroom' stage, you can choose to NOT play FOBA, and instead play one of three alternate games for stream potential. (FPS, Troll and Minecraft respectively). This will award you quite impressive amounts of money from your fans.

You don't get money from streaming FOBA. Apparently MOBA players are stingy.

And the best part? You can rack up way over a thousand credits in a single day while streaming, whereas you get virtually nothing from participating in the team stages... Hell, setting up advertising revenue or an eshop can result in tiny amounts of money.

So an HOUR of streaming can net you 300 credits with 500 fans via donations and subscriptions... But a shop where you can buy stuff with that same money, and have it go to the same place? That generates 100 credits a WEEK with a thousand fans. And this is at the stage where you can no longer stream for some bizzare, non-existant reason, thus cutting off your only reliable source of credits!

The funny thing is, that sounds realistic. A lot of the popular streamers (IE: The ones making the serious bank) AREN'T esports professionals.

So... The moral of Pro Gamer Manager is... Don't be a Pro Gamer? Just stream. Then you won't go bankrupt.


This game needs so much redesigning is a little bit sad. Here's hoping Early Access works. I'd quite like a good game based around this concept.

Pro Gamer Manager
I realized i didnt go too deep into manager mode but its not worth my energy on this crappy game bottom line is dont buy this game and buy Game Dev Tycoon Instead its a much more satisfying game to play.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Version

-Nothing feels like progresss

-Practically nothing to research makes me feel like im never making real progress

-pointless and random events that dont effect gameplay

-Overall score dosent mean anything in 1v1 duels sometimes

-Money is really only used for paying monthly expenses and pointless boosts

-No Trading Cards

-No Achivements

-No tutorial is just plain laziness and a tutorial really is needed for a game with so many stats to put points into.

-Everything is decided by  random number generator instead of a result of your decisions or skills
_______________________________________________

When i bought this game i thought it was going to be similair to a game called Game Dev Tycoon because of the look of te core gameplay. This was only kinda true.

The first big problem with this game is the lack of things to actually unlock through research. In game dev tycoon you not only had over 100 game genre's to unlock and playwith but also Marketing strategies , game engines , graphics , physics engines multiplayer and much more features to add to your game. In Pro game manager there were very few things to actually research. in career mode i think i research like two things before getting the option to switch to career mode. In career mode theres like only 4 or 5 things there too except they make the prices to get them ridciolous when it dosent feel like they actually do much.

My next issue with the game is its random events and popups. 2 in particular i remember is Injuring my hand so my reflexes were damaged and a new headset that came out. You cannot use your money to buy new equipment so why bother telling me about a ing headset that dosent exist for me to buy? I honestly think the whole reflexes thing is t too cause i never see a difference even when they game says they are improved. When you had popups like that in game dev tycoon it was the result of your decisions. for example one decision is To release your old game engines to the public or to sell them. is you sell it you make money but lose fans if you give it away you gain fans. its that ing simple and it makes game dev tycoon much better than this garbage.

Next is THERE IS NO TUTORIAL? WHYYYYYYYYYYY. it makes no sense to not have a tutorial its jsut plain lazy. I have no idea what stats are good for what freaking role because it has no  tutorial. Game dev tycoon has a great tutorial it tells you how to mkae reports to figure out what people care about more in which game genres and which game platforms do better with certain genres. Theres too many things to put your stats into to not have a tutorial. You just have to guess untll you start doing better in games.

Money is also pointless in this game. You have nothing to spend it on except for upgrades that dont really do anything or feel like they are worth it. Buying a house is pointless all it does is increase your monthly expensese like wtf is the point of that? It dosent help you dosent add anything theres no point at all nothing beneficial of buying a better house.

Even in the Manager mode everythings feels like a waste of time. i see my fans go up but your fans going up dont impact anything except money which besdies needing it for paying your players wages. In Game dev tycoon when you got more popular you got invited to interviews and even to E3 eventually. Something like that would make my fans seem they are better than just me getting more money.

With these things in mind in general i just never feel like im making progress in my 6 hours of playing. i see numbers go up and sometimes i win sometime i dont.  Even when you win championships you just get money its really lackluster to see nothing come out of my effort. In Game dev tycoon when you get popular you get newspaper articles magaznine articles , interviews and E3 showcasings and all that feels like progression because its a gradual rise to beign a big game developer. in This game everything feels the same nothing feels like the next level.

No achievements , No trading cards they just dont give a .

Pro Gamer Manager
Hello, this is my first serious review.

I'm an avid gamer and dedicate most of my free time to gaming and checking out titles that could be cool and fun.

Pro Gamer Manager did have an appeal at the start... same Game Dev Tycoon art... managing your own eSports team... so I figured the mechanics would be similar, thus, making it a fun and entertaining experience. I was wrong.

I can see the devs tried to make an entertaining title, but the formula does not work. In MANAGING GAMES you want to see that the decisions and actions you take, affect the outcome of the matches whether in a good or bad way. But when you play Pro Gamer Manager, the decisions you make, affect the outcomes in a really vague way or they don't affect it in any way and are unable to change its outcome.

You never know or are told (at least give us a hint of how the mechanics work for god's sake) how things are going to affect your results. You can pickup styles and different tactics but they are really vague on how you should use them and really basic. They try to make it simple but making it that way just takes away the whole experience of being a Professional eSports team.

Even if the devs assume you're used and knowledged about MOBA or FPS games, it's difficult to figure out what to do in every situation, even with Trial and Error. I might be wrong if I say that the decisions you take as a manager or a player DO NOT affect the outcome BUT; when I played Pro Gamer Manager I always felt that way and, believe me, IT IS NOT A PLEASANT FEELING.

I really tried to find something redeeming and have fun with Pro Gamer Manager, but either I haven't tried hard enough (prob not) or the game in itself isn't fun, probably the latter.

It also has some bugs that are not gamebreaking or really important, but they are really simple and basic bugs that kind of break the experience too (16-15 as a valid victory result on a FPS match even if it's not meant to be CS, can't click too fast on incoming messages or they will delete themselves).

Pro Gamer Manager defeats its own purpose as a game and a managing game, such potential wasted because of a bad execution.

I wouldn't recommend to buy this game in its current state, it's basically not fun for me and I've requested a refund.

Pro Gamer Manager
Early Access Review

This game suffers from the same issue Game Dev Tycoon does: lack of meaningful feedback.

Sure, I feel like i MAY be making meaningful decisions, but in the end they all are just random guesses, as the game does not let you know HOW you decisions affect anything at all. It just becomes a game of random rock paper scissors, where you don't even know what the opponent threw. Unless they fix this issues, this game is a huge miss

Pro Gamer Manager
I find this game really boring. The game seems to not give me a real choice in what my player does.

Pro Gamer Manager
The game has potential if they give it some meat rather than leave it in it's current state as some RNG, souless shell disguised as a strategy management game.

I read the reviews and most advised me not to buy this game.
I ignored that advice and while I don't regret buying the game, I totally understand why it's pretty much a waste of time.

In it's current state, you may as well roll a dice for everything. Most of your leveling up, honing of ingame skills and upgrades seem to have extremely little to no effect on anything.
Fix this and this game will go from a C+ to a B+.

The only reason why I don't regret buying the game is because I have a smidge of hope that the developers will update the mechanics of this game to actually mean something.

I cannot recommend it as is, however, by lacking any of the things we were expecting, it does show us that with the right things added, this could be a great little indie game.a

Pro Gamer Manager
Career:

This game feels like it is rolling dice for everything you do. The two games you can go pro in are team based, yet it only gives you real" feedback on your player. Otherwise it lists the top players of the game. It literally tells you nothing about your teammates. The tournaments are absolutely random

Pro Gamer Manager
Amazing Idea. However...

Boring after a while

Random. Stats don't matter

Player never plays for team in Career mode

Thown into an initial league where all teams overpower you with ease

Early Access Review

This game definitely has a ton of potential ! I would highly recommend and will edit as soon as changes are made since i can easily see how this could be incredibly fun , but for now , ill have to say this is pretty meh , and limit frustrating since each time you discover a part of the game or something you like , the game becomes somewhat unclear as to what you're doing wrong and what you're doing right , most of the time when i get good comments in game i will then lose all my games , and when all i hear about are other teams or player , it will feel like i was just underated. higher overall players on your team doesn't seem to do much when it comes to winning ( i won everygame with 4 x 50 overall members on my team , then upgraded to 4 new better players and started losing ). Also sometimes it feels like whatever strategy you're using has no impact on the way games go. Early in the game there is a development phase for your main character which seems like it didn't even matter later in the game. The easiest way to make money in this game is in the first half which is kinda weird since i dont think streaming the game should pay more than having an actual pro team ! A lot of minor bugs are also present which is understandable due to the very early stage of this game ( for example I was number one on the solo queue ladder and when i looked up at bjergsenx it would also tell me he is number one ). Most of the menus dont have back buttons which means you have to make decisions that can't be changed  after you change screen. The overall for other characters than yourself also dont seem to change which is sad when you spend time training and stuff. I will definitely be back to try this game in a while to see if it was fixed since I had fun , but otherwise this is pretty much unplayable. Hope to see you guys push the great ideas you had further and do some epic polishing on this amazing project of yours !

Sincerely
Just a Hobo

Been playing it since it first came to early acess. If the game keeps getting developed then i would say get it if you enjoy manegment games. In its current stated it is definetly unfinished. Many things that were promised were never delivered, but its still decent once you get past that it feels like the hole game is a RNG (which it very well may be). In addition there is no clear guidance as to what does what or what stats might effect what things.... All in all i am disapoionted that they rushed the realese and will still keep following it, but without more work its not as much a game as it is a beta/alpha with a great concept.

Pro Gamer Manager
Next to no depth, choices dont feel like they influence much (some sort of percentage display after making choices would be nice). Upgrades dont feel like they do anything either. Nothing really to progress to, got rank 1 and nothing changes really. Would be an ok game if it was free, but defs not worth paying for.

Pro Gamer Manager
Promised far too many things that were just not delivered on.  Even worse is now most of these planned" features are now removed from their website and game description.  Game outcomes seem completely based on rng.

This is still very much an early access with many key features not working or not fleshed out.

Do not buy."

Pro Gamer Manager
Tried to play it, no tutorial and decisions seemed to matter very little.  Poor player feedback, too many elements introduced at once, several of which appear to make no difference.  Waste of an opportunity.

Early Access Review

So I won a copy of this game on Letigress' stream. My understanding is that she (the streamer) had teamed up with the developers to promote the game. Which was pretty cool.
So I played the copy I won for a couple hours. Is it interesting? Heck yeah! Is it fun? Well, depends on what you're lookng for. Right now it kind of plays like an idle game that you can't be idle for. You start a game or start watching a pro to increase stats, and just wait. Then the growth doesn't seem to have a huge impact on your playing. And things seem very vague right now. Champions don't have names, just graphics. You don't do the draft, just make some broad strategical calls, and the computer takes over.
Do I think you should buy this game? Sure. It is worth $10 in my opinion, if you have money to try out small indie games. If you're looking for 20 hours of content, this game is NOT for you. It could be eventually, but it needs more development.
I want:
Champion names
Ability to draft
More customization of my character
Clear growth in character with all the stats
More options than just play or watch
A more interesting early game
Ability to get in game money and customize room
More depth! Right now this feels generic at times
Great idea, guys! Keep at the game. It could be special. :)

It's a Trap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Don't buy this a game!!!     This game is a BILK, a  LIE    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




If i am not too slow to comfrim this a just a piece of garbage, I would have got my refund already

There is some state point to upgrade you or your team, but i found out thats effect nothing. The game just totally random

There is no mechanism in this game, the entire game just shell, and nothing in side.

Early Access Review

Ok, I, giving a positive to keep balance flow, altough I agree with some fact from negative reviews.
Pro Gamer Manager have potentional to be favorite casual game, if it gets proper polishing and finishing touches.
One of the reasons Im giving it temporary positive is that developers looks very friendly with community, ready to listen any suggestion or proposal, so Im pretty sure they will do a great thing with this game.

Just an idea that you play as pro gamer is epic! It looks like a Game Dev Tycoon, but its so much more...

At this time  pro's and con's arent much of a use, since game is clearly not finished, Il point some out and some of my playing.
I will mark it as spoiler so think twice before you read it :)

Pro's
+ Original idea and great refreshemnt in casual gaming
+ Big potential to be very addicting game

Con's ( at this time)
- Bad battle system
- Lack of events
- After moving in to gaming room you loose track of your skills and ability progression
- You cant see details of enemy team (players and their skills)
- First part of the game jumps out from the second

At this time battles looks like they are win/lose randomly. Are you sure? Yes! after 4 hours of playing, I used cheat to boost my stats and hire best players in the world, and you cant beat  amateur teams, yes I also played 6  constant seasons to have high team harmony, and yes you cant progress in to the next league.

Suggestions to developers:
+ A character creation (at least name, age and nationality is a MUST)
+ More controls managing your abilities and skills
+ Practicing matches ?
+ More random rewarding events

I do hope it will get it's full potentional, and I will fu**ing love this game.

Pro Gamer Manager
Lots of people have given lists of Pro's and Con's so I'll skip that side of things and keep it simple.

I bought this game around 6 months ago when I heard about it and it was difficult to play but I seen it had a ton of potential so I was happy to wait for release, sadly it seems either the developers didn't have the time and money or the skill to realize this game's potential.

The main issue with this game is a total lack of player feedback, you make tactical choices before each match but the game doesn't tell you what you did right and what you did wrong, you have a ton of stats but the game doesn't tell you what each stat does, there are a ton of heroes to play in the MOBA mode but there is almost no information about the heroes, just a basic thumbnail, whether they are a support, ADC, Jungler and whatever and whether they are Utility, Healer, Burst and such but no other information at all.

If this game gave some worthwhile feedback to the player and went a little more in depth with the heroes instead of just a name, thumbnail and the bare basic info then I could see it being really good, but unless that happens.. it's not worth buying at all.

Hopefully a developer with more experience takes the idea of this game and makes something better because a game about being a manager of a Pro gaming house and/or being a professional gamer could be awesome, sadly.. this game isn't.

TL;DR version: No depth, no player feedback, no skill involved, just RNG, not worth buying.

Pro Gamer Manager
Probably more like a satire or a funny game, but it's not worth its price. At all.

Pro Gamer Manager
Pro:
+ Interesting idea
+ Career mode and Manager mode where from Career mode you can retire your character and proceed to Manager mode
+ Player can choose MOBA (in this game it's named FOBA) or FPS path

Neutral:
/ Game Dev Tycoon graphic style

Cons:
- Feels like unfinished game and rushed to be out from early access
- Some features are not responding (one of it is Tournament)
- Lack of content
- Feels like all matches based on RNG instead of stats
- Little to none tutorial
- Repetitive gameplay

If only the developer address the cons, I totally would recommend this game.

Pro Gamer Manager
Everything is just random, doesn't really matter what you do. Just grind and you'll eventually win...

Early Access Review

UPDATE: 4/15/2016

Okay, if you loved Game Dev Tycoon then you will see this game has SO MUCH potential it isn't even funny. GET IT WHILE IT'S ON SALE!

Now that that's out of the way there are still some gapeing holes, and I'm not talking about the kind your team leaves during a MOBA match. Mostly polishing, some gameplay issues, but everything overall is pretty neat for an early release.
(WHY we still call games early release" when EVERY GAME ON STEAM these days is an early release baffles me) but I digress.

Why you should buy it:
Somewhat original concept... create the gamer you've always wanted to be not the n00b you actually are.
Upgrades

Pro Gamer Manager
Played it until about Day 60 or so. I was a big fan of Game Dev Tycoon and this seemed very similar to it so I thought I'd give it a go.

The biggest hangup I have with this game is that no matter what, nothing you do seems to have any affect on the outcome of the battle (I only played FPS player and not manager). After I unlocked streaming and got it up to about level
10, all options of genres to stream vanished except for FOBA and FPS.

I bought both upgrades for the houses and they did absolutely nothing. I thought you'd get some better hardware or it would be easier to stay in high spirits and get benefits to gaming, anything really but no, nothing.

I can't seem to get passed star level 95. I don't know if that's working as intended but you go into the league tournaments and you'll often get beaten by guys that are half of that of your level.

You can upgrade your hardware but the last one you need platinum gaming status and it seems pretty damn hard to achieve. Simply for the reason that you can win 1 map and then lose 10 in a row no matter what you do.

You have a rage bar that fills up whenever you lose a ranked match but I have had it up to full and down to nothing and I honestly can say that I see no difference in the outcome battles with this either.

It is certainly in need of some tutorials. I see other people say that there is a not of Counter Strike terminology in here and never having played it, I had to look up some of what they're talking about to get an understanding of what skill is supposed to do what.

I think if they ironed out the few bugs that existed and made things less random or maybe give some kind of explanation as to what is doing what, it could turn out to be a really fun game. In its current state though, I can't recommend it.

Pro Gamer Manager
I went from #303 to #-5 in 1 game, after a long time pointlessly grinding something that's gonna make no difference anyway.

Riddled with bugs, stats don't matter, experience doesn't matter.

Stay away from this one

Pro Gamer Manager
This is not a game. This is a random generator where you press some buttons that doesn't do anything other than spitting out random numbers. you dont have any influence on the matches or anything else in the game.

Stay Away from this game""

Pro Gamer Manager
ok, ive fed a good few hours into this so I'm pretty clear on what im talking about. Its pretty clear that there is little to no impact of skills and weapon familiarity on ranked games. This appears completely random. There is no feedback whatsoever to give an indication on what tactics to take following a disaster or a flawless win.

Your team WILL NOT PLAY YOU despite having three times the fans and skill levels as the team capatain. There is no real bonus with enhanced gear. I have NEVER asked for a refund on a game and I have Rebirth but this...this...makes me wonder.

Pro Gamer Manager
UPDATE FOR FULL RELEASEThe game is now out of Early Access. Prematurely, as you'll find out.

Many of the points below - written for an early version of the game - still stand.
There is little to no feedback, not even to mention explanation. If you are not aware of the terminology in League of Legends or Counter-Strike, you will have a hard time understanding without researching it yourself.

The game is a big grind for stats which ultimatively do not seem to matter. The results (winning, losing, stats) seem incredibly random, even if your team is half of the world top 10 players.

I had a lot of hope for the game when it was in Early Access. I do think this was released way too early and the premature release hurt the game in the end.

If you find this review unhelpful, I invite you to tell me why in the comments. Will do my best to explain my verdict and would happily take feedback.

##################################################
Original Early Access review below: ##################################################


I was thinking about giving this the thumbs up or not. I decided that I should go by what the game is right now, not what it can be, promised to be nor I hope it turns out to be. The game shows a lot of promise but what's in there right now has too little long time motivation for me to recommend it. (the ammount of hours played is a bit skewed in my case as I left the game open for a night and work day).


The game assumes you know a lot of terminology of League of Legends (since that is what the game is mainly taylored towards right now) and doesn't explain any of it.
I've played a bit of MOBAs but never heard of an ADC in my life, because I haven't played LoL. Friends with multiple hundres (sometimes thousands) of hours of playtime in DOTA 2 and Heroes of the Storm didn't know either.

The game generally doesn't explain itself too well right now. There is no tutorial yet and your performance in the game is not explained.
You select a role (Top Lane, Mid Lane, Jungler, Support, ADC) and a chamption according to your role. There are types for champions (e.g. Sustain, Healer, Chaser, Utility, Tank, etc) but they are not explained.
There are mutliple champions for each type but you are not told what differs Healer 1 from Healer 2, except for the Tier" it is listed in

Pro Gamer Manager
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
This game teaches you NOTHING, and why would you need to? Everything is useless! Half the time the game plays itself, and when it doesn't you're trying to see what will work WHEN EVERYTHING IS LUCK BASED! And Manager mode, its even more confusing than the Career mode! You're never told anything, and you don't tell us how to make money!
Some pros of this game: It gives you lots of choices at the start, letting you learn how to play the game easily. Sadly, this doesn't help the game because EVERYTHING IS LUCK BASED! It's a good idea, but it's not made well that you don't focus on the idea. The time where you choose your personality is great, and if other games (well made games) had this they would be fun.
But still: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! THIS IS A TERRIBLE MADE GAME!

Pro Gamer Manager
I love the game, but there is a bug to where I cannot start a career in which I have nearly 100 days in.

Pro Gamer Manager
Great game, but I feel that it could be better. A way I would improve it is adding some sort of story to the game that varies based on your performances in a team, I would find it more entertaining having a sort of story and goals you could achieve that is different from just getting a house/joining a team. Another way would be to add some sort of shop to say buy a mouse, keyboard, monitor etc. They could be used to improve stats inside the game. Also the money aspect is broken, you get way too money for the amount of streaming you do in the game. Overall this game has great potential but is not worth getting if not on discount.

Pro Gamer Manager
In alot of scenarios I find you lack the option to back out,

On many occasion I have played 1v1 tourneyments or World Class Championships, if I make it out of the first round with a  win, but lose in Semis, if the team that beat me wins, I get the first place rewards,

In random occasions the desc for things have FOBA and not FPS text

Just random glitches, refreshing the Free Agents crashes the game, Rejecting players causes all players in that slot rejected til restarted

AND FINALLY, When creating a new character, it keeps the same OVR points in profile, but doesnt count them, leaving spaces filled that can be counted.

All in all a awesome concept and cant wait for the future, but try to delve off from random to skill.
Less Grinding more Playing


Pro Gamer Manager
Put quite simply, as it is right now Pro Gamer Manager is really bad. Like, absolutely terrible and wouldn't want to spend my money on it had I known how crap it would be kinda bad.

To be fair it's an alpha, and that is to be expected.

So far I've only played Career mode for FOBA and the game tells you NOTHING. There is no tutorial or any feedback of any kind. Wanna know how each stat afffects your gamer's ability to win? Too bad! Developer says Fk you! Want to know what kind of play style works best against a certain kind of team comp? Too bad! Figure it out for yourself - which I can understand and would be a normal thing in a game like this... if not for how it seems completely random at times.

In order to consistently win I had to grind the hell out of my gamer's stats and that was when I was only in Silver, which, by the way, I could not progress out of - not because my gamer was bad(His rating was 84) - but because I ran into a glitch. I could not get to gold and I was in the top 10,000 in the world at one point.

My gamer was also on the top team in the league and I was replaced by a complete scrub who had 40 less rating than I did. This was near the end of the season too which made me extremely salty. I didn't even show up on the team's roster, despite still actually being on the team - which makes me think it was another game-breaking glitch. My team went from thinking I was a good player" to completely hating me and wanting to replace me for no reason. I carried their worthless hides on my back for the entire season and they want to replace their star player? Get real.This happened on such consistant basis too- the only fix being leaving the team and finding a new one.

So why am I recommending it then? Well despite all of its glaringly obvious flaws

Pro Gamer Manager
I really am a sucker for these sorts of management games, so when I saw this game I thought Hey

Early Access Review

as much as i want to tell people to go out and buy this game, i cant. Everything in this game is RNG and has no actual value. litterally nothing in this game has a value modifier (sp?) and is completely based off rng. You want an aggressive team, go ahead play a season of aggressive build style and still get reports about your team is not being aggressive. you want your team to do troll picks, sure go ahead, you'll still get msgs saying your team doesnt like the current practice set up and wants troll picks. pratically everything on the finance/staff members side is a waste. not a single one gives you  more income (or value) than their weekly salary. your scout is worthless and wont give a good pick to save his life. on top of that, you must fire the role you're trying to replace, just to view potential replacements (ie that adc you want to replace, gotta fire him, just to view the crap list of people available or to sign the 5th support that your scout found). the teams stats dont have any value to them. despite putting 5hrs into this game, i cannot find anything that i enjoy about it (and i enjoy progressional building games like game dev tycoon). you cant see how much everything cost until its too late and you cannot fire any staff members (despite them being completely worthless). no back button, so even if you're investigating something, its already too late (ie your scout got back with a potential team member, gotta kick the person you want to replace, as you cannot view his recruitment page again, despite having no idea what role your scount found). money: your source of income before you create a team is great (and a bit OP), but once you expand to a full on team, you better pray to RNG that the famous hockey player wanted lessons from your adc, as there is ZERO source of income (besides placing in the top three at the end of each tournament). dont waste your time building your player (or his toons) into the top solo Q player, as it will be worthless once you create a team.

random other nitpicks: no audio control, so you will be forced to listen to the Sims build mode music until you take your headphones off. spelling, its  (i know mine isnt great either, but im just ranting and not producing a game). one save file, at least give us three so we can save different variations, when we're experimenting.

I have high hopes for this game, but even at a discounted rate, its not worth it atm.

Pro Gamer Manager
My opinion is that this game should still be in alpha. Not even beta.

It is a game that still needs development.

Lots of unfinished things: graphics not appearing as they should, finishing a 1v1 tournament on 3rd place will sometimes give you the 1st place equivalent prizes, playing games in tournaments is extremely random  and many many other things

It is a nice game but an unpolished one.

To start out, I really like the game concept and would really love to continue playing it in my down time! I found out about this game through Letigress's Stream[www.twitch.tv] and thought I would try it out.

Things I Would Like Added
Ability to adjust sound levels
Create my own character and name
Leaderboards across steam friends/global
Customizeable/Randomized room because it is identical everywhere
More of a background on FOBA"

Pro Gamer Manager
Game is . Seems like most is random. Great concept, however the game is not up to expectations.

Pro Gamer Manager
This game is simply not finished, as of now - 2016-04-30 early access, and because of that this game has bugs and is not that fun although it's a bit better than when I played this without steam a few months ago.

Pro Gamer Manager
Needs a lot of work. It's got great promise but I just can't recommend the game yet.

Pro Gamer Manager
an excellent game,but needs more update

Pro Gamer Manager
Complete rubbish, the english is awful, the game play is horrible, there doesnt appear to be any discernable difference from having no skills maxed to have everything maxed...

Complete waste of time.

Pro Gamer Manager
The fact this is being released now is a disgrace. It's a neat idea, but it's neither a good idle game, nor a good clicker especially seeing as it wasn't even supposed to be either of the two.

If you want to waste your time play some free flash game instead of this 12$ (!!!) waste of effort.

Raptor Claw, you started with a cool idea and some support from the community, and you've just effectively thrown that into the toilet.

It's alright.

The game's good, but pretty rough on people that choose not to spend any money. Some tips:
1.) Finish the first Saga and get a free Pegasus pet. It has an aoe summon attack that cures poison.
2.) Make a human first and that way you'll get a free elf and giant from talking to the elf and giant leaders and aligning with them (you can change alignment once per day).
3.) Events usually give you cash shop items so be sure to bank in on those.

although it says i have only 425 hours in this game that is far from the truth, i found this game on its website and then i went and found it on steam. Now although i love this game i will try to not be bias. so to begin, i will start the pros and then go to the cons
PROS:
1.this game is massive, as of Thursday October 30, 2014. there is 16 generation story lines . then there is two episodic story lines , saga and iria, with iria on its 4th episode.
2. you can do almost anything in this game. I always ask people  tell me what you'd like to do in the game." and I normally get stuff like "trading

Mabinogi
My name is Trigger, of the Ruairi server.  I'm well known in the community, even across servers, for effectively codifying the proper use of Mabinogi's Magic skill set with a comprehensive guide that underwent many, many revisions over the years (and which is still referenced and quoted to this day).  I played for over six years and sank countless thousands of dollars into the game.  Mabinogi is my most-played video game of all time by a nigh-incomprehensibly-large margin (just not on the Steam version, which will explain the lack of hours logged here).  I've shrugged off changes that have made similarly-tenured players quit.  And as a relatively respected player whose advice carried significant weight with newbies and old-timers alike, I have one thing to say.

Do not play Mabinogi.

Mabinogi's combat was originally, at its core, a rock-paper-scissors system.  Normal melee strikes are deflected by the Defense skill.  Defense can be broken with Smash.  Smash is not as fast as normal melee and will always be trumped by it.  This, combined with many different enemy AI patterns, required players to be able to read the enemy's movements well in advance and react with appropriate timing, because all attacks carry some degree of stun and enough consecutive attacks will knock a player backward.  In the original release and for some time thereafter, tanking was completely non-viable because player health was vastly outclassed by enemy damage potential, requiring every combatant to be adept at reading and reacting to enemy movements and encouraging the then-commonly-espoused battle philosophy of don't get hit".

Dude I used to love this game, and so did so many others. Like I had some of the happiest times in my life through this game; I started this game with 2 of my real life friends, found an amazingly fun guild, and made an amazing friend (though I'm sadly no longer in contact with them) as well as other great friends. Now, sorry for this giant rant, hopefully you read it. I seriously loved this game.

I went and replayed the game about a year ago, hoping to relive my happy times, and to some extent I did, but to a very small extent. I went and played on the Mari server, the once biggest server in the game. I found ALOT of fun through Martial Arts (it was boxing basically), and it was flashy, and the enemy AI (The AI used to be really smart and worked very well, but it was never upgraded to combat skills like Alchemy and Dual Guns, so it became really stupid when you used these skills) was still functional using it, but besides that, everything that made the game crumbled. There was so many damn skills, each one rendering older skills useless. Magic to a point and archery more or less were replaced with Alchemy. Then puppeting came and replaced Alchemy's biggest selling point; having a golem. Then came Dual Guns to completely replace archery (like so few people used archery, why not go and fix it?). The last thing that was added before I gave up on the game was Ninjistu, and I just gave up. It was so silly and extremely anime (yes the game's korean, but it had taste and a really nice art style; not just full fledge kawaii desu Naruto rip-off crap), and I can only imagine this replaced another skill class.


That wasn't the only thing that made me leave, there's a bit more. I could deal with a load of crap skills as long as I had some fun ones, but each new event was complete crap. Back in the old days events were so much freakin fun! Like there was a skiing event, a cotton candy sheep event, and a water balloon party event! (just to list a few). Aw man these were all great and alot of fun to me! But when I returned, it was just non-stop re-hashing of the dragon boating event (where you go down a river in a raft, fight some mobs, get a reward, rinse and repeat) and the Tara event (a japanese style event with a dart throwing mini game and a test-your-strength hammer game.) The Tara event was fun when it released, but it REALLY overstayed its welcome through it being rehashed every other week.

The economy also went to complete crap. Current day rare items would cost about 10 million+. You wanted a guitar? Better be rich, because you're gonna have to dish out about 20 million. Not only that, all old rare items went to complete commodity. Like I had a rare Leprechaun outfit that was super rare when it first came out; I was one of the maybe 20-ish people who had it on Mari, but when I rejoind they were barely even worth 100k (this is basically normal spending money in player markets). Due to Nexon just re-hashing old content, extremely rare items became to the point of being only uncommon to just somewhat rare. I used to be so proud of alot of my rare clothing; since alot of the game was about fashion and being distinct and being yourself, I felt proud walking about with some really cool n rare clothes, but now that satisfaction I had was quickly diminished.

Lastly what made me give up on the game was how lonesome and empty the servers became and how crap the once thriving and amazing community became. I played in about 2009 to 2010, and when I did, I could basically just walk up to anybody and either join in their conversation or start one, and befriend them. It wouldn't be some weird akward conversation either, people would just talk and be friends with eachother. The game used to be a huge party. You could walk down dunbarton (basically the games main town) on almost any server and find naked people running about PvPing one another, and then just down the road find a group of people participating in Elves vs. Giants war. It was great! But when I went back, the place was completely lonely. Nobody talked, there were barely any live guilds anymore, most guilds being dead, and nobody Pvp'd anymore. For the most part, the game was just deserted.

Sorry about this huge dang rant man. I just really love this game. It was really important to me. I made alot of great friends through the game, some that I'm sadly no longer in contact with, but I still have the fond memories. This game was amazing in every aspect in its prime; great combat, great community, and great events; there was something to do for everyone, and the game truly was a fantasy life. You wanna go and do something? Go do it! You can! Everything felt important and was satisfying. Even just fishing and gathering potatoes and such was fun, because you always had a friend while doing it or just someone to talk to, and a reason to doing so. I'm always hoping to find another amazing game like this; a game that'd make me excited to wake up and see what's going on, and just a sheer joy to play. I keep hearing about FF:XIV, and here's hoping that I'll be able to enjoy it like mabinogi.

Once again, sorry for this giant rant; I'm just super passionate about this game. This game meant alot to me.

Mabinogi
*Edited and revised for further clarity and information*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An interesting mmorpg. Having played many mmorpgs before, mabinogi is a favorite due to its dynamic combat system. There are infinite battle combo possibilities as the gameplay involves fast paced action with a unique do-it-yourself strategy allowing almost limitless freedom to choose how you play. While the game features talents (i.e warrior) like most mmorpg's, it doesn't limit what you can and can't do allowing you to choose what skills from any tab (melee, magic...etc) you want to train giving a really unique gameplay individual to the player rather than restriction, emphasizing complete freedom in how you like to play.

Another appealing factor for mabinogi is the anime-style graphics rather than the traditional realism based graphics that give the game a relaxed outlook rather than a serious tone.

Having played this game for several years and watching it change and grow i can point out a few perspectives on its pro's and cons:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pro's:

- Freedom to play however you want, as whoever you want to be with no linear path set out for you to take. There are no penalties for doing what you want or neglecting to do certain things if you don't want to. This allows a player to choose what to do, whether it be fighting and training, crafting and trading, or even just socializing.

- Active and alive community full of players from veterans to newbies; never a dull moment no matter where you go (Alexina is one of the most active servers in-game and Dunbarton is one of the most active towns in-game).

- Immersive and involving storyline that spans out several chapters, events, and in-game years that pit you in the midst of the struggle as one of the milletians" involved in the conflict between the gods and various factions in Erinn.

- Constant updates and add-ons to the game; whether in the form of a new storyline chapter or the many year-round events

I am ghoultrooper of Alexina lvl 11k. I've been with Mabinogi for a long time playing on and off since 2008. i wanted to input my views of the game so here we go:

The Pros~
+ Unique Rock paper Scissor style of combat *
+ Infinity customization in coloring anything from the soles of your shoes and outfits to the hilts of your weapons
+ Newbie Friendly Beginner System ( helps you somewhat catchup to the current players )
+ Unique Rebirth Leveling up System which has no LvL Cap ( main reason i haven't ever permanently quit )
+ Events come by frequently and so do content updates every few months
+ Many Crafting Skills
+ Abundant amounts of daily minigames/quests that you can do
+ Nice Story
+ Playerbase is Mostly Friendly.

The Cons...
- Nexon.
- Has a somewhat steep learning curve.
- Reforges are from cash shop only but are obtainable from other players via in game gold.
-* The unique combat system slowly dies off as you gain High Dmg. you will end up using just the efficient clearing methods ( although that can be said for most of any game )
-~ Inventory can become an Issue if you're a hoarder like i am. Pets are almost a must buy utility BUT you are able to buy pets from other players with gold also so...
-in my honest opinion, at least half of the NA server is lazy af. so many  people just afk and don't run anything ( missions, dungeons, etc. )
- 7  channels but everyone clogs up on channel 1 and channel 2 through 7 are almost like ghost towns zzzz....
- Durability.

Neutral
**- Despite what many people say, Nothing in Mabinogi is actually Pay2Win. Everything is obtainable through grind or luck. things in the Cash Shop are more of Convenience/ Fashion Items.

Conclusion.
I find the game fun to play every now and then but once you've got your gear and many of the skills done there isn't much left to do. the Dye customizations are great!
I Recomend any new players to find a nice guild or just a nice veteran player in general to help guide you through. guilds are generally very nice in Mabi overall and will help you often.

Mabinogi
I can only begin to try to describe the countless good and bad things about this game, but the bad far outweigh any of the good. Detailed other reasons are noted after the 3 short lists of key factors. Note: I have clocked in several thousand hours over the 5+ years I have played this; before it was available on steam naturally.) Looking back, it was not worth any of the time or money invested.

The Good: Unique and interesting way of leveling up" as your power is based on skill levels rather than actual levels (a unique system known as rebirthing is  the fastest way to gain the points to rank up skills).  Combat system Is complex and strategic

Mabinogi
Mabinogi is the best yet the worst game out there in the MMORPG genre. There are quite literally infinite possibilities in gameplay, but most people spend their days online with friends. The social aspect of this game is honestly it's best trait; Mabinogi holds home to one of the most friendly and active communities I've ever seen. Sure, it sounds great and all, but it's a serious time consumer. Personally, as a gamer, I want to play as many games as I can for story, gameplay, etc. Mabinogi offers this, but it never stops and consumes all of your time and money. I will never regret playing Mabinogi; it was the best time of my life, but I am also happy with leaving the game after five years of service with the hated and loved Nexon Inc.

Mabinogi
Played this game for 8 years.
No other online game has got into me more than this one.
I would not recommend it for its combat, its p2w cash-shop or its overall content.

But if you want a game to talk with people and to live adventures.
You won't find a more social game anywhere.


The skill system is interessing, the Story has its up and downs, the music is amazing and the npc are memorable.

But what really give mabinogi its charm is how there is no ''zones''.
No matter your lvl, everyone hang out in the same cities.
You meet and talk with the same people every day. You get to know your server.
This game was for me exactly what everyone is hoping of a future SAO mmo.


I've meet people here that I wish I still had contact with, friends that I would never see in the outside world.
Fox, dem0, Waui, Tropacat, Blackcat9, Ravendor, Reginar, Atokadz, Kittywolf, Goodrich, Alexane, Rena24, Kiosk, Lucy, Abbie, xcrushx, Zyrus... and so.. so many more that I can't even remember the names... I knew each of them. Some more than others. Shared joy and sadness with them. Laugther and rage. Tales and Music. Advices and questions.


I took a few breaks. Changed servers a few times.
After 7 years I've lost friends. Somes hated me and stoped talking.. Others simply quit the game. I was seeing new faces more and more. And then It hit me. Mabi was not the same for me.

I don't know if I will ever be returning, but I feel sad every time I think about these memories.

It may only be a game, but the time we spent in it was real.

Mabinogi
Mabinogi is not your typical rpg, with the class-less character customization and clothing color system, it's practically impossible to be just like" another player. The game can get very challenging at times

Mabinogi
Mabinogi is one of the greatest MMORPGs out there. Very Unique and Very Fun.
I was recommended this game by a friend and I told him that I wasn't very impressed by its 'looks'. Sure enough, I at least gave it a try...and From that point onwards, I have never stopped playing it. That was about a year or so ago. That's how amazing this game is!
Mabinogi is one of those games that doesn't require you to complete EVERY SINGLE quest and task; it's all completely up to you to make the choices and do what YOU want to do.

One of the main things that makes this game so unique and fun is its combat and leveling system. The combat in this game requires more stragetic choices and as well as good timing of skills and attacks to do some damage against foes, rather than just pressing the skills button to do some extra damage. Also, the leveling is very different to other games. There's quite a lot to explain but to put it shortly: There's no level cap. You can just keep on leveling.

Another thing is the gaming community. I promise you, that this game has one of the most friendliest communities I've ever played with and that is what keeps me playing. Simply just asking for a little assistance and someone, who hears it, would usually come by and help you out.

Last main thing is the story and updates. The story of mabinogi is very unique and it is separated into 'Generations'. Each generation can pose quite a challenge and usually isn't something you can just rush through. The story overall is a very interesting one with its twists and turns. Each update is always something that I can look forward to as each one usually has some sort of event with it, giving players the chance to win great and useful prizes.

There are alot of other great things that I can say about this game, as well as a few minor problems. But overall, this game ROCKS! and I recommend it 100%!

Mabinogi
This is probably my third time posting a review for the same game, and at this point, I lost interest in this MMO. My stuff in Mari is going to be left there, and I'm probably going back in a year or so to see how things are checking up. But at this point.. just don't.

I've played the game at an odd rate. I've played in the Closed Beta as a kid, in which I never really gotten into the game, then the first time I joined Steam (which was around 2012), then last year, and now, this year. I've had my share of what did I miss?" moments here and there

Mabinogi
Mabinogi is a play as you want game. There is really not much you can't do in this game as far as picking how you want your character to look and feel. Outside of few race locked skills there is no ability you can't learn and master in this game if given enough time. Even for people who like to do nothing more than craft items and gear all day the game is set up not only to let you do that, but you to also level up while doing it. In this game what level you are doesn't really mater as much as the rank of the skills you use and how well you can use them. Even a person who is a total newbie can manage to kill bosses for as long as they got the timing of their skills right, know when you block and/or dodge, know what weapons work best for what you are doing. There is no such things as making a bad roll when creating or playing your character as part of the systems as well as story is rebirthing". Letting to restart your character from lvl 1 and/or change your looks again. When rebirthing only your level is reset and you keep all your gear and skills. So over many life times you can build up your skills only focusing on what you want.

This updates often with events that are fun for new and old players alike. And the main story of the game is well thoughtout and deep. Besides being fun and well as challenging. People who are aware of real world history and mythology will notice and spot a lot of the hidden meaning behide a number of the people

Mabinogi
this   mothering game will ing ruin your mothering life. it will rob you of every penny, every dime, every dollar you own. it will rip away at your existence. it will make you feel like the worst person on the planet because you end up spending over 500 hours on this   mothering game. it will tear apart friendships. it will tear apart relationships. your friends and family will plead and beg you not to go on that   mothering game and to spend time with them, and to go outside and appreciate life for what it is. but you will not. you will look at them, tears in your eyes, and tell them you /can't/ stop playing the game. you can't stop. because this... this   mothering game is no longer ....a game". it is a lifestyle. it is an addiction. an obsession.

you have become the   mother ing game.

Mabinogi
Eh.

Mabinogi
I do apologize for my lack of game time. I played Mabinogi directly from Nexon before it was released on Steam. Though it seems I have almost no time on the game, I guarentee I've spent at least 150+ hours on the game.
Now that that's out of the way...
This is quite possibly one of the best, if not the best, MMORPGs that I've ever played.
This game is far, FAR ahead of its time withs its massive variety of skills ranging from picking herbs to controlling puppets in combat, its INCREDIBLE organization of stats and abilities, its MASSIVE amount of customization and fashion (Hence the nickname Fashionogi") and wonderful

Mabinogi
Mabinogi is an interesting little mmo that is about you the player being sucked in your computer and ending up in a world called Erinn. You are called a milletian by the worlds people and as you discover more things about yourself, the story unfolds into this tragic and sad conflict of many different people. This is the main focus of the story and I will say that its decent. It will keep you interested but the story mission lines are short. Though at this point in the games life, there are tons to complete. And speedrunning even at low level will only take a couple of hours to finish.

Now on to the Mechanics. Mabinogis combat is simple yet hard to master. It is a lot like rock paper scissors and every skill has its counter. Smash> Defense Counter>smash. Theres many different skills to choose from and you will always feel unique from other people.

The skill leveling on the other hand is somewhat similar to UO (Ultima Online). You have to use the skill repeatedly to rank it up. For example Smash would require you to kill 10 enemies using smash, smash a critical on ten enemies to rank from rank B to A. These are just examples, but the number of times you would have to repeat using this skill increases to hundreds or even thousands depending on the skill. Some rank themeselves up and you won't even notice it as you play. Other skills will require you to go out of your way just to train them and could take hours of your time just doing that. Life skills like blacksmithing could take you about a month to do if that was what you had spent your time on for a whole month.
To rank skills though, you need Ability points. Ap (for short) is given by leveling. I level up to 80 per rebirth for example. After you hit say 80, you will want to rebirth. Rebirthing removes the stats you gained from levels but you keep your stats that you gained from skills. You can only rebirth once a week but you can rebirth for free every three weeks. If you would like to buy a rebirth once a week its about 10 bucks.

This is actually one of my problems with mabi is that its very grindy. Its a very unique game with huge amounts of character customization. Just very grindy. The questing is totally fine with not much grind at all. Some of the story quests mix it up with puzzles. Its just the actual building of your character.

If you are looking for an mmo thats different and you can waste a ton of time on but stay engaged, then this is the game for you. Game has quite a bit of sandbox features such as housing and character customization with tons of outfits and skills to mix in. There is even farming.

If you are looking for a game that will not waste your time but still give you a great experience then this may not be what you are looking for. Mabinogi has to much grind hidden under those colorful cartoony graphics to justify playing only 1 hour a day. You can very well play the game for free without spending a dime, but you will want to. They offer limited edition pets constantly, Various limited edition clothes, and rebirths to make your life easier.

So all in its a very unique mmo and its hard to lie and say that it isnt. But playing an mmo like this or wow really worth it to you? After all of the fun is said and done and you have seen everything it will turn into a job. Every mmo that is currently out in america will have you grinding for hours. Even guild wars 2 has grind at the end. So is it worth it to you?

Mabinogi
I JUST LOVE IT HOW YOU GO INTO COMBAT AND THEN YOU GET HIT WITH MASSIVE SERVER LAG AND FIND YOURSELF DEAD ON THE FLOOR.

10/10 Would die due to server lag again, thanks Nexon love knowing I can count on you! <3

...But really, I'm gonna be writing a serious review here. I love this game so I'm recommending it, Mabinogi is a fun, casual game to pick up and play at your own leisure. Currently my main problem is the combat. Ever since I first started playing this game some six or seven years ago I've noticed one major thing; Nexon's server stability is complete t. If you play this game with the idea that you're going to mainly be combat oriented, you're gonna have a bad time!

Combat in this game is all about picking your battles wisely. Two key factors in combat is lag and targeting. I've already talked about lag so let's talk about targeting. Unless you're good at pointing your mouse in very specific places, you're gonna wanna hold ctrl to auto-target the nearest enemy to your mouse. Now, this isn't a bad thing... unless you're fighting a large boss monster. I'm in the beginner dungeon trying to target a giant red spider when his little buddies are nowhere near my mouse, yet I target them anyways and aggro unwanted enemies, thus getting myself killed.

That aside, this game has a number of features that make for a great atmosphere. The soundtrack, for example is one of the best I've ever heard in a free-to-play MMORPG. Not only that but you have the ability to pick up an instrument, write your own music and then play said music. The only other game I've seen that implemented would be in LOTRO so this feature is a huge thumbs up in my books.

Mabinogi offers a wide range of skills from combat to magic to simple gathering and crafting. Each skill has a rank and the more you work on the skills the more training it gets to the next rank. Before ranking it up you need to spend AP which is gained when you level up. Back when I first played this game AP was really hard to come by so you had to pick and choose what skills you want to work on, the same can't be said now as I have more AP than I know what to do with! Personally, this is a bad thing hiding underneath a good thing. Having all this AP means that you can work on more skills, but at the same time it means that everyone can pretty much be a jack-of-all-trades. This bothers me slightly because it takes away from the idea of players specializing in specific things, constructively forcing them to work together.

Community is...well, as I said in my review of WAKFU, you have to know where to look for them. Sure you'll see a group of people hanging out in the Human starter town in channel 1 of any given server, but aside from that I don't see many people aside from your everyday player running to and from one place to another, too busy to stop and chat. There are guildstones placed all over the place, you can click on them to bring up information about that guild. You can also just pull up the guild interface and search for guilds so I find the guildstones pretty redundant. There are also guilds recruiting on Nexon's official forums as well as community forums, which gives the opportunity to speak to the leader or recruiters before joining.

There are more features about this game that I'm missing, I'll be editing this review at a later date but I thought I should add some more of the game's core features to the review since it was originally pretty bland. I still recommend this game and even though I talk about negative points it is still a great game that you absolutely must experience at least once. Thank you for reading!

Mabinogi
Okay, I'm gonna go straight to the point here. I love the concept that this game has. I think the fact that you can rebirth and master multiple skills instead of being restricted to one class is really cool. Being a music teacher, I also love how you can compose music on here using actual music theory. The in-game music is pretty awesome as well. One thing I don't like is how buggy the game is. The pathwaying for the game seems pretty sloppy, as I occasionally find myself glitching in the same spot when I try to talk forward (especially through the narrow hallways in the dungeons). I also invited some friends to play the game, and it seems like most of them have problems when they try to launch it (these people also have very capable computers, so I wouldn't call it a systematic problem). Another thing that really bothers me is the pop-up tip windows. I try disabling them, but it doesn't seem to work. It's tediously annoying to have to deal with that appearing in the middle of my screen during a fight.

Overall, I like this game. I think you'll enjoy it too, if you can work around the little annoying bugs and pop-up windows.

Mabinogi
Mabinogi, by definition, is the closest MMORPG to Sword Art Online ever created. Wether you acctuly like the anime or not, there is no doubt that Mabinogi closely resembles some of its elements. However, I whole heartedly say this, Mabinogi is not for everryone. Why you may ask? Well, simply but, Mabinogi is very, very, VERY grindy. If you want to have a half decent character, you need to grind. See, there are 2 ways to play Mabinogi. 1. You can play just to dork around and talk to some friends you convinced to play with you. 2. You can feel like a toatol badass when your character is so combatically stacked, that plowing through hoards of enemies with one quick swoop becomes incredibly entertaining. That' right folks, you want some fun out of this game? You gotta learn to fight, and fight like a pro. This is where Mabinoig is the most grindy. See there are multible classes (or talents). And each talent has its own weapons, and stats, and blah blah blah. But here's where the game is intresting, some talents work off the same stat, thus making it that if you did both classses, both would become stronger due to you training that stat. Here's an example for you: If you do Close Combat, which get's its power off of your strength stat, and you alos did Ninja, which also get's its power from the strength stat. Now both of these talents become stronger because they both work off the training of the strength stat. Some people will take this to the extream by taking many different talents that rely on strength, or intelligence, and train them up so that they can be powerful in a whole arsenal of classes. Now how do these classes work? Well remember how I said this game is kinda like Sword Art Online? Well basically each class has X amount of skills, and each skill can be trained and ranked up by using AP. Every skill can go from rank F to rank 9, and then rank 9 to rank 1. This obviously is where the game becomes very grindy. In order for your skillset to be half decent, your going to have to train that skillset a lot and earn lots of AP. However, that makes becomming a respectable warrior all the more rewarding. Mabinogi is honestly very addictive, it plays off its own grindiness, pulling you in and making you beg to bring your skill up just one more rank before bed. Basically if you give Mabinogi time, and take the time to learn the ropes, and find your way around (I would suggest using the Mabinogi wiki page) then you will find that Mabinogi is a really great game.

Mabinogi
I hate this game.

Mabinogi
Mabinogi was a lot of fun. Using 'was' because I played it for over 5 years and outgrew it already, but couldn't just leave without reviewing my experience.

Let's start with the good stuff.

-Uniqueness
This game is old, and it was way ahead of its time. There were so many features other MMO's never even though about having. So much stuff to do.
There's not even a level cap so you could just literally keep on playing this game until it died.
Updates are frequent and have actual creative/interesting content.

-Combat
How do I even begin to explain how amazing the combat in this game is.
Sure it's point and click, but its deeper than the typical point and click game.
You actually need to think about what you're doing instead of just spamming 1-9 skill keys like other similar MMO's do.

-Graphics
For a game from 2003(?) the graphics don't harm the experience.
The anime style of the game still kept it refreshing.

-Story
Oh man, the story in this game..
All I can really say is that its confusing and doesn't flow together but its interesting at the least.
The directors kept changing for this game and they never continued each story arc, they made their own instead.

So why am I not recommending this game?
Nexon.

The name itself pretty much has a derogatory meaning in the world of MMO's

-Horrible customer service
-It's just another pay to win-free to play game.

The community isnt that great either, it was good at first but then corrupted once cash items started becoming necessary to be good at this game; Such as reforges.
Don't get me wrong.. I've spent hundreds of dollars on this game. Looking back at that.. it wasn't really worth it.

But if you can get past Nexon, for some odd reason. Then go ahead and try out Mabinogi.
There weren't many MMO's to play back when I played this. The ones that did come out, never stood up to Mabinogi's features. Not to mention that I had a crappy computer, so this game was perfect for it.
I grew up with this game and it'll hold always be special for me. But yeah, if you want a more modern version of Mabinogi, just wait until Peria Chronicles goes west. (if it ever does, but Nexon will probably bring it over)

Mabinogi
Kawaii waifu simulator.
10/10 its okay

Mabinogi
I Would recommend this game to anyone looking for a mmo that really is like nothing else. I've met some people i plan to keep around for the rest of my life on it. but remember, it's called a fantasy life" for a reason (sometimes drama and all). it can consume ALOT of time.

One other thing to remember

Mabinogi
The game can be stale at times, but last night just made me want to write a review. It's because of night's like those that I still play the game.

So I'm just minding my own business, I see a party ad for a title someone wants to buy that I happen to own. Well, I note them, we agree on the sale and whatnot. Well, they then proceeded to invite me to run Lord missions with them. The entire time we're just having laughs and fun. A person who was there was beating enemies with his hammer and pickaxe. At some point he realized he could use the new skill, Bash

Mabinogi
ABSOLUTELY YES, This is by far the very best game i've ever played. My name is Lawliet aka L666 from the ruairi server, I'm friend to anyone and everyone and if your starting to play for the first time message me, I'll get you geared up. :D

Mabinogi
>Looks at game and thinks it's good
>Plays for more than 200 hours
>Made 14 year old friends (I have no friends in irl...)
>Got married to some random dude
>He thought we were dating (IRL)
>Talked insanely dirty (Also wanted to do things to me)
>Told him we weren't dating

>Me stops playing cause of him and nobody will help with episode 3.



Couple weeks later.
>He finds my kik/insta/snap
>Says he loves me
>Is scared
>Blocked him off of everything
>Plays again and deletes him

I just told you my story of this game. Now for girls who play this, make sure you know who you're talking to, you might end up talking to a damn 42 year old pedo. Or some batshit crazy dude who loves you for no reason. Just say you're a damn dude ffs.

Gudbai have a beautiful tiem! :D


Mabinogi
As a veteran who has played this game for 6-years, I would recommend this; however, this game has really reached its end-point and it has lost its luster. Why? There are various reasons and it's the reasons why I have left this game permanently, with some very few exceptions of coming back for the story content.

NOTE: I have played more than 2000+ hours of this game; however, I have never kept it attached to my current Nexon Account, because the one attached to this is my banned account.

Gameplay / Game Compatibility - The game engine runs on a pretty old engine from 2003 and it has hardly been tweaked for newer contents. While that might not be the problem, the reason why this game has issues here is because of the security programs" and constant "bug fixes" that Nexon does. This game literally burnt out my previous computer

Mabinogi
An Affectionate Retropective...
I haven't touched this game in a while, thus I can't represent what the game is now, however I can give my thoughts on what it was like a few years ago. The only reference used here is my own memory; this will mostly likely have bias, as a person who did enjoy the game. I bolded the important bits for tl;dr.

The story is actualy good for once, or at least the first three generations were. I can't remember what the rest of them were about, though I do remember that they continued the story line in one of the later generations (17~18 I believe). I don't think I've ever seen characterization of this extent in any MMORPG; to this day I still occasionally wonder what ever happened to Triona and Ruari. The NPCs are recurring, meaning that they still are relevant through out the game relative to the story. There's even a relationship system with the NPCs, though I do think it could be fleshed out some more. Perhaps they've already fleshed it out by now, who knows? I remember giving lots of bread to the nun that's always outside the Church in Tir, I'd finally got her to warm up to me after ~50 loaves of bread and occasionally she'd give me a boiled egg. It was ... heart warming, and it's probably the only thing remotely similar to human affection I'm ever going to get from a girl.

The music is god tier. Each NPC has their own special song. The nun outside the Church had a particularly wonderful tune. Here it's better to show you, listen for a bit: https://youtu.be/rG2Z9dnovKA
It almost seems like each song was composed to maximize nostalgic value, even more so once I heard the lyrics to the theme song sung by Tanaka Rie; it was as if it was speaking directly to former players. Not to say that new players can't enjoy the music as well, it's just that listening to these pieces right now, it has more impact than one would think.

It's an ever lasting game. There is no level cap, how it works is that every so often you'd reset yourself to level 1 again keeping your skill progression. You can literally play for as long as you want with out it getting too slow to level. And when I speak about leveling it doesn't nessesarily mean grinding.

Even with the unconventional combat system (for it's time), you're not required to grind or even kill anything at all. The game doesn't follow the point, click, and wait system that was common during that time, it was a little more dynamic than that; in fact back in the day getting hit twice usually meant death. Goblins, being one of the lower forms of enemies, would still deal out high amounts of damage both in raw damage and in numbers (multi-aggro). The good thing is that you don't have to kill monsters if you don't want to, with the release of non-combat leveling, you can be a farmer that levels up by touching chickens, milking cows, etc, or you could just blacksmith things all day. I found it particularly fun to simply search for gems to feed to the loli living in my knife.

Customization is a core aspect of the game. If I had one good thing to say about Nexon's cash grabbing, it's the customization options. They do a pretty good job of offering a bunch of choices. That's all on top of the innate customization in the game, I can't even count the amount of clothing articles this game has. Even in the case that you see someone wearing the same thing you are, there's dye. mathmatically there are millions of possibilities, for God's sake you can dye your weapons. You write your own music, you design your own plot of land, etc. Combat wise some of the key choices the game shoves at you is Paladin vs. Dark Knight, Elf vs. Giant, I think you have to choose the Demi-god thing too; I can't say for sure, I never got that far in the game (those quests were too dificult for me).

Not to say there's nothing negative to say about Mabinogi...

The graphics may be a bit blocky for this generation, especially with these fancier games coming out. My defence to this is that the magnitude of customization offered here would not be realistically possible with next gen" graphics

Mabinogi
This game is garbage and will devour your soul, time, and wallet. 10/10 would play again

Mabinogi
While Mabinogi is pretty new to Steam. I played it when it first came out #hipster.

Mabi is a game that basically plays like a more awesome, anime version of Runescape. If I have to be honest. You can train talents and skills related to combat, tailoring, cooking, carpentry, fishing, etc. It's basically a virtual life simulator that happens to have weapons and monsters involved. There are marriages, familiies, and of course the classic guild.

The combat system is strategy based, with a heavy emphasis on stacking and planning out the use of your skills (Combo. If you will). Simply left clicking on an enemy is enough sometimes, but when you start diving into deeper dungeons, or the dark, deep wilderness - you're going to want to know how to run your dang combat skills.

Recent updates have made the game MUCH more accessible as far as talents and skills go. And with frequent. FREE updates coming constantly, there's no shortage of content available to keep even the old school" players entertained.

The music is amazing

Mabinogi
Sat on loading screen for half an hour

The phrase Something special happens when you use counterattack on Succubi..." is forever imprinted on my mind

10/10 would load again"

Mabinogi
Despite being a game originally made in 2004, I can guarantee you that you will not find another game that can compare to this.

The main thing about this game is the fact that there is technically no level cap - while there is a soft cap" at 200

Mabinogi
This once was an amazing game. The play and story is like none other, however lately the game has been slowly shifting to a Pay2Win platform with gachas and reforges that unless you want to sink hundreds of dollars into it with little promise of getting anything, you'll never really get much of anything.

Mabinogi
i have like almost 4k hours of course it's amazing

Mabinogi
A once great game now nothing more than a black hole for your wallets bordom.  Maginogi, coming on 9 years live, has seen better days with more activity.  What can be said?  Nexon, the publishing company for the devcat studio based in Souel, South Korea, has watch its hit game run into the ground.

Nexon is no better, letting employees abuse the job by ban hammering anyone they please or creating chaos without due consequence or respect.  Before Danel Kim showed up with KNoxxr, the infamious CFO, VP to PR; Mabinogi held on to the top 5 list in IGNs best free to play, letting player customize thier Fantasy Life" and giving them room to follow a path of their own choosing without talent trees to follow.  Mabi once held a hybrid subscription

Mabinogi
I've found that I can be really picky about MMO's to the point that I'll only play one or two. Character customization and freedom are key things for me and Mabinogi has those. It is not perfect, but I don't think any MMO will ever be. I'll list some of the good and the bad (and other key notes) and let you decide if it's for you.

--Cons--
Nexon/Cash Shop: The cash shop does support the game, but with people spending hundreds, if not more, each time a Gachapon comes out it gets a bit excessive. There are some useful consumables, and some pets and outfits that change frequently.
Grinding: Grinding is very real in this game. Finding materials or items for quests or crafting can take hours. Training some skills can also be a pain in the .
AP: Skills are more important than levels and all skills have their own rank and use AP to get those ranks. I listed this in the Cons because it shouldn't be spent wildly, even though it is technically unlimited, because it can take a while to get.
Quests: A number of the quests are the generic, lackluster fetch or hunting quests.

--Pros--
Events: Nexon always has some sort of event running and 9/10 are at least decent (there is one where I had to fight two dragons (with other players) and all I got was a crappy MP potion. That event was cut short and replaced). Some events will give cash shop consumables, unique outfits, pets, exp, or just other unique items.
Customization: There are several free options for physical appearance and your armor and weapons can be dyed. Finding a player with the exact appearance and outfit and colors would be difficult unless you coordinate it.
Classless: Something I like in games. Rather than choosing a class, you choose a talent that helps with training associated skills. You can change your talent and it doesn't restrict any equipment or skills. You could be a Mage with heavy armor bashing things in the face with an umbrella.
Story: There is an extensive story, but all of it is optional. There are some exceptional rewards for parts of the story (transformations, a free pet) but with the open world you never have to touch it. It's also possible to start later parts of the story. Best of all, the quests are generally unique.

--Neutral--
Dungeons: Dungeons are randomly generated and are have some unique rewards. Searching for a specific reward, however, goes back to the grinding note. It's especially annoying to have a multiple floor dungeon and not get the drop you need.
Races: There are three playable races in game, each with their own pros and cons. This and your name are the only things locked about your character, but I listed it in Neutral because I'm not especially for or against it.

Overall, I'd rank Mabinogi a 8/10. There's an extensive wiki available online, and you can find some helpful cash shop items in player shops (can be a little expensive though). There's also a few minor glitches, but all games have that.

Mabinogi
Don't.

Edit:
I figure I'd write an actual review for this since I now have 700+ hours invested in this game.
Do you want a game where you can become a blacksmith who's also a mage?
An archer who just happens to use an oversized lance or a chef who happens to be a scientist?

Look no further but be warned: The game is a lot easier compared to when I first joined but that doesn't change the fact you will have a hard time. There is a variety ways of optaining gold but mercy will you still have trouble affording repairs.

The game was, and still is, designed to be played with others: You can't really do it alone for the beginning, in fact in the beginning NPCs encourage the player to meet others.

That doesn't mean somehow the game becomes easy with more players: Throwing impossible odds at you in the later chapters is pretty much mabs at this point.

Now if you're interested thus far you're probably wondering if this is P2W: It's not. I've heard people say this game is P2W but that's not really true, unless you want pets, almost everything else can and will be sold by other players. In fact for 400 hours wasted I didn't pay a cent and I still managed. A lot of the paid stuff isn't even that good, it just looks fancy.

You will struggle; you will suffer. You will lose and you will fail so many times but if you keep at it you'll eventually pull through.

So in conclusion: Don't.

Mabinogi
Mabinogi and I have this love-hate relationship, but whenever i think back to all crazy adventures i've had, and the people ive met, I can't help but smile. Mabinogi is a game that always left me wanting more. After playing it for a while i would crave and action game and leave it, then I might crave a stragegy game and leave it, I might leave it to focus on my school work or my part-time job. But every time, without fail, I always come back. In a since, i guess mabinogi was my home. It raised me, and though I would sometimes wonder off, I always knew where my home was.

Thank you Mabi, for the 7 years.

Awesome Features like:
-No rewind
-Stages last for more than 2 mins
-You don't need to win to progress the career
-Night driving
-No more Kenblock
-No more HEY THAT ROCKED

DiRT Rally
Ever watched rally on telly and thought, 'pfff, doesn't look so hard...'?

Buy this game. Buy a decent steering wheel. Discover a whole new level of respect for crazy men with mad talent driving ludicrously fast cars with no grip while someone yells numbers at them.

10/10 - welcome back to rally, Codemasters. We missed you.

DiRT Rally
Early Access Review

Since the recent physics update i felt the need to re-write my review.

This is quite literally the best racing game ever conceived. I already held it in extremely high regard pre-0.8 and had taken plenty of time to master the game - And then boom. A complete overhaul of the aero, tyre and suspension models. Why? Because the community said the handling didn't feel quite right.
They decided to then cram some equipment into a van and drive all the way to Barcelona from the UK to get some more feedback from the real world RX drivers, to help pinpoint where improvements could be made.
If this doesn't show some real dedication to the early access model and prove that they're actively striving to make this the best rally game ever made, i really don't know what could change your mind.

DiRT Rally v0.8 has managed to become my favourite all time game - Taking the throne from my childhood SNES classics and there's still more to come! I honestly can't find words to say how good the feeling of finding a perfect game and having a reliable stream of updates that just improve it further, really is.

This deserves a perfect 10/10 and i'm sure by version 1.0 it will be damn close.

DiRT Rally
+ No more Ken Block/X-Games/Gymkhana bull****.
+ Early access done the right way.
+ Lots of respect to rally history.
+ Hard, unforgiving, enraging. Rally as rally must be.
+ Physics and force feedback improving at each update.
+ Great, varied car roster. Each car REALLY has its own behavior.
+ Awesome feeling of reward, since learning is slow and gradual. You'll definitely learn the fundamentals of rallying.
+ Truly 3-dimensional stages, faithful to the real ones.
+ It's a sim" and really asks for a wheel

This is my Early Access review after putting some considerable hours into the game, playing various game modes while keeping a close eye on the community, the devs and updates.

I would like to point out unequivocally to any existing DiRT fans: this is NOT DiRT 4, or anything close to what most everyone would consider a DiRT" game/title. To be honest I'm not even sure why CM used the "DiRT" prefix at all

Oh god, finally a Rally game without any of the other t. Thank you!

Edit:

Alright, now that I have some playtime under my belt I want to give my first impressions.

- Great selection of cars
- The tracks, cars and the game in general look absolutely fantastic
- 3 monitor support + FOV settings
- OculusRift support
- Cars feel realistic (either use a wheel or gamepad!)
- Great performance (3 monitors (=5760x1080) + high settings on a single 970 with ~80fps)
- Great damage model
- You can manage your team and repair your car
- Online challenges are fun
- League support

No more gymkhana & Ken Block BS? Codemasters, please take my money.

DiRT Rally
Early Access Review

Colin McRae would be proud Codemasters 10/10

DiRT Rally
It's the DiRT game we've all been waiting for

Let's get the most important detail out of the way immediately.

THIS GAME HAS GROUP B
YES. IT HAS THE AUDI QUATTRO.
NO THERE IS NO GYMKHANA AND KEN BLOCK IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND

That alone is reason enough to buy it.

But there's more. Stages are much longer, 4-10 minutes.
Car tuning is much more in depth. Varied weather of just about every condition. Difficult tracks. Great sounding cars. Great graphics. The only thing that could be improved is the damage modeling, which is very forgiving even on the hardest difficulty in certain situations. I've never rolled the car and not been able to drive off.

This is one early access game you should buy in to right away. We've been starving for a proper rally game for years. This is the best there has been since RBR.

UPDATE 3/5/2016
The game is out, and it's fantastic. This is quite simply as good as rally games get.

DiRT Rally
Co-driver calls don't cut.

Still cut the corner anyway.

Car goes unrepairable.

10/10 would cut again.

DiRT Rally
Early Access Review

after playing this game without HUD, on ultra graphics, with a nice soundsytem + cockpit view i have to say one thing:
i will hate driving my own car in RL after playing this game

100/10
codemasters, you nailed it.

DiRT Rally
Encouragement Edition
So far I've put 31 hours into DiRT Rally, which is nothing really, since it took me roughly 30 hours to be able to drive confidently. Now that it's out of Early Access and despite glowing reviews from that period, I want to offer words of encouragement to those who have no experience with rally simulation games. My experience with rally sims is literally that, 31 hours. For a long time I thought my big brother was kinda crazy with his Richard Burn Rally, GT Legends and what have you. I stayed away from his racing sims, cos I knew I wouldn't be able to compete with his stage times. So instead we got competitive in games like NFS: High Stakes (the Snowy Ridge stage in particular) and the old Colin McRae Rally games, which had enough arcade handling for me to be able to compete with him. Naturally he played with assists off, where available. I on the other hand wouldn't even know how to begin to setup my car, let alone understand how turning off certain assists would translate into the handling of the car. And I pretty much still don't. For someone my age, I've driven very little in real life, but my mechanically inclined big brother knew exactly what he was doing back then. So most of the time he was kicking my , both in and out of the games. I keed, I keed.

My immediate conclusion after the first few hours with DiRT Rally was that I had no clue how to drive. A drunk elephant skating on ice would have more finesse. While I didn't rage-quit as often as I was expecting to, at the start I was playing only in third person view, thinking that my experience with the NFS, GTA or Colin McRae Rally games would help me here. It didn't. What I soon realized was that an outside view of my driving made me too aware of the track, which is probably just me, but that coupled with racing sim handling spelled disaster for me. So either by brazen choice or through cunning design, I chose the cockpit view to complete an entire stage, which I had never done in any racing game before. Sure, I've toggled it on and off here and there, but I had never stuck with it until now. This had an interesting effect on my driving, cos I was assessing the track and my line of driving more by feel than by actually seeing the track from above. I mean besides listening to your co-driver, which is important if you want to win. All that said, I think it's a good idea to put some 30 hours into it before you drift off to other games, cos being an FPS guy mostly and after taking long breaks from it, I was essentially starting afresh every time I returned. Even if your skills are still there, the stage conditions from Wales to Greece will bring you back to earth in no time.

Recently I graduated to Clubman, which means you'll do 6 stages per race and have 2 opportunities to repair your car. While my initial reaction was oh no

DiRT Rally
First race...
Full throttle...
First corner...
Rolls the car and gets achivement Nailed It"

Pros:
- Group B
- No Gymkhana
- Great physics
- Pike's Peak
- No rewind function
- That dillweed Ken Block is nowhere to be found.

10/10 - Exceptional rally sim. Very intense and unforgiving. This is everything that Dirt 3 isn't - and that's fantastic. Suck it Ken Block.

DiRT Rally
Early Access done right like a driver getting through the sharpest turn by doing a scandinavian flick. Codemasters were good drivers, listening to the co-pilots who gave feedback during development.
Apart from that, the most authentic rally game since Colin McRae Rally and Richard Burns Rally. It can please both casuals driving 60's cars in Monte Carlo with assists enabled, and hardcore drivers going through Pikes Peak at high speed from start to finish.

What other reviewers say is damn right. Best and most challenging rally game in years, realistic driving (even though physics might not be the best), great immersion, technically beautiful in almost every way and many classic and modern cars to drive. Career mode is simple, yet effective which encourages you to drive each car and upgrade them overtime, then there's player-versus-player Rallycross and online leaderboard rally and hillclimb to prove your worth.
I won't recommend playing online other than to earn credits though. It's full of hotlappers with 1000+ hrs of playtime who know every inch of the map.

Totally recommended, if you don't cut.

Personal rating: 8.5/10

DiRT Rally
Early Access Review

When Colin McRae Rally was released at the end of the previous century, that was some kind of revolution: For the first time, there was a simulation that really felt like driving a car! Now, some 17 years later, there is another rally simulation. And it feels like driving a car. For real!

They say they made a physical simulation of individual car components. In combination forming the experience of driving rally cars from the 1960s to today's WRC. And what can I say - an overwhelming success!

I mean, I'm sitting here with my keyboard, right? I don't even own a frigging steering wheel. But I do own a car. And I sure know what driving that feels like. And I know that this game feels like that more than anything else I've ever seen on a video screen.

Recommended without the slightest hesitation to anybody interested in simulation games and racing simulations in particular. Don't miss out!

Early Access Review

WOW!  I never thought i'd see the day that Codies produced any driving game with such authenticity, let alone a spiritual successor to RBR.  I'm amazed and somewhat shocked how good Dirt Rally is.

Took a while to get the settings dialed in to my liking and it still needs work on the FFB (base lateral and centering forces) .   Also the damage model could do with a bit of refinement, but otherwise very, very good indeed.

Please Codies, don't be tempted to dumb this down or add a whole load of peripheral fluff before release.  Keep it pure and focussed on the essence of the sport.  Continue in the same vein and you'll make a lot of serious racers very happy.

If Ken Block appears even once and calls me 'dude' I'm gonna hurt someone.

Unequal length headers.

DiRT Rally
You like vroom cars? Awesome. You like realistic cars flying over y roads that will punish you for your mistakes...but won't kill you for them like an actual car would? Read on.


Two things first. This game requires a DirectX 11-capable GPU, and there is an achievement for having played the game in Early Access. I don't know if it'll prevent 100% completion, but it is a thing.

Apart from that, this is 100% recommended for rally fans, and anybody who isn't afraid of a challenge. DiRT Rally is the fundamental opposite of DiRT Showdown, and it shows. Excellent physics (Codemasters' most realistic to date), truly awesome sound, breath-taking graphics, oodles of cars and a great variety of locations already. Between the career, multiplayer (with leagues!), fully customizable modes, achievements, and aforementioned car/track variety, there is a lot of value here.

Rally is predicated less on being the best right from the start and more around improving yourself as you go, gradually pushing yourself forward. Which is good, because this game really does simulate rally, and it is unforgiving. New players, trust me when I say you will screw up and it will probably be frustrating - because I sure feel it! And that's okay, because improving yourself in this game is truly rewarding, and driving itself is more often than not its own reward. Hell, veteran drivers aren't always perfect either. This game is quite possibly the most elegant combination of game and simulator I've ever seen.

The community will probably tell you to turn off all the driving aids from the start, but they're there for a reason. One must learn to walk before they can run, so I would suggest incrementally turning them off whenever you feel comfortable enough to. Or...not. How you use this game's remarkably wide-ranging realism/aid preferences are up to you.

If there's any criticism to be had of this game, it's that you kind of need a controller or wheel to really get the most out of your vehicle, and you will need to push your vehicle that far eventually.

The career progression is also rather impersonal: you mainly interact with the championships via sterile menus. I'd like to see my car in the service area so I can look at its damage in detail. I'd also like to see showcases for the cars, complete with short videos and historical information for people deciding which car to buy. The presentation is still good, but it's kind of impersonal for a representation of rally. I'd like to see something more like what's described in this special-interest review[www.worldrallyblog.com]:

DiRT Rally
Early Access Review

So out of what seems like out of no where a Realistic" rally game appears from the same Codemasters that couldn't really satisfy my Rally needs since Colin McRae Era

DiRT Rally
Early Access Review

This game is unforgiving, harsh, and deadly, however its incredibly addictive. Every failure and crash makes you want to race again,and again. To me its like like a racing game on difficulty insane which makes me want to master it even more. I feel I have to mentally prepare myself in between courses because I just cant keep up with the speeding and cornering aspects in locations such as finland which have fast and easy bends but one wrong move, and too much power on the throttle could send your car up a tree or through the undergrowth. This is the racing game Ive been looking for, for a long time. Think Dark souls but on four wheels.

Earth 2160
Let me start with saying I am a huge fan of the earth series,

-Earth 2160 continues the story of its predecessors through 4 campaigns of around average length that will most likely keep you busy for a while.
-The game features 4 very unique races which vary greatly in terms of playstyle.
-Lets you modify your units as you see fit to execute their job perfectly.
-It comes with a skirmish mode and supports up to 8 players for lan and i-net multiplayer. Has a bunch of extra maps added to it, some of which I recall seeing in fan patches.
-The game natviely supports most modern resolutions up to 1920x1080.
-Despite its age the graphics are still very neat to look at and features like its day and night cycle make the game quite pretty.
-Note: You will have to register the game ingame via its product code allocated by steam to unlock its full content, which might scare some people off but I dont exactly see any harm in it. (not like most modern games dont require you to make accounts :p)

Gameplay:
Eurasian Dynasty (ED)
The ED originated from Russia and while they may not be the fastest, they certainly have some of the toughest units in the game featuring heavy tanks, artillery and bombers. They weaponry ranges from conventional weapons to heat rays.
Their basebuilding consists of placing a main 'core' at the center of your base from which you build pipes to connect a variety of structures and generators to power your network of buildings. They can also build walls and a variety of other defenses.
Their ressource gathering is done by mobile refineries which can hover from depot to depot and process all ressources gathered on the spot for a steady income.

Strength: Very tough units, able to turtle quite well using a ring of walls around the mainframe, simple ressource gathering
Weakness: Slow units, buildings are vulnerable to get disconnected from the frame and can get disabled due to lack of power, basebuilding takes up a lot of time and needs to be planned ahead a bit in order to make room for future buildings.


United Civilized States (UCS)
The UCS originated from the United states of america, they have a variety of mechs and jets at their disposal and use a lot of energy based weaponry as well as ballistic missiles.
Their basebuilding is probably the most 'normal' and executed by flying drones that place structures which then build themselves as they drain the ressources needed. Their bases have the unique feature to use add-ons to enhance buildings in a specific way, such as making generators create more power or making refineries generate more income.
Their ressource gathering is rather traditional and has flying harvesters land on top of the ressources, gathering them and returning back to the nearest refinery for dropoff.

Strength: Fairly easy to master, strong missiles backed up by laser weapons, simple basebuilding which doesnt need babysitting. Can place turrets and walls to some extend to provide decent defense. Can teleport freshly trained units.
Weakness: Their structures while efficient can get costy to replace with a bunch of add-ons added to them and expanding to get more ressources does require you to set up additional outposts. Their laser weaponry is prone to get tackled by shields early on which renders them inefficient.


Lunar Corporation (LC)
The LC created orbital colonies and initially settled down on the Moon. They were able to study alien technology and feature the most advanced weaponry out of all the races. Their vehicles are hovertanks, infantry has jetpacks and aircraft are speedy.
Basebuilding for the LC means placing a basic module on the ground and stacking other modules on top to create a tower which depending on modules you places can fill in a variety of roles from research and unit training to combat modules to turn them into tough fortresses. They can also place external turrets and laser walls and all structures can be placed anywhere as they are dropped in from the sky. (you can only call in a limited number of buildings at a time though)
Their ressource gathering is as simple as dropping a mining base next to a ressource field. They will harvest and process it automatically.

Strength: Some of the fastest units in the game, very strong weaponry that is specialized to usually fit a single purpose, probably have the ability to expand in terms of ressources easier than any other race, can build foward or hidden bases anytime, anywhere.
Weakness: Due to their 'stacking' mechanic of modules their structural integrity is often at risk and they are prone to have their buildings get sniped which are even more expensive to replace than fully modded ucs building, their early game units while fast are fairly weak in terms of hp.


Aliens
The aliens are a new addition in Earth 2160 and feature the most unique playstyle using cloning and evolution to create their units and having no ressource gathering in the traditional way.
They can morph strong defensive structures which are able to provide heavy cover for units while they clone and evolve or block off ressource points from your enemies.
Instead of ressource gathering their units absorb a small amount of ressources to evolve into different species, starting with a basic unit that has no way of attacking and a basic mothership you have to clone them to create more and evolve those into different strands to create the perfect army.

Note: It is advised that you keep at the very least one basic unit to replicate as you might be unable to reproduce if you dont!

Strength: Strong structures, heaviest aircraft in the game, fast and lethal units, can easily poke at hostile bases and harass them.
Weakness: Beyond static turrets no way to defend yourself, take great amounts of planning and macro management to keep track of your units and their evolutions, easy to get harassed and crippled if cloning units are exposed.


Virtual Agents:
Virtual Agents are 'Hero units' which will offer their services for the highest bidder. As Aliens have no means to store ressources they are unable to obtain any.
Agents pop up every now and then , initially after a few minutes three random ones will pop up and ask if the player wants to hire them. You have to be quick and go for whichever suits you best or simply bid on them all if you feel generous with your ressources. Your enemies also have the chance to obtain them and can make them a better offer. In the end they will join whichever side is willing to spend the most money on them.
Once hired you can spawn the VA anywhere you like and they will remain in your service for a limited amount of time till their contract expires, after which you have to pay them again. If they get killed their contract is also terminated.
Those Virtual agents offer a variety of bonuses for certain playstyles, such as reducing the cost of flying units by 25% or having your ground units start as veterans. The VA's also come in a variety of shapes and often are a powerful unit on their own that if used right can pack quite a punch.
You can have up to 3 agents at a time which will most likely start to chat with one another at some point. This usually leads to quite some hilarious conversations which might entertain you if you like bad puns and sarcastic comments.

Note: Virtual Agents can be disabled during game setup if you dont want to have them around.



Thats about all I can tell ya, if youd like to know more you should just take the game for a spin, especially since its currently on offer for a laughable price. The rts genre usually doesnt bring forth as many games as other genres do currently which is why many of us still play 'older' games to pass the time.
This one is a little gem, sure has its flaws but it can be a bunch of fun, especially if you're looking to get it to play with some friends of yours who are also willing to spend a single dollar or euro to get it.

Earth 2160
Game welcomes you with a registration form you better fill out if you don't want to be limited to demo mode".
That form includes mandatory fields like: Real name

Earth 2160
This is one of the best RTS game released in 2005 but graphics and design still very impressive even in today's standard the gameplay is deep with technology research ,units customizing and unique base building techniques for each faction. Earth series very powerful brand in strategy games. if you didn't play earth series game before (earth 2140,earth 2150) I recommend you to read this wiki page to understand the story behind each faction in earth 2160 (Eurasian Dynasty, United Civilized States, Lunar Corporation, Aliens) . http://earthseries.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Wiki

Earth 2160
Earth 2160 is the third game in Earth 21XX series, a polish RTS that tried to put small innovative features. It came out in 2005 and then got Steam release in 2006, quiet early stuff. Didn't get any expansion packs, unlike Earth 2140 and 2150.

So, let's get to technical part. Around half of negative reviews that you see over this game comes from people beliving that game requires full registration, with your name, adress and such, for it to work fully. Actually, what is required is Activation"

Earth 2160
Leadership comes in small acts as well as bold strokes.

Earth 2160 is a very good real-time strategy game with four unique factions

Earth 2160
They make you register when you first start the game. Don't write the return code they give you down, you won't ever play the game again.

I know why you're here. You got a 90%(OR 86%) discount on this like I did, didn't you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: Apparently it's now an 86% discount.

The game will crash a lot and have long loading times. As a fan of RTS's, this is not one to buy.

Earth 2160
Featuring four races, each unique and interesting in their own way, Earth 2160 has an average storyline that doesn't really enthrall or engage in any way. There are three groups left from Earth who are fighting it out and trying to maintain a foothold in the future of mankind. Add to that an interesting alien race that has some especially unique features, and you have a recipe for a fun game. Earth 2160 has a campaign for each of the four groups: The European Dynasty, Lunar Corporation, and Union of Civilized States represent the groups from Earth, and the aliens representing the fourth playable race. If you're looking for a deep single-player experience, you're sure to find it with Earth 2160, as it takes time to work through the campaigns for all four groups.During the campaigns, you'll find out that each group really is different and depends upon a certain strategy to achieve victory. Another great aspect is the ability to research and create new units to combat the enemy tactics you encounter. Unfortunately, if you find yourself up against a unit that your newly created and research units are ill-equipped to defend against, you'll quickly find yourself on the losing side of the battle. Relying on a single strategy, weapon, or defense type will quickly lead to defeat. The key in Earth 2160 is to maintain a constant vigilance and be on the lookout for what sorts of technologies your enemies are employing, and work to create your own units to combat them. There is a ton of strategy involved in this, and it works to great effect.The interface for getting around, controlling your units, building your bases, and handling other options is a bit clunky. There are icons that have convenient tool tips that appear, which makes things a lot easier, but when you're looking for a specific action, you don't want to have to hover your mouse over each icon to find the one you are looking for.Graphically, the game is one of the best looking real-time strategy games I've ever played. You can zoom in to insane levels, and each unit looks as good up close as it does from a distance. Battles between groups of enemies are fantastically exciting and explosive looking, providing a brilliant show that almost overshadows the results. The environments are large and pleasant to look at, and once you've gotten your bases built up and lined with defenses, it's like gazing at a landscape straight out of a science fiction movie. One of the coolest things is the transition from day to night; watching your units light up the night is extremely cool. Another great graphical aspect is the trails that your vehicles leave on the ground. Tire treads, steps, it all looks amazing and comes together to form a fantastic-looking experience.Sound, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. One of the worst aspects of Earth 2160 are the voiceovers. The soundtrack is pretty good, and changes with the action, which is nice. It's nothing really excellent, but it does provide ambience and helps with the suspenseful atmosphere.There is a skirmish mode as well as multiplayer, and if you get tired of the lengthy campaign, you can always find a friend to play against or take on the computer in the skirmish battles.Earth 2160 is an excellent title that is sure to stand the test of time for real-time strategy fans.

Earth 2160
Not a bad strategy game for 5 dollars that came out during 2006 , not bad research system and battles, good customization for troops with upgrades, story and navigation can be boring though, if you buy this game it might be for lan or skrimish.

Earth 2160
10 years after initial release and the game is still amazing.  4 different factions to play, one with extremely different technology then the others.  The three primary factions have serious differences beyond what you see in similiar RTS games from the last ten years.  Played this game not only on Steam but also via CD and DVD versions.  Only flaw in the game was too small an advertising budget.  After many hours of playing I discovered the first person view for your units, pretty cool in an RTS.  Even more features remain to be discovered in this gem.

Earth 2160
Fab game to burn the hours.

Earth 2160
So, Earth 2160 it is. I first heard about the series many years ago. I only played Earth 2150 back then, but then I heard about Earth 2160 about 6 years ago and decided to try it. To my surprise, it came out to be a fantastic game. Much better, than its predecessor, the 3D setting of this game is quite revolutionary for a 2006 strategy game! I love it! And the gameplay? Amazing! You can customize your units as you wish, give them many different weapons, and level them up. Though, there are some unsatisfying things. When playing against the Alien race, the LC faction is quite weak against them. The second thing - you can't really tell what damage you are getting from the aliens... I tried all kinds of armor against them and none worked... Also, it seems like the shields aren't doing their job... they SHOULD absorb all kinds of damage... and not let any projectiles or beams through... so devs, PLEASE, patch these glitches to perfect this game! It's already a beautiful game as it is, and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this to any RTS lover! Enjoy! :)

Earth 2160
Gameplay is gr8
glitches kind of mess it up, such as the glitch where the infantry go inside each other, this isnt a prob tho because infantry is almost useless. XD
missions can be kind of boring at a few times, but skirmish is fun AF.
I remember playing this game a long time ago :P had so much fun, i love how the game updated! Good work guys! x3
I dont see a problem with the registration thing because maybe steam doesnt support the network for them... I mean they do have their own website...
the dialogue for anything without a helmet is ridiculous... theyre saying somethin like Ok

Earth 2160
Overall I would recommend to fans of RTS games who have played the major titles and are looking for something different.

+4 unique races, each with their own campaign
+Units, buildings, and research look, feel, and play differently for the races
+Cool unit customization options, build and name your own vehicles
+Hero units with variety of weapons and armor with different effects
+Story and graphics are decent, with fully voiced dialogue

-Poor voice acting, little story outside of missions.
-Some fans of the Earth series do not like the changes in this game
-Doesn't hold up as well as major RTS titles such as C&C or Starcraft

Earth 2160
To all those who complain about the supposed need to give out personal info: LEARN TO READ.
You do not need to register to play the full game, just UNCHECK the box for registration and press the internet activation button and you are done. Honestly, if you tell the game to register, then of course you have to give your name, birthdate and co., but you only have to ACTIVATE.

All those thumbs down to a generally decent game, just because they cant read properly. Steam should delete such invalid reviews and never give refunds for this game if such a reason is given.

I admit, I at first didnt read properly myself, but then i just used the back button and read properly, noticing the checkbox for the registration with no problem at all.

Earth 2160
Weaker than Earth 2150 but still an underrated and decent RTS game that brought some interesting changes into the franchise for the better and the worse.

Also:
Aliens are interesting but you may or may not like them as a playable faction or as your enemies. The only other problem might be the annoying extra-DRM.

Earth 2160
Best RTS ever? Well there is 2150 but 2160 is at least as good. What surprises me is that not only it is an absolute classic, but also, it runs perfectly, or was adapted flawlessly to modern OS/PCs. The AI doesn't let you fool around much, even on easy, if you like challenges this is the one. Graphics still look really good too! Best Topware game easily.

Earth 2160
Great Game, Fun Gameplay, Reminds me of Halo Wars :)

Earth 2160
This game surprised me. I originally thought while contemplating on buying this game that it will provide a mediocre RTS experience. Fortunately, my judgement was wrong and I have been enjoying the game so far. The graphic quality commendable considering that this was released 8 years ago. I definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a unique RTS experience.

Earth 2160
Earth 2160 is a great game but might not appeal to everyone.

The game seems a bit outdated by today standards, especially graphics wise. Furthermore it's a somewhat slow paced game that requires time and thought put into it.

It's a science-fiction based RTS game featuring advanced base building, ressource gathering and combat. The economic aspect of the game is quite basic. Gather ressources to fund your base and units, base building is pretty extensive depending on the factions. The combat is quite good but challenging. One of the most important mechanics is the unit customization, through research you can design your own units with various strengths and weaknesses. This allows for some major tactical planning and you really need to think what type of unit is effective against another type of unit. Overall this mechanic is very rewarding but can be frustrating. Sometimes your units will just be annihilated and you won't have the time or patience to find a new design that suits your needs.

Two aspects of this game that I find very appealing are the factions and the campaigns. The factions are completely different and feel distinct. Each faction has a unique way of playing and focus, some have completely different structures and designs that opt for different playstyles. The mission campaigns are extremely well done, especially for an rts game. You have dialogues and cutscenes, some rpg elements as well and a decent storyline. Furthermore you will have several campaigns at your disposal to play.

The multiplayer is seviceable and works quite well. So are the graphics and soundtrack. Nothing to complain about.

Earth 2160
I remeber this game when his original realised, still i love it
Its a really nice RTS with plenty of mission's, really good challanging AI, epic plot (by the standars of his age), many diffrent units (that you can customize them to your needs) and a very good music to back up your plays

The only con i think for this game is the hard AI (personaly i love the AI ) but for new players it will be proven a bit challenging

If you buy it i hope you  enjoy it :D

Earth 2160
The game is a pretty good rts game. Maybe not the best but still really fun and well worth the price.

Earth 2160
Fun game, unique races, technology and UI, albeit a little clunky compared to Starcraft or Supreme Commander.  Still if you want something similar with beautiful diversity, maps, unique wall system, and a really neat PIP-window mode that allows first or third-person viewing of a platoon of your battling troops in a picture-in-picture while you command your standard starcraft style screen; this game is a fun piece of unique diversity in the RTS universe, and the AI can be quite interesting.

Earth 2160
Really good game all RTS gamers must play...

Earth 2160
It's awesome with explosions!!!

Edit: Overall I liked this game, but it does have it's failings.

Pros:
Great graphics
Awesome looking bases
Interesting UI that can be quite powerful once you figure it out
Rebindable keys
Awesome base building mechanics, which are different for each faction
Lots of tanks
Lots of explosions

Cons:
UI is still clunkier than DoW or Starcraft
Hardcounters are way too OP, for example, most units do 30% of their regular damage vs buildings, while artillery does 1000% their regular damage vs buildings, meaning they can kill a building in 2 shots while your entire army does no damage at all to the enemy base.  This even extends to regular units, for example, if you have a tank with regular armor, it will only take 10% damage from regular attacks, but 100% from everything else.  So if you happen to guess what the enemy is using, they're ed, if you guess wrong, you're ed.
Unit customization only leads to more hardcounters, and doesn't really give you much freedom
Anti-missile defenses don't work properly
Units feel cartoony and wimpy compared to Earth 2140

Earth 2160
Although it is getting pretty dated by this point, this is a pretty good game for fans of the old Westwood Command and Conquer type games.  That's pretty much what it is: You mine resources to build units which have been researched.  You protect your base with some while wiping out the enemy base with others.  It is nice that there are at least three different 'factions' in the game, each with their own completely different technology trees, which keeps it interesting for quite some time.  The characters and story are pretty corny, but fortunately, they don't get in the way much.

Earth 2160
No matter what I say, I think http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976344679/recommended/1900/ summed it up best.

There's too much good about this game to list, so I'll list the negatives, what few there are.

1: Strike + Return aircraft seem a little bugged as they'll just dryhump their taget unless you micro them well (they also can only target they can't move")
2: The voice acting was much better in the previous installments.
3: Aliens (as the new race) are pretty crappy as they don't build bases and are venerable to being out-rushed

Earth 2160
Great innovative rts game with incredible difficult ai.

Earth 2160
Great Game but a lot of bugs... =(

Earth 2160
Has some nice ideas.
The graphics are good for when it was made.
7/10

Earth 2160
That's a tough one ,hard to review it ,haven't played it too much yet but as an RTS superfan ,I loved it! It has great mechanics ,the 4 factions are completely different which is just awesome ,3 different recources make the make even more fun. The only 2 things I don't like are: The graphics ,well it's an old game so the graphics are obviously outdated but for some people it may really feel annoying (Not for me though) , the second problem is that basically ,there's not tutorial whatsoever ,you should have to practice and discover the game yourself through skirmish mode. (As I did) Hell ,you have to make your own units as one of the factions which is great but might be really REALLY hard for beginners. Overall a decent RTS game!

Earth 2160
I can see why this game has mixed reviews. Beyond the registration thing, which I didn't really mind (just lie about everything), the game itself leaves much to be desired.

Graphics weren't great, but I didn't expect much. I don't need a good looking game if the mechanics are solid.

As for mechanics: the first mission, they tell you that you need to rescue some soldier that were captured. okay, let's go! The strategy of this seemed to boil down to BUM-RUSH

Earth 2160
Earth 2160 is the follow on from Earth 2150 which was one of the best RTS made. Earth 2160 is a good game in its own right however it does fall short in comparison to its predecessor.

Earth 2160
This was not worth the time I spent dicking around entering CD keys and trying to get past the archaic DRM.  Just use an idler to get the cards and forget about it.

Earth 2160
It can be pretty challenging some times...:D

Earth 2160
never done a review but whatever,
If you love the good old days of Tribes and Starsiege then buy it, plain in simple.

Earth 2160
Its good idea to make LINUX / STEAM OS / MAC OS ports of GOOD OLD CLASSICS using WINE. It surprisingly works fast. I almost forgot I have this game in my library until you created linux port :-) This game works great in UBUNTU LINUX, thanks devs.

Earth 2160
This game looks like it a nice game to jump into but the DRM makes it impossable to access the skirmish or multiplayer along with half the campaign! If you want to get this game get it on good old games (which has no DRM).

If the DRM gets removed off the steam version then I might change my review.

Earth 2160
nice timekiller RTS! only 5...good for that price

Earth 2160
The only real downside to this game is the fact that you need a registration giving personal info, that is only due to the fact its run by a third party site. The glitches everyone else brings up dont effect overall gameplay. For one example, when cloning multile Martian Queens (as the alien race) one may be encircled and will be stuck until the rest are move. Yes that is annoying but you can work by it. For me, the game doesn't crash, the exit button is just EVERYWHERE, if you see a message saying 'Are you sure you want to exit?' and you are just trying to leave a menu click no and use the back button. You we all must admit, these graphics are just ( ) for 2006.

Earth 2160
It's a fun game, but some flaws are really stupid/maddening:
- Your troops won't attack the nearest enemy on their own. Seriously, if you leave your guys unattended and the enemy attacks en masse, there's a really high chance your troops will try and pursue the farthest unit, ignoring everything else.
- Only Hold Fire" and "Pursue Enemy"

Earth 2160
Great RTS, good story and a bit old school :D

Earth 2160
EARTH 2160 is just amazing, the graphics are far ahead for it's time (released in 2004-05 i think) and with the IEO rebalencing mod it just becomes even more fun

however there are a few annoying bugs, but nothing game breaking thankfully :D

overall a great game, besides the not so good voice acting, but hey, who plays the story when you can be busy blowing stuff up in skirmish or rushing your friends online.

this game features 4 different sides with they're own unique play style, 3 Large tech trees of varying improvements, a Cool in-game unit editor that allows you to create combinations of vehicles

e.g. your enemy is using beam and laser weapons but have anti-chemical armor and heavy shields, so to adapt you'd either create or redesign a unit to include reflective armor, shields and kinetic weapons (AP guns, rockets etc)

a game i'd recommend, and with the two mods IEO rebalencing, and SuperStorm this game is amazing.

8/10

Earth 2160
I'm going to be honest.

I got this game in a sale and played it one day because I needed the cards to sell for another game. And I found myself enjoying every moment of it, wanting to play more even after I collected all of the cards.

A must-have must-play for those skeptical of the RTS genre, it will bring you into it and this is a good place to start.  Even if you're not into  science fiction or the whole futuristic outerspace scenario. I would still recommend this title as I think it is much better than the original Stacraft or of the older Red Alert series. Be sure to find the class that suits you best.

HINT:
This game doesn't have a complete tutorial or at least I didn't find one yet aside from it telling you how to build, so it might take some prior RTS experience to be fully competent at this game.

Earth 2160
This is a suprising game. I thought it was a simple 99 cent game to waste some time, but it is a well thought out RTS game with fantastic unit customization and one of the best soundtracks of any RTS game. Be warned that this game runs best in windowed mode but you can pump up the resolution to pretty close to 1080. It is a must buy for the price. You will spend tons of time on this game.

Earth 2160
6.3/10- RTS aging really well!

Almost 10 years after the release this game is still pretty fun. While not as good as Civilizations and other elite RTS this game was well done. I did have trouble with some bugs here and there, and had to enter my serial key more than once.. but overall a good pick. Graphics are not great but the content and campaign should compensate.

Worth $5 but usually on sale.

For once i can't make a joke about this one! its amazing! l

Earth 2160
Like Earth 2150 but set 10 years later.

Earth 2160
The game is addictive.  The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack sets the mood.  The AI is challenging and realatively adaptive.  It is reminiscent of Warzone 2100 in that you can design units, albeit with some limitations.  My only complaint is that you can get into situations where cheats are almost nessecary.  On big plus for me is that there is no hard unit cap, only what you have built as far as structures.  If you want a fast paced RTS, then you will enjoy this.  Be warned though, if you want to avoid cheating, have a good idea of what your faction has available.


Earth 2160
After playing Earth 2160 for awhile. I have to say it's a really good game.

The one major thing I like about the game is the fact you can custimize your own troops with Armor, Weapon, Speed, Shield/Repair to help you fight against the race you are facing. There is tons of different unit combinations you can choose from for each race and it brings out the full RTS.

The Battles are fairly epic as well. If you are just trying it out, I recommand to play on easy difficulty. Medium/Hard is over the top for the AI's on some parts so you have a good challenge and epic battles.

Overall the game is entirly just fun. Sometimes you can get lost in it and lose track of time from having so much fun.

Earth 2160
Typisches Aufbaustrategiespiel. Spielt weit in der Zukunft (Wie der Name schon sagt). Das Spiel hat vier verschiedene Rassen, welche alle ihre eigenes Bau-, Forschungs- und Einheitenkonzept haben.
Fazit: Zusammen mit dem Zukunftsdesign macht das Spiel viel Spa mit Freunden (Vorallem, wenn man gegen die overpowerten NPCs kmpft).

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

This game is ly simple-minded and boring; that is my rating! It is not worth the $30.00 USD that it is being marketed for. Now what may I mean by that you ask; well allow me to explain.

Blitzkrieg 3 is nothing like it's predecessors; the infamous Blitzkrieg and Blitzkrieg 2. Both of these games were traditional RTS with different twists in game mechanics and plot lines. Blitzkrieg 3 has no plot line, and is more in line with a crappy Warlords or Clash of Clans (yes....dare I speak that name) in the sense that your only goal is to either bash endless amounts of player-owned bases" or engage in poorly designed "Historical" missions. It is not an RTS but is more like a Mobile App game that has been given the skin of Blitzkrieg. There is no Map for you to conquer

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Absolute trash.
I want to like this game.
I REALLY want to like it, but as of now this game is almost a chore to play.
Infantry are near useless, Allied tanks out perform Axis armor, building up defenses for your base is fun, but good luck actually defending it.

Please avoid until they fix the gleaming difficulty disparity of defending your own base.
Please avoid until they fix the marshmellow shooting AT emplacements .
Please avoid until they fix the bore of attacking the same map over and over to farm for materials just to make minute changes to your semi permanent base.
Please avoid until they fix the overpowered artillery and air support.

Please avoid until they fix the game.
It spits on the entire franchise.

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Below is my original review, unchanged from when I published it.  I wanted to write an update.  As of 6/27/2015, the devs are adding real PvP against real players.  While I admit in my review that it isn't my cup of tea, it was also why I felt some may not like this game.  The fact that they listened to those who wanted real PvP is awesome-sauce.  And I wanted to send a big kudos to the devs for continually making this game better.
============================================

The single player campaigns are similar to Blitzkrieg 2, albeit the RPG element of it is lacking in comparison to Blitzkrieg 2.

The multiplayer campaign can be explained very simply.  It is Clash of Clans...world war 2 style.

Before you say Cool" or "No way!" (depending on how you feel about Clash of Clans).  There are some differences.

The main difference is no waiting.  You don't spend "gems" or some equivalent resource which can only be obtained with real money.  You build your army

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

This could be the first clash of clans ww2 mod for pc-games as of yet.

The graphics are marvelous & stunning, the way bullets ricochet of structures and how the tank engines whirl. 4/5

Micromanaging basically leaves you a bit wanting.

Regarding gameplay, you place about 3 main structures on a map and also a couple of defensive structures, then you get the opportunity to attack another players same setup and your repeat this, you repeat this and you repeat this x4 then you are out of tries for a day and get to wait another day to do it all over again.

In between this you get enough loot to upgrade about a tank, a soldier, and if you are doing really good, also a building.
There is absolutely no resemblance to the blietzkrieg 1 or 2 in the way of multiplayer battles of epic proportions that we are used to, none whatsoever. You dont have any communication with other players ingame at all, period.

I just paid 30 for the opportunity to raid the same maps, and basically the same base setup about 10 or 15 times a day. Ill give the developers the benefit of a doubt and hopefully they will change the direction this game is heading. When that happens (hopefully) ill be the first to thumb this game green.

I cant get rid of that annoying feeling that I feel cheated of a good game somehow......

I don't quite have a good feel about the game just yet,
But i can say,

Nival shows us how a Early acces tittle should be, The basic game is working there are no obvious bugs.
They keep the players informed and post Polls ingame.

Whats not to love about this approach?

For this alone i'd recommend the game.

Early Access Review

Top notch, old school Blitzkrieg fun. Wirbelwinds and Nebelwerfers; what's not to love? Developers seem a good, dedicated team, and the game is regularly updated and patched. 10/10. Would love to see the Deutsche Afrika Korps/8th Army added   to the mix. Where's my 88's?

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

This is a quite interesting project so far and it's going to be even more promising in the future.
Pros:
- Two big modes are sure to make it into the release build: Singleplayer Campaign Mode (somewhat close to the BI classical campaigns) and Multiplayer Campaign (imagine a Clash of Clans in WWII setting... without constant donations reminder and the urge to watch the progress of your base each few hours).
- Classical isometric view on warm and homey 2,5D graphics. Just like the old times, but with better effects.
- Rock, Paper, Scissors gameplay in a whole - vehicles are good at destroying defences, infantry has something for everyone (apart from defences), and defences/obstacles when put in place can cripple any advancing enemy.
- Developers are listening to the community, setting the highest priority to bug hunting and making the most wanted features come out first.
- Great oldschool music, artwork, map decorations (some - with borderline humour)... You'll like it when you notice it :)

Contras:
- It's not BI as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong - It's a fun game to play, but it's just not Blitzkrieg I. Not yet.
- BIII is kinda poorly balanced on higher, advanced levels. I believe it will be fixed soon, but atm t5+ of the headquarters can be pain (imagine fighting Pershings with your KV-1s).
- It's still Early Access. Expect to have some minor pathfinding bugs (I've met no other).

Overall result?
I'd say it's 7/10 for old Blitzkrieg players, 8/10 for Clash of Clans players and 9/10 for those dissapointed in Company of Heroes 2 fantasy-like setting (such as myself).

Update 11.24.2015
Game has surely evolved a lot since the last time I've launched it in the September. All sorts of improvements are here and ready to go:
1. Pathfinding got fixed in a small unit groups. Yes, tactical combat still requires a lot of micromanaging but hey, it's what the Blitzkrieg series was about since like forefer.
2. Developers really DO listen to the Community. All of the suggestions I've made as a regular Community member were answered to. Some made it into the game (like treating fortifications as if those were units in the means of a balance).
3. Generals provide a unique experience with each and every faction. You can customize both your army now and the defences of your base like you see fit.
4. Most balance issues are now gone, whilst 'Sauron's eye' should be fixed IMAO. It is a little bit too much OP.
5. Numerous UI improvements here and there finally made the game easy to navigate.
6. Should be first, actually... Now you can switch maps in Multiplayer Campaign. Yes. You can.

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Blitzkrieg 3 - Review
Story:
Blitzkrieg 3 takes place in WWII Europe, where you control three forces through their battles:
Germany conquering France, Russia conquering Germany and America fighting for Sicily.

Gameplay:
In singleplayer, the game is a typical RTS, you command units, that are either added to your forces by you freeing them, fullfilling objectives or just as reinforcements. You have no impact on the types of units that your army is made of, so you basically have to adapt to your army, and not the other way around.
The three nations have the same units, maybe with minimal slight variations, but the overall gameplay is the same for all. And this is where strategy comes in:
The game is basically beatable with very few, very basic strategies, once you learned an effective way to defend/attack you can always go back to that, since
all nations play the same. Thus the singleplayer is nothing special.
The multiplayer on the other hand features something very unusual for this genre: You are provided with a base, the size of which grows with your level,
that you need to build up and defend with units and structures from other players. Upon an enemy attacking, your units are controlled by AI. You gain resources
over time, that you can use to buy and upgrade units and structures. When attacking, you are matched against a random player of similar level and have to fight their setup. It is an interesting concept, very often seen in mobile games.

Pros:
+Nice graphics, creating a fitting atmosphere
+Troops speak in their native language

Neutral:
~The multiplayer gameplay is new for this genre, but often seen on mobile devices
~Singleplayer offers nothing special

Cons:
-The singleplayer is very basic
-All nations play the same
-There is no straightup 1v1 battle

Conclusion:
I don't think I can give this game just one score, so I went ahead to give it a singleplayer-rating and a multiplayer-rating:
Singleplayer: 6.5/10
Multiplayer: 8.5/10

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

This is a fun game that is being updated on a regular basis- I'm not sure why there's so many negative reviews. For me, the pros and cons of this game are as follows:

Pros:
- Fun to build defenses and adjust them after watching replays of people attack your defenses
- Plan attacks and decide what force composition to use based on what general you use
- Quick games- they cap out at ~15 minutes
- Fairly rapid progression, with accruing bonuses based on how long it's been since you've played
- No microtransactions, so you avoid pay to win scrubs

Cons:
- It's not as complex as Company of Heroes - the tradeoff being that you don't spend an hour on each match
- Graphics are dated

If you want a WW2 multiplayer RTS fix but don't want to play Company of Heroes, this fits the bill nicely.

The game is great & loadded with great ww2 weapons in addition it has better graphics than coh2 however it needs to have skirmish mode,
also the servers needs to be improved a lot as connection lost many times inside the game & hangs during game loading


Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

I was hesitant at first to review Blitzkrieg 3, due to its mixed reviews on Steam. But given that its still in development, I figured Id give it a shot, and Im glad I did.

Blitzkrieg 3 is a fantastic strategy game, with features I havent seen elsewhere. The key thing to remember is that its not Company of Heroes. It isnt about moving your troops cover-to-cover. Its about blitzkrieglightning war. Its Pattons no holding ground strategy, and the strategy that allowed the then-evil Germans to steamroll half of Europe.

It also doesnt feel like a WWII game. You can play as Americans and still fight against Americans, and the same goes for the Soviets and Germans. It feels more like a post-apocalyptic war-game with WWII weapons, where you build your defenses and raid the camps of neighboring tribes.

Now that we have that out of the way, lets get to the point: these factors are what makes Blitzkrieg 3 fun. While one side needs to try and plow through the enemy, the other side needs to build a base to defend against the attack, and this means finding all kinds of creative ways to ambush them.

The game starts with you at your base. You get a set number of fuel and supplies to spend on upgrading building and units, or on your defenses. The base building is a game in itself, because your base is technically a full map that other players can attack at any moment.

Think of it like Home Alone, only with tanks and guns.

Early Access Review

Grew up with Blitzkrieg 1 , loved it. Never played Blitzkrieg 2 because of the bad reviews and it wasn't really that much better. But this game is a completely different story.
You must know that you are buying an incomplete game which is still being updated, so dont get too upset about some bugs. i find it well playable.

Now the great thing about this game is that it is being developed exactly as the community asks. The developers regularly put polls in the main menu of the game and are also very active on these forums.

Looking forward, this game is going to get much better. they are working on a new gamemode which allows for more than 1v1 combat (2v2, 3v3), which is where my roots of blitzkrieg are. (large battles, reinforcements and such).

Also, If you are comparing this to CoH, Don't. this is different.
Because in that game (loved that game also), you are building a base while fighting and build new forces while in the match. in this game you pre-place stuff and use that to fight untill you are annihalated (or time runs out).
With the new gamemodes it will get even more different from CoH.

I hope to have steered your mind into buying or not buying this game by writing this review :)

Even though there are many negative reviews, I would like to rate this game positive. Of course it is in an early phase, but:
1. whenever I needed help developers or customer service responded less in 12 hours!!!
2. the game is constantly improving, every month new features and bug fixes
3. you can customise your defence/attack defences... but it is not a clash of clans mechanics, because when you are online you can defend your own base! so basically a 1v1

If you have some money to spend it on a promising WW2 game. I recommend you to buy it. And join Germany, because we will eventually kick the Russians and Yankies out :p

Don't get the hate on this game, I assume people are disappointed when comparing this game to BK1 or BK2 however I think that this is also a good game but with a very different approach. It plays like a f2p clash of clans in some way yes, however the game does it very well and base building is fun attacking also. Only thing this game really needs is a better singleplayer and when they add that, I think the older fans could be more satisfied aswell

Early Access Review

Friendly speaking I don't know why this game has so low user rate. Guys, check out other EA games - it seems that Blitzkrieg 3 guys are learning fast not only on their but also on others mistakes. It is RTS, it is not another one franchise action no-brain game. Graph is ok, gameplay is ok. Of course it is not finished yet and rather overpriced. But think in another key - this price let us play with guys who are so interested in RTS genre so they are ready to pay this money to try EA title. Thats rather fair - you are taking part in developing the unfinished game.
My personal rate is 7/10 for now. Hope I will have more reasons to rate it as 10/10 in future.

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

So after 6 hours of gameplay and 32$ -_- I'm saying this game is a no. Why? because it's a watered down Company of Heroes 2 meets Clash of the Clans. Now I like Clash of the Clans, and I enjoy Company of Heroes but this game is missing a lot of the core concepts maybe they will add them but at this moment it's a no.

This is only for multiplayer

Pros (+)
-easy to learn
- Hard to master
- Setting up base defenses can be fun
- Assaulting can be fun

Cons (-)
-Maps are not balanced
- little to no differences between countries. Every country is the same
- those stupid 3X multipliers
- the combat just feels dumbed down a lot. (by this I mean, only two types of cover for infantry, buildings and bushes.)
- I loath the battle timer, you have 10 minutes or shut down. This makes you feel extremely rushed, you can't do proper scouting missions and plan any type of assault. Make it a bonus to do it within 10 minutes not forced.

(What feels lacking)
- Proper cover mechanics
- Countries, I signed up for germany so why am I assaulting German Bases?!?! If you're going to do Countries, make us feel united. Give each country strengths and weaknesses, Germans should have better armor, americans should have better infantry and russians should have better support or something that justs make dividing lines and give us a country chat, allow people to form divisions and build together a unified base then if someone wants to assault our unified base it would be 10 players simultainiously assaulting it together. Make this game feel like a world war!
- This game has great potential please use it :)
- Also I know this is an in development game and all but 32$ atm is too much.
Have a nice day and I hope this makes you add it to your watch list!

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Here's a basic idea of what Blitzkrieg 3 is:
You have your base. you can't buld production buildings but you can and will build defence buildings. From that you then build your army and attack bases like any IOS/FB strategy game. But unlikse those who are all F2P and nickle and dime you, B3 gives you everything at the start all the buildings, you just need to upgrade them to get higher units or defences.

I'd recomend the standard edition of this game. Most of the stuff that's in the dlux isn't in the game get from what i hear.

Here's my list of Pro's and Cons.

Pro's:

They take a IOS/FaceBook strategy system and make it fair. No timers or pay to speed ups.
It's quite tactical in both offence and defence.
Quite fun.
It's getting patches/update.
Base defence.

Cons:
Match Making will screw you over ; eg. going up against a base with units a level 1 or 2+ higher than you. You won't win but might get a cap zone before you lose all your units or time ends.
The Match Maker. More or less same as the first point. Saps fun real quick but doesn't break the game.
Pathfinding is non exstant.
The FaceBook/IOS strategy style. Quite off puting till you see a bit of the gameplay.
Really my big beef is the MatchMaking but that's getting fixed this week.

Over all i'd give the have a 5/10 right now with the  of a MM. But when the MM gives you a base fitting of your army it's a 8/10.

good graphics and not to demanding. you cant build a base" like command and conquer style BUT you cancustomize just about everything about your home area. you have 6 main buildings. hq tank depot barracks research center and a few others. you level up your structures with materials you earn from winning battles against other players. in all you can build your defenses to protect your home while your away and you can watch the replays to see where you weak points are. you slowly grow the size of your force over time and upgrade them as well. its basically like clash of clans online but with a world war 2 setting. the replayability is outstanding and the devs arent lazy as the game stays updated. worth the money."

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

If you enjoy incredibly simplistic RTS games that only require you to point and click without thinking this is for you, if you enjoy crappy Facebook games this is for you, if you enjoy clash of clans or boom beach this is definitely for you.

I haven't played enough of the original BK games to judge them but this is one of the most bland, boring and simplistic RTS games I've ever played apart from the stupid mobile ones. If you've played COH,COH2, Men of War or ANY RTS game post 90s/early 2000s this game is gonna make you want to physically torture yourself because atleast that wouldn't make you as bored as this game does. Tank combat is pretty much just really vague flanking or tanking from the front with no form of special abilities you can use to gain an upper hand or change ammunition types, its just point and click. Infantry combat is even worse, I can't even firgure out if there's a proper cover system in the game but right now its just about having better/more guys or placing them in buildings.

The base progression thing is kind of cool...if you've never played a mobile game/facebook game in your life. I honestly don't know what else to say about that.

Now the least important but worth mentioning anyway are the graphics, animations and sound. First off the graphics are not awful but they're not amazing either, especially when you zoom in. Animatons are pretty awful, they feel really cartoony sometimes especially with tanks as they look like they're toys or something out of a cartoon and lastly are the sounds, music isn't memorable which I don't care too much and all ambient, gun/explosion sounds etc are bland and boring.

I would complain about the fact that all you can do is attack other peoples bases but we got PVP gamemodes so maybe that might improve things. I honestly suggest you buy a game like Men of War AS2, COH or COH2. Hell maybe even go back in time and grab the game Stalingrad, based off the old BK engine yet the game seems to have more depth and complexity than this one. Maybe a year from now Ill check the game out again and maybe it'll be better, who knows.

I just started playing this game and I love it and recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of WW 2 strategy games. The only problem i've run into is that sometimes my units and buildings both in defence and offence battles become invisible at random times(not a big issue the Devs kick bugs out pretty quick) but other then that this game rocks.

This game is in BETA. so please don't get it if your not willing to play an unfinished game! That being said, it plays great for a BETA, Online and off. This game has turn based stratagy very fun and addicting! will keep you playing for hours, if your looking for a great RTS, You have found it here in Blitzkreig 3 and yes I have played and love the old versions of this game in the past. Just a modern version with refreshed graphics, easy to use interface with standard rts controls that most are used to and some new inovations that definetly make this game compete with other rts games on the market today!

Early Access Review

The game is doing everything right in terms of different strategies deciding for victory or defeat, while cutting the ressource management and basebuilding in favor of more pace in the game. It's also refreshing that the factions are balanced by having different strengths or weaknesses than a pure mirrored factions approach.
It also runs remarkably well for an early access version, with patches and insights coming weekly, often incorporating player feedback. Now let's just wait for the single-player missions and a better tutorial and I may just double my game time.

Who am I kidding, I'm hooked anyways. Multiplayer and theorycrafting about the defense mode is just too addicting for any armchair general.

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Got 10 minutes to attack the enemy base.

Deployed my assault force (2 Hetzers, 3 Pz II.Luchs, 1 Sd.Kfz 222 and some infantry)

Got instantly rekt by the spawn camping enemy base defenses.

Only the Sd.kfz 222 left.

Sneak around the entire map avoiding mines and detection, notice that all the enemy forces was at the spawn and manage to capture the enemy base without meeting any resistance.

Returned to base with the loots.

Stealthy RTS / 10

The gameplay is quite alright, if you're into old school RTS like the previous Blitzkrieg game.
Graphic is amazing, the map and effects are just gorgeous.
So far with 10+ hours into it (non-steam) I'm a bit sceptical about the asynchronous multiplayer, Its like Clash of clans but in WW2.

Campaign is almost as the same as Blitzkrieg 2 but with some enchantment and major graphic improvement.

You can't compare this game with the others WW2 RTS game such as Men of War or Company of heroes, because this thing here is something else.

Highly recommended for Blitzkrieg fans, but for those who are still in doubt go watch some gameplay videos and visit the game website for more informations and do a little research on it, because you shouldn't take my word for it. I'm not not Jesus or something dammit

Really nice game, has a lot of potential and good developers that listen to their community. The game itself is not expensive, but the Deluxe edition is quite of it, it should cost 9.99 or 12.99 but 19.99 is little bit expensive. Game mechanics and innovation is good. I think it needs a little bit of optimization, it runs me at 35 - 40 fps at High preset, my specs are not the best but here they are:Geforce 820m 1gb, intel pentium 4x core 2.42 ghz 2m cache, 4gb ram, 1tb hdd and 1366x768 LED. It runs Mowas 2 at 55- 60 at medium-high, coh 2 low - medium w/low AA at 20 - 25 (horrible optimization, it doesn't have the greatest graphics), Wargame AB at 40 - 45 medium-high, All Source games 50+ FPS. Great game, great developers and greetings from Chile. Keep up the great work !!!!
Note: I updated Graphics drivers and tested all games FPS that i mention here, so i edited them above.

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

So Blitzkrieg 3 is in my opinion a WW2 light RTS game. The multiplayer is a carbon copy of Quest for epic loot with a WW2 theme. You dont actually fight online opponents. You build upp a base with defences and raid other players bases to get more resources and upgrade your base.

During these raids the opponents base is controlled by an AI same goes for your base when invaded. If you are into that its ok. But dont expect VS multiplayer couse there is none yet.

My biggest gripe at the moment is lack off control of your units, by that i mean you cant tell your tanks which way to face and you cant give your infantry units orders like throw granades, run, or take cover.. Your units do this bythemselves hence why i call it a light RTS game.

The graphics are Ok. The sound's are mediocer at best, machine guns sound more like pee shooters instead of machineguns. It has destructible environments but nothing compared to CoH2. Unit movement and behaviour is not very realistic. Tanks move and turn way to quick instead of feeling like lumbering metal beasts.

If you want a more standard WW RTS i would reccomend CoH2 instead. Better audio

After playing the game and going thru all the teirs and up grades that are available,it is a great game. Not one who plays a lot of online games, But a fan of the blitzkrieg series it is some what of a challanging game. like most all games there is a point where it could get repetitious but where this game is different it allows you to challange your self if you take the time and effort to do so,even at this point i have learned new things to challange my self as well as others in pvp. The pvp is the best part of the game in my view,and the game has not even released yet.

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

As an early access game, Blitzkrieg 3 has a lot going for it.  However, early access also implies that you'll be receiving an incomplete or flawed experience from that of a retail (launch) game.  All of that said, I will try my best to provide an unbiased and objective review, detailing the qualities and deficits that Blitzkrieg 3 currently has.

Pros:

[+] Excellent graphics.  Beautiful, highly detailed maps--there are animals, roaming vehicles (trains, cars, etc.), and people who are doing daily tasks.  Trees fall down as tanks run into them, fortifications explode and crumble, and shots richochet off of vehicles creating an impressive realism.

[+] Base building.  Organizing your upgrades is always fun.  There are tradeoffs to consider as you are leveling up, because you can't possibly level everything up at once.  Do you want improved infantry?  How so?  Do you work on individual upgrades to existing units, do you upgrade research options or upgrade the barracks itself?   The tradeoffs aslo exist in how you upgrade your defenses.  Do you want a widespread defensive network, or do you want a few key structures that are hihgly upgraded?  The options are impressive.

[+] Strategy.  Despite what others are saying, there are lots of strategic options that open up conisderably the more you unlock and play.
-Command points can be spent on a variety of support options.
-Artillery to weaken defenses
-Smoke screen to hide advances
-Spies to scout the bases
-Reinforcements

[+] Army composition.  The options are pretty limitless here.  There are four classifications of vehicles and five classifications of infantry, and determining how many of each can be a very important decision going into battle.

Cons:

[!] Pathfinding.  This is something that will presumably get better over time, but right now tank pathfinding is horrendous, at times.  This becomes even more apparent the larger the vehicle is.  And taking into account that as you upgrade your vehicles, you replace them with a larger chasis (stug to jadgpanther for instance), this makes it even more problematic.

[!] No expanded multiplayer options.  Currently, there's only 1 v 1 asychronous battles.  I love the asynchronous battles, by the way, but I'd love to see 2 v 2 and greater options implemented.

[!] Building off the above, there are no integrated community options.  No friends list, no chat system, no way to invite others to look at your base and basically zero player-to-player communication.  [This is a huge negative]

[!] A lack of unit explanations.  I would love to see a detailed tactical tutorial or in-game guide.  Right now I have no idea how to use an MG squad versus an assault squad versus a normal rifleman squad.  All three seem relatively samey

Blitzkrieg 3

I will get the negativity out of the way first.

The connection to servers are horrible. I keep on disconnecting when i'm in a match and i lose my attack bonus for the day. It's really annoying.
The income rate is horrible, and my resources don't come in when i'm afk which i feel should be changed.
More units and better names for them would be nice. I would love to see some SS Stormtroopers in my army.

Now the good part.
This game shows a lot of promise. The base building concept is very interesting, and i hope to see more from it as the game slowley develops. The combat seems fun and engaging, and there is a great sense of realism to it.

Early Access Review

One of the best rts I have for years.
Good:-They manage to rebuild the art style of the first game,visual,sound and atmosphere.In 3d and much more details.
-The clash of clan mode is fun and tactical,well balanced.Maps are much bigger and with multi route,it is more of a slow pace strategy game than the castle rush type.(You got 10 to 15 minutes,but you will punish hard if you rush into any defence line.So no rush,take your time.)Make it both fun to attack or defence,and grow your army.
-No simple A better than B counting,try rush any of your tanks into enemy's infantry and you will be nail.

Bad: -Unit's path finding is a mess.
-They are still working on the pvp mode.
-No countries advantage(Allies tanks are smaller,I wounder if that count),which is easier to balance,but I wish they could bring up a division system.
-This is a DRM game,you may alway be online,but the DRM server wont.

The game is still in development,so alot more could improve.But overall this is a fun beta game to play,or you could wait to see if the full game worth the 30 dollars price tag.I personally cant wait.

This game is great I love it.. it's evern better and more challenging when you get to attack a live player or a player attacks your base.. aside from the tank destroyers being riddled with bugs the game is very playable and very easy to learn / understand.. the only downside to the game is that once you have chosen a faction from what I can tell you can't change your mind. I picked russia and I fancy a go with germany, I have got to teir 7 now and I would really like to start the experience again but with the knowllege I have now.

BK 1 WAS THE BEST PUT BK 3 GRAPHIC  WITH  SAME GAME PLAY OF BK1 AND U GET THE BEST GAME EVER MADE

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Game can be fun when it`s completly ballanced out. I really like the idea behind it. But at the moment it`s still dissapointing.
Line of sight is completely ruining the game in my opinion, you can use one infantry unit to scout the enemy positions and then  a defence with way too many howitzer barrages. I spend hours on creating a good defence with measuring out killzones and positioning my fortifications only to find out my opponent can take one infantry unit and use it`s line of sight to call in way to many barrages and wipe out all my hard work without being able to counter it with anything at all. After bombing down all your defences they just roll in 8 heavy tanks or tank destroyers and destroy what is left of your fortifications ( with of course using the line of sight from an infantry unit and the massive atack range of the tanks ).
Since the opponent bombed out all your units allready you don`t have any line of sight yourself anymore, and your opponent just takes out what`s left of your units using the fog of war. Any tank you roll in to defend gets spotted and destroyed before you can even see your enemy. Exept for spotting infantry is completely useless. If you garrison them in a building they will just get bombed to hell or taken out from a distance by a tank destroyer, if you leave them in the open, well... nvm.

Not going to be only negative about the game. I like the idea of building a defence and getting the time to make it as you like it to be. Other than a game like COH where you don`t get any time to organize defences and get overrun before you can even place one building, this game let`s you choose when you are ready to be attacked, so no stress and when you are ready you just accept a battle. At this time i think 30 euros is a bit too much for the game because the part i would spend the 30 euros on ( building and spend time in sorting out a good defence ) is not working for me. As an attacker i`ve won like 40 out of 60 battles in total, defending 3 out of 30 with 60 hours of reviewing and modifying my defences.

Blitzkrieg games feel empty without a proper single player campaign, but so far so good for an early access game.
The only problem I see(aside from a very few content) is the connection issue; even single player campaigns are in risk of connection time-out/cuts (devs, please do fix this).

Anyway, if you're new to Blitzkrieg games and should this be your first, I recommend to have a little more patience until this game is fully released before buying this or try the previous games; well, either you're a Blitz veteran or not, BK3 will feel different as it has much more arcady approach. Unless you're interested to WW-2 themed asymmetrical multiplay, then grab the game.


Pros:
+gameplay is interesting and fast
+asymmetrical gameplay is addicting
+graphics are aesthetic and looking fresh (the battleground feels quite alive)
+it still has the combination of realism and arcade just like BK1 and 2 (realistic vehicle armor value plus HP bars)
+each countries are unique

Cons:
-connection issues
-off map artillery (except rocket arty)



tbh, I'm a bit disappointed, but then again it's early access - too early to judge since the game has a lot of potential and the devs are quite approachable (compared to other RTS games *cough* *cough* CoH2)

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

I heartily recommend holding off on this purchase at the time of writing.

I see potential in this game. While the people comparing this to offline defence mobile games are not wrong, I believe this kind of gameplay can be an engaging experience. Others will talk about high-level balance, but I have only been able to sink a short time into this game due to the following concerns:

1) Unclear instruction. The tutorial currently gives brief highlights of where the first couple of buttons to press are, but after that, nothing. It is a trial-and-error system to figure out what you must do. I was confused. Still am, although after two hours I think I have most of the interface figured out.

2) Bugs. Yes, the game is early access. But you knew that, it's an early access review. Regardless of the release state of the game, I am here to say that the current state of bugginess impacts the playabilty of the game. Objectives dissapear from your screen and there appears to be no way to get them back. Unit pathfinding struggles immensely. You cannot target units behind buildings (you will target the building itself). There appears to be no way to adjust a unit's heading when controlling it in battle, causing micromanagement dances when trying to get a tank to stop reversing into the enemy.

3) The game seems to spazz out pretty horribly if you have a less-than-stellar internet connection. I have a less-than-stellar connection, but I am able to play other online games without major issue. This game freezes near-constantly, and for seconds at a time while playing. Worse, it does this WHEN TESTING AGAINST YOUR OWN BASE. Meaning, even what should be a local single-player experience appears to communicate through the game's servers.

4) Attack/Defence balance does seem to be massively off, though others with more time in the game will have better opinions on this. Simply put, the defender and attacker appear to get the same number of units. As any RTS player will tell you, this is an automatic win for any semi-competent attacker. Concentrate on one point in the enemy's defences, and it's pretty much right-click to win. The attacker can even continue to call up reinforcements to replace any lost units.

Until such time as all of these issues are resolved, I must strongly advise against purchasing this game.

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Early Access Constructive Criticism :D No Donkey sh1it!

1.	To my pleasant surprise, the narrative in the tutorial mission alternated between Russian, German and American forces. I love the way the developers choose to give different perspectives during the same session. Its an interesting way of displaying what kind of impact, your actions have on your foe, as the perspective changes.

As you get the chance to play thru the eyes of your rival, you immediately see the aftereffect of your consequences. Its a new take on storytelling, its very entertaining and refreshing.

2.	Cool moments: During a tutorial mission, you are given a few German infantry to clear out a poor Russian village. And here I was, in the middle of nowhere hoping to spread democracy. Oh, well! We musn't disappoint our fuhrer, maybe we will find some MANA vodka.

I split my infantry into two squads. I started off by sending squad one to occupy an empty house on the outskirts of the village. This immediately started a firelight, my first squad was taking incoming fire from a house further up the street.

I tactically maneuvered my second squad thru a forest into an assaulting position on the flank. Using the new ability assault building, my second squad dashed forward out of the bushes into the house, screaming, pulling ears and vomiting on a chicken, ending up with five Russian KIA inside, oh and we found really fluffy teddy bear in the basement, to celebrate our victory, my heroic soldiers baptized it PUTIN.

3.	Sniper Unit - Sounds inaccurate in game. Last time I checked, yelling wasnt part of the sniper weapons inventory. I swear to God, every time you give the sniper an order the dude goes ape sh1it, and starts screaming patriotic slogans.

The entire idea of having a dedicated unit going stealth, is silence. At least put some effort into making him act covert and whisper in response. Small changes to sound, can make a big difference to the atmosphere and characteristics of a unit.

4.	There seems to be no function at the moment to see your troops behind objects. And with such a rich and beautifully detailed environment, sometimes its hard to pinpoint your units in the field, you constantly need to reselect the units to find them.

Sorry, but I dont want to spend my time searching for my troops on the battlefield. Especially when there is a mission timer involved.  Some sort of highlight is needed to distinguish your troops from the background, Men of war dose this brilliantly. Take note.

5.	Ability About face - Being a Company of Heroes player for many years. I found myself selecting a vehicle and trying to drag the front armoured part towards the enemy. Im abruptly, startled and confused when I realise that no such function is available in Blitzkrige 3.

Its 2015, happy new year! Abilitys like About face should be at my fingertips, and not hidden away in the far-flung-bottom right hand corner of the UI menu.

Yes, yes, I know! There is a Hot Key, you can press R. But thats so 2005, Im not stating that simplification is bad. But coming from a CoH frame of mind, my RTS behaviour is tuned to having fast and responsive controls. In the current state, I dont feel that responsiveness is coming thru in Blitzkrige 3.

I know there is a red compass-marker you can utilise to set your vehicles direction, but that option is way too sluggish and clumsy to use. Having an instant clock, with an arch of fire, popup underneath your vehicle is faster and better way to do it.

Why not include a more fine-tuned approach of controlling your vehicles for those that want that possibility. Instead of this barebones, point and click. There is definitely room for improvements to be made regarding this issue.

6.	At the current state Blitzkrige 3 does not offer any cover system for infantry. This is something that we should expect by todays standards. There is a missed opportunity here in NOT letting the player use destructive environments as part of cover.

A lot of effort has gone into creating a detailed destructive environment for Blitzkrige 3. And the developers have succeeded. I just wish the developers made the collateral damage more than just eye candy.

Let me illustrate an example.  - Battle for Monte Casino, On 15 February 1944 the abbey was almost completely destroyed in a series of heavy American-led air raids. The bombing was conducted because many reports from troops on the ground suggested that Germans were occupying the monastery, and it was considered a key observational post by all those who were fighting in the field.

Only after the bombing were the ruins of the monastery occupied by German Fallschirmjger (paratroopers), aiding them in their defence, because the ruins provided excellent defensive cover.

The point Im making, is that the destructive environment in Blitzkrige 3 could have been utilized to benefit both sides. This could have created some unique variation of strategies in battles. What you get instead is repetitive gameplay, with limited paths of approach.

7.	Which brings me to my next point, I find it odd that the developers of Blitzkrige 3 strongly incentivise the concept of artificial intelligence for defensive purposes, in base mode. Calling it core component of the multiplayer experience.

Yet, the game is lacking any meaningful Ai behaviour, the way Ai responds to human players is with basic triggers, which activate on conditions. Example: A is true, there for activate B and repeat, basically.

Someone once said, The best defence is an offense! So far, I havent found any way to change Ai behaviour perimeters when defending your base to aggressive stance or turtle defensive, hit and run or balanced tactics.

Its not fair to say that the Ai is inadequate. It dose its job, but it doesnt like to deviate from a set path. Doing anything complicated like taking the initiative or making a surprise manoeuvre is out of the question. Its all scripted and predictable behaviour, dont expect to encounter General Rommel in the field, anytime soon.

8.	One more thing, the tip popup in the tutorial disappears to fast, its stressful and should be fix. This problem is especially hard on new players, who are trying to learn the game.  Your popups dont have next tip or a back to previous tip buttons. WHY! WWwwwwhhhyy!!! WHHHHHYYY!!!!... . .. .why!

9.	OMG! I have no idea what the designers or concept artist were smoking when they created this Modern-bluish-sci-fi-metallic-transformers looking UI menu, Im pretty sure it wasnt water vapour. For the LOVE of GOD, the current UI doesnt fit the WW2 themed framework at all, change it.

Other than that, its a good early access start.

Dont forget to thumbs up if you like my preview and would like to see more. Dont be a stranger leave a comment. Cheers 4 reading.

With less love BatSithCrazy!

Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Even though i've only had this game for a short time, i enjoy the hell out of it. One of the main reasons is that its a new concept. It's similer to ( but absolutely nothing) a nation builder were you upgrade your defenses, buildings, troops, etc.
The tutorial needs quite a bit of work but is thankfully skippable. Once you're past that, the game is terrific. the RTS aspect with that special twist really makes it unqiue and oddly enjoyable. I myself am horrible at RTS games, but i really do enjoy this game! There is a lot more to this game that makes it such a unique experience, but dont hesitate to buy this game becaused of the mixed review.


Blitzkrieg 3
Early Access Review

Vorab, es kann sich noch viel ndern den es ist Early Accsess. Wer ein Spiel erwartet a la Blitzkrieg 2 wird mglicherweise enttuscht sein den so wie es sich jetzt prsentiert liegt der Schwerpunkt eher auf den Multiplayerpart.

Das Grundgerst dazu ist gut aber die Umsetzung gefllt mir nicht. Es geht darum die Basis des Gegners zu erobern und dafr hat man 10 Minuten Zeit was dazu fhrt das es in hektisches geklicke ausartet.

Fr ein Spiel auf dem Handy wre es ok, aber fr den PC reicht es einfach nicht.
Ehrlich gesagt habe ich mir mehr erwartet.

Simply Chess
Only two factions.
Both factions have the same units.
No ambient occlusion.
No skins for your units.
No season pass.
No story.
No gore.
Basic animations.
No base building.
No resource management.
No mods.

And none of that matters because this is the greatest strategy game ever made and a working, free version, of it just hit steam.  Simply chess is the centuries old game we all know and love. The simply" moniker is paramount here as many chess or chess-inspired games have shown themselves to Steam before but none have seemed to get it quite right. This one does. Play against a scalable AI

Simply Chess
Pros:
-You can play chess on Steam.
-With your friends.
-It's free.

Cons:
-Many friends do not play chess.

Simply Chess
It lacks a lot of features that are in most chess computer games such as notation, a clock, and the ability to drag your pieces to move.

EDIT: You can now flip the board in whichever direction you please so at least the developers are paying attention to what needs to be improved. Hopefully this means more improvements in the near future.

Simply Chess
First game on steam with ads in the game where if you do not want to see those ads you have to pay. It creates a bad precedent. Do you people really want to see ads even when you are playing games?! It stars with little games like this and then other developers/publishers will copy it.

You can play online chess on http://en.lichess.org.  You have difrent looking 2D and 3D options and sound etc.
I do not know if that site has ads since I use adblock so I see none.

It is nice to have a free chess game on steam. I wanted that also but suporting a game with ads in it is not a good thing.

Update: they closed a topic  So what's with the premium account? Ads? Where? When? " where people where discusing in a polite way about ads in the game.  Developers did not like that topic so what did they do? They just closed it down. if that does not tell you enough about those developers then I do not know what will."

Simply Chess
I love chess

Simply Chess
Online play needs a timer. Too many people going afk after the fact that they know they will lose. Had this happen to me 3 times now. Everyone goes afk. Find a better game to play online than this POS.

Simply Chess
Queen OP please nerf and only 1 faction with a reskin

But for real it's a very well made game for what it is.
2d and 3d both works well.
100 dificulty level allow any level of player to play
very costumisable when it comes to look.
good port from the board game.


Simply Chess
TL:DR - Chess.com is the better free chess game, especially for online play.

Some things to know about this particular implementation of chess:

* Two clicks to move (one to select your piece, one to move). No drag-and-drop option, which is the biggest dealbreaker for me.
* Online play has extremely limited options for time controls (fastest is 1 minute/turn, second fastest is 10 minutes/turn).
* Computer play has no time controls and 100 difficulty levels simply labelled 1-100.
* Ad-free premium is $4.99.

I can make a case for this being a decent casual tablet game, but otherwise I would rather go onto chess.com.

Simply Chess
I can't even beat the computer on level 1.

In fairness, that's nothing to do with the AI.

Simply Chess
Why does a chess game have controller vibration?

Simply Chess
Avoid. Avoid, avoid, avoid! You want free chess? There's several different things you can get instead of this. This is one of the worst implementations of chess I've tried. To the developer: if you have to release yet another chess program, at least make yours stand out. This one has nothing. It doesn't look very good, it has awful AI, it doesn't have normal chess clocks (fixed time per move instead), it glitches, and there are some serious very basic problems with it. Let's name a few shall we?

* It puzzles me how the AI levels were implemented for single player game. Both on level 1 and level 100 difficulty, the opponents makes moves like he was a monkey and picked the random one available. It places pieces on squares where they can be captured and in general plays terribly. For reasons I can't comprehend, it is stronger for example on level 45 difficulty, but don't expect fireworks.
* I started 2 online games and both times the board was flipped the other way. My pieces were on the top. I had white and I was moving pawns downwards. That's the weirdest thing ever... I searched for a button to flip the board to actually view it from the perspective of my pieces and I didn't find it.
* Music glitches at random moments starting to make a repeated choking noise like a stuck gramophone.
* If you lose internet connection, even while playing single player, you'll be bugged by some cryptic error messages covering your scren

On top of all these problems, it keeps annoying players with advertisements.

Why would you want to play it? Other than to farm cards or perhaps gain achievements if you're an achievement hunter. And also... Why would anyone give this positive reviews? In the field of free chess, this one is a step backwards. Not only other existing chess programs and services are better and more professional, but also they are actually free and don't annoy you with ads every time you start a new game. If this game was another genre, it wouldn't have any positive reviews, because people would just say this is just a terrible rip-off of XXX

Simply Chess
Haha it was total free and after 1 day they brought the premium account feature without advertisements... Nice try developers for a crap board game where you can't even flip the board when you are black.

Simply Chess
Edit: I played this again and attempted an en passant and the game crashed. Definitely needs some polishing.

Edit 2: Disclaimer: Since the game is free to play, I'm not attempting to disuade people. The developer seems to at least be interested in bug-fixing. This review is based on my experience pre-patches.

~~
As a chess fan, this isn't bad. Had a single match vs a level 1 opponent and it went well. If this is was a project someone put together, it's pretty decent.

For a free to play game, I can't say much.

The quality of the music is terrible. The music broke about 5 minutes into the match anyway so it wasn't missed.

The game logic is standard as per other chess games. Didn't notice any problems and the computer player predicted most of my moves on level 1. A minor feature that bothered me was the lack of dragging pieces. Clicking worked fine though.

Overall, it did what it was supposed to. However, the reason I'm not giving this a recommendation is there are much better options elsewhere. Some polish could have been put into it before pushing it out (free to play or not.)

Simply Chess
It's chess... on Steam.

My life is complete.

Simply Chess
Online Chess is now free on Steam with Simply Chess, a more than decent chess game with a variety of multiplayer and single player modes. As a chess fan its probably what you want from a chess game. If you like chess you should try Simple Chess here on Steam, you might just like it!

Simply Chess
Absolutly a worthy steam version of Chess.

Gamewise:
- Clean UI
- Ellegant 2D Chess board
- Smooth gameplay
- Good classical background music
- Stockfish based AI with 100 difficulty lvls

Steam integration:
- Steam Achievements
- Steam Leaderboards
- Local / Online Multiplayer
- Supports Steam Controller

The best chess game on steam so far! Cannot recommend enough!

Simply Chess
Finally!  A chess game.  10/10.

Simply Chess
Well guess Steam has chess now, thats the good thing, the bad thing is it looks and act like a sleeping dinosaur that could make nanotechnology look ancient and tedious, which is a remarkable achievement in itself and may very well be the strongest asset of the game.

Pros:
Its chess (Duh)
Its very simple (we do puns too)
Its free (excluding the money youll spend on Kleenex wiping off your tears)
Online mode (youll need popcorn)
100 different difficulties (they are actually not that different)

Cons:
Its very unpolished (except the 3D black pieces they are way too polished)
Play with the 3D pieces and the black pieces blend together, like tiny liquid snakes all over the board. (not including the cardboard box).
The sound is horrific (its a perfect sleeping aid though, huge plus)
The layout/graphics (was this made by a cave painter?)

The main issue with Simply Chess is its too simple, with the vast amount of better chess games available  outside of steam, several of them free too, its a bit odd that Simply Chess doesnt bring anything to the board aside the fact its available via Steam. But hey its chess and still fun, off to try level 100.

Simply Chess
IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS GAME EXISTS, THEN DO NOT WRITE A FVK1NG REVIEW!
I am only writing this review because this game does in fact deserve positive feedback. I am very disappointed at how the Steam community immediately give negative feedback to newly released games as if the game was already in its finalized form. This basically gives the developers no morale or reason to continue improving their game since the rating has already been decided by the sheer ignorance of the community.


Why I think this game deserves a positive review?
Because it is on Steam.
Because it has access to Steam functionality.
Because it allows you to invite and play with your Steam friends.
Because the game actually works as intended.
Because you can do all that for FREE!
If you do not have friends, then go to fvk1ng https://www.chess.com/ like any normal chess enthusiast, and blitz against GM Hikaru. You didn't know that a massive chess community has existed for years in plain sight with all the features and functionality you were looking for in this Steam game? Why are you even here?

Don't write a review as if you know what the F you are talking about, you ignorant piece of chess!

On a side note, a lot of the negative feedback has to do with the developers' inability to market their Free to Play game properly. Seriously, why would you put ads" as something to feature when the game clearly doesn't have them apart from the 7 seconds of developer showcasing? That's basically the same as Intel

Simply Chess
As someone that is both a gamer and a chess player, this game is just bad, these are the pro's and cons:
+chess is a fun game.
+It's on steam
-No custimization.
-moving the pieces is done poorly.
-Buggy as hell.
-chrashes all the time
-Timer you can't see and is too short for actual thought.
-ELO is done oddly.
-ELO is not accurate. (could be because new.)
-AI level achievements are grindy

All in all. just sign up for a free chess game.

Simply Chess
It's chess.
On Steam.
It's free and offers single-and multiplayer locally and online.

...

Have I mentioned that it's chess?

If you really need more information to decide whether you want this game or not, here goes:

Gameplay:
Simply Chess is a turn-based strategy game with gameplay mechanics that closely emulate tactical warfare scenarios including multiple specialist units that need to be coordinated with the goal of ending the oppressive monarchist regime of the other side's king (as opposed to the benevolent, generous and generally awesome monarchist regime of our king). While the attempted targeted military assault on an enemy head of state may sound like a brutal, bloody premise, it should be mentioned that the graphics have been toned down to a degree that lets you easily forget that this game is basically about two armies trying to obliterate each other.

Sound:
There's sound. If you like classical music, you'll like the sound here. Because it's classical music. Also, no dying screams of the lowly soldiers whose hopes, dreams and future are thrown away to enable the continued decadence of their ruling class, so that's a plus. Or not, if you're actually into that sorta thing, you creepy, disturbed human being...

Characters:
The units in the game each have unique... I guess we could call it special moves. Or just moves. Let's go with directional capabilities.
Yeah, the unit types all move differently. In terms of balance, the game does a good job of evening the playing field between the two sides, even if White tends to have a systematic advantage, getting a headstart in the default mode (which one may change if one is so inclined).
Other than that the factions in the game are not all that different from each other - a stroke of genius that supposedly aims to make the player think how both sides in a war are usually just staffed by poor schmucks who get to suffer the consequences of their respective leaders' poor life decisions.
The game has strong RPG elements, such as upgradeable units (pawns can level up to become queens if the requirements are met) and... yeah, no - that's it.
I'm sure that, given enough time, the developers will get the hang of balancing the various units in the game - as of now, queens are hopelessly OP and just waiting for a nerf.

Difficulty:
The single-player AI can be adjusted from disinterested cat randomly trying to push pieces off the table" to "knows how to play chess much better than I do" up to "dear Kasparov

Simply Chess
Started game online against some random, ruined him, he raged and quit, that was 4 months ago, still sitting here waiting for him to make his next move...

10/10

In all honesty if your opponent is losing, he/she can just quit the game and officially the game will never end, so yeah until that's sorted out just look for a decent site online.

UPDATE: There is indeed a function for a time out option, you can set it for 1M, 7D, 30 D etc. It was there the whole time, you just have to look for it.

Simply Chess
It's chess...
Cool to see the Steam Turn Notifications in a game, but feels kinda uneccessary for them to be here.
Make it a toggle maybe? When I play chess I usually take around a minute to make the next move.
But hey, it's free, so try it ;)

The only real negative thing is that the Linux (and probably Mac version as well) isn't native, but it's not a very advanced game, so it doesn't really matter.
And achivements doesn't seem to work either...
And ads doesn't work either... good...?

Simply Chess
Some people say this game sucks, other might not.
In my opinion is a good free chess game, it has a lot of tweaks in-game and is good to play alone against AI.
It's free and only weights 300MB so you only may lose like 10 minutes if the game doesn't suits you.

It has patches almost everyday and the game itself keeps evolving" in better ways.

At this day (04/10/2015) i give it a 8/10.

-Fischer"

All of the people giving this a bad review are wrong. This is a chess game that's free on steam, it doesn't claim to be anymore more or anything less than that. It's exactly as advertised and it's free to play. I'm not sure why people are ing.

Simply Chess
Everyone's playing checkers, but I've been playing chess for years. 

Simply Chess
Imagine a chess game in which you get errors cuz it cant calculate what you did... this is how bad this is... can be pretty meh too after 5 turn music crashed and kept making weird noises near the end it just couldnt determine what state the game was in... anyway... dont even bother trying this out

Simply Chess
great for 1 vs 1 with a friend.

Simply Chess
ez game. finished it in 1 hour.


***ppl need to stop acting like it is a PAID AAA game.

Simply Chess
What can I say? It's simply Chess with a simple premise.

Simply Chess
Was looking for a quick and simple chess game my son and I could play without board setup and takedown.  This covers it.  Thank you developer for creating this for the community!

Simply Chess
It's simple and it's chess. Two things every tripple A game out there lacks.
What more could you want?

Simply Chess
eh, there is better chess on yahoo games.

Simply Chess
Played The Game On Level 100 Difficulty , Lost in 3 Moves . The Biggest Wtf Of My Life . Won't Even Try Multiplayer . 10/10 Demotivating Simulator.

Simply Chess
The online is terrible, the offline bugged out the first game. Not much else to say.

Why is it so hard to get chess right on steam?
I dont understand.

Simply Chess
This game is everything I wanted it to be. Simply chess. Chess, probably the greatest board game of all time, with no t, just chess. It has pawns and , even ing knights! It's brilliant. So, if you like chess, download this . If you don't like chess, what the hell are you doing here? If you think you might like chess, grab this from steam, its worth it and here's why.

Even if you have no idea how to chess this game is worth it. Rules and moves can easily be looked up in the game, there are a hundred skill levels for playing against the computer, so no matter how good or bad you are, you can have a fair match.

Everything is very basic and simple, which I consider good. You can either have a 2D view of the board, or a nice classic 3D chess set.

The singlebest thing about this game though is the multiplayer. The only thing I don't like about chess is that pretty much nobody else I know likes it. Now this is a problem of the past. No longer do I have to nag people to play chess with me in real life.

As far as I could tell from the couple of hours I've played there is a decent amount of opponents to be found in multiplayer and if not, it's easy to organize a game between steamfriends. The only thing this game could have done better is the chatsystem for multiplayer. It would be nice to be able to talk to your opponent in the game itself without opening the steam overlay.

The best thing about this game though is that it is free! Yes, that's right!!! That means you don't have to play any money!!!! It's so ing incredible I'm not even ashamed of my use of multiple exlamation marks!!!!! (!, !!, !!!!!).

So big thanks to whoever made this chessgame happen on steam, if you ever need your  sucked give me a call.

Simply Chess
This is a game with chess that is free, with integrated multiplayer.

It has ads, yes. But they can be removed for a reasonable price.

The dev team have been quick to fix bugs, and have kept in constant contact with the community. The game is plain, and could do with some improving. But it is clear that they listen, and for any issues, just approach the devs through the discussions.

On a side note, anyone complaining that this game is free, and saying that is a bad thing? You are absolute morons. It is free, and to try to use that as a negative purely on the basis of it's being free is inherently anti-consumer. You can literally test out if this game is for you, without paying a penny up front. Buy premium if you want to feel like you've bought this game. otherwise, just enjoy that it's free.

Of everything on steam, a decent, free chess game with a responsive developer is a breath of fresh air, compared to all the pay-for Slaughtering Grounds and Temper Tantrums that just want your money and don't care about quality.

Of course, this isn't the best chess game out there. but with the dev team pushing through the bugs, and their quick response time to critique, I've no doubt in my mind that this game will get better.

Simply Chess
Product received for free

I mean its chess guys , interweb chess. stop being so negitive . 10/10

Simply Chess
As long as websites like lichess.org exist, it's hard to reccomend this. The matchmaking lobby is unintuitive, the games are always displayed from the host's perspective, meaning anyone who joins a game has to play upside down. Other than that, there's simply not much here that hasn't been done better elsewhere. If you want an excellent online chess playing experience I recomend:

lichess.org
chess.com
Or even Gameknot

This is Simply Chess, and this is simply my review!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The multiplayer is just great. You can 1 v 1 people just with one computer and battle randoms!
The multiplayer does'nt have anyone on there, i know the community is'nt dead but why is this?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can change the chess peices and the look of the game over general. Alot of variation and is very good.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Playing against bots is as great as playing against another human player!
There are a selection of levels and you can pick which one to verus!

So for people that dont wanna read here is the summary.
8/10 Amazing Chess game with many ways to play but not much online matches.

If you're black the board doesn't invert and it gets awkward to move. chess.com does a way better job and it has no download.

I really like to play it and it's fun to compare yourself with friends.
Pros:
+ It's Chess!
+ It's free!

Cons:
- The 3d mode could be better.
- Timer is missing, so you need to use your own clock to not run out of time when think about your next move.

Simply Chess
It's Chess, what more can you really say?

Pretty simple and good online multi-player!

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
For those that missed the first episode of Sonic 4, this is a 2D platforming game staring everyone's favorite blue hedgehog. The plot is the same as its always been, but with a twist. Dr. Robotnik, the evil antagonist of most every Sonic game has now teamed up with Metal Sonic! The dude with 90s attitude isn't alone though, he now has Tails to go with him. With Tails, come new mechanics, such as jumping into the air, and calling Tails to lift Sonic like a helicopter. If you're on the ground and use the tag button, it summons Tails to combine the two for a super fast attack. If you need to use the helicopter ability, the game will have a little billboard to tell you. This game feels more a kin to the Game Boy Advance games than the original Genesis games which the first episode clearly drew inspiration from.

In Episode 2, you have four zones with three acts each followed by a boss fight as a fourth act. Not just that, but later into the four hour game, you unlock a playable Metal Sonic with four zones and one act each. These zones use assets from the first episode. So in all, there are 16+ levels for you to master. These levels feel a lot longer than the first episode and the Genesis games as a whole. Some levels feel like six minute marathons with no end in sight.

The levels are big and offer many paths to the exit. You'll have to avoid an array of enemies, spikes, and even death traps. You'll collect rings everywhere and these rings aren't just because dullards love shinny things, but as long as Sonic has at least one ring, he can take another hit. Even if you have 100 rings and get hit, only 30 will spray out of Sonic. When you get hit with no rings, it means death for the fuzzy blue guy. There are plenty of check points in each level if you die. A game over simply means that you'll need to start the level again. If you collect 100 rings in a level, you get an extra life. If you have 50+ rings at the end of the level, a giant ring will appear that will take you to a special bonus stage.

These bonus stages are updated versions of the old Sonic 2 bonus stages. You'll follow Sonic running down a 3D half pipe. You can boost and jump. There are a few check points that need X amount of rings to get past. So as Sonic, you'll solemn down the tube moving left and right, collecting rings and dodging obstacles that will lose you rings. At the end you'll find a chaos emerald.... that somehow isn't green. Whatever. Collect all seven to unlock a yellow Super Sonic.

New to the Sonic 4 series is local co-op and even online co-op, but since the game came out in 2011, good luck trying to find a partner. There are online leader boards for time attacks. It adds to the replayability I guess, but more than that, the game has a red star ring on each level to collect. These rings are either tough to find or tough to get. Its an extra challenge for veterans.Sonic and Metal Sonic play the same. Left and right to move, with a single button to jump. Hold down to duck and hit the jump button to start a spin dash to get momentum to go up slopes. You still need to charge it which takes time. That's why the airborne dart attack is not only a much better way to gain speed instantly, but you can also lock in on targets accurately hit them no matter what the angle. Episode 2 didn't make as much use of the homing attack as the first episode, but it does make travel easier, darting for an enemy or a springboard. The only difference between Metal Sonic and the ordinary version is lack of an ally. No helicoptering around or bowling through enemies.

Calling Tails just feels slow. Tails automatically zips right back to Sonic wherever he is, unless he just died, but it just halts the game to wait. The Sky Fortress kicks off with an airplane mission that has Sonic atop Tail's plane that gives you full control to move the plane left, right, up and down. Complete with Sonic able to jump and attack. Under normal circumstances, I'd think it diversifies gameplay having a plane dodge enemies and twirl through barricades to destroy them. This felt like a slow auto scrolling level (act). There was still a part where the 2D platforming returned, but then it was just back to being on top of a plane. It felt dull, slow and boring. Then having to fight the boss on the plane was unfun.

The real snag that I have for this game is how long and dull the boss battles are. They take traditional, classic boss battles and completely twist them around into mega bosses. See I like the twists and fighting giant bosses, I just don't like how tedious every boss was. Having to damage each boss for three minutes before the final phase of the boss fight left me clueless and dead ate up most of my 4 hours in the game. These 3 minutes on each attempt felt like 10 and I was never in any real danger. It wasn't a challenge surviving the 3 minutes, it was just a delay for the real challenge. At least the game takes full advantage of having Metal Sonic as an enemy. You get three boss fights against him.

The game has other down sides too, like a timed race against sand flooding an area. Sonic needs to go up, breaking through barriers, then down. This would separate the casual players from the hardcore. It ate up two dozen lives and was quite the difficulty spike. Then on the final two levels, when Sonic went down hill or uphill, the entire screen would shift so Sonic wasn't running downhill, he was on a horizontal plane. It was disorienting, and might cause someone motion sickness.

Water areas feel better in this game than they have in the past. Sonic jumps higher and Tails can carry him, so you have more maneuverability. Under water still slows down Sonic and he can't swim. If you're underwater too long, Sonic will need to get oxygen from big air bubbles that drift their way up.
The soundtrack feels Genesis in a good way. Percussion and synth horns. Its all upbeat happy game music. The graphics are bright and vibrant. There is a good color pallet here. A dusty yellow castle with an aquatic greenish blue moat. A winter wonderland theme park, lit up for a holiday with blue ice water. A metallic sandy red oil rig in a yellow desert. A yellow sky fortress with fans to propel Sonic into the air. Dr. Robotnik's gray and purple metal lair. As each zone progressed, the acts would change their color pallets so you'll see day turn to dusk. It all adds to making each of the three acts feel different. Having Metal Sonic's 4 different zones with 1 act each adds a lot of diversity, even if 3 acts each would have been nicer.

Even with all the bad, its still a good game. Better than most other 2D platforms out there for $15. I enjoyed the first episode better, but it felt like they took the gameplay a step in the right direction. If its on sale, take a risk.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
I want to get this out of the way before starting this review, why was this episodic? This easily could've been the next main series Sonic game as Episode 2 looks WAY different than Episode 1. But was it for the best? Yes. The engine has been updated for full 3D graphics like in Sonic Generations and the physics have been fixed, which was a major problem in Episode 1. Another problem in Episode 1 was unoriginality, which Episode 2 changes around (apart from Not Wing Fortress Zone). The bosses are now not complete jokes but I found the Eggman bosses annoying and enduring complete with a 17 second loop boss theme. I have much more enjoyment with the Metal Sonic fight in White Park before Sky Fortress ruined his reputation. The music is still Mega Drive samples but I found more catchy tunes in this game than Episode 1. Also, this game has Tails who follows Sonic like in Sonic 2 and you can perform tag actions with him, like flying, swimming underwater and 69. So is this an improvement over Episode 1? In my opinion, yes. Still not worthy of the name Sonic 4 but it's a decent improvement. 8/10

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Gameplay:Sonic 4 EP II is compared to EP I a hell lot of better. The movement is finally working and doesn't feel weird anymore. The soundtrack is still great and the game does not feel anymore like a rip-off. It's fast and the highlit of the game are the boss enemies, because you haven't seen those boss fights in previous sonic games. It feels so more fresh and more like a unique game. Summed up you can say: Average Levels and Awesome boss fights.

Rating: 7/10

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Have you ever thought maybe sonic the hedgehog goes so fast because he's running away from his feelings...........

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
I honestly don't know why Metacritic gave this game poor reviews. It's a vast improvement over episode 1, the only complaint I have is that it was too short and I want more!
If you're a sonic fan, you'll absolutely love this since Metal Sonic makes his much desired come back. Even if you're not into sonic games this is still great for platformer fans. I'm glad that steam users gave this game positive reviews because it certainly deserves. The game is totally worth the price and I hope some day Sega decides to make more episodes.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
A huge improvement over Episode 1, with a lot more challenge and more feautures, this game is a true sequel to the first one without a doubt. Where the hell is Episode 3 though?

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This game has online co-op! And it works well. It's not like the Sonic 2 co-op, where Tails will just get left behind. You just have to tap a button to reunite Tails and Sonic. The online seems to be sturdy. I had a little bit of lag during the final Acts, but it never became unplayable. But don't expect to just find some rando online, because I don't think many people even REALIZE the online co-op exists. It's not even listed on the steam features blurb. Plus it's a million times better than Episode 1. Skip right to episode 2. And don't believe the people who say this game is the worst Sonic game ever." It's FUN. And the music and level design are both on-point. The homing mechanism is a little bit broken

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Well sorry that I've enjoyed this game. I liked Episode I and this one have better grapshims, better controls and better soudtracks. However, it seems that the problem come from a unbalanced difficulty, a load of vicious moments and a very hard final boss. It is way harder than Episode I.

 74/100

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Personally don't think the game deserves such a low metascore, I thought it was a drastic improvement from Episode 1. Movement and controls feel more fluid and the level design shows they can still come up with something original. Found the boss battles to be fairly challenging and more entertaining than the first episode too. A solid Sonic game.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
I much prefer this to Sonic 4 Episode 1. It feels a lot more like a proper Sonic game, desipte the occasionally gimmicky co-op stuff. A great bit of classic 2D Sonic, I hope they make more and continue to improve...

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
I definitely like sonic 4 episode 2 better than episode 1 mainly because it has more characters, plot, and a better flow overall to the game. The only 2 things I don't are the game has to show a pop-up everytime you complete a zone and that it's not long enough. The sonic and tails roll ability is unrealistic and makes the game too easy in my opinion, even though it's a cool idea, I just think it needs to be implemented in a different way like in an item box. All in all it has beautiful graphics, physics, and boss fights. The reason I think it has good physics is because it doesn't seem too fast or too slow in my opinion.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Tails killed me by stealing my air bubble. Too much water in the starting levels. 7.8/10

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This game is very fun,i had it on xbox and me and my brothers had so much fun! I would also reccomend purchasing episode 1 to play as metal sonic in Episode Metal" on episode 2!"

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Huge improvement over the last game. Improved Graphics, Sonic feels fast this time, and music didnt feel so repetitive like before. The game introduced some tag team abilites that were interesting and worked well. Got to the first boss and i thought they were gonna rehash the totem boss with the arrows but it quickly switched switched to a more creative boss. They were probably poking fun at how the bosses were in the last one.  Metacritic's score is questionable.  Games pretty good overall.

4/5

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
A great improvement from Episode I. It has better graphics and Tails! The game feels like a mix from the Genesis Sonic 2 and 3. You can do combos with tails that include flying (even without a second player!) and other cool stuff that you actually use a lot during the game, giving it a new way to play Sonic. The only thing that I would complain about is the ending, that is pretty so-so". For the 2D series

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
New Sonic that feels like Good Old Sonic, clearly better than the Episode 1!
Buy it !

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Co-op Sonic! Do I have to say anything else?

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
It was ok. You'll like it if you're a Sonic fan, but it's not a good sidescrolling platformer. Episode 1 was far better. Buy this game on sale if you must.

The backgrounds and graphics were absolutely stunning. I liked the fact you had tag team abilities with Tails. When you do the spinny thing with tails it looks like they're doing a 69 which is pretty funny. Makes you realize that Sonic is a homosexual because he hates Amy and love Tails.

The platforming itself was quite lackluster. Most of the levels were just so easy it was rather boring. I really hate the handholding where the game tells you where every bottomless pit is and when you need to use tag team abilities. Can't I die once and intuitively know I need to use the ability next time? The music is also mediocre until it becomes grating because it's so repetitive.

I have little to no reason to replay levels as there's a save system. The game was also rather short, it took me 3 hours to get through all 4 stages and Metal Sonic stages.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This game is as good as the first one, and that's awesome.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This has to be one of my favorite Sonic games ever. Twice as good as the first part, which when I bought it when it came out on 360 I didn't see that coming. I love this game more than the 2D half of Sonic Generations, and that's totally the better half. Now I'm going to have to remaster this game, like I did with the first part, so I can have the same bragging rights again. Where is part 3 Sega? They came out with the two Sonic 4 games about a year apart from eachother, maybe less. WHERE IS PART 3! SEGA, TELL ME, TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE ME MORE SONIC 4! Can I double recommend this game?

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
While not as shockingly bad as Episode 1, Sonic 4 Ep. 2 really doesn't improve upon the formula all that much. It's a tired retread that doesn't come close to any of the Genesis games. There are positive qualities: The storyline is non-existent, a Hedgehog isn't revived by a kiss, the music is bland but okay, and um...yeah that's about it. More than anything else, I appreciate Sonic 4 simply because it makes the previous games look so much better by comparison.

Once again, the first major failing of Episode 2 is the level-design. Everything feels cramped. It's a combination of the camera being zoomed-in too much, a lack of anything note-worthy nearby, and a general absence of flow". All of the stages have this boxy feel to them. It's like they were slapped together by some sort of map-maker and the results are really unnatural. Good levels are supposed to be sketched out before-hand

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Game No 1 is meant for playing with friends that sit in front of one monitor or who are in one net! What a great atmosphere: your mistakes, your friend's mistakes, and JOY when you finally pass the unfortunate episode! In addition to Co-op one can also be very pleased with the disturbing bosses, colorful graphics and level design, interesting, and seemingly impossible achievements.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Way better than episode 1, this game is more like a Sonic game should be, still lacks a little in the music, but its is a fun game.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Sonic is a 2d platform game.

If I look to the old Era of sonic games.
Sonic 4 episode 2 is not bad and it has some good points.
You have many option to play and if you buy both games you get some extra stuff.
Still I prefure the old Sonic from the Sega Megadrive / Genesis era.

Game is very extended and there are many things to do .... even become super sonic and that is cool.
I still find the new generation sonic very slow when starting to run and missing the feeling having real speed.
Modern sonic has some cool moves like the dash move and this gives you a new dimension of playing this game.
PLaying with tails is cool and also give some new moves and ways to play.

Sonic is a good plaftorm game only try also the classic versions.

I give it a 7/10 score.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
After being disappointed with Sonic 4 Episode I, a return to Sonic's 2D roots that featured some ugly art design and a brutal phsyics engine, I wasn't expecting much from Episode II. Surprisingly though, I ended up having quite a bit of fun with the sequel. The physics engine is upgraded considerably and, while still not perfect, now feels much closer to the Genesis-era games. The hideous cel-shaded character design from the first episode was also ditched in favor of a cleaner look. Level design and boss battles are also improved from Episode I. The newly-introduced Tag Actions" feel fresh and make for some nice platforming sequences as well. On the downside

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Beautiful and Colorful Platforming Game.

8.9/10

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
"A Blast from the past"

Back in the day we had Sega and one of our most played games was Sonic the Hedgehog. This game brought back alot of great memories and made some new ones. Partner with tails to take on the oh so memorable Dr. Eggman and Metal Sonic.

If you played this when you were young you'll enjoy this now!

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
A great improvement over Episode I but still retains some of its mistakes. The main difference in this game is the addition of Tails and tag actions" which

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Isso sim que  SONIC! No falaram, mas esse jogo POSSUI SIM o ONLINE CO-OP! Muito show, principalmente quem  f das antigas. SUPER recomendo.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This game is probably the worst game the gamecube ever had to put up with. this is shovelware at best and just a disk at worst. a story is al ready terrible enough but him about sonic finishing" someone is just terrible.

sorry even in a game this bad i dont give the story away. The gameplay is... terrible due to bad camera bad controls and no sense whatsoever THE POLES AND SWORDS HAVE AMMO

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This game is much better than Episode I; the graphics and controls are better, the environments and bosses are more unique, and the music more memorable. Not saying it's a perfect game, though; I'd say that the inclusion of Metal Sonic was unnecessary, and I wouldn't go so far as to say it's worthy of being called a direct sequel to Sonic 3 & Knuckles. However, it's an enjoyable Sonic game, and for that, it's worth the recommendation.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
The Sequel to the one of the worst sonic games out there.
this is actually a solid game, and way better than the first sonic four episode.
The graphics are more sharp and it has a more sonic vibe to it.
The music is alot better this time around. ( same with the sound effects)
The gameplay is pretty fun, the platforming is fast, the momentum (while still a little wonky) is much more responsive, but The homing attack is still here and can be overpowering, also there are these little tag-team things that can get annoying at times. the levels are well made and are fun to play.
The bosses are a mixed bag but all-in-all they are really fun (some of them are based off of older games bosses).
The Metal sonic segments are awesome, so much fun to play.
The story doesn't really go anywhere, not like the older games.
Verdict: it's suprisingly not awful. 6/10

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
GOTTA GO FAST GOTTA GO PLAD GOTTA GO NOW

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Sonic 4: Episode II is a brilliant sequel to it's not so brilliant predeccesor, Sonic 4: Episode I.

Pros:
+ Level design is unique and fun to play
+ Music is good to listen to and some are very catchy (Can't get Metal Sonic's theme out of my head)
+ The psyhics for the game are fixed and no longer includes the ability to stand on walls
+ For around 500MB its a very good looking game
+ You get to play Episode Metal if you brought this and Episode 1

Cons:
- The co-op side of the game (the tag moves) can really put a weight down the fast-paced action
- Just like Sonic 4: Episode I, there are only 5 zones
- Some stages can be a bit tedious at times

The ability to play this game with a friend can add on a number of hours to your playtime and you'll be playing this game for around 10-20 hours. Even longer if you're looking for the Red Rings.

8/10

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Better than Episode I, but only a little. I don't mind Tails being back (I love Sonic 2 forever) but there are some incredibly lame combine" gimmicks. The best thing about it is the special stages based on the ones from Sonic 2."

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Great visuals and great music at points, still not a great game though. Recommended only as part of the whole sonic bundle, not worth the money on it's own.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Sonic 4 Episode 2 is a game I'm completely inconsistent with. I played it for half an hour and thought it wasn't worth playing through, played it again from beginning to end and hated it, and then played it through again and honestly thought it was on par with the Genesis games.

In comparison to Episode 1 it's definitely better. The physics are improved and the graphics no longer look like New Super Mario Bros. but worse. A lot of people complained that classic Sonic was absent from the first game, and took it way overboard, but I kinda do agree that modern looks really unnatural here. Thankfully there's a mod for that anyway if it bothers you that much.

The game controls a lot better than Ep1 and it's at least satisfying in this game, but still not quite as solid as in the classic games or even Generations. Sonic feels like he lacks weight on the ground and momentum building isn't quite right, sometimes requiring homing attack spamming just to reach your max speed on the ground.

The level themes are all blatantly reused concepts with the exception of White Park which while I can compare it to some levels it doesn't outright copy anything. I hate the fact that a game selling itself as Sonic 4 is almost nothing but recycled levels and enemies, but the levels themselves have so many new concepts that it's still pretty fresh as a whole, and the likenesses of Episode 2's levels to classic levels isn't as offensive as in Ep1... with the exception of Sky Fortress which is nearly identical.

The game's visuals are absolutely gorgeous. I'd say Sonic 4 Ep2 is the most scenic game in the series. It's incredibly polished visually. I can't say the same about the soundtrack, though. While I initially really hated it, I realized on subsequent playthroughs with Super Sonic available I never used him for just one reason; I didn't want to stop the level music. While I do actually really love the compositions themselves, the instrumentation is horrid. They clearly went for a Genesis style tinny-ness to the synths but it just sounds awful on some tracks, specifically Sky Fortress Act II and the Death Egg's theme, two songs which I would actually really like if they used better synths.

Oh yeah it's also really short. This game has five zones in total and 25 levels in all if you count the boss levels and special stages. I think with a casual runthrough of both this and Sonic 2, Sonic 2 would still be longer, but I consider Sonic 2 to be fairly short for a Sonic game I dunno. Completing the game without all of the Chaos Emeralds yields a message to go collect them, but there's really no reason to, because it does nothing to the ending. Little Planet is still stuck inside the Death Egg while Sonic and Tails feel good about themselves in their escape pods. This could be thought of as a lead-in to Episode 3, but as of now Sega has no plans for one. One of the developers has said that they might make one if Ep2 sold well. Did it? I dunno but I certainly don't want the Sonic 4 series to end like this.

The game was actually short enough that I turned to achievement hunting to elongate it. Which was odd as this was after I'd already had my fill of this game and dismissed it as another bad Sonic entry. I actually WANTED to come back to collect achievements and actually found a lot of fun with the game, both in gathering the achievements and just playing the game itself. However I will say that the achievements are absolutely pointless. Certain gameplay elements like the Red Rings and presence and abundance of rings before boss encounters were clearly just implemented for the game's achievements on release, but getting said achievements has no bearing on the actual game whatsoever. Collecting all the Red Rings or getting the last hit on every boss as Super Sonic, none of this affects the game at all. It doesn't even have a list of the achievements in game so really it's questionable why they're even there other than to make this short game slightly longer.

All in all though I did find a lot of fun with this. The game's length as well as reused settings are the biggest problems, but they're pretty well made up for with a beautiful presentation, pretty enjoyable music and most of all a lot of good level gimmicks and physical designs. Is it as good as the classics? Eh, probably not, if only because it's not completely orginal, but I had just about as much fun with it anyway.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This is the game that every fan of the classic sonic games should own

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Sonic the Hedgehog, that little blue ball of fur. He whizzes around in a blur. Faster than a speeding bullet. The thrill! The exhilaration!

Those wonderful feelings that come to mind whenever I think of Sonic and his buddies. When thinking of a character like Sonic, it's hard to separate nostalgia from true feelings. Hopefully I'll be able to do that!

Sonic 4: E2 is a fun platformer. Colourful landscapes, and cute enemies create a vibrant atmosphere. The graphics are acceptable for a 2D game in this generation. The game struggles to run on low end machines, even those that pass the system requirements. The game just isn't playable with system lag, or low FPS.

The gameplay is okay, but I do have a few issues. To me Sonic was a different kind of platformer. It was all about whizzing through the levels as fast as possible. I got great joy from timing my jumps just right, getting enough coins for the special levels and bouncing off the enemies on the way. Unfortunately S4E2 doesn't feel right. Sonic at full speed feels sluggish, and that's a word you never want associated with our heroic hedgehog. I never felt out of control, Sonic never flew off the screen. Some people might call that a good thing, but I think a fair few fans would agree with my perspective.

I was able to play some levels co-op. The levels are the same, one player controls Sonic, the other Tails. The problem with co-op is as soon as one character gets a little bit away from the other, the player behind has to use the catch up button. This just made the game feel like a chaotic mess. However, this chaotic mess was extremely fun. It enabled some awesome near-death escapes.

The game is trying hard to be like the 2D Sonic games of old. It introduces some new abilities, like forming a super-ball of death with Tails (which is the best way to go through 80% of levels), or dashing through the air by double jumping. Ultimately this is where it fails. It's an okay platformer, and it has a pricepoint that reflects the length of the game but it doesn't stand up to classic Sonic games.

Whilst the game does not stand up against previous Sonic games, it is quite a fun platformer. The levels are a nice length and fun to run through once. There isn't much replayability there though.

Bottom Line: Fun co-op game. A little lacklustre when compared to classic Sonic.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Does everything Episode I did, but better.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Does everything Episode I did, but better.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Rehash and slash Sonic 2 in half.  Not that great.  But a steal on sale with co-op to boot.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
super fun and way better than the first

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Probably one of the best modern 2D platformer ever made!

The only real complain I have is that it's pretty short... You can complete it pretty fast.
And also, there aren't really so many mods for it at all...

Anyway, it's a really good game worth buying! Also, the multiplayer is pretty awesome as well.

I would give this game 8/10

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
i couldnt go fast enough :/ :/ :/ :/ :/

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Yeah! Gotta go fast! Run real fast! You're too slow! Way past cool! Totally radical! Gotta speed up! Chili dogs! That's no good! Yeah, suck my !

NOW WITH CO-OP!

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
The better of the 2 episodes. I, for some reason, enjoyed this one more than Episode 1.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
This game deserves the name sonic the hedgehog 4 unlike episode 1. Sonic controls like sonic and now we have tails. Of course the levels are inspired from earlier games but they are done well and the addition of the tails moves make it different enough. I recommend this game to any fan of old school sonic, it's the best sonic game in years.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Massive improvement over Episode I. The art direction and some of the game mechanics would not feel out of place in a Sonic Generations level. The physics have been revamped and feel closer to how they should feel. Metacritic score is too low, and probably skewed by the extremely low number of reviews (and from no-name sites) overall. The main failing is an over-reliance on the tag team mechanic with Miles, which can bog the pacing down at times.

Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II
Fun is fun, same with this game. SEGA used something from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (dreamcast or pegasus i don't remember). Anyway single is good but best fun (I mean REAL fun) is when playing multi. And there is a problem, NOBODY PLAYS IT. So if you don't have friend to play better don't buy it unless you are big fan of Sonic.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
I bought this game, it wasn't on sale, I bought my friends copies too, I have many regrets and no more friends.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
The Call of Juarez series is one I'd definitely recommend giving a go. Every game in the series is distinct and has its own identity, which is something I really appreciate. I'll avoid going into too much detail about the rest here, but they're all a good time with individual strengths and weaknesses that form a satisfying whole.

Unfortunately, the defining characteristic of game number three, The Cartel, is that it's an utter shambles. The classic Wild West setting of the previous games was ditched for a staggeringly uninspired modern-day Los Angeles/Mexico counterpart, which is exactly as appealing as it sounds (i.e. not at all). Likewise, the hole left by the entertaining and likeable cast of the first game and Bound in Blood (like legendary gunslinger Ray McCall) is filled with some of the flattest caricatures to ever spout tired one-liners. Once all the character and charm of Call of Juarez has been stripped away, what you're left with is a medicore first-person shooter that is an absolute chore in single-player and probably not much better in the new co-op mode. Solo players be warned: your AI partners are incompetent, and they will make no effort to hide it, though they will continually belittle your performance as you carry them for the game's entire duration.

Lackluster AI, boring gunplay, dull visuals and an uninteresting plot combine for eight hours of unmitigated tedium. The only saving grace is the way the game ends, which could have been a pretty cool conclusion to a much better game, but is of course held back here by being part of The Cartel. In retrospect it's good that the series had one final outing after this, though The Cartel remains a testament to how quickly good games can go bad. It's almost worth playing just for that lesson, though I'd suggest you try any of the others over this rubbish.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Weak link in Call of Juarez series. Why modern world? Ubisoft attempted to make this game like Call Of Duty but messed it allright. Finally understood its mistake and a miracle born; Gunslinger. Play Call of Juarez, Bound in Blood, Gunslinger and ignore this one.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Let me start by saying I really do enjoy this game, it really isn't as bad as the reviews say. However, I completely and fully say do not bother with it on Steam. The uPlay is absolutely awful, and the game refuses to play on every computer I have tested it on (and I am FAR above even the recommended settings.) After attempting to start new game, the game crashes and you are taunted with a Thank you for playing Call of Juarez: The Cartel" window from ubisoft.  those guys

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
I have finished about 1/3 of the game. So far so good. I would love to give it thumbs up. But unfortunatelly i will have to do the opposite.

I cannot continue.
On first day everything was fine. Uplay and steam worked fine together. Accounts were conected and i have seen no problems.
Day after - Uplay doesn't allow me to log in. Too many log-in attempts". Rubbish. If 0 is too many then f*** you ubisoft. Click on play offline - to play offline log in to your account... Argh...

UPlay is steaming piece of s***.

AVOID BUYING ANYTHING THAT REQURES DOUBLE DRM (especially if second drm is uplay).
Sadly CoJ:TC is one of those games.

:(

UPDATE!

Uplay kindly allowed me to log in after some time

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Even though I'm giving it a thumbs up, I have mixed feelings about this game. The Cartel is the worst game in the Call of Juarez series, but it does have a few features that other games in the series (and even many co-op FPS games in general) don't have and make this game unique and somehow enjoyable to play. I would recommend this, but only when it's heavily discounted and you've got one or two friends to play in co-op with.

PROS+ Good campaign mode with an intriguing (and underrated) storyline and characters, 4 endings and amazing soundtrack. It includes co-op mode, which is required for the full experience.
+ Replayable: 3 playable characters each with their own objectives, roles and dialogues (e.g. talking with different characters on the cellphone). Playing the story once with one character, in fact, may lead to plot-holes.
+ Varied levels with car chases, nightclub shooting, highways and more.
+ Random challenges mid-game (e.g. kill X enemies before the other players). It kinda kills the teamwork sometimes but I find it to be a nice addition, also because the main characters, plot-wise, don't get quite along with each other.

CONS- Unfinished: the game got released when its development wasn't finished yet. It is technically horrible, with dull graphics, many bugs and audio issues. Expect frustrating moments.
- The main menu and the first levels are dull (luckily the game gets slightly better and more interesting afterwards).
- The gunplay, the driving and grenades.
- No drop-in joining (players can only join your co-op match at the start of a level).
- Multiplayer is dead.

Personal rating: 58/100

The game as-is, is MOSTLY technically horrible, but if you can get past its technical issues and focus on everything else, you might enjoy it in co-op with one or two friends.
If only Techland had more time to develop this it could have probably been a masterpiece; co-op mode is good and unique, the story is decent with memorable moments, but the rest is heavily unpolished. Dead Island, which is made by the same devs, got released in the same year.

Tip before you play: don't tell your friends what you're doing and what your character says in certain moments for the full experience!

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
This game's co-op, which was what I bought it for, was somehow more broken than I imagined. It doesn't help that this game is also just effluvial grime.

Verdict: Don't do it!

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
An extremely mediocre offering and I write this as a RABID Call of Juarez and all things western fan. I went into this looking for even a schlocky B-movie sort of good time after purchasing it on sale and I had to muster a LOT of courage to make it through to the end. Disappointing gunplay, terrible driving segments, paper thin characters and plotting, only play it if you're desperate for a gritty crime shooter and you've literally played everything else on your backlog. A huge disappointment. The series was thankfully put back on track with Gunslinger and I expect great things from Techland regarding the future of the franchise. But this one?

Keep clear.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Call of Juarez is a western-themed FPS game series released by Ubisoft. The Cartel is the odd one out" in this series as it is the only one taking place in a modern day setting instead of the good old Wild West. Interestingly

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
bad boys, bad boys... whatcha ya gonna do? what you gonna do when they come for you?... The game was very entertaining to play, since I love Bad Boys"

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
The Call of Juarez franchise should've stopped with the first one, which was plain bad! But then Bound in Blood changed my mind! But then The Cartel appeared and strenghtened my first feeling! But then Gunslinger appeared and gave me that nice nostalgic feel of the 2nd one! Boy, those are a lot of But then"s :P
Anyways

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Thanks to Uplay I can't play this game, therefore I cannot recommend it if it comes to my point of view. Shame, because I like Call of Juarez serie a lot. I don't know how the game really is, so bear in mind I wrote thie negative review due to having problems with running it.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Call of Juarez: The Cartel drops the best appeal of the original by dropping the western theme, instead offering a mediocre modern day themed story where you control horribly written bad cop" characters. If you're looking for a good western game

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
No Bugs,Glitches,Lag, This game for me runs 100 percent perfect

Ever think of going into high speed chase to chase someone and shoot and see explosions?

Wanna Take the life of three people Part of the police,Fbi,Dpa and Go kill some gangsters

Maybe a game not related to cowboys But Still Cool game/.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
This was a tough yes or no review. Def get the game when its on sale!! I beat the game once and i plan on beating it twice due to you get to play as 1 of the 3 characters. The story wise doesnt change as much just some little things such as the people calling you. Gameplay was okayish. The combat felt terrible at times and the driving is just like playing the enter the matrix game. Three annoying aspect about this game was that jumping off a small stair case can kill you, second one is when your trying to find items to lvl up sometimes you may go off the mission area causing you to fail the mission. and the last one is you have to follow the path the game gives you.

Pros
lvl up system- giving you new weapons
Can choose your weapon loadout
Small little side missions to do
3 playable characters each have a different story (different story but you pretty much play the game all over again)
2 different endings

cons
Bugs- Ai sometimes are in boxes and walls shooting at you
Cant go your on path
Driving is bloody awful.
Combat while fighting against heli's is just clunky

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Alright, all of the problems asside, slow frame rate, cheap difficulty, bad voice recording and buggy gameplay...Those things could have been forgiven if there was some substance to the story line that might tip the scales in this games favour...but there isn't even that. For some reason, it had to be made hip" and set in modern day LA

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
I don't get all the hate and bad reputation this poor game has earned.

Sure, it isn't a Call of Juarez like the two before, or.. a Call of Juarez at all, as the only things in common are a guy called McCall, a trip to Juarez in a couple of stages, and the bullet-time which isn't as good as in the previous titles.

It wasn't ported perfectly on PC, that's true. You almost can't set up the graphics at all, there's a motion blur and a depth blur that can be annoying, but you'll get used to them pretty soon.
But for the rest? It's a simple action fps like tons of others, with badass characters maxpayneing" their way against an army of bad dudes

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
This game is not as bad as everyone says it is. But it is one of the worst sequels of all time.

I love the Call of Juarez franchise: the first one was good, Bound in Blood" was great and "Gunslinger" is a fantastic FPS. But where does "The Cartel" stand?

The story starts in a very mediocre way

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
I had ZERO problems with UPlay, really. It worked fine for me all the way.

Don't let my playtime fool you, that was me trying to go around the many problems in this game.

I really wanted to say this game is good, it has good elements, like the three distinct storylines but that's about it.
Bugged, poorly polished, typos, bad action. This game shouldn't be sold. This is the major regret in games I bought.
You can't even finish the achievements since the play on hard" cheevo simply won't unlock (That's my playtime

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Alright I just want to explain what I think about this game, Horrible voice acting, Didn't like dead island engine, Gameplay is horrid and the game is just...bad...if you want to play a REAL Call of Juarez then get Gunslinger or Bound in Blood not this piece of crap, thanks for your time and I hope this review helped you.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Bought this for the cooperative mode. Turns out even the coop mode couldn't bring back any replay value. Is this is a broken game? Well, it's not entirely broken but it's not a good game either. I had 1 playthrough and I felt like deleting it off from my HDD. Unfortunately, I wanted to get Upoints from for completing all of the character's campaign. It was suffering since all of their campaign were pretty much playing the same levels again.

The good thing is that each character has their own perspective view. For instance, when your character is on the call, you can hear the conversation while others can't. This applies to coop mode where your friends can't hear what you're listening from your phone call.  Let's get straight to the point.

The graphics is awful. It's very blurry. When you aim, anything apart from your center of your aiming scope gets blurred. Sometimes when the enemies are running around and your aim focused on the tree, everything gets blurry. It's hard to aim at the enemies. Using the directX 11 doesn't seems to have any difference. This game graphics is bad.

I gave the sound average is because of the voice acting. Anything else felt like low quality sound effects. Your gun sound effects doesn't feel powerful. The soundtrack isn't memorable. At least they tried to use back the cowboy soundtrack. Very weak in this department.

Gameplay is just a typical shooter game but feels very boring. You have multiple car chase, multiple gunfights and multiple enemy chasing on foot. Yes, they are repeating those same events through the 3 campaigns. It gets buggy like enemy pop out of no where. Enemies disappearing. The game gets broken where the event doesn't start. As for gunfight, you fight 4-5 enemies, then done, next area, 3-4 enemies, then move on, 3-4 enemies again. Very repetitive and very boring gunfight. Even in coop, it's nothing interesting about this except the challenge like who gets the 1st 5 headshots within the time limit. There are some other challenges but it's just competing with your friends That's it, nothing else. For public game, good luck finding one.

Story is about the corruptions. The only reason you want to replay is because you wanted to know everyone's perspective. There are multiple ending as well. I spent so many hours on this game is because of that and the U points. Nothing much to say about this.

I can't recommend this game as it is very weak. I got this game from promotion sale so I don't get much loss.

My Rating:

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Oh god, what have I bought.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
This game is....well to be generous....quickly thrown together and lacking in story, graphics, gameplay quality.  Really wouldnt recommend spending any more than a dollar on this.  And do not think that it will be anything like gunslinger, which in my opinion was an amazing title.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
This is the worst Call of Juarez game! It really is as bad as people say it is. Not worth buying.  4 / 10

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
This was a terrible game. The point is that you have 3 protagonists who follow the main story but have unique side objectives. Although this is a good idea in theory (3 different games), they mostly just follow the same damn story and the only difference is what items you steal and the phone calls you get. Not worth 3 replays (not even 1). The story is hideously complicated with 3 different motivations and a  ton of characters that you don't care about that it all merges together into crap. The levels are very linear and the weapon choices dont really matter at all.

The only pros are that the controls are pretty good and the cover does shred forcing you to move. Other than that, the game is bad

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Let's be straight. Call of Juarez: The Cartel is not really a good game. It take the wild west setting of the previous installments and brings them to the modern day. The game is buggy, it's incredibly linear, the gunplay is mediocre, the enemies are on the bullet sponge side and the AI is nonexistent as your partners are absolutely worthless at times. That said, I had an absolute blast playing CoJ: The Cartel. It is the video game equivalent of playing a B-Movie, and I love B-Movies. You see all the twists & turns" in the story a mile away in a cliche ridden script filled with stereotypes and eye rolling dialogue

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
I bought this game for criminal vs cop shooting game.

The story is preatty cool.

Graphic is pretty cool.

Not sure if the online service is still active.

Gun play is not fun (compare to Call of Duty or Battlefield)

It has CooP but again, network service might not available

Finally, if you buy this game on sale and play singleplayer only, it's okay to have this game.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
This game is not as horrible as I was led to believe. It's... inoffensively bland I guess? Which is not good if your game follows the excellent Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood.
It was okay to play through and I didn't encounter anything so bad that would make me stop, with the helicopter fights coming close though. Some levels were fun, and it was nice to revisit Juarez's fort from CoJ & CoJ:BiB, now fallen into disrepair.

4 silver sloths.


Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Its and ok game on singelplayer for xbox360 or ps3 but got a little to bad graphics for my taste, and still alot of small bugs with it, and also history flaws, they should have learned from Rambo movies that M72 (Rocket Launcher) is use and throw, you cant reload it, and also using RPG rockets to reload it with, would remove the most important part of any body;) the HEAD. Havent tried mp yet, but dont think the graphics will be much more then in singelplayer since it has problems with 3d hills, its a little weird looking you dont feel your in a hill but in a funny hill with no depth in it.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Bargain bin material. That's all you guys should know. It's maybe worth 5. At first I didn't really know why people thought it was bad but the closer you get to the ending the more annoyed you'll become. The graphics are mediocre, definitely not bad, and the voice acting is also ok. The rest; the story, the gameplay, the menu (aaarrrrggghh, so hideous and simple); it's all forgettable.
The stealing of illegal items is a nice idea by the way, but it's badly implemented, which is a shame really.
If you have nothing, nothing, NOTHING else to play you might want to give this a try.

[Rating: 52/100]

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
The gameplay is decent but the storyline isn't great. Overall, I'd recommend it if you're playing through the COJ series like I am. I do find the character selection a bit silly. They give you McCall and two other character choices. Seriously? Why the hell would I want to play anyone except McCall in a COJ game? Silly.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
So for starters, I have NOT played the co-op or multiplayer, in fact, from what I played of the singleplayer I think it would be majorly improved by playing with 2 other people rather than horrible AI partners.  The driving sections in particular, as well as the sequences where you're seperated (though few and far between) would be pretty epic playing with friends.

Now that that's out of the way, let's start with the cons.

Uplay

Very dull, repetitive gameplay for the most part, in fact, you know how most people rag on call of duty for being 6 hours long?  I kind of wish this game was done by 4 hours, but for whatever reason I powered through.  The full time for one playthrough (on hard) for me was about 12 hours.

Low rez textures ect, only good looking texture in the game is really the bull revolver (from my point of view) though this is from like 2010 so mabye I'm just nitpicking

Seriously, I didn't think uplay was a thing back then, only bought it because I thought it didn't require uplay

Really common scripting bugs, from having the ai chars just not move (when you literally can't play the game without them moving to you meaning you have to restart the checkpoint) to scripted sequences where you're forced to literally slow down to a crawl, put your gun away, and sit infront of your cell phone screen for 30 seconds (often in the middle of a ***ing gunfight) NOT NOW DADDY I'm SHOOTING BAD GUYS!"

Really unlikeable chars

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
savagely racist

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
i am very very very dissapointed with this game :(

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
The Mexican Drug War, Juarez style.
Call of Juarez: The Cartel, third installment into Techland's CoJ series, seems like the misfit child of the bunch.  It's not as good as Call of Juarez: Gunslinger; it's not a game to be taken seriously or to carry any real expectations for, whether you're a fan of this developer or not.  As action shooters go, it's definitely more of the same.  It did provide me a brief bit of fun & includes a potentially decent cooperative experience.

The Dead Island series & Dying Light are by Techland too, so if you liked those you'll be at home with The Cartel, which looks and feels similar in a number of ways.  Level design, enemy AI, linearity of missions, visuals/art, side tasks involving item collection, gun aiming & handling, driving & playable characters with unique personalities & combat characteristics all felt familiar.  What you shouldn't expect much of in The Cartel is homage to the CoJ series itself, 'cuz there ain't much.  You do get to play as a modern day McCall, dual wield revolvers, take a brief jaunt through a familiar place & hear a schpeel from a guy who's obsessed with the treasure of Juarez.  None of that gives this a real connection to the rest of the series, however.  In my opinion it lacks the flair that makes the others entertaining.

By 2011 standards The Cartel is decent, & I'd say by today's (2015) it's mediocre but worthy of purchase on the cheap.  I got it on sale and can't imagine anyone doing otherwise, by now.  It's a very brief campaign consisting of 15 missions; took me about 7 hours to finish on Medium difficulty, with the AI companions rather than real teammates.

The AI teammates worked out well enough, although I regrettably didn't play it with anyone else & thus missed out on what looks like a fun three player co-op.  You can breach rooms together, provide covering fire allowing allies to advance & also engage in some friendly competition via the Secret Agenda feature (each law enforcement agent has an ulterior motive & they each mistrust each other, so you try to catch the other two red-handed while being sneaky & accomplishing your own hidden objective unnoticed).

I tried doing some multiplayer action online but was unable to find anyone for the Cops vs. Criminals mode or the online campaign mode.

This game is published by Ubisoft & requires their client, Uplay to run alongside Steam.

There were some (sadly not too) farfetched news clip cutscenes and a lot of interagency bluster between the LAPD, FBI & DEA that I found entertaining.  The entire game is pretty much a sensationalized portrayal of the Mexican Drug War.  Each character & most of the dialogue was cliche.  I feel like I'm describing a Hollywood blockbuster film.

I'm not saying I wouldn't recommend Call of Juarez: The Cartel to anyone; it was okay.  It just doesn't merit recommendation unless you're looking for a quick bit of shoot-em-up action & don't have better alternatives - or if you're a big fan of this dev & just crave that experience.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Good universe and big vent but the rest...
First, bad feeling launching the game : the menu... well, the 80s menu I'd say (sensitive souls, don't play that game just for that new generation" menu) ugly

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
L'ho comprato senza aspettative pensando di trovarmi davanti ad un gioco lineare invece mi ha stupito molto. La trama  coinvolgente perch riesce a sfruttare al meglio i tre protagonisti molto ben caratterizzati. Consiglio di giocarci con un amico per sfruttare al meglio le potenzialit del gioco.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Only 8 hours played but I enjoyed it.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Its so bad, its good

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Awesome!

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Without a doubt this is the worst game of the year. I had high expectations, nothing of which was met. Call of Jaurez was an enjoyable game, with the sequel being a fair step up in quality. But as is often the case, the longer the series runs for and the more greedy companies become, the products that roll out generally become inferior, and production values just plummet. Profit folks, that's all that matters nowadays...

Considering the poor mechanics, the downgrade in graphics, and the incredibly horrible script (I can't emphasise this enough!), The Cartel is not even worth a $5 sale. Stay well enough away! Although, if perhaps you've the money to spare and you ever run across a retail copy of the game on sale, buy it, and do us all a favour... burn it.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Great Game!!!

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
I don't understand why you guys don't like this game.It's a lot fun in this game and the graphics are good,this is my opinion.I recommend this game,good job ubisoft!

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Pretty good game design and story design. I love when I play different characters and start hearing the other side of the conversations and what-not. I never did catch another character stealing but it was not that important. As far as the gameplay goes, it is smooth most of the time and well constructed. The AI is not too bad as well. The ending was enjoyable.

8.0 / 10.0

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
One of the worst Shooters I have ever played. The plot is moronic, the graphics are sub-par for its era, and the gameplay totally lacking in any depth. The gunplay is unsastisfying and awkward, with many of the iron-sights on the weapons bordering on useless.

The plot of the game is moronic, racist and disrespectful to the ongoing human tragedy that is the Mexican Drug War. In particular I felt uncomfortable mercilessly killing hundreds of 'gang members' when I was supposed to be playing a police officer. No policing or investigating is done in this game at all. Its plot and mechanics are totally at odds.

If you have any respect for yourself or your money do not play this game. Take your money elsewhere.

And that each character three they have a story different and the different end (In the sense that the game is a bit LONG).

Call of Juarez: The Cartel
the games story levels get a little bit the same but the multiplayer is sick!


Call of Juarez: The Cartel
Contrary to many, this actually is an ok game if you want to relax yourself trough some pewpew; the shooting feels very arcadish and enjoyable, voiceacting is more than good and atmospheric and even the story gets interesting with passing chapters. But ofcourse the other aspects of the game are embarrassingly and poorly executed.

Call of Juarez: The Cartel

Interesting story but Lacking gunplay, Boring script, Redundant objects, Lots of bugs and glitches and It 's not Call of Juarez. 5.0/10

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Having played for just over an hour now here's what I have to say about the game. If you ever played Port of Call, Transocean - The Shipping Company is a modern version of that. Everything from the time progression to status" or "reputation" to unlock more ships.  There are some nice features of the sim that are handy to use such as the financial statements & diagrams

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Everybody look at me 'cause I'm sailin' on a boat!

After two hours of play, I have to say that I'm impressed.  After just a couple tutorial missions (each and all skippable in turn), I was turned loose to make or break my company.  After a few lucrative ore contracts, I found myself smuggling contraband on the Mediterranian.  And got busted.  And my cargo seized.  And fined.  And my ship impounded for a week.  A time-based contract I still had in the hold expired, so there were penalties there.  And harbor masters didn't care to allow convicted smuggers in their ports, so harbor fees went up.  All that in two hours and not a moment that felt repeatative.

A few features that I liked:  Your home port determines what bonuses your company gets.  I picked Lisbon for +5% on ore contracts and -10% to fuel.  The trick is, the smaller the port, the larger the bonuses.  So you have a reason to keep smaller ports and the ships that can service them.

There is some ship customization.  The Feeder I started with had three levels of Hull and Engine upgrades, which increased range and speed respectively.  There was also a license upgrade that would allow me to carrry what appeared to be hazardous waste.  Unfortunately, there does not appear to be options for custom paint or appearance (other than your ship name emblazoned upon the stern and bow).

I remember reading a comment somewhere saying that the music was repeatative and annoying.  To me, it sounded like every port had it's own song.  And each port felt VERY unique.  I'm already developing favorites and least favorites.

The only meh item I encountered dealt with other ship traffic.  Large ships move fast and looked intimidating at first, but it turns out they can stop on a dime and give the player right-of-way.  I would have liked to have seen navigation lights and right-of-way implemented (and fines for failure to obey maritime traffic laws).

Anyway, back to my ship.  I'm saving up for a fleet.  And I'm naming all my vessels after internet porn sites.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
I am a Retired Certified Warehouseman/Dispatcher. This game plays close to the real world when it comes to Cargo Movement.  With a few more Improvements, I believe this game could actually move into the Sim World, as a School Training Tool too.
Imagine that, having fun, and learning about the Real World TOO!"
Wanna make a bet it'll never be picked up as such?
REAL School is supposed to be boring so you want to Grad and leave! Ha Ha...."

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Sadly this game appears to be no longer supported. Please visit the forums for latest details.  The game has many bugs and features missing which according to the developers are to be addressed in a version due out in 2016.  If you don't mind spending a bit of cash it is an interesting, challenging game which will amuse for a number of hours, especially over a wet holiday weekend. This game ideally should be heavily discounted from now on and free upgrades offered to those who purchased before the new version TO2 was announced earlier this week.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
This is a cool game and all but it has its negatives that quickly spoil the experience.

First, docking and undocking is tedious as hell and gets very old very quickly. Unfortunately you're essentially required to do it every time, since using a tugboat is $100K a pop -- so docking and undocking at any given port if you don't want to deal with this tedious docking mechanic is $200k. When you're starting out and your profit margins are very thin this isn't feasible.

Second, in the campaign your investor is essentially the villain. Every quarter she takes what seems like half of your cash and when you finally scrape up enough to rank up to the next size ship she saddles you with an impossible contract which requires you to ship an insane amount of goods to a specific port (including things that you can't even ship yet without ship upgrades that you can't buy) or lose $10M. Guess when this automatically kicks off? When you hit $10M in cash. Oh the best part? You have around a month to deliver everything. Twice. Twice I hit this point and this impossible burden combined with the investor taking her quarterly cut left me bankrupt. I would keep trying but the aforementioned docking mechanic saps my will to start over.

Third, the sailing mechanic isn't very deep. When your ships are sailing you'll get popups like there's a storm a comin" and it asks you if you want to sail around it or sail through. I can't tell the difference between the two aside from the fact that sailing through practically destroys your ship. This is fine

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Played Ports Of Call? This is it. A few new things, but other than that, its Ports Of Call.
I love Ports Of Call, played it a lot on the Amiga, but I know that this game isnt for all.
Its repetetive, its just one more year"

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
OK, this review is primarily for the campaign game as I still am in the progress of completing it.

THE GOOD:
If you remember Ports Of Call, this game has a very familiar feel to it.  So much so that I would consider it the spiritual successor to that fine game.  The ship docking is nearly identical, smaller feeder ships are more difficult to dock than the larger post panamax & larger ships that have side streamer jets that will allow much better maneuverability than the tiny ships.
Many varied ports are available worldwide to sail into and each port has very unique feel to it.  Hamburg & Santos are especially technical and can be quite challenging and fun to sail into at full speed.  They have an option to pay a tug to skip the manual docking for a fee based on your ship size.  The fee can be quite a hit to the profitability of the runs... Which leads me to the Bad...

THE BAD:
Profitability:  I have noticed that the smaller ships, while they carry much less cargo, and in some cases are significantly slower, are FAR more profitable than the larger ships.  Cargoes are 3 to 5 times more profitable per container than the larger ships.  THIS IS A COLOSSAL FLAW IMO, and a huge reason that my fleet of over 200 post panamax ships is starting to bog down my computer.  I refuse to make runs where the cargo value for my huge UCLV ship is equal to a post panamax ship 3 size classes smaller.
I have found that there are ways to crock the game model by leaving feeder ships in the company contract ports to generate hordes of tiny highly profitable contracts meant for feeder ships, but this exploit should not be needed.  The value of the cargo should remain similar through all the ship classes to motivate players to want to get the giant ships (which are a blast to drive) because they are big money as well as big fun.  Instead I am forced to slog through thousands of port tug fees to remain profitable.  Which leads me to the UGLY...

THE UGLY:  The worst part of the campaign is the outright thievery of the investor.  The first several status upgrades come along at reasonable intervals and have logical milestones to nudge the player to create a shipping empire.  Once the player hits the Magnate level though, the game bogs down into mindnumbing repetition.  The game becomes a treadmill of completing company contract after company contract.  The fun quests" of filling a whole slew of varied contracts to a specific city are no more.  The "driving quests" where you are tasked with parking several of each ship are gone.
Tycoon level is the worst though.  Your only goal is to gather enough money to buy out this thief

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
I am not much of a game player, but have always been interested in the shipping business and business simulation. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed playing this game. Some people will enjoy the docking of the vessels in the various harbors. As you gain experience you will be able to get to and from the dock faster. Some ports are extremely easy (Lisbon), and others, quite challenging (get one of the larger boats in and out of Vancouver). So people looking for a game that builds your skills handling various ships you will likely enjoy this.

There may be some small issues with the underlying rules. For example, was surprised I could pickup cargo from NY for Havana. Suspect that isn't a realistic route.--more likely such goods travel to an intermediate port first (like Halifax). Also, not totally sure the rules follow the Jones Act. But one can really spend time figuring out how to keep the vessels as loaded as possible, and efficiently moving the most TEUs for the most money. I didn't like it when my ships had less than 50% of the capacity in use at any one time. I found this more challenging then moving the boats around, and therefore I would sometimes just let the game dock the ship to save time even though it negatively affected my reputation.

Again, not a gamer, but surprised how much time  I have spent playing and enjoying this game. If you like simulations, you'll probably find this entertaining, if not informative.

This is the first game I purchased via the Steam recommendations.  I am certainly not disappointed.  So far, I have 10 hours in the game, and I feel addicted.

This is a fairly simple simulator/logistics game.  The game has a tutorial, and I'm playing through it.  However, if you played similar games, such as Cities in Motion or Railroad Tycoon, then you can probably figure this out.  You buy a ship, get a contract, and then deliver the goods.  You have investors, you can take out a loan, and your ship will need fuel and maintenance.  From that standpoint, it is very easy.  As you get more ships, you gain more capacity but lose some capability.  Eventually, you can create company specific contracts that require delivery of a certain good to a certain location; at this point the complexity starts to become apparent.  To keep it interesting, you also have to deal with storms, pirates, and fires at sea.

While the game is fun to play, it still needs some polish.  I've had a few popup notifications remain on the screen.  I can play through them and sometimes get them to disappear, but its a bug.  While there are hazards, like storms and pirates, they purely random rather location specific, thus avoidable.  For example, I had a piracy near the Canaries, and I hit a storm with one vessel while another vessel sailed through the same area at the same time without the storm.  Personally, I find these oddities to be minor imperfections and potential room for growth in the development.  Overall the game is very solid platform and is good enough for this early release.

A larger area for growth is the games focus on cargo container shipping.  I commented about this in relation to US ports on the forums.  I was happy to see the game designer respond within hours of my comments.  While my request won't go fulfilled for now, I'm satisfied knowing that they understand the issue.

I'm definitely getting my money's worth from the game.  I think the game is playable for most ages.  If you are into sims like this, you'll love it.  If you prefer FPS games, then you'll probably hate this game as it is not meant for you.  I recommend this to all the simmers out there.

Recommended, but ONLY if, like me, you played Ports of Call on a dodgy DOS computer and couldn't get enough of expanding your fleet. As that is not likely to be the majority, I am not recommending it.

This game IS Ports of Call, there are a few additions and subtractions but the core of it is simple: Get the most out of your fleet. However, where PoC offered depth and complexity, in this it isn't difficult to achieve what you want to achieve, it is a fun(ish) time-waster for a few hours before you realise it is severely hampered by lack of depth. It is PoC but done half-hearted at points where it matters. I've just sent two ships off from New York to Algiers, loaded with medicine, to finish a contract off. Both ships for some mysterious reason left without their loads. In PoC I would turn them round and ignore the bug, here you can't: You cast-off, that is it.

In PoC part of the minigames was that you would manoeuver the ship in tricky situations, ice, reefs, castaways. Here you either damage your ship or have to wait for an unknown time. I am fine with the minigame element being gone, but now I haven't got a clue what determines how long you wait, it doesn't tell you (unlike PoC), but having a ship sail round a reef" just of the Galician coast and it taking 12 days... It could have been in the Antarctic by that time. Some of these aspects feel like they've just been put in to slow down the player for no apparent reason.

The game is a lot easier. The upgrades to ships are a potentially nice addition

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Welcome back, my Ports of Call. :-)
Simple but nice, if you know Ports of Call, here it is back in new livery - i like it.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
The game gets very old, very fast.  It's incredibly easy to make a huge amount of money, and for a supposed business game, many things (like staff wages, stock market, competition) are absent.

The graphics are quite pretty, and it's neat that each port is unique"

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
If you never encountered the 90s classic Ports of Call Amiga game then this Tycoon merchant marine simulation game may open your mind to how oddly addictive and geeky this kind of game can be.

It kind of appears to be another version of the Ports of Call game brought forward into the 21st Century though some of the features such as a few entertaining, sometimes nailbiting minigames are sadly missing which kinda like takes a bit of the soul away from what made the classic so popular many years ago.

Despite a few shortfalls it is a nice translation of the old Amiga Classic where your family give you weird looks as you blurt the odd expletive trying to park a 400m long heavily laden ship moving at speed into what would probably be the shipping equivalent of a tight parking space".

I hope this game has some sort of expansion planned in the future to include more types of specialised transport ships and more minigames to broaden the experience and truly bring the game properly forward from its ancestral past.

I found iceburg avoidance amongst other things a nice quirky addition that is sadly missing in TOTSCo.  Where I would have expected the sucsessor to PoC go would be to expand on these minigames for getting through storms

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Decent game. Its very polished and plays well. The game offers exactly what its intended, a tycoon simulation trading on the seven seas.

The love they have put into views is lost with the camera being fixed behind your ship, which is where the game tries to be different. It does not do it justice imo.

Overall the game is good, but not worth its current price tag. if you wish to splurg and love tycoon simulations this game will entertain you for maybe a week max, a day if your experienced player.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
I missed seeing this game when it came out, or I would have gotten it sooner, It is a simple cargo ship company tycoon game, very much like the classic 1986 Ports Of Call, with lovely 3D graphics and overall a nicer art style. For those interested, Ports Of Call XXL is in development (www.portsofcall.de), and you can get versions of the classic game as well.

http://www.metallicat95.com/?p=388 -- my review page


TransOcean has all the nice elements for a trading game  transport cargo from port to port, trying to make the most money and boost your reputations in order to improve your shipping company. Travel to more ports, play the ship driving minigame to get in and out of the docks for more status (and to save money and see the nice scenery), buy more ships, complete company contracts, and get rich. Or go bankrupt if you fail, but the game is overall fairly easy to play.
This is a single player game, with a sequel with multiplayer and more features coming out in May 2016,

As such, my recommendation is to get this one on sale, unless you cant wait to get your ship captain fix now. The polish of this game is a good sign for the future of its replacement, and I expect that you wont get exactly the same sort of challenges and game play features in the sequel.  This original game does, though, contain the background story and missions which set up the campaign mode of its sequel, and may be a little easier to play (in single player).

There are two basic game modes, the campaign  a mission-driven game with an investor who gives you orders and wants to be paid back, with the ultimate goal to become a tycoon and take control of the company  and the free game, where you just run the shipping company however you want. The campaign can be a challenge to win, but also provides a nice tutorial on how to play.

Much of the joy of the game is making smart choices and watching your company and bank balance grow. You will spend most of your time watching your ships sail around the world, and making decisions when they reach ports. Refuel now, or wait for a cheaper location? Select cargos for the best pay, but take into account the chances of getting new valuable jobs at each destination. Repair or upgrade your ship as needed. Some cargos require upgrades in order to legally carry them  take them without and you risk customs inspections and fines. Time spent sitting in port costs money, so that is another hard choice.

Some jobs have time deadlines. They pay better, increase your status if you are one time, but penalize you if you fail. The company contracts you can take give you a mission to deliver a specific kind of cargo from one specific port to another, with a time limit as well. They add another piece of depth, trading guaranteed work with a good payoff at the end (and more status) for a commitment which makes you miss out on valuable high-paying loads to other locations  or taking them, and risk failing the contract.

All the ships in this game are container cargo ships, and can carry multiple cargo loads as long as they fit on the ship. Sometimes you have enough to fill the ship and go to one destination, but often you must it several destinations in order to travel fully loaded. Each port docked at takes time and money.

Early in the game, you will dock manually and play a simple ship driving game to get into or out of the harbor. It isnt hard to do being slow and patient, but most of us dont want to wait too long, and so you take chances and risk damaging your ship. Succeeding boosts your status. Being Famous means youll get better deals and cargos than a small, Unknown company and captain.

Later in the game, especially once youve seen all the ports in 3D, youll just pay the tug costs and skip this part of the game, as long as you have the money in the bank.

There are dangers which can affect your ships travel  storms at sea, fires, sickness, reefs, pirates, rescue missions  plus the risk of customs delays if your ship isnt running legally. Taking the risky illegal goods (counterfeit and questionable merchandise) pays very well, but has much higher fines and delays if you are caught. Plus the illegal goods are confiscated, unlike loads where you arent compliant with regulations.

Most trips, though, are uneventful for legal, properly maintained ships. Youll spend your time making good choices each time a ship hits port, and when you cast off to send it to its next destination. The game proceeds in simulated real time (you can accelerate the clock, and will do so often in the early game). With more ships in play, you will have a lot on your mind, as you try to figure out the best way to make money and complete your missions.

The sequel adds competition -- AI and human multiplayer -- and expands a lot on this game.  But the basic elements seem similar enough, with, I hope, enough improvements to make it a really great game to enjoy with friends.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Well, after 13 hours of playing,  I find it to be a very relaxing game....  As you get bigger ships, the ports seem to be alittle harder to get into... Game play itself is easy, the mini docking and undocking game makes it even more enteresting as you get to drive" the ships to there docking and undocking points... I DO enjoy the game and hope to see some little inmprovements in the future.... OTHERWISE.... GREAT GAME for ME.... Nice addition to MY library of SIMS...."

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
As a big fan of transport simulator games like Transport Tycoon I jumped on this one. The game is fun, for the first 5 hours or so. Unfortunately it suffers from repetitive gameplay and the tedious management of your ships. When you start to have more than a handful of ships to control the game becomes overwhelming. Your life becomes docking ships, reloading them, and setting them to be repaired. Manually docking is also enjoyable at first but something you'll soon be more than willing to pay a premium to avoid. On top of this, the banker and her loan will be with you for a long long time. In 10 hours of game play I was still not close to being able to pay her off due to the requirements.

It feels like there is potential here for the game to be better than it currently is. Right now it too quickly becomes a micro-management simulator. Even with the problems I'd still recommend the game as I feel like I got my money's worth out of it; just know what you're getting into before hand and only pick it up during a sale.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
A lot of people thus far keep comparing the game to ports of call, and there are a ton of similarities between TransOcean and POC, you can choose to play the game more like the old DOS game Ocean Trader.  The game is fun to bring your ships into port and try to meet deadlines on contracts with your fleet of ships, however as the game progesses having to dock every single ship gets old fast.  However, if you like piloting ships into and out of port, then this game is for you.  I've gotten far enough into the game that I have ended up playing it more like Ocean Trader and using tugs when my ships have to dock.  I still enjoy relaxing and just racking up cash and expanding my fleet.

Either way you play it, the game is quite the feat and well worth the money, especially if it's bought on sale.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
My review is from single player only. I work for a container shipping company, so this game caught my eye a while ago. I expected something like the classic Railroad Tycoon series, but with ships. What I got was something different, but in a bad way. The game itself isn't horrid, but more something that is vastly inefficient. The mini-game of docking the ships manually when they call ports is tedious and just isn't worth it at almost any point in the game. The whole thing is pointless.

The business element is very lacking, and I was disappointed that the one of only ways they could think to make the game challenging was to vary the same starting scenario. The only thing that changes is the insane interest rate the player is required to pay to the angel investor, along with her ability to sign annoying shipping contracts with huge penalties without your consent. Starting capital should be something the player is in conrol of, or at least given some options. I haven't beaten the game yet, but so far the only risk is getting caught without proper liscense to carry goods and varying interest rates. All of the systematic risks associated with shipping, storms, fire, whatever are all completely random and don't even affect other ships on the same rotues. There is no political risk, market risk, exchange rate risk, or purchasing power risk. The game is supposed to be global, but has nothing global about the simulated economy nor is it dynamic in supply/demand.

Last, and probably the biggest deal breaker, I don't enjoy the micro management required in this game. Having to approve every single ship when you call port is annoying, and it seems almost impossible to set up a static voyage using supply and demand or contracts. Every port you have to pick new goods based on what is available and then decide where the ship is to go next, and because goods cant be transferred at ports for a hub and spoke strategy, the only way to play is by having direct routes for every ship. In late game, you have so many shipts they are calling ports every 4 seconds so the gameplay never feels like it is going anywhere. Youre costantly being inturruped by having to agree to pay the docking fee, load more goods, and then choose the next port. The only way to keep ships in specific areas is to basically micromanage contracts, and have them sit in port waiting for a contract that keeps them from having to go from the EU to Asia, or float them completely empty to another port, which is again heavy micromanagement when you consider how many ships you have to track in late game, and not realistic at all.

These business simulators still have things to learn, and it makes you truely appreciate games which are very well done like the Railroad Tycoon seres. They are still amazing. The next installment of Transcean is out this summer, I hope it is a little better.

TransOcean - the new Ports of Call!
If you liked PoC back in the day, you'll like this one too.
It is basically the same, just with better graphics and features.

If you are looking for a deep, mutitasking managing-a-company" game

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Simply put its a great game, if you are interested in a game that is all about managing a network of ships, ensuring you can afford the ships, fuel, repairs and any fines you incure all the while needing to keep enough money in the bank to pay your greedy investor then this may be the game for you.

The graphics are exactly what you would expect from a game that is essentialy a map and a bunch of finance screens, simple clean and easy to understand. The docking part of the game is quite fun but when you have 10+ ships can become very tedious to dock every ship. The advantage of actually docking yourself is you save the moring fee's and when it come to the most expensive ship in the game thats a lot of money especialy if you dock the ship and leave the port. So it comes in handy throughout the game and while you dont need to use it ever it can be useful (especialy if your ships is empty and you need to move to a different port and want to save some money), its also quite fun and challenging as some of the docks are very oddly shapped and possitioned. The graphics for the docking are nice clean and I expect will stand the test of time nicely.

Every aspect of the game is fun, if a bit repetative, however with the docking mini game you can vary it up and keep the fun alive. It does become very repetative nearing the end of the game as you are simply trying to buy out your investor and the money you need is huge and can take a little too long to reach, which is the only real downside to this entire game. I wold have liked to have seen a few other elements like competiton with other companies and the such but alas not in this game. If the game starts to feel repetative try taking on a contract that is restrictive or try and get a chain of contracts, there are many ways to keep your interest, you just need to look for them.

The tutorial is very good and is perfectly integrated into the main game so no need to stop and start. You follow the instructions and you start making money. My personal recomendayion is to always but the ship with the highest top speed and bigest hold, the distance it can travel is imaterial, especialy when you reach level 3 and 4 ships.

Pro's
Graphics are simple and clean and will not feel dated in the years to come
A number of different challenges throughout the game.
Piloting the ships are fun and challenging, the latter ships with thrusters, makes piloting a dream.
Finding the best routes to make money is a lot of fun.


Con's
Can be repetative, especialy later on.
You will hate how much the investor takes from you and can be annoying when you simply want to finish the game.
Becomes a little to easy in the late game.
When you have 15 + ships it still takes forever to buy out the investor

Conclusion, this is a fun game that will keep you occupied for many hours, however its not for everyone and you need to be a tycoon fan to get the most out of this game, and even then trying to end the game will annoy you.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
This game is only fun for a few hours, after that, you've basically seen it all.  It had potential, but unfortunately there isnt enough depth to the game to keep it fun and interesting.  If you are interested in checking it out, I would wait for it to go sub $5.  I feel robbed after paying close to full price.

I rarely buy games this expensive and at full price, but something urged me to get this after the first major update of bug fixes was released. There seems to be a wealth of official and unofficial game remakes recently and I definately feel we are encountering another golden age of PC gaming. This game is unofficially similar to the old DOS game Ports of Call". Even though I did find the storyline a bit weak

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
+ Manually docking your ship is fun at first
+ Okay graphics
+ It's like Euro Truck Simulator 2 but with ships (and less 3D)

+/- Docking isn't fun anymore after 25 times of doing the same thing (but can fortunately be skipped if you have enough money

- Becomes very repetitive
- Performance issues, struggles whenever there's 3D involved

[Rating: 71/100]

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
I was quite surprised at how much I liked this game. I had only ever played one ship sim and gave up after 42 minutes. I was burned out on fps and horror/survival and just wanted to sit and play a game that did not drain me and this was just the ticket. It is really easy to learn the basics in the begining but gets quite challenging as you get into the economics of the game. I have played the campaign 3 times. The first I lost my companyto the investor. She means it when she says she will shut you down. Then once one normal and once on hard and I may play it again. I feel I more than got my moneys worth with this game.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Not really worth buying. Gameplay kinda like Plague inc., you just watch map, click, upgrade, choose route. 90% of gameplay is choosing most expansive route, clicking get fuel" and clisk "sail". dock/undock mini-game is not worth trying too. I was expecting something more in more late game - but nothing interesting i see.

rus: .    

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
The idea of game is not bad, but requires additional motivation to the player for spending more time and reaches some targets. It starts boring to move the vessels in/out of ports many times, while the idea is a managing of Shipping Company. With a fleet size more than 100 ships the gameplay turns to a long-long row of mouth clicks. The player has to spend several hours to complete on month of game time. Another big issue, what to do with money?  My account grows to 10 billion and I have no idea where to invest.
Hoping the Developers will read the comments of fans and apply the improvements to gaming process.


TransOcean: The Shipping Company
This game reminds me of Ports of Call a game made in the 80s. But it's in 3d. It also plays similar to port royale but doesnt take as long to rank up in the game. I really like this kind of game. This one has good graphics too. I bought it after having it on my wishlist for a while and saw it was down in price so I bought it. This game is easily worth full price. I'm glad I purchased it. If you really like games for trading and making profit this game is a good game. And it takes less time to complete the game than port royale which i still like. I give it a 9/10 game cause i really glad I bought it but it seems to have one bug I found so far. There's a bug that has to do with weather you use tugs or not and it leaves a box for it on right side of screen.  You can remove these box(es) by saving and reloading the save.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Finally after all these years a new game like Ports of Call. So far I am completely impressed as this game seems to do everything PoC did and more. Plus the graphics are really nice. I won't go into detail about everything it does, check out some let's play videos on youtube and it will give you a great idea. This game is polished and well done, I totally recommend it!

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Holy Crap! Someone invented time travel!!!

I have been thinking about buying this for the last several months. When I saw TransOcean on sale, I went ahead and picked it up. I started playing it, bought a few ships, filled some contracts, started to REALLY HATE the shrew of an investor... (my apologies to any actual shrews offended by that comment)

and then, I think it was about the point where I had 6 ships, I TIME TRAVELLED!

No. Really. I time travelled. That is the only explanation I can think of. I looked at the clock and it was 10:00... a few minutes later, it was 11:30... THEN IT WAS 2:00!!! Somehow, I now had 10 ships and nearly $200 million...

I must experiment with this more, but so far, it seems that the time travel only goes forward, not backward...

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
One dimensional and tedious.  There needs to be a higher level of automation; setting up shipping routes, preferences of goods, ports to sail to and from automatically, refueling, etc. so you can focus on MANAGEMENT.  One person doesn't make every day-to-day decision in a business with billions of revenue, especially ones as mundane as should we refuel the ship?".  After a certain point it just becomes a button pressing simulator

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Highly reccomend for anyone who loves Tycoon games and/or Buisness Simulation games with a fantastic ballence between micromanaging and user-friendly UI when it comes to managment.

The campaign is challanging and fun, especially with a story-line that enhances the game so much more than just simply playing on a freestyle mode without obsticles and concaquences which affect your company name and rank for the good or bad.

Great game for Tycoon lovers and those who enjoy Management

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Be warned!!!  The developers have moved on to making  a TO2 so support for this if it has not already will die. The game is buggy sometimes game crashingly so but not frequent for me. This game also does not do anything new or revolutionary in any way shape or form and lacks any depth of any kind!!!!

That being said, now that you know what you are getting is it still worth it?
For me yes.

If you like economic sims and are looking for a timer killer this is pretty good to fill that spot and focusing on shipping only is a unique aspect.

Would i cough up $20 for it? no.. wait till it goes on sale.

Its a point and click adventure and the learning curve is not all that steep. Click boat A and find the most profitable route... pretty much the entirety of the game right there.

They touted how they accurately modeled the ports.... wish they had spent that time on making a better game but meh...

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
If you're interested in an navel-merchant game, then the Patrician series is a better option (and much cheaper). Also, the physics of stearing the ship inside the the dock area is unrealistically arcade-esque and a pointless feature from my point of view.

In conclusion, buy Patrician 3 and Ship simulator instead for the best of both worlds.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
I fired this game up on a whim because I don't have full use of my left hand at the moment and can't play keyboard-heavy games, and I found out that this is a fun game that scratched a logistics simulation itch I didn't know I had. However, there is little challenge besides the contracts (especially the mandatory one at the end of the campaign). I also suffered intense slowdown browsing through contracts while there were multiple ships in port and the docking and launching minigame was tedious (though thankfully skippable if you pay for a tugboat).

I'd cautiously recommend it for anybody who enjoys casual games involving economics and planning.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
I really liked this game. You get a good sense of progress as you spend your time. It is exactly what I wish to play right now, but not to everyone's taste. It is the best container ship company simulator, but it is not a very popular genre.
It is not a very complex game, and it is rough around the edges. Parking ships can be fun, though it interrupts the tycoon flow.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
One of my favorite games growing up was Ports of Call by Rolf "Dieter" Klein"

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Very Rewarding.
Set-up with some care going in.
Simple pricipal, Loads of Fun.
You can play for very long periods of time. Addicting..
Call me simple, but I Really enjoy playing this game...
Keeps your mind thinking, when you play" the game.
Enjoyment Level...10
Ease to Learn.......10
You can see where this going right?...Sorry

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Well, it certainly is fun to play. That said, what you're buying isn't a business simulation with ships, but rather a send ship from a to b to c".

If you want something where your actions have direct consequences on global markets or you want to mercilessly drive your competition out of business

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
I have been a great fan of Port of Call in the 90s and played it almost beginning of the 2001.  This game is a clone of that original Amiga hit but to my dissappointment the publisher didnt even clone the 100% its even missing the features of the original game.

The grafic and the UI is everything is good but not perfect.

I wished this game had  :

- automated routing for a permanent contracts to deliver x amount of y to specific port.
-  much more depth in stock buying and selling and AI competitors
- Pay the government or soldiers money to protect your ships from pirates
- variety of ships
- Political influence the pricing etc........

I played the game for 6  hours and then got bored. This game had potential but may be its because its does beat the original only in Graphics.


TransOcean: The Shipping Company
There is almost no game here. Here is the game in a nut shell.

1. Select highest value cargo from list.
2. Click button to auto undock (Or spend 3-5min undocking to save a tiny amount of money)
3. Wait for boat to get to new dock.
4. Go to step 1

Later on pirates will attack at random and steal ships from you (Or you can pay more than the ship is worth as a random)

I put a few hours into the game and still have no idea how you are supposed to be able to buy larger boats, it said I could do it, but never showed any for sale. Not that I needed them, money comes in far too easy.

This game needs a lot of work to be fun IMHO.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Very Great Game !!! . If you like/love games like PoC , Der Reeder , Hanse , Patrizier or Port Royal you might find a game which you would like either.

You should give it also a try if you like games like Industriegigant, Transport Tycoon, OpenTTD a.s.o.

The only thing which is missing, is a multiplayer mode (hotseat would be fully satisfying)  which all of the above include.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Works realy good, performance of the contract list could be better if you have 5+ ships in one habor, if you like Der Planer" from the 90s you'll love it."

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Awesome game, but I must be the worst smuggler ever because every time I smuggle cotraband I get caught, litteraly EVERY SINGLE time. Still an amazing game though.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Fun game to waste your time with, although i wish you could customize your ships more. Otherwise great game if you tend to have a fetish for logistics and business

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Not a really difficult game, some nice logistics.

What's it about:
In the campaign you begin in Europe and from there you spread to the world, obviously ships will get bigger and you will make a lot of money in the campaign but you have to keep in mind you have to buy your company back from the investor. I have bought the company back, took me slightly over 60 hours of only campaign game-play. I have not had any game-breaking bugs so far, so no severe ones that I encountered. Theres only the loss of frames when moving the view in docks when multiple ships are in the same dock, though I almost never do that. Further more.. you can manually dock and cast off your ships (press spacebar when manually taking control it is fun) which will not cost you any money.. it will when you auto do it.

Free play?
Yes there is that option, have not reached that point yet.

Recommend it?
Yes, but I read they are making TransOcean 2. So it is up to you to buy this one or wait for the new one.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Well, this game is fun, but it has its own share of imperfections. While the game itself is polished, without any bugs so far, actual gameplay isn't so fulfilling and deep. After cca one hour, when you learn mechanics of this game, you will find yourself in one big cycle of routines. Buy ship, take route, fulfill objectives... as I said, it's fun, but approach is pretty much simplistic without any deeper customizations.

This game leaves a lot to be desired, but I can't say that this is a bad game. It just needs to be  more challenging and customizable.

TransOcean: The Shipping Company
Boaty McBoatface is at port!

+ : great controls for this type of game, user-friendly, ok-good graphics, you can play online, reputation, ranks, ports, naming ships (this one was one of the best features lol), customizing company, dolla dolla bling bling (late game = lot of money)

- : manual docking is boring (but can be done), pain in the  when you have more ships, company contracts are annoying and you need a lot of them to finish

Amazing and addicting at start, annoying at late game

still great game, 8/10 would ship again

Nice relaxing game that still manages to encourage sharp wits. Not one I find myself wanting to play all the time but it's good for every now and then.

I'd recommend it at the very least for when you want time off from your other games.

Soldier Front 2
Game is shutting down, please do not bother to waste your time. Aeria was unable to maintain a competitive environment and also did not announce Worlds this year, leading to a steadily dwindling list of players. You should take your money (and preferably your HDD space) to another company.

R.I.P Soldier Front 2, it was fun while I played you! The competitive community was great when it was around, shame the poor design decisions, and inability to fix persistent performance issues turned away most players. Thanks for all the fun times.

why is SF2 shutting down? It's such a good game. I'll probably never find a game close to SF2. Anyone know any games that is close to this?

Soldier Front 2
still better than call of duty ghosts

Soldier Front 2
To anyone even considering downloading, this game has been shut down. Do not bother, it was fun while it lasted but its over. Im surprised they didnt just take this off of the steam store, its been gone for a while.

Soldier Front 2
Solider Front 2 is an absolutely awesome game.

Pros:
+ Great graphics for a F2P
+ Not pay to win at all
+ There are loads of great serious gamemodes but many humorous ones like snowball fight, party, etc.
+ Nice inventory/loadout system.
+ Not much of a learning curve, so it's fun for people of all skill to enjoy.
+ Fast-paced, quality gameplay overall

Cons:
- Not too many people play anymore
- 99% of players are 12 year old Filipino kids that don't speak English (not to be racist)
- Awful community
- Hackers... so many hackers...

Overall: 9/10
This game has its cons, as does any other game, but it's definitely a gem in the free-to-play genre.  It has great gameplay and graphics, and it's especially fun with friends.  Highly recommended.

Soldier Front 2
Soldier Front 2 is without a doubt the best F2P FPS experience i've ever come across. (And FPS is my main genre with quite a bit of experience) It in many ways manages to match and in some places exceed both its F2P brethren as well as its more costly retail alternatives. SF2 is as you can tell, is a sequel to a once very successful F2P title back in 2004/2007 in Korea & later internationally by the name of Soldier Front/Special Force. This game manages to not only outdo its (very) dated predecessor but also remain a viable option in todays overpopulated shooter scene. Everything from the animations, guns, and gameplay very closely mimics its big brother Call of Duty, and does a damn good job at delivering the same experience without paying every year for a new edition (map packs included). The game oozes quality and definitely is the best you can get when it comes to free to play currently at the moment if you're looking for COD-style shooters.

THE GOOD
+ Fantastic presentation & graphics for a F2P.
+ Weapons are affordable with ingame cash & permanent.
+ Quality COD-Style fast-paced gameplay.
+ A slew of modes to choose from including Classic Defusal to Coop.
+ Entertaining for both newbies and pros alike.
+ Tons of people playing all the time.

THE BAD
- Sometimes laggy players ruin a good match
- Hacking players can be a pain in the .
- Community is horrible and abusive to eachother. (They crossed over from the first game)
- No way to mute/report/kick undesirable players.
- Female characters run faster and are harder to hit.

THE UGLY
Raging 12 year olds from the philippines who constantly spam the chat with incoherent things like aw" "vovo" and "base"

BOTTOM LINE
I can hardly think of any free-to-play shooters that manage to compare with full retail games this well. It's very impressive if you enjoy COD-Style shooters. If they managed to fix the hacking problem

Soldier Front 2
Fun game! Would suggest for a person who does not have any money!

Game shut down


My life shut down


I lost my friends


I lost my Soldier Front II

Huge difference from the first soldier front.
Truthfully I like this version better, the gameplay is more fluid.

However, there are tons of bugs/glitches, not really any new content.

Though I love the swf mode lol

Soldier Front 2
Free2Play & Pay2Win
But it's still one of my favorite fps games.<3

Soldier Front 2
I've been playing SF2 for quite awhile and to be honest. It's amazing. I never did get bored as the game has constant patch and updates. (with new map packs etc.) The devs and forums are active. As you know this is a Free To Play game. In most FTP games you might expect a Pay To Win situation. But for SF2, the gun they first provide are pretty decent, and they also have daily log-in prizes. That way you're able to experience better guns, of course with limited time. Overall it's a great game, if you're looking to start off your FPS journey, you'll never go wrong with Soldier Front 2.

Soldier Front 2
Good for the price. Similar to call of duty, but without as many customizations. easy to kill, easy to be killed, small or large maps, lots of gamemodes, lots of weapons, decent graphics, and there is no need to pay any real money because you have plenty of money you start out with to buy weapons or gear! Overall, this game was good while I played it, but there are definitely better games out there. For the price, I would rate this 7/10

Soldier Front 2
I enjoyed this game while it lasted. At least 220 of my hours were from before I could afford any game I had to pay for. I spent many nights playing the seizure maps which were really fun in my opinion.

Its a shame the game shut down. The game in itself was actually pretty good and if the devs could've stopped the whole playerbase from dwindling and addressed other problems that lead to SF2s demise, the game might've had some real potential as a competitive game.

R.I.P SF2 (2013-2015)

Soldier Front 2
AWESOME! Similar to call of duty, but without as many customizations. easy to kill, easy to be killed, small or large maps, lots of gamemodes, lots of weapons, good graphics, lots of players, and there is no need to pay any real money because you have plenty of money you start out with to buy weapons or gear! (I do not know if you earn the money back though by doing stuff)

Soldier Front 2
I used to REALLY enjoy playing this game! I recently decided to boot it up again and play my first FPS & I can't play it anymore :/ .. I heard the game was shutting down & that broke mai heart. Please if you guys can keep the game running! We love it & you!

Soldier Front 2
If you've ever played A.V.A before, nothing will be new, other than less lag, almost no hackers, and a growing fan base. ANd did I mention the weekly events that allow you to get paid items for free? Join today!

A great FPS, maybe quite a bit P2W but all-in-all a 9/10.

Another lovley game gone :(

Soldier Front 2
loved this game....sad that it died :,(

Soldier Front 2
hey i have been playing this game since closed beta, it is amazing, its like COD so you you get acievements throughout gameplay (200Headshots) and the game runs really smoothly , constantly updates (1 or times a week), the GM and Gs's are always very nice and ask the community what we are wanting (:

Soldier Front 2
Soldier Front 2 is just as good as the original. Bring back plant the bomb, death match,and team death match plus some more. There are guilds you can join to have fun with people, many guns, armor, secondary weponds, and more to choose from. Game has been updated in the graphics on highest can be compaired to AVA but the lighting effect put it over it some. Very fast gameplay, need tohave precision shooting to kill someone before they get you. 17 achievmnets to go for and in-game ranks like the first. Unlock more stuff in game with leveling up your rank, and allong the way get some free gear, to help the leveling process. Overall it's a great game for being free. Try it out if you were into the first or have some free time and want something new to do.

Soldier Front 2
well....i've never wrote a review for a game before, but after 1,000 hours of cs i came back to this game to learn, it was shut down.

This broke my heart cause i always loved to play this game in my early years...i played with a couple friends and had lots of fun.

if u see this aeria...i commend u for making such a good game but it's such a shame it shut down.

Don't bother with this game. Hackers everywhere.

I actually really miss this game, this was the best game I had and i didn't play it enough. I didn't think it would get shut down so quickly. I have spent a lot of time on this game and it was extremely fun, if you want to have good memories of this game look through my screenshots, there are many which are getting perma weapons (the best part of the game) and then there are some gameplay screenshots. This game helped me awp in cs:go, i made many friends on this game. Rest In Peace SF2, you will be missed.

Can be an enjoyable game if there are no H4x0rz

This game is not full of haker nowadays, it's not pay to win, most Sp weapons are permanent and it's totally not another type of any other FPS games such as CoD, etc, it has its own advantages, modes( like Shatter, Xanthid, Seizure,...). Some say that this game is unimaginative, how silly that is! If any of you like to shoot with your imagination, go get an imaginative" capsule gun skin.-_-"

Oh the memories.

Soldier Front 2
TL;DR at end of this review.



Soldier Front 2 is the best MMOFPS of all time.
That's what I want to say.

Soldier Front 2 is the ultimate CoD wannabe and fails horribly at trying.
That's a more accurate statement.

I've put a lot of time into this game, so I know what I'm talking about. To begin, SF2 pits two teams in maps to fight to the death. Cool concept. But it's plagued with errors and mistakes and horrible development. Hitboxes in the game are the easiest out of any FPS I've played (Counter Strike, Tribes: Ascend, Blacklight: Retribution, HAWKEN, Combat Arms, AVA, just to name a few). Your head hitbox is literally the size of a watermelon. It's HUGE. Too easy to hit, too easy to be hit. Many times you'll run around a corner and after you're completely around it, some guy shoots you from behind by hitting that one corner of the hitbox that isn't even supposed to be there.

This game is plagued with lag. SF2 consists of action-packed amazing adrenaline-rushing combat." When really it's "that guy's lagging

PRETTY GOOD GAME,BUT PAY2WIN MAKE THIS GAME BAD

Soldier Front 2
In the very long period of time in which I have played this game I have been gripped by its immense character driven development. I honestly believe that this goes over the standard set by even the best triple A games. With truly innovative shooting mechanics that Resemble real-life to no end. With graphics that make the Division look like EAs left over steak dinner, with Intense animations that really reflect real life in a never seen before way. To say I recommend this game would be a lie with my large amount of time playing this game, it has become more than a game it has become a feeling.

R.I.P Soldier Front 2
2013-2015 Shut Down :(
<3

Secret Of Magia
After being gifted this game, I really really want to recommend it, but I just can't. Here's why:

Pros (+) :

1. Pleasant and fitting music though it feels... Not so original.
2. Strong monsters (for those of you who like strong enemies in games) that scale with your level, including their loot.
3. Six different classes to choose from.
4. The character art is pretty, but everything else is what you would expect of a game of that genre, nothing special or unique here.
5. It's possible to upgrade your weapon as well as craft your own potions.
6. It's a fairly cheap game.


Cons (-) :

1. Classes are way too similar to each other. In fact, it doesn't matter which one you pick as they hardly differ from each other at all as there are no special abilities or talents. All of the classes can use the two OP weapons I will mention further down in this review.

2. Unfixed bugs are present in the game. Several of them. You can literally walk on the walls inside the church, an innkeeper won't allow you to enter the room you paid for and you can't walk behind a really tall building.

3. Hardly any balancing in melee fights: Enemies have more hp and hit harder as you level, while you hardly become any stronger. In fact, it wasn't unusual for enemies to be able to kill me with 2-3 hits once I leveled up just a few times. And that was indeed as a melee class with a higher defense stat than mages and archers. Also, there are two swords that can be used by ALL classes, and those swords can kill just about every monster without them ever being able to hit you as you hit them diagonally, while they can only harm you when you are in their path.

4. Spells are useless: only 2 spells and they don't really do any major damage. Also, enemies apparently have a 2 second or so invulnerability after being hit, which isn't much of an issue when using melee weapons (as a melee weapon takes about equally long to charge the attack), but it's a major issue when using spells as you have to time the spell right so you don't waste mana nor get hit while waiting for their invulnerability to wear off. Unnecesarily hard and really bothersome.

5. Very few quests for a game of that genre: I could only find 4 in the game and I literally looked everywhere and talked to every single npc in the game. Oh and they don't really give any directions so you more or less have to guess where to go for x quest.

6. Lacks content: Like I wrote above, enemies become stronger the higher level you are, and so it would be nice if you could buy or acquire better armor, but there isn't anything meant for mid-game fights and above. Also, why is there a random guy living in the middle of nowhere when he does nothing important? Why does everyone talk about the king and all when he actually proves to be completely irrelevant to the story and is, in fact, impossible to interact with?

7. Incomplete (or feels so) things: why are there guard towers with instructions on how to use smoke signals if you don't ever get to use it yourself or see it happen? Why are there so many locked doors?

8. Doesn't really have a lot of different weapons to offer: Again, no need to acquire any other weapon than one of the two swords mentioned above.

9. The crafting / upgrading system is more or less useless. Once you acquire either one of the swords (again with the swords), you can literally just kill monsters without them ever being able to hit you, and only standard weapons sold by npcs can be upgraded, and the upgraded weapons are FAR inferior to those two swords. As for making your own potions, well, using OP swords will give you so much money that you will easily be able to buy more potions than you could ever need. Oh and if you really want to make your own potions, farming the ressources is a major pain and nearly impossible to do, as nothing says where to acquire them (apart from those blue butterflies). Just farm gold kay?.

10. No fast travel" or "teleport to x city/town": It's really annoying to travel through several zones 10 times while trying to avoid monsters (in EVERY zone) that can almost kill you with one hit.

11. It's a fairly short game (fortunately?). I beat it first time as a ninja (the slow and long play-through to explore everything the game has to offer

Secret Of Magia
Secret of Magia is an Action RPG developed with RPG Maker.
I was given a key by the developer and I am sorry to say I do not recommend this game and here is why.

Let's start with the good things first :
The game offers not only between the choice of a female or male character, but features a class system that determines what can you equip. The HUD is nicely done and the quest system is rather original for a game like this.
The combat system is pretty good and the enemies are implemented in a smart way, the skeletons in the mines were one of them, as they genuinely surprised me and made me paranoid.
Another nice thing is that you can gather flowers and butterflies for the crafting system, sadly after an hour and a half I have not tried this system yet, but I gathered quite a lot of stuff.

Now for the bad parts :
I'm not sure if the developer has tested this game, but it's full of bugs, you can go inside walls, letters become plants when you read them, some blocks that should be solid are not, some that shouldn't be are, glitches here and there, couches have teleport blocks inside them, I was joking with a friend that in the first chuch you come across you can ascend to godhood by straight walking on the wall, most of the walls there are passable, even npcs climb them.
The combat while original for the first half hour, is kind of unbalanced, at least as a melee class, I was getting oneshotted the first levels which was pretty frustrating (slimes), I had to align myself diagonally so the monsters wouldn't have a chance to attack me but I could. I farmed a little, when I leveled up though, the monsters leveled with me and became a lot more tanky, giving more gold too. Now, the first real boss was not a big problem because by the time I had so many money I invested in health potions, he could never kill me, doesn't matter how much damage he did to me. After that you drop a legendary weapon which is a bow, a weapon my assassin shouldn't be using but he was using anyway (not sure if legendary weapons do not have class requirements). Some of the resources are inherent to RPG Maker and not original by the developer, you can judge if that affects quality or not.
I do not feel compelled to complete or continue the game as I did not have much fun with it, but thank you anyway for this chance (since I received the key by a developer or someone in contact with him).
All in all it's a low quality rpg maker title with some smart ideas here and there, but with a weak story, characters and quite full of bugs at the moment of writing, so personally I would not recommend you this game.

Secret Of Magia
Got this with a heavy discount.

The great shading effect shown in the screenshots are not actually in the game. So I think that constitutes false advertisement. It looks more like an 8-bit color pallete in-game.

SIDE-BY-SIDE SCREENSHOT: http://imgur.com/YmSFA8G

I want to try this game but I don't think the game is playable in this state. The framerate in this game is locked at what seems to be 10 FPS. It's hard to tolerate. I've never seen anything this bad. Maybe this game was made in Basic.

Extremely difficult to control your character:
There's a setting to toggle run/walk but that stopped working after about 5 minutes and no longer works so I'm stuck walking. Seriously. I reload an old game save and that one is stuck running.

360 pad works, but only the analog stick, not the D-Pad. This is really dumb since movement is not analog.There is an option to 'hold down a button to run' (It's the shoulder button), but it should be the OPPOSITE! Hold the button to walk! And as mentioned, this might not work after a bit. The shoulder button is a bit too clumsy for this dextrous task as well. Very unfortunate.

Test PC: i5-750, 760GTX, 8GB RAM
Going to let the developer keep my 49 cents. Controller updates would be greatly appreciated. Keep trying.

Secret Of Magia
I don't know why everyone is praising this game, just beat the game after 2.5 hours and from my experience it didn't look near as fun as the trailer looked, levels served hardly any purpose since every monster levels with you and they always deal massive damage no matter what armor you have equipped, all the Legendary Swords" cost MP to use so if you're not a Paladin or Mage they're useless.  Speaking of Jobs

Secret Of Magia
Secret of Magia is an Action RPG offering robust yet at first kind of clunky feeling combat. There is a main attack, skill and a guard feature (if shield is equipped). However, you can only attack in 4 directions = not diagonal, which confused me a bit first; hence the clunky feeling.
From the getgo you are free to explore the world and take up quests. Leveling feels fast and fluid as moving to and from areas will respawn the enemies. Thus grinding a bit is always an easy to do option (and never hurts, at least in my opinion).
From what I have seen so far, Secret of Magia does not reinvent the Action RPG, but offers some nice and easy pick-up and play mechanics.

Secret Of Magia
Plays a bit like an Ys game with no bump combat, but not turn based either. Clever game mechanics are used, such as the grappling hook, and the game gets you into the action very quickly.

It is an RPGMaker title and it is super cheap. Get it on sale and have fun.

Secret Of Magia
This game is half bad. The story is nice. The music also fits for this game. Controls are not bad either. I like that I can choose gender and character's class in game. This game could have a better mapping system. I didn't like that you can only save your game in certain places (not when you want). And with that you can't launch the game in background, so if someone is writing for you or you need to check something quickly, you have to shut down the game. In overall I can say that it's not that bad nor good.

Secret Of Magia
Very entertaining from what I've played. The quests and story are really goofy. I don't know if that was intentional or not but it made me laugh. The menus and controls took me a little bit to get used to but it's very quick to learn and play.
I also like the Zelda/Link feel of it all.
Totally worth the money 10/10 for entertainment and price

Secret Of Magia
Haven't played too much yet, but so far it's pretty good.  Soundtrack is pretty good, though even with all the volume sliders at 50% some noices are still really loude.  Gameplay is pretty simple, but that's not a bad thing.  I've also noticed that sometimes a monster (like the wasps and slimes) take up to twice as many hits as other monsters of the same type in the same map, causing my death a handful of times (I picked mage, by the way, so I probably have less HP).  I've also walked though a wall or two so far, so hopefully a patch or two will come out later to help fix these issues.  I do like it so far, but I probably wouldn't buy it if it was much more expencive.
Added: Oh, and the shift+tab doesn't do anything.

Secret Of Magia
Secret Of Magia is an action RPG that was made using RPG Maker.
It is inspired by games like The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past, Arc The Lad and Secret of Mana and takes you back to the NES/SNES days.

The game starts by selecting between a male/female character that you can later specialize in one out of 6 classes.
There is no tutorial in the game that shows you how to do certain things.
There is also no main quest or other information regarding the storyline, you have to find that out by yourself which is a good thing in my opinion.

While I really like the combat system and the sounds/music this game has a few main issues that need to be addressed like:

- Low texture quality
Because of low quality assets things get pixelated quickly and sometimes it is really hard to read certain things (in the UI for example).

- Missing widescreen support
Widescreen resolution should be supported in every modern game.
It would be great to have an options menu to select the desired screen resolution / aspect ratio.

- Missing key binding customization
Want to move your character by using WASD instead of the arrow keys? Not possible to change this anywhere unfortunately.

Other than these issues the game has a couple of minor bugs and design flaws, but nothing really game breaking.

All in all I can say that this is a solid game for a cheap price.
If you are into these type of retro action/adventure RPG's you should definitely consider buying this game.

Secret Of Magia
I'm enjoying this game, the fighting is like zelda, and I'm in a fire dungeon now with a lot of crazy monsters.

Secret Of Magia
This game is fun in the fact that it does bring one back to the old nes days of final fantasy, and other rpgs. The game also does it's best to tie into games such as Zelda with the combat being more along the lines of the player being link, and swinging your sword at the creatures. I enjoy this game as it does give some interesting challenges, and quests.

Secret Of Magia
This game is worthy to give it a try. It's old school action RPG. It has simple enjoyable game system. If you are looking for some simple, but nice game. Having regard to the not too high price... You should give it a try!

Secret Of Magia
Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Secret of Magia with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.

I had braced myself for yet another piece of RPG Maker garbage when I first loaded this game up. It took me joyfully by surprise when it turned out to actually be a real time adventure game similar to that of the old top-down Zelda titles. Hookshot included!

Sadly, the magic didnt last as I quickly found that nothing felt quite responsive or snappy enough. The sword swung in a pitifully small arc, the character feels very locked down to a square grid of movement, and actually trying to naturally navigate with a controller or D-pad is very uncomfortable. Even the hookshot moseys across the screen like a tranquilized snail. The story wasnt dreadful from the little bit I saw of it. The creatures, while rather disjointed and inconsistent in theme, were decently drawn and animated. However, when it comes down to it, playing Secret of Magia makes you reminisce of Zelda and sulk over how inferior this game feels in comparison.

Secret Of Magia
A technically flawed but mostly charming and low priced action adventure/RPG title, Secret Of Magia harkens back to older action adventure RPG titles and the inspirations and love for the Zelda titles is clear, and things like the friendly dialogue, brief random encounters, art style and music all fit nicely. There's also a fair amount of content, areas and enemies for the cost, and overall, while it has problems and does nothing special, it's good value for money and a competent aaRPG.

Full disclosure: I recieved a Steam key prior to this review.

Highlights
The variety of environments and pretty good intro level were enough to get me engaged, and the casual and unlimited nature of exploration from an early stage are worth mentioning. It's easy to skip ahead if you're impatient, but equally easy to spend an extra hour or two just exploring and grinding. There's also a variety of competent and occasionally funny dialogue from many different denizens in many different towns.
The music is also very pleasant to listen to, and sets the tone really well without getting annoying at all.

Overall, if the developer releases a patch or two and clears up some issues, this title will be worth picking up for what is essentially the price of a coffee.

Mistakes and Annoyances
I feel like a patch or two would fix up most of my complaints, but for the sake of completion and honesty here they are.

There are tons of small technical bugs. I routinely found myself clipping through walls and into inaccessible areas, I was unable to equip or de-equip items after certain encounters, and had no way to continue but to slowly suicide, menu systems sometimes became disabled for unidentifiable reasons and plenty more small annoying technical mistakes that should've been play-tested and fixed.
The support for using a mouse is great, and makes playing a lot faster and smoother, but the out of the box key bindings are frankly awful, and the in-game configuration panel isn't listed in the controls, nor accessible by anything other than messing around (it's F1 in all RPG Maker titles), and even that isn't properly labelled or actionable, and F12 causes crashes due to a bugged RPG Maker script. Again, these are little things that can be fixed fairly simply, but that's all the more reason to highlight them.

There are design mistakes too, namely the save system relying on positional altar markers. This means that, like some of the older Zelda systems, you can only save before entering an area or after travelling to a specific place. For a game that encourages player grinding and a slow death screen, this makes little sense. An auto-save or simply just a save button would've been a far better choice.
The main issue for me, however, was the combat. There is arguably a small level of skill required in coordinating where to position the player in regards to each enemy and the environment but, at least as the soldier class, it's mostly just about finding the next diagonal tile and slashing ad infinitum and became repetitive and bland after a short time and even boss fights are mostly about predicting the next move and getting in position.

Recommendations
Priced at just 1.99/2.99/$2.99 at the time of review, this is actually priced fairly, and will probably be worth picking up on sale for someone looking for a casual aaRPG with a nod towards older Nintendo titles, just not until some of the technical problems are corrected.

For the low price of $1.79, I would say its worth it. Reminds me of legend of zelda. The control set up menu through F1 is awful to get though or even navigate through just to re-map controls. You have to use tab rather than use the mouse and its a pain when you are trying to map controls. I hope that will be fixed because it almost made me come close to asking for a refund. Once I got everything working correctly, I rather enjoyed playing it. So if you have a extra 2 bucks to burn. Buy this.

Early review:

This game has so much potencial! It's an indie RPG game and I love RPGs!

At the beginning you can choose between 2 characters: male or female. Then, you will chose your favorite role for your character. It has great character art style, it's like anime art style which is great for this game. The sound/music of this game is great to listen to. You can play either with M&K or controller.

The negative aspects: limited resolution, some frame drops in certain areas, some grammar errors and the Game Over" screen could be better arranjed than that. The Steam overlay isn't working

Secret Of Magia
Decent story, fighting is fun. You can choose different classes and it changes how you fight a lot. The fighting is like zelda and if you choose like archer then you basically run around and shoot arrows and dodge projecticles. I'm liking it so far.

Secret Of Magia
Really nice RPG reminds me of old  Legend of Zelda A Link To The Past in terms of gameplay. Interesting storyline and also  a nice soundtrack.
Great content for the price.

Secret Of Magia
Altough a great game, I can't alt-tab outta it. Devs please fix

Secret Of Magia
The novelty of Secret of Magia is in it's portable bridge which adds a puzzle component to many maps without the need of puzzles.  It's very beginner friendly, though it does seem a bit like it's commanding you to go this way or that initially.  For example, something like Go to your house."  or "Go to your house now." could be better worded.  The class selection occurs after doing something else first.  The sections on each map don't flow together well

Secret Of Magia
It's rare that I will post a review for a game that I haven't completed in full, but I just can't bring myself to do much more than finish out the achievements and then give up Secret of Magia.

From the store page, the game looks like it will be a fun and fast paced RPG with dark, gothic graphics. However, when you play the game, you realize that it's the opposite of all those things. The color scheme and tones of the graphics are nothing as they are presented on the store page, which is very misleading. You can easily go around and avoid all of the monster fights; the monsters will not follow you or go out of their way to hit you. The only real fast-paced action here is how fast the main character moves.

The BIGGEST downfall of this game are the controls, whether you're playing with KB or a controller. It's just horrendous either way. I'm not sure how the developer even thought that the control scheme was a good idea in the first place. It's barely feasible on a controller, but downright hand breaking on a KB.

I should also mention here that any time you quit the game, the game crashes instead of closing properly. There is also no way to adjust your resolution or if you'd rather have full screen or windowed mode. Steam overlay also does not work in the game, but toast windows pop up and leave an annoying white rectangle on the corner of the screen.

At the paid price of a whopping $0.32 CAD, I can't say I'm upset. I got it at this price for the achievements, honestly. But anyone who is seriously considering this title for pleasure play should think twice. Don't support misleading store pages and broken games.

Rating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)

Secret Of Magia
Highly Recommend this game the story is so nice, i also think people should give this game a chance. The thing about indie games is keeping the story going and wanting the person to find out more and this is what i got from this game. Its fun and keeps you wanting more.

Secret Of Magia
The game reminds you immediately of Dink Smallwood.

It does look extremely good as far as the character profiles go and the game art is intentinally 8 bit pixellated

I find these games 'tougher' to enjoy on a PC with 1080 resoution and would want them on my mobile. But that is my own opinion.

The gameplay wokds on the 4 directional keys and attack/ moves using space and shift

easy 2 handed operation

The game features combat that is deceptively simple. You can die with lvl 1 monsters outside the village if you dont time attacks

A better quest track sytem (with a map to start with) would be better. The maps you can see are too pixelated to make much sense of reading them

Get this game if you like retro TOUGH classics

If you dont, wait for the IOS/ Android/ WinX version


Secret Of Magia
The Good
The atmosphere serves the game well.
A decent soundtrack that is very fitting.
The combat feels satisfying.
The game runs smoothly.
The Bad
Some of the most confusing controls I've ever experienced.
Although the music is fitting, it is royalty free and you've likely heard it in 10+ games already.
Steam overlay will leave a nasty white tear on the sides of your screen that will remain there until you close the game.
For the first 20 minutes there is literally no story as far as I could tell. Pick a hero with a ball, a bird says go get the Four elements"

Secret Of Magia
I love this game, it's cute. Charming and as an old school Zelda, Final Fantasy feel to it. Though I may not be the best person to review it, I tend to have lag and a lot of framskipping when I am outside in the world, but in buildings I have a perfectly smooth running game. It may just be my computer. I really enjoy this game, though I have no played it for as long as I had wanted or hoped, my wisdom teeth causing me some pain. I definetly reccommend this game if you like a neat little pixeleated graphic game

Secret Of Magia
So far I have enjoyed the game.  I had to go back and check the controls in the option menu but once I got it down it was great.

I played as an archer which works well for a lot of enemies, EXCEPT the ones that rush you down.  Make sure you stock health potions.  I will update my review as I continue playing.

Secret Of Magia
Game which has potential. Haven't played it enough to tell if the storyline is too liniar but from what I've noticed there's a decent amount of sidequests available. Game is really easy to play but is lacking a proper menu for resoution settings. On a 4k display like mine it looks weird since there isn't an option to force the window to be bigger than the 600x400 frame it is currently in.

I enjoyed the 30 minutes I've played, but it is all existing content. There's tons of games like this so a good story is very important. I haven't played it enough to judge that.

Secret Of Magia
I have recieved this game for free as part of a promotion for the game. Regardless of whether I paid for it or not, I remain unbiased in all of my reviews. My reviews reflect my opinion, and my opinion only.

The game lacks in a few areas such as story, tutorials, and controls, but it's relatively easy to pick up and play, and the RPG elements will keep you busy for a few hours. Not to mention, it's only a few bucks, you can't argue with that.

Secret Of Magia
Secret of Magia looked like it was going to be a retro RPG, taking me back to the days of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo.  Playing Dragon Warrior, Faria, Times of Lore, or even Ultima to some extent. Starting out, you are in a room with Two characters, while you control a black sphere.  I was given the option choosing which Hero I wanted to play as by going through One of Two doors on either side of each Hero. I selected a character and was taken to a black screen where dialogue appeared. It seemed there was some sort of overarching villain who wanted the elements" and threatened to reap your soul if you didn't get them for him. You then wake up in the bed of an inn

Secret Of Magia
Seems like really beautyfull RPG i dont play it too much but here is what i can say....
Soundtrack and atmosphere makes me return to oldschool rpg games which i really love and enjoy, well there is one bad thing.... When i go outside the house it seems like i get so much fps drops and i have no idea why when im inside any house or smaller location its totally smooth i hope there will be fix. It is still playable but would be way much better if outside locations would be runing smooth.

Secret Of Magia
really ? more ? another RPG game ??
that is awesome, back to our childhood, yippy

Secret Of Magia
Secret of magia is and action RPG, and it has some really weird stuff:
- The equipment system that isn't explained, and you basically need to purchase every single weapon to check if your class can equip it;
- The guard feature that works if you have equipped any kind of shield, but lacks of any graphical animation, basically you just sit there and ask yourself whether you are actually guarding or not, and hope for the best;
- The enemies get stronger as your character level up, and even the starting slimes end up almost 1-hit-killing you;
- The knockback that makes you switch areas just as you enter a new map and some monters attack you;
- The knockback that gets you stuck in between a monster and it's own attacks;
- The knockback;
- The doors that have weird hitzones and are sometime placed wrong (for example: doors on the left side that teleport you on a sofa in a room called the right wing" (?));
- Visual glitches

Secret Of Magia
Absolutely adore this game! You get such a fun nostalgic feeling when playing. The combat is great, story is decent, and the graphics are perfect for its style. Definantly worth the buy.

Secret Of Magia
Love the battle sequence of this game.  It  took a bit of practice as you cant go rambo" into battle and expect to win against the AI units.  The battle sequences of this game requires tactical attacks done at the correct time while also dodging the attacks of your enemies.  If you are looking for a game that will challenge you and require you to play at a high level

Secret Of Magia
i bit confusing at first but you catch on giuck its a cool system but if your looking for a game with a story line dont get this game its not a story based game

Secret Of Magia
fun game nice story adventure RPG has
Steam Trading Cards to  if you like rpg give it a go                                                                                Explore a huge world and free your people from the tyranny of an evil supernatural dictator                            youtube secret of magia then you can  judge the game for yourself i can make a big review but no need just go to youtube i can write a good review and still get a thumbs down....

Secret Of Magia
I've played only a little bit of this gem and can't wait to dive deeper into it.

6 classes, male or female, crafting, awesomeness, be a flower girl

Secret Of Magia
Good game just getting started!

Secret Of Magia
Similar to Legend of Zelda.  The archer was fun.

Secret Of Magia
It's okay for the price

Secret Of Magia
Great RPG, fast-paced combat, massive world.

You can choose from several classes, you get a grappling hook early in the game, can spend time exploring and killing stuff.

Looks like Zelda.

Can't wait to finish it!


Secret Of Magia
Okay, so Secret of Magia looks like your everyday normal RPG, but in face it plays more closely to the Gameboy Zelda games, well in my opinion anyway, it's fun, it's easy to get the hang of, it's hard (damn slimes always killing me) and it has secrets! (still can't find the icy-fire sword or whatever it's called) But yeah! I'd say it's worth it's $3 price tag!

Secret Of Magia
-Story is good
-Graphic: standard RPG Maker (not sure if XP or not)
-Fun like Zelda Jr. :D
-If you like old RPG Soundtrack and Environment. buy it :D
-Price really cheap!!!! lol

7/10 comfirmed it's not bad game

Secret Of Magia
This is a suprisingly refreshing RPG, thanks to the dynamic fighting style and fluid movement. Give this a try if you are sick of all those turn-based RPG's, but still want a solid RPG to play.

Secret Of Magia
Fun so far, feels well thought out. The enemies are fun and the fighting is fast paced. I like the bubble monster.

Secret Of Magia
All I have to say about this game is:
>Completet some quests
>Reached first dungeon
>Died on boss
>Bought some potion's anf got back
>Boss door locked
>Get key again
>Still locked

And this is about my first hour in the game! I also read that something similar can happen in the endgame! And there seem's to be no other fix for it than start over!
You can get better(Without gamebreaking bug's!) RPGMaker game's for free. I don't know what started the trend of selling RPGMaker game's on steam but if you take money for it at least check for bug's on the discussion's page.

Also on the side. I do not understand how the price of the JRPG bundle (Where this game is in) came to be. I mean for all of them alone you pay about 3.60$, but the bundle cost's 10$?

Secret Of Magia
epic

Secret Of Magia
fyi ALT+ENTER toggles fullscreen

This is my thoughts thus far:

Pros
mouse support ingame and menus
controller support (may require configuring via F1)
great graphics (for RPG maker)
comical text
smoothly playable (did not encounter glitches or bugs)
decent music
Cons
occasional violations of grammer
movement keys are arrow keys and NOT WASD
this is a genre I don't usually play
Tips
Use the up and down arrow keys when entering a number to gamble. The reason the three numbers look like a dial that spins is because it is like a dial you spin with arrow keys.
Learn to use the mouse as well as the keyboard. It can make your play experience more fluid by using the middle scroll wheel as a the harpoon thingie instead of SHIFT. Your experience may vary.
There is an options menu ingame where you can change a few things but there is also another one specific to all games made using RPG Maker which is F1. If you are having any problems with the game you can likely fix it there.
ALT+ENTER as always will toggle fullscreen for nearly all games.

Secret Of Magia
A neat little rpg game that feels especially inspired by Pokemon and Zelda.
For the price, it is definitely worth a try if you are considering it!

Football Manager 2016
I was on top of the world. I had it all. Fame, money, women, and league title wins. Then, the new season came around and we were ready to do it all over again. We went on to lose our first match, but I figured it must surely be bad luck. Then, the second game came around, and we lost that one too. Interesting. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. It was obvious to everyone that it was a fluke, though. Fourth time? Referee's fault. Fifth? THEY LITERALLY CHEATED.

At the end of the season, the team found themselves in the relegation zone. As I stood looking at my reflection in the mirror, I said to myself, Don't worry

My Arsenal squad has 13 first team injures. Very realistic.

Football Manager 2016
I would like to preface this by saying a few things: First, I've been playing FM games for about 10 years now, so while I don't have as much experience as others, I'd still say I'm quite familiar with the game.

Secondly, upon reading many of the reviews here (mostly the negative ones), I have to say - a game being too hard" isn't a valid reason to give a negative review; it just means you either don't understand the game

Football Manager 2016
Mourinho agreed that the referee made the right decision to award my team a penalty?

Other than this minor bug, the overall game is impressive.

Football Manager 2016
This review is intended for the experienced FM player. If you are new to the series, or indeed the genre, you should buy this game. It is by far the best available in the genre. Highly recommended.

However, if you have owned virtually every CM/FM game that has ever been released, then perhaps the following comments will constitute a review which is closer to your heart?

Somewhere along the line, these games lost their soul. The most identifiable yardstick along this path was the moment the developers introduced overall star ratings for players. There was a time, in early CM games, when signing a player was a risk. You would look at their form, stats and overall value and make a decision. Sometimes, you would buy a flop and othertimes you would make a great signing. Now all you need to do is have a good scout and you can go on the star rating they provide. That might be good for your average ADHD fifa manager type players, but people buying these games, for the most part, WANT to spend time trying to make these decisions and don't want to have their hands held through the process. In a real-world scenario, a player who has scored 20+ goals in a season immediately attracts interest from bigger clubs. In this game however, you will simply overlook such a player if their star rating is poor. In these games form has absolutely no relevance when making signings. This is NOT an accurate simulation of how decisions are made in real life.

If you are a long-standing player of these games, ask yourself this question - when was the last time you bought a player who ended up not being good enough to make it at your club? This is something real-world managers live and die by, but is an element of football management which has been woefully overlooked by the developers. Somewhere along the way the developers have made the hardest decision in football management the easiest one. Signing new players should always be a risk. Think of the countless examples in real life of signings which on paper should have been stars. If there is one thing which is clearly evident, it is that even the most experienced and talented of managers occasionally buy players who flop. This should be the most important aspect of any football management simulation. Instead, this game provides you with god-like ability to predict just how good a player will be in the future through an overall star rating. In real-life, managers would make such predictions through a combination of the player's professionalism, age, determination, injury history and availabilility of experienced players for the youngster to learn from. These factors would also fluctuate over time and be subject to change. Hence, a player like Michael Johnson at Man City comes an goes.  By forcing players to consider these things the developers could make this game SO much more rewarding and return the franchise partway to its former roots.

As for the matchday engine, it is simply a non-event. The quality is just not there to warrant ever using this view. The ardent FM fan will not even care about the 3D view as it is not the aspect of the game which they find rewarding. Rather, it is taking the plunge and signing players and working them into a functional tactical system. Incidentally, tactics is the one area of the game which the developers have virtually got spot on. You cannot sail through a season just repeat using the same system like in the good old days.

My suggestion, stop trying make a stats-driven simulation and try to return some atmosphere to the game. You can make a start by providing authentic match day sounds. I could go for hours explaining how this game could be improved, but ultimately this is intended as a review and not a 'blue-sky' suggestion session for the developers.

I will obviously keep buying these games, if only for the reason that there is no other franchise which comes close in this genre. But everytime I buy the latest version a little piece of me (and the genre) dies. It is for this reason that I have to send a message to the world that as long as this game is not fulfilling its enormous potential, I cannot in good conscience recommend it.






Football Manager 2016
I'm now on my 6th iteration of Football Manager, but after thousands of hours of addictive gameplay, this will likely be my last purchase of the series. The last few editions, they roll out several dozen new features (burger vans at the stadium, players growing facial hair, create your own Frankensteinian manager, etc.) while stubbornly refusing to fix problems that have been repeatedly reported for several years. They use their early-adopters to beta test well after the full release, send out a couple partial patches and then declare the game good" and start working on the next edition.
If you report a bug

Football Manager 2016
Utter horse manure. I've spent hundreds of hours trying to like this car crash of programming.
FM16 nonsense in no particular order:

A player will do everything he can to force a move (except actually put in a transfer request - to keep his loyalty bonus). Then when you finally give in and sell him, his team mates will be annoyed at YOU for seling him. Ridiculous.

A young player, at the end of a meeting, will almost always say I'll get going then. I'm sure you'll want me for something else soon..."
Excuse ME? I'm a strict disciplinarian with a fierce reputation (think Fabio Capello). No young player in his right mind would DARE be so damned rude like that in real life.

Endless

Football Manager 2016 Beta First Impressions
Hey guys, I'm about to write my first impressions about the game, but keep in mind that this is beta / pre-order version. Also, this review is intended for Football Manager players that already know how to play this game.

Pros:


Most advanced animations yet in any Football Manager edition. What I mean by that is the fact that FINALLY you can see the difference in Flair / Quality between 2 players. New dribblings, crosses, decisions and finishing in front of goal. It was FM13 since I've been asking for more realistic dribblings / decisions / crosses in the final third but the game never got quite there, until now. Let me give you a short example: I am playing as AC Milan and Jeremy Menez was attacking the right flank as a Winger-Attack. In any of the previous versions, he would have done 3 possible things: attack the byline and cross, cutting into the penalty area or pass the ball back to the overlappting full back. Now, I noticed something absolutly beautiful: He did neither of those. His decision was to dribble 2 players like they were nothing by cutting inside the penalty area and then he launched a lobbed-cross to Luiz Adriano who was rushing forward from a deeper position. Now, besides his way of dribbling (which i've never seen before in FM), we can easily notice another MAGNIFICENT improvement: lobbed crosses. This kind of crosses are a must in a game like FM and I am finally happy it was introduced. So yes, new animations / decisions / dribblings / crossings. You can finally see the difference between 15 Flair and 18 Flair so to speak.
Game is in a much better state beta wise than it was last year (loading times, match engine and leagues)
Fast loading / saving times. Last year's beta was awful regarding saving times. It was something that eventually got fixed, but FM16 doesn't have this problem at all. In fact, to me it seems than the game loads/saves faster than FM15.
3D Match Engine is another thing that pleasantly surprised me (played 3 games). By this I mean it feels smoother, no visible glitches and artefacts. Last year we had all sorts of problems with 3d engine performance until it got fixed (the game ran choppy and stuttering a lot on anything above medium" quality no matter how powerful your machine was). In this regard

Football Manager 2016
Am in the bottom half of the table with Chelsea. 10/10 Realism.

Football Manager 2016
If you've never had a Football Manager game before? It's worth getting. If you have FM15? It's not worth the upgrade.

Firstly, I've gotten promoted twice in a row and qualified for champions league in years 3 - I'm going OK! I have played it for years and years, this review is not on the back of me doing badly in the game.

Basics*
*(note - a lot about match engine, but this is a large part of what makes the game enjoyable for me)

The main issue I encountered was the quality of the match engine. Prior to the release, we heard about how the developers were improving this area of the game. However;
-Goalkeepers are making STUPID decisions, the visual standard you watch would have been disappointing in a game that's 10 years old. It hasn't a patch on the FIFA Manager game I played 10 years ago.
-Defenders are nearly as bad - they can't track a run, they give away stupid penaltys and can never cover the back post
-Tactics enforced can't really be seen in play. If you target a side in your tactics, the stat's never display this, the highlights never show it.
-Match engine overall has not improved. The lack of progress since FM15 is absolutely TERRIBLE
-Negotations are still unrealistic - small clubs will still demand 30 million for a hot prospect who has never played a game for a club.
-It still hasn't allowed for better negotiations on contracts etc. - I would have liked more career development talks etc. when taking on and dealing with young players.
-The press conferences are just irritating - again, very little progression from last year. Even most of the questions are the same.
-The 'new club' feature just isn't good. Picking a new team has been made far too irritating and long winded by the way you have to search. It's as if the developers got bored at this part and just gave up before they were finished. I was really excited about this feature, but it has a number of HUGE flaws too such as you're able to get players who haven't got work permits, then if they can't be renewed at the end of the season - they're gone (I lost half of my team after the first season on free transfers because of it).

Overall, I would advise getting FM15 for a fraction of the price and getting an update for the new players etc. This is one of the worst updates I've played and it's really not worth the effort that has been put in since the release of FM15. I really don't think they're keeping with the times, there are lots of new features that they could of added but haven't.


Football Manager 2016
A longtime player and huge fan of the FM series, yet every year there seems to be one or more elements which can make the gameplay infuriating and unbearable. Before I list my complaints, I would like to emphasize that I have no problems with winning games, competions or creating working tactics and that these complaints are merely observations which cause a huge amount of frustration.

- Goalkeeper intelligence is laughable as they will frequently concede goals easily in their close corner due to terrible placement and movement. And even with frequent clean sheets, your goalkeepers (or anyone else) rating will rarely reach an average above 7.0.

-Defenders (particularly centrebacks) will track a player's run only to make 180 turn and run away from the attacker, which usually results in an easy conceded goal. And it doesn't matter whether you play as Bayern or Gateshead, because you will concede more than a fair share of goals from crosses at the far post, due the defender(s) inability/will to follow the run made by the attacking player.

- You will never/rarely actually get a goal, when you need one. Whether it's drawing level or winning a close encounter. And to pile on the misery, the opposition will also more than often score in the dying minutes, snatching either a draw or win.

- The aforementioned point makes the matches feel extremely predictable as you either absolutely smash opposition, go ninety minutes without a single chance or get the dreaded late conceded goal and all is visible/predictable due to the way your/opposing players move about on the pitch during the whole match/last minutes.

- Different tactical approach isn't as visible on-screen as one might imagine, which gives little incentive to create/tweak own tactics.

- Corner instructions are ignored (short corner instruction results in floating crosses being hit).

- Generally lack of new features with the exception of the terrible manager creator screen.

Football Manager 2016
Each year Football Manager offers less incentive to play.  Maybe I'm getting too old for these games. Developers promises to rectify age old problems with match engine, press conferences and transfer bids.  Shame, been a fan since 1993.  Time to move on.

Football Manager 2016
Instruct your world class keeper to clear the ball to flanks and watch everytime as he kicks the ball straight up the middle.

Football Manager 2016
Ah. Football Manager 2016. From the superb to the shocking.

Firstly, I must say if you're looking for a game with superb aesthetics, then Football Manager 2016 is the game for you. The menus, tactics, training, transfers, fixtures etc. screens look superb, as they always have and probably always will. Aesthetically it's a 10/10 game.

However, once you press that play button to start the match, it all turns truly dire. Never mind your coaching badges, your club's level or your standard of players/staff, you'll suffer (and receive - it can go both ways) some of the most shocking, and in some cases bizarre, pieces of gameplay you'll ever likely to see. Goalkeepers diving away from the ball, sometimes not diving at all, players not tracking the most blatant of runs, your star attacker continuously missing sitters while the computer's youth debutant with a finishing attribute of two bangs in a brace from outside the box. Those are just some of the things you can expect to see in Football Manager 2016 (though, that's been the case for years in FM to be honest.)

Admittedly, I'm definitely not the most skilled player, no question, but even so it's clear to see the game needs a lot of work to firstly get to the standard the developers give it and secondly to merit its price tag. I'd honestly say don't buy this game, I regret doing so especially given it's the same stuff (gameplay-wise) as in FM2015. I've been underwhelmed with FM for years now, they've seem to have slipped since the superb days of FM2009, FM2010 and FM2011.

But hey, this is just my opinion. Make a decision for yourself. It's OK to play, but it's definitely not enjoyable in my opinion. Thanks for reading.

Football Manager 2016
(Disclaimer: I think I've burned out on FM.)

I'm tired of FM, because although the game is 'easy' - and it is, don't get me wrong, you can pick a team and either bludgeon your way through to titles, or you can be a savvy type of player and tactically mastermind your way to titles. Me? I'm one of those that bludgeons the game and the reason for that is simple;

There's a comprehensive lack of useful in-game documentation to help create sensible tactics. In fact, if you go on their official forums you'll find thorough posts (a bible's worth of pages) on how to defend, attack, counter attack and whatnot. It shouldn't be the case, that if I want to better understand the basics of the tactics creator, that I have to go out of the game to get access to that information.

Worse still, is when that information almost directly or indirectly contradicts in the in-game information. For example, Counter Attacking mentalities is stated in game to be a mentality to choose when you will lose the battle for possession

Football Manager 2016
Way too buggy, very few improvements over 15 (as usual). I used to be one of those FM addicts you read about and laugh/marvel at, my playing hours of FMs have dropped from  around 1700 hours per year in 11, 12, 13 and 14 to less than 1k for 15 and now I've barely even opened this one. Build a club is just the editor. The only good new thing is the online draft thing. Which is so slow you'll love the concept and then get incredibly mad it wasn't polished.

Not recommended because of the bugs and incessant errors. It's been the same bloody game for 20 bloody years, you REALLY shouldn't be getting errors every day.

Football Manager 2016
This game is ing awful! How the hell do you  up Football Manager 2016??

The whole game feels like it was cobbled together in a mad rush. Did the developers not give the creator's enough time to work on the ing match engine?? The game is broken. Nothing works the way it should do.

The AI is ing horrendous, you could have 20+ shots every game and score one goal, if that. The opposition has a ridiculous tendacity to dominate you, regardless of the gulf of class between the two sides. Your best player - you know the one with four to five ing stars - will be humiliated and abused by the est players imagineable. No matter how many times you change your tactics, i.e. retain possession, narrow attack etc, the AI is simply incapable of processing these very simple ing instructions. When I tell my team to retain possession, to play at a low tempo... they do the exact ing opposite. Coutinho, when of the best passers of the ball, will clear the ball away into touch despite having acres of space, with two players either side of him to distract the lone single ing defender in their way. And what happens.... Coutinho clears the ball into ing touch. Are you ing kidding me SI??

Word of advice to every football fan... Do Not Buy This Game. Do Not. Do not support the continued production of recycled crap, this game is competely broken. If you really want to buy a FM buy last years FM 2015, but make sure you buy it during a sale. Or find other ways of acquiring it. SI are taking liberties now, they will continue to produce this broken trash if we keep buying it. Do not support this franchise... It is a complete waste of your time, effort and money. A walking, breathing, abortion which should have been left to die before its inception.

DO NOT BUY FOOTBALL MANAGER 2016!

I'm not going to be one of those guys who uses cheeky rating systems like 1-10 and then delivers a pun at the end. This will be a hardcore review for hardcore football managers.

Took the wolves to the premier league avoided relegation then was fired by the board.


Football Manager 2016
I have been playing FM since the time it was Championship Manager. FM12 for me was the last decent version of the game. Since FM13, the game lost the magic and became predictable and boring. Despite the disappointing FM13, 14 and 15, i decided to give the game one last chance. FM16 unfortunately, is no different than 13, 14 and 15. SI once again, failed to deliver a decent game. Match Engine is once again full of bugs. For example, the opposition scores a goal after one single shot very often and usually on the first minutes (under 10') of the game under. Opponent's most goals come from crosses.Also, if the opponent always scores the same number of goals with the half chances of my team. For example, if i score a goal with 4 shots, the opponent will score a goal with 2 shots. Check it out and you will understand what i mean, Tactics actually have no real effect. In general the main problem with FM is that what rarely happens in real football, happens very often on this game. The game is more like a Hockey Manager. In a few words, FM16 is a polished version of the disappointing FM15. Except the transfer update, the rest of the features are pointless. No way to buy FM again. I would suggest to people NOT to buy FM16. Waste of time and money.

Football Manager 2016
I am an addict, like many football fans the FM franchise is a drug, we all get the latest fix every year.
However with each year that comes the cost of the drug is going up, the supplier is getting greedier.
Each year sees a few new graphics tweaks or menu changes which are largely cosmetic.
As other reviewers have noted, support is a joke. Thee are a number of glitches in the game not big, but signs of sloppy or hurried programming, as you play the game more, you notice a few things like this.
I had an issue with the game starting up on FM2015, wasn't satisfactorily sorted it, it may have been eventually, but I had lost interest by then.
After the latest update I am getting Game won't save messages" I've discovered that if I create a new Folder I can then save it

Football Manager 2016
Wow, what a difference!  FM16 is much better than the poor shadow of a game that FM15 was.

Just some quick comments:

1.  The goalie AI is miles better.  The reactions are more realistic, and diving saves are made when they are meant to.  A lot less opposition goals scored with keeper just standing there.  I feel like my team has a locked door again!!

2.  The defence AI is also much improved.  Where last year they would let players through easily, there is a real feeling that the defenders respond to tactics you set and that makes such a positive difference.

3.  I love the new animations for scoring, celebrating, remonstrating, falling and tackling.  I really like the little flicks of the ball that have been introduced as well.  Also some nice improvements in the build of players' faces on the pitch.  My computer was rated 3* for graphics, but there has been no problem with the best quality setting being used.

4.  The new tactics screen is super.  It makes it a lot more clear to use the 'pie' graphic to show whether the players are suited to a position and now a role.  Much much better.

5.  The new manager builder is a great idea.  I kind of managed to match my face but I have heavy stubble and glasses - any chance that SI could introduce facial hair and glasses settings for this?  Wouldn't mind so much if it was just for the match engine, but my attempt at my face comes up whenever I am quoted on screen and whatever.  However, that is the only thing I don't like about the manager builder.

6.  Injury frequency is much fairer than in FM15.  I no longer have an injury list the size of Glasgow.  I've gone from a consistent injury list of 8 first team players out to just 1 or 2 - much more realistic.  This makes such a difference SI - please don't change it when you release the final version.

7.  Injury type and associated time out of the team is much better balanced than in FM15.  The option to play through injury is good too.  SI have listened to us here, which is excellent.  I was kind of dreading playing this game after forking out for the beta, simply because the injury system crippled FM15 in my eyes, and I was afraid that this would be more of the same.  I am very happy that I have been proved wrong.

8.  The prozone tactical system is great.  Now we can access substitutions in a much slicker fashion, and it doesn't take an age to go through.  This helps the game continue quickly.

9.  There is a definite distinction between match fitness and match sharpness, and both affect the performance of the players in their own way.  A lot of thought has gone into this, and it works extremely well, even in beta.

Can you tell I'm a little impressed??

10.  I haven't tried the team builder yet but looking it over, it seems a great option.  I'll comment more fully when I have the chance.

SI, thank you for giving us a much better offering (so far) this season.  I will be playing this version of FM a lot more than I played the last one.

Football Manager 2016
I love the FM series and have played each one for the last five years.

I'm enjoying it but have some mixed feelings. There are new details, the opta stats are fun - players are a little harder to keep happy, tactics feel a bit sharper, but there is nothing here that feels like a big step. It's just an evolution. You could update FM15 with FM16 rosters and what have you and not really notice a significant difference...and that's a shame. Even all the new animations are not really that obvious. I'm waiting for something to blow me away but year in year out, its just minor progress. I still played the hell out of their games so they are obviously doing something very right. But for the full price - I expect more bang for my buck as a year in year out customer.

But yes, I still recommend this game, absolutely.



Football Manager 2016
This is the first time I have ever written a negative review and it pains me, however, as it stands now, I simply cannot recommend FM 2016 and regret that I purchased it.

I have been playing the series since CM 1998 and never once have I regretted purchasing the games until now.

Why the negative review?  Because in my opinion the Match Engine is simply broken.  Defending just doesn't work and is commical.  In 5 matches my keeper (Prem division) conceded 3 goals that slipped through his fingers and two goals from defender back passes.

I have spent the last 8 hours trying different tactics and formations and it seems very little actually affects gameplay.  Players do not follow instruction, defenders do not defend and goalies seem to make mistakes every game.

In addition, players do not follow instruction and seems regardless of what tactic/formation results do not alter (as mentioned, have been testing).

I have read they are looking to release a patch to fix some of the issues.  I will revisit this review at a later date and amend it if the patches actually fix the issues, but right now, I cannot recommend this game and would suggest sticking with 2015 instead until this has been patched to a playable state.

*sadface at posting negative review*

Football Manager 2016
This review is based on being a FM/CM player for over 20 years and someone who only ever plays the full mode, not classic or touch.

If you have never played FM before then it is the best game you can play, it is the latest, most up to date FM and (excluding presentation) the best because while it doesnt add much, it is a subtle improvement on 15, just as 15 was on 14. Although if you can buy FM14 for under 5, then buy that, get an updated database and in terms of value to what you play there wont be to much difference.

The thumbs down is purely for players who play FM year in year out. This is just not worth the 35. I wouldnt have bought FM2016 but it was bought for me as a present that I didnt ask for.

If you are in any doubt then have a look at the new features on the store page, 3rd down is manager on the touchline. 3rd down, it must be pretty important, it must be a huge new feature! now scroll through the screenshots until you get to the picture of the manager. That is what you get. Basically a huge slap in the face to every long-term FM user.

On the Sports Interactive FM forums there is a huge wishlist thread with over 6000 replies. Pick any random page and there are countless wishes for in-depth training, media pressure, player interaction, ME improvments, Board improvements. With the exception of the ME there has been no noticeable improvement in any of these over the last two years. This year we are treated to new features such as create a club, fantasy draft and manager on the touchline. Fine new features in themselves, widely asked for? no.

The game is all to easy to create all conquering teams that win trophies year after year. In real life how many managers stay at the same club and keep constantly winning trophies? Obviously Sir Alex Ferguson and a few others, but it should be hard, really hard to do. Its just to easy in FM. How many young players who are deemed wonderkids in real life go on to actually become superstars? Not that many, a handful from each generation. Not so in FM, buy a wonderkid, play wonderkid, watch wonderkid fulfill potential. On the other hand, want to pluck a kid from the french second division who no one really rates and watch him suprise everyone (ala Marhez of Leicester), no chance. The constrictive CA/PA system wont allow that until a FM researcher updates it for you. Its a system that is showing its age. They may have served the series well, but many of the systems FM16 incorporates are basic and easy to control because they havent moved forward in the last few years.

Football Manager really hasnt moved forward with the times. 15 to 20 years ago a lot of managers did run the club from top to bottom but these days top, top clubs arent run like that. FM does a really poor job of reflecting this, sure there is the token Director of football, the token head of development, but again very simplistic, basic systems that just doesnt reflect top level football in 2016. Managing a top club in FM16 feels more like a quaint throwback to the 90s than an actual reflection of what fooball has become in the last 15 years.

3 years ago I thought FM was about where it should be. Now its coming across stale and out of ideas. Going by the wishlist thread in their own forums theres 100s of great ideas, but for whatever reason SI has entered the change UI, tag on some light weight features and sell for full price approach. Its sad to see. I will still play it, but every year its getting harder to justify paying 35 for a game that isnt moving forward and is no longer reflecting the sport I watch and read about. I will still rack up the hours, but more because there is no other game to buy than what SI have developed.

The FM series needs a huge shake up. Every year real life football grows, the juggernaught keeps getting bigger and expanding. Every year that goes by where we have new features like create a club and fantasy draft is another year where FM loses ground on the sport its trying to represent. Its sad that the people in control of the games direction have completely lost sight of what gave the game its cult following. It got the basics of the football world right and let the players imagination fill in the gaps and build from there. The basics of the FM world dont feel right anymore. Without that basic foundation the imagination has no support, FM needs imagination to work or it is just a game and FM was never just a game.

Football Manager 2016
Alright, in hope that I can beat the unfunny reviews of this game, lets crack this one out!

Football Manager 2016 is part of the continual football (or soccer depending on where you hail from) series. This is the eleventh game in the series and will release officially in November 2015. The game was made available early for people who pre-purchased the game to take part in the beta testing phase. This review is based off my time in the beta thus far.

The game play of FM16 is exactly the same as all of the others; you take management over a football team and run everything to do with the sporting side of it. This includes picking your teams tactics, choosing which players to take part in matches, setting training regimes for your players, buying and selling players, agreeing contracts of your back room staff and players. Pretty much anything which a manager of a football team has to do, you also do in this game.  Each yearly release of FM comes with over 200+ changes compared to the last years. Some of this years biggest changes are as follows:

Players can now customize their players appearance. I have to admit, I wasn't a huge fan of this; mainly because I have no real interest in what my manager looks like in game, you hardly see the character at all. When creating my manager, it seems as if the actual appearance of your character doesn't change all that much when editing the face, you just get a strange looking mess of a face. For me, I hated this feature as it adds nothing real to the game.

The feature I am most excited about is the addition of a Fantasy draft - we see all sorts of drafts in American football, but not so in soccer. This feature will allow you to play with friends, set a budget, and draft your own team to go head to head with people online. I have played a bit of it so far, and it is awesome. It has a sort of pick up and play feel to it; if you have maybe just an hour to spare, rather than getting engrossed in the full game, load up a draft and play a couple of games. This is a welcome addition to the game if you ask me.

A create your own club feature has been added; this feature was already kind of included in previous generations of the game via the game's editor tool, but now it has been encorporated into the main game. Personally I have never used the old create a club feature, and probably won't even in this release. But what this does do is allow you to create a club from scratch and build it from the very bottom of the league structure and turn it into one of the best teams in the world. This is what I would call a hard mode difficulty setting and is a project which you need to set probably hundreds of hours to if you wants to succeed.

The main screen display you'll be seeing the majority of the time, looks just like an email inbox, you'll be sent items of news regarding your team, the league you are in, potential players you'd be interested in, injuries etc. You can choose whether to show more items, or fewer items depending on how in depth you want to go. When playing the matches, you'll be shown a 3D match engine. This has gotten a pretty heft face lift compared to previous titles, and it now looks even better than before. The players have a much smoother animation cycle, the stadiums look better; weather effects look more prominent too.  The game has various options for how you can view the match; such as birds eye view, or touchline settings, personally I went with the directors view most of the time because it adjusts to the best angel depending on where the ball is.

FM2016, has the new game modes as mentioned above, the regular full FM experience,  and a sort of watered down version, aimed at an audience who don't want to spend hours looking over numbers and statistics, this mode allows people to play matches in a couple of minutes and maybe complete a season in a few hours. If you want to get the full experience out of this game, the Full Game mode is the way to go, if you want a casual experience, maybe try with the classic mode.

As with all other FM games in the series, this game has ample replay ability, and I will easily see myself racking up hundreds of hours in this game. It will suck every second of your spare time and more if you let it. You can finish a season in the regular mode in maybe fifteen hours, that's just one season. You can effectively play this game forever, the game will just keep going and you'll eventually have yourself your own footballing universe which you'll probably find more interesting than the real world.

Even though this game is still in beta, I have had no technical issues with this release thus far. I will keep this review updated in case I do run into any, but as of now, this is a technically sound game and runs like a dream.

To sum up, if you are a fan of Football, and want to learn about the management side of things, or want to drop the FIFA franchise and try something different, you will find no other game out there that does it as well as Football Manager. It is a no brainer for me to recommend this game for any football fan. If you aren't so much of a football supporter, you'll probably want to skip this over, as you may not fully appreciate the content on show, but for me, this is a must play.


Tom's Score Card
1) Stay away
2) Not Recommended
3) Only recommended when on sale
4) Recommended
5) Highly recommended
6) This is a must play

Football Manager 2016
I've been a BIG fan of the series from CM right through, owned every release, and hand on heart im honestly disappointed that this years FM was nothing short of a small update on FM15 which in turn you could say was also a small update on FM14, besides the fact they added the feature of create a club and fantasy draft, you could do the first anyway with the editor, they've just made it easier for people.

The game itself is as though the difficulty level has been set to extreme, i have started no less than 8 saves with 8 jobs ranging from League 1 in England to Premiership clubs, all using different tactics, training methods and backroom staff, and the problems are all the same, with every club.

Injuries - Too many and way too long, one club i had 8 first team players out injured, 5 where over 6 months. This not only has an affect on results but other players happiness because results aren't positive, creating a game that you dont want to play. Same thing happened in every club.

Player prices, having to sell cheap and pay over the odds, again. This is nothing new with the game and i was under the impression it was fixed, clearly not.

Goals.. Every other game my teams concede a goal within the first couple of minutes of a match, even when on counter/defensive or attacking etc when starting off
The amount of times ive conceded a goal immediately after scoring is ridiculour. This hasn't just happened a few times, it's continuous, one game ended 4-4, i scored 17, they scored 18th, i scored 23rd they scored 25th, i scored 53rd they also somehow scored 53rd minute, and the last goal was 4 minutes into injury time after i scored on the 89th. I nearly threw my PC out the window.

There are other bugs and parts of the game which aren't up to scratch, so overall dissappointed.

Try the beta first if you an, make your own mind up, this could well be my last year playing FM.

Football Manager 2016
I've never written a review for anything before, but I just had to. What a shame, I'm not going to go into the details of why this game is terrible because many other players have set them out above. All I will say is that I have got the new Fm every year since i was 16, this is the only year that i've ever reverted back to the previous game. FM16 is unplayayble, I think they've become complacent and I won't be buying fm17. Doors open for a team to create a new football management game I think, everyone seems to hate this as much as me.

Football Manager 2016
Started my own club made my team and started in Spain sub divisions. Made my team win two cups in my first season, got promoted to Liga Adelante won promotion, had a 15 game winning streak made it to La Liga and got fired by my own club for losing against Barcelona.

10/10

Football Manager 2016
Overall I like FM again. 8/10

Pros
- Addition of Prozone. Huge, Huge addition to the game.
- Realistic Injuries. Injuries still happen but not as frequent and not as drastic.
- Star system isn't as restrictive.
- Improved transfer negotiations.
- Better Contracts

Cons or mild irritants
- Press Conferences. Very much improved but over time could become boring.
- Match Engine. Appears the same but a lot less errors.

Definitely would recommend this game, improvement over FM 2015.

Football Manager 2016
I have been a Football Manager player for as long as i can remember but this will be the last time i buy it. The game is far from realistic, If i could get my money back from Steam i most certainly would. So many bugs that should have been ironed out in the Beta version before the game was released to the general public. The match player is shocking and should have been reviewed before release. I read the reviews before buying this and still I bought it, please if you read these reviews save you 35 and spend it on something else. I have never been so dissapointed in a game as i have with this. Please read as many reviews  you can before committing to buying this game.

Football Manager 2016
+Player ratings are more realistic
+While there are good improvements;

-More expensive than previous years.
-It's still feels the game of previous years; so becoming boring and dissapointing.
-No new UI, innovative UI needed.
-Tactical freedom is no more free, some tactical choices are automatically disabled by your instructions given or positions. Every tactical settings should be open for tactical freedom. A good manager knows what is what, and don't need guide by seeing disabled unsuitable" tactical choices.
-Menu transition is slower.
-Injured player does not pass health checks so can not sign any injured player.
-Opponent team players not seem to get injured often.
-Fixture distribution is not good

Football Manager 2016
This is the worst release so far. I have signed 3 players for each position to deal with unending injuries, nearly impossible to win most teams at home even the ones at the bottom of the table and world class players play like they belong in league 2. Its broken and would not recommend you get it till its fixed.

Football Manager 2016
I want my life back.

Football Manager 2016
I already said good bye to my family. Hopefully I will find time to stop playing around April for my daughter's first birthday.

EDIT 1.0
On a slighty more serious note. I've been a huge fan of Championship Manager since 1990's, and I bought every iteration of Football Manager.

This year, as always, SI delivers.

Let's be honest - in the past we often received a flawed product, that was playable only after first big patch. This time - I don't see many bugs. Sure - I have a feeling that there might be slightly too many long injuries (my wingmen got injured for 4 and 6 months... then 2 of my attackers got injured for 2 months), but I do also take into account the fact, that I am leading a team with rather poor staff support.

This is the good, old Football Manager. No revolution this year, but as usual it feels like a more complete experience than the previous one.

Long story short: if you love football, and management games - grab it. If you can live without some adjustments that FM16 brings - stay with FM15.

Personally - I am happy that I bought it, and I am playing it like crazy :).

Football Manager 2016
I've been a fan of FM for years and years but this version is awful. The simple way to describe it is it's too hard but not in a challenging way, in a totally unrealistic way. The irony this is supposed to be one of the most realistic simulation games you can get. I'm no newbie to FM so am familiar with the tactics and systems but in this game you are instructed by you assistant to change your style constantly through each match. In real life a team has a style of play, they may change it slightly for certain teams or certain periods of matches but no dramatically. In each game I would be told retain possesion

Football Manager 2016
hey guys!

Just clocked 100 hours in the last 10 days since the release, so i know what im talking about.

This game feels almost like an downgrade from 2015.. if you think you are a master tactician, this game came to make you doubt yourself!! Its crazy! feels like the engine is always against you..

NEGATIVES
-You lose to 3rd division teams... frequently ;
- No goals opportunities(when you really need to win) even maxing the offensive mentality and the most offensive tactic
-no last minute wins against the ai, the opposite happens a lot
-bad goalkeepers, goals going through them is frequent
-Mourinho simulator: almost evey team will enter a slump of results, resulting in the most unrealistic match results and final standings(Barca AI is at 7th place right now )
-strugle to score when opposition scores first(happens a lot, losing 1-0 and the opposition basically sitting doing nothing)
-1st minute opposition goals: the game makes you feel like its normal to concede goals on the first atack15 seconds into the game! it happens a lot in this game trust me! ive been managing two clubs(sporting clube portugal and leeds utd)
-big clubs just buying every single player in the game, unrealistic transfers, saturating the squad resulting in them selling the player six months later

POSITIVES

+updated squads
+new clean look, new tactics menu
+.....can find more

Football Manager 2016
The match engine must have been designed by Moynes. Every cross is an auto goal. 4 Defenders between the goal and the forward receive a cross or 0, a goalk keeper that 'Rushes out' and one that prefers to say in. A deep sitting team or one pushing forward. A cross will find the forward like a magnet. Whether the winger is crossing it from the middle of the field or by the corner flag. You can watch 5 defenders and a goalie all stupidly stare at a cross while a mediocre forward from a lower league connects with the perfect fit.

But maybe you say I am just a bad FM. And that is possible -- except you can look at the statistics of every other team. 80% of goals are crosses. In fact thats what most matches are between two evenly matched teams, its cross and counter cross.

The other banalities of the game are just quirks of FM -- a sliding tackle strips your player but the ball falls to another one of your player who gives it back to the sliding player -- but the crosses simply take you out of the game. Presumably some programmer watched a game once and saw a cool cross from the deep land perfectly on the tip of a strikers foot and decided that this is the only way goals can be scored.

Oh and also there is a pretty nasty memory leak. But thats usual for FM engines so if you soldiered on through to 2016 its no surprise.

To those who are still on the fence about FM16, dont buy it. Stick with FM15. There isnt much more than cometic upgrades and improvements to talk about. Such as icons where there were none before, and new colors on menues etc.

As far as the ingame match engine goes, it actually seem worse than the FM15 with A L O T of horrible bugs and completly unrealistic things happening. Closing down, marking, passing and keeper work is abysmal. Keepers on Premier level are conceding goals in such a way you most definatley will struggle to keep all of your hair intact after a few hours play.

As mentioned the closing down is also a freakin joke. Top players running passed the ball instead of collecting it,  man marking or closing down where palyers seems to have opposite magnets attached to them.

I could go on and on and on and on and on about why you should NOT buy this game, but take my word for it. If i could get a refund i would, and i've bought every single game since the first Championship Manager back in the early 90's.

DO NOT BUY this pile of dung and keep supporting developers like this who think a DLC warrants a FULL price. F off!.

Football Manager 2016
Well here it is. Another FM for all of us to dump endless hour into only to come back and rage about the injurys and how tactically you dropped the ball. But why? Why so many injurys? Why did my perfect" tactic fail to work? Why why why?
Honestly this seems like the first questions I always seem to ask myself playing the FM games

Football Manager 2016
Finally FM16 released...
I bought as a FM fan. I play FM since 2003. And I have to admit that the last 3 years the game is really bad....
I dont regret buying this game cause as a fan I always love to try" to manage my team.
But

Football Manager 2016
Buy this game if you like being locked in a room all day, vitamin D deficiencies, and just simply don't want to deal with the confinements of real life anymore. Because trust me, once you play this game, there is no going back. The only people interaction you will have in the real world is with the Pizza delivery person.

Pros:
+ New Prozone match analysis is extremely useful especially for those who create their own tactics, and speaking of tactics; the tactics manager is refined and is easier to use than ever. With a completely redesigned set piece creator that makes the difference between building a winning tactic and a losing one much more distinct. It's easier to see where your tactics are going wrong / right, and because of this, if it's going wrong you're going to be able to figure it out much more easier than last year's iteration.
+ Draft Mode is a winner, Who doesn't love fantasy football? Now you can have it inside your favourite football management sim.
+ Injuries aren't as horrifically prominent as they were during the early builds of last year's game.
+ Create-A-Club mode allows you to create your own team and lead your creation to glory. (Replaces a team in the league you choose)
+ Realistic data for almost every player in the WORLD playing across tens of thousands of different leagues. That's just phenomenal!
+ Refined matchday Engine with better 3d graphics.
+ Still easily the best football management simulation in the world, and most likely it forever will be with the sheer amount of work put into this database. This game is a literal universe inside your PC, load it up and you'll be sucked into another dimension where suddenly YOU were actually good at football in the past, and have retired to lead Wigan Athletic to champions league glory.

Meh:
= Press interaction is slightly more varied this year, no more pressing random buttons and hoping you didn't say something to  your star player off. The new conferences will keep you intrigued for at least the first 24 hours of gameplay. (Then it's back to your ol' Assistant Manager because you have nothing to say A la Jose Mourinho)
= Customizing your own manager is neat, but it lacks options. There are only a few different choices for hair styles, colors, and outfits. It doesn't prove to be the immersive feature it is advertised as, because I couldn't copy my likeness.
= The beta is not without it's fair share of bugs, from the silly, to the game crashing; and i'm sure the first versions of the full game are likely to have some too, but it's to be expected with the sheer size of this game. It will just get better over time though, as the devs are highly active and the final version of FM15 was almost bug free from my experience.

Cons:
- Chelsea are actually good in this game.

Football Manager 2016
Barely an upgrade on 15, if at all. The new features were really quite small and do not improve the game at all. Create a manager? really? It looks like the Sims 1, which is not good graphics for this day and age. Create a team? Just a far more limited way to make a team than using the editor, and you cannot use your own logo or kit! It is another year I just cannot give it a thumbs up.

Football Manager 2016
I skipped the past 3 iterations of Football Manager because this game consumes my life for about 6 months straight, every day.

I forgot how bad the addicition can be, and now I remember why I skipped them. Can't. Stop. Playing.

Football Manager 2016
I think this is the first Football Manager in a few years to offer some actual innovations rather than just 'tinkering' with the system and interface.  It's about time that happened as well as some aspects in the game were getting really quite dated, especially the match engine.

On the subject of the match engine: It really looks like they have tackled this in 2016, especially regarding the goalkeeper and defence, who now actually interact as players on the pitch instead of just going through the motions for the engine.

Tactics ACTUALLY seem to work for once, so asking for direct football will actually get you direct football with forceful wingers and killer balls attempted.  They had started to try and fix this in 2015, but still seemed like they were going through the motions to mask a pretty average match engine.

I am really enjoying the new detailed staff page as well, you can now see exactly who is doing what at the club, and where your club ranks in the league at staff skills.  This was always an underdeveloped part of the game for me, as a club's backroom staff is just as important as the players on the pitch.

I hear the prozone is good as well, but not something I have looked at in detail as of yet.

There are, however, still some issues:

The blighted over developed press conferences are still in the game.  MY GOD these are boring, and I don't think SI actually realise how dull they have made this, which is ironic as a lot of development time seem to have gone into making it 'intuitive'.  Let's make this clear though - intuitive means nothing if it isn't entertaining.  My solution is simple...drop all the press nonsense, that just kills playing time, and allow people to have a preset button which gives you avatar a way of dealing with the press - range it from 'conspiracy theorist' right through to 'upbeat and passive'.  You can then change you demeanor as and when you see fit - so if you are in a slump you can do the 'world is against us' mentality if you wish to, without having to spend 5 mins reading through very dull rhetorical journo questions! The whole 'get your assistant manager to do it' just doesn't wash for me either, as press management is an important part of creating a team mentality.

The interface still looks like it was developed by a sociopath, however I get SI not caring too much as Steklo will no doubt just create a great new indie Skin over the next couple of months anyway.


Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Let me qualify here, I like this game quite a bit and I think it does deserve all the praise it recieved. So why the negative review? Well for one, Steam doesn't give me the option to have a neutral review, and two I want to give potential buyers some reasons as to why they wouldn't want to buy in. Most of the negative reviews don't really do that, at least not in detail.

I've been following this game for a long time, a lot of love has gone in to its development, and it really shows through the quirky spritework. The problem with the development is that it's just been so painfully slow that I can't recommend spending $15 on it at this point, because the desire to check back in after a few months when nearly nothing new has been added fades away after over two years; and that's how long I've had this game. It was first released for beta purchase around April 1, 2014.

Over the course of two years, the story has essentially gained one new dungeon (of which there was only one before) along with a marginal amount of content that shows this game is going to be in development for many more years. The content that's there is good, sure, but it's not so stellar as to justify playing through the story more than once or twice.

The real mode that seems to add playtime to this game is its arcade mode, which is roguelike in nature, and requires a good understanding of enemy/boss patterns to do well in. Players play through two floors representing each area in the story mode, complete with enemies from said area, and have no chances to heal except at the end of each floor. Despite having numerous floors and all of the enemies from the story mode, it's pretty light on content in terms of roguelikes. There are unlockables and such, but they only give minor advantages, and as a result adding more floors to the mode seems kind of pointless in its current state. Even after over two years of going back to this game I struggle to reach the 7th floor of what must be over 14 at this point. There isn't much incentive to bother trying to reach those floors either.

So should you buy this game? Well that depends on how patient you are. After two years I'm pretty burned out and don't see myself playing this game for a long, long time. If you think you can wait for what could be 5 years to play a finished product and want to support the developers, then by all means get this game. If not, keep an eye on it and pick it up a few years down the road when it has a more justifiable amount of content to offer.

Edit: Thanks for all the support guys, since this review got so much attention I want to add a little more.

If you're worried about spending $15 on a game that won't be finished, don't be. This game is a safe buy in my opinion. Even though the development has been very slow, it has been extremely consistent and the team behind this game definitely has what it takes to finish the job. Secrets of Grindea has been in the works since 2011, and the quality of the content in it has only improved since. Their dev blog[www.secretsofgrindea.com] has a weekly recap that is posted nearly every week without missing a beat. So if you're interested, definitely keep an eye on this game, because it is one of the better early access titles out there, despite the slow development speed.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Let me start off by saying if you think this game doesn't have grinding in it...then seek help. There are people who care about you and don't wish to see you go down this path (not me per se, we've only just met. But I'm sure there are people who love you very much. Like your grandmother or that neighbor with the nice rack. Anyway, I'm going off topic here).

Secrets of Grindea is a tongue-in-cheek RPG that draws heavily on the nostalgia of games like Secrets of Mana, Zelda: Link to the Past, and Illusion of Gaia. The sprite animations and colorful backgrounds mimic classic 16-bit games and go well with the fluidity of combat. NPCs are prevalent in towns and in the overworld to the point where the world does not feel empty and that their character is not some lone warrior living on a planet full of monsters (though that sounds like an awesome game idea. Dibs). Each area has its own unique feel that you will hopefully enjoy because the aforementioned grinding will have you staying in one area killing the same enemies for drops.

The combat is extremely straight forward where your basic attack is spamming one button or having a charged skill where you hold and release one button. Let me go on record to say that I do not think this is a bad thing. Sure, you won't be chaining attacks that culminate in your wooden sword hitting with the power of a tactical nuclear device, but you will be unlocking and upgrading skills that define the way you, the player, wish to play. The skills are limited (for now I hope) to a 1 handed skill set, 2 handed skill set, and a magic skill set. The player is able to mix and match these skills however he or she wants and has the option to refund some or all of the skill points that were spent by spending gold (this is done in the menu rather than with an NPC). There is a bow the player can get from a sidequest but so far doesn't have a dedicated set of skills to leveling up the damage.

The story is pretty straightforward for an RPG of the era it emulates: You are a guy or gal that wakes up, is handing a magical bag that can hold anything without weight restrictions and are sent out to become a renowned member of the Collectors". It seems

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Where to begin.  This game is as advertised.  It's a game similar to Secret of Mana (SNES), Crystalis (NES), Zelda-esque, Final Fantasy Adventure (Original GB)  and many other old RP games.

You can customize your character physically by gender, colour of your clothes, hair style and colour, and name.  Additonally, you get a vanity part for your hat, face, weapon, and shield.

The gameplay is very nice, you can be a full warrior, full mage, whatever you want to be; a combination if you want.  Although, being a healer is not an option.

This is a beta game, it's not complete, from my estimation it's a little near half done, if that.

You can play cooperatively, over the internet, using your steam friends list or direct IP!  This is awesome!

You grind in the game, if that wasn't obvious.  (What old school console RPG didn't have you grind?  It's part of the fun!)

The transition between keyboard and controller playing is seamless, you just start using your keyboard and it swaps to keyboard mode, you use your controller, it swaps to controller mode.  I found this particularly great!

The host of the game's save file is progressed in the story, however - if you're not the host - you keep everything you gained.  You simply have to play through the story (by hosting or single player) to go through it.  The rewards though, you do not acquire again, you already have them!  :D

This is an awesome game!  As far as I'm aware only three people are working on it and they're from Sweden.  They have me as a fan.  The sprite animation is awesome, the artwork for the avatars is great and expresses much emotion, and the game looks very polished for a beta that is not even half done!

I used to pay $50+ US dollars for games like these, and wait years for the next to come out.  I love the game very much, and I haven't even started exploring the Arcade Mode.

tl;dr - Buy this game if you loved Secret of Mana or any similar games on the console or PC.  Especially if you want to play it co-op with friends over the internet!

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

To review this game is to review it in two parts.

Story Mode: An amazing adventure akin to the days of Secret of Mana, Sword of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3. Quick swordplay with an oldschool-meets-polish aesthetic that's filled with charm. Combat is quick paced and - with over 20 skills and spells with multiple charge levels, along with 30 talents - more or less unique for every character made. Every attack, skill and spell feels as if it has weight behind it for a thoroughly satisfying brawl through hordes of monsters and challenging bosses.

The story is serious at times, tongue in cheek in others without outright resorting to cheese. There's plenty of side-quests, mini-games and collectables, but contrary to the name no grinding appears to be necessary. The shield is as relevant to the gameplay as the sword is, every attack can be blocked if you know the exact timing, reminding me of the days of 'Timed Hits' from Super Mario RPG and Final Fantasy 8.

The music is beautiful, the characters well written to make you love or hate them, I can't say enough good things about Story Mode. The only shame is it's incomplete, but between pet taming, treasure hunting, fishing, card collecting, playing with 4 player online co-op and duking it out in the arena, there's more than enough content to keep me busy between updates.

Arcade Mode: All the rules from Story Mode no longer apply, Arcade Mode feels like an entirely different game. Less Secret of Mana, more Binding of Isaac. You start in an empty plain and delve within a randomized roguelike-esque labyrinth. Each room is different every time, filled with traps and all manners of enemies or bosses not present in Story Mode. HP is precious, mastery of skills, spells and shielding is required.

Arcade Mode is perfect for sinking endless hours into as you try to go deeper and deeper into the labyrinth, gaining points and essence to level up and expand your town, unlock new NPCs to aid you, take on quests for rare and unique loot not found anywhere else. Skills and spells are best experimented with in here to see which build suits you best. With friends it's harder, but with 4 people on screen the monsters barely stand a chance once you hit your groove. The online leaderboards for Arcade Mode help to give it even more replay value by trying to do better than your friends or complete strangers to try and hit #1.

If you have any doubts whatsoever, try the demo. With an hour of Story Mode gameplay, several hours of Arcade Mode and co-op bundled into the demo, it's a great teaser for what to expect moving forward.

Tip: Opt into 'Frontline' by selecting SoG in your library if you want quicker updates. The normal version receives slower updates, but your experience in the game will be much smoother.

This review is based on the game in its current state at the time of posting and is completely my opinion. Yours may differ to mine. I also only really played the story mode and did co-op.
Secrets of Grindea is an action RPG with a major focus on the story and meticulous detail worked into its environments and graphics.

I just completed everything in the Secrets of Grindea that is currently available in the version out at this time and I have to say that what they have so far is fan-bloody-tastic.

Things I liked
Fantastic pixel graphics with fluid animations that make me say wow" in some circumstances
An interesting story with creative sidequests and lovely characters
Hats and lots of them. I'm a Team Fortress 2 man and I found the choice of hats to be most adequate.
The plethora of references. I won't spoil any of them

I bought this for myself and my best friend. We're using our DnD characters. I love this so much. As does she. When my birthday hits I'll buy it for another friend and you know what.....I will buy someone a coffee <3. Keep developing guys and gals. You've made my day with the wimsical game. It brought back good memories of playing resident evil together, zelda games, and animal crossing. We have fishing contests with each other, and when we summon our cute monsters we give them names. My friend's ice summon was named Baby Meta/ Baby Metaknight <3, and the cloud summon I use is named Malo. It seems my friend though has the heart of the cards as she finds them all leaving me in the dust. We'll play this game till we get 100% for everyone. Thank you so much for your hard work. You've made two best friends so happy.

I wasnt %100 sure about this game until i finally said screw it and bought it.

It's like if legend of zelda, chrono trigger, and secrets of mana had a baby and taught it funny one liners.

10/10 i highly recommend.

Will edit post once ive put more time into it.

Edit:
So far ive made it to the second main boss.
My thoughts so far is the bosses are well made and very creative. They are hard to fight and you have to learn every pattern very well if you hope to beat them. There is a little grind in the game but thats all just part of the experience.

Edit: 2
I have made it as far as i can in early access. Loved it the whole way through. Cannot wait for a new update to add more content.

So. I got this game because it was cheap, and looked kinda fun. Well, I was not really expecting to be too amused, the game looked kinda low Q and corny.

6 hours later i nthe same sitting, I realized I had not eaten anything, nor had a bathroom break. Well, it was a little late.

10/10 would sit in  again.

Now for a more serious review.


This game is 15 bucks at the time of this review.

I have spent 30 on games that were NOT EVEN CLOSE to as good. I mean, after 20 minutes the game is already throwing you into a deep and fun story. after an hour you have already laughed your  off more than once, and the game does a damned good job of not taking itself to serious.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

This game has driven me to make my first serious review about a game, ever.

This game is one of the most satisfying RPG experiences I have ever had, ranking above many AAA games.
Everything about this game brings about an intense craving to  play more  in the best possible way.

Pros:
Combat
-Large skill tree filled with unique and interesting abilities.
-If you like an ability you can level it up over time to make that ability do more awesome stuff
-The freedom to mix melee / ranged spells to create a unique playstyle
-Epic and highly original bosses that are frequent and challenging

The Story and Regions
-Colorful and vibrant art style with very well done sound effects
-Likeable characters and lighthearted approach make for an enjoyable story with a mysterious undertone
-Main quests take you to several areas that are have their own unique themes and enemies
-Regions are fairly large with explorable secrets and puzzles containing hidden loot

Loot and Cards
-The everpresent chance of obtaining cards" is one that creates the urge to grind each area's different enemies
-Not only do enemies drop cards they drop crafting materials as well as rare and unique equipable gear to further create incentive to grind

THE DEVS!
-The trio over at Pixel Ferrets are incredibly talented and hard working
-Weekly dev blog updates along with frequent patches add tons of content at a high rate
-Buy them coffee to add hyperspeed perk to your favorite dev team

Other Pros:
-Easy to connect multiplayer supporting up to 4 people
-Well done controller support
-A talking bag that roasts people

Cons:
-Smallish amount of craftable material (But of course more will be added over time)
-Some bosses are way harder than others on the hard difficulty (perhaps need more difficulty settings?)

As an early access review the full potential of this game has yet to be realized however; this game has so much personality

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Story-wise, it's nothing special. The story is well-written, funny at times, but ultimately nothing that will win any prizes.
Action-wise, it's nothing special. Combat systems and skill trees reminiscient of soo many other games of the same kind.
Visuals are not really anything special either. Everything is cute and well-made, like in so many other games of the same kind.

But you know what? It's engaging, it's fast-paced, it's completely glitch-free and smooth, and most importantly it supports multiplayer through Steam. It's both a relaxing and fast-paced Action RPG that I can definitely recommend that you enjoy with a friend or two. Not to mention it is still in Early Access, which means there's lots of content to still come.

So far, this game is extremely well-made and polished, and definitely something you can sink some time into, alone or not; though the multiplayer aspect was ultimately what made me buy it. I haven't tried the arcade mode yet, but I already feel I've seen enough of this game to recommend it dearly.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

I've been waiting for a game like this for YEARS.

Zelda/ Ys meets Castlevania, with a story like something out of SNES-era JRPGs.

Grindea doesn't take itself too seriously, but really hits home with amazing sprite animations, exeptionally tight and ballanced gameplay, a loot/crafting system that makes you actually want to collect things you don't need, and a simple, yet complex level up system that honestly doesn't feel like any I've seen before, and to top it off, it's got a killer hard mode (arcade mode) that reminds me why I suck at rouguelikes, yet for some reason keep coming back to them!

Oh, AND it's got a great coop system! My gf and I look for fun coop games pretty frequently, and we're often dissapointed. Not this time! Great weekend gaming/ veg session!

The only gripe I have, is that since it's early access, the adventure content is incomplete. It took the two of us about 14 hours to complete" the story at 100%. Arcade mode had more stuff

This game is what I've been missing since the advent of the Nintendo 64 and Playstation.  A quality, amusing, fun, multiplayer RPG that lets you be who you want to be and play with your friends.  A lot of the game is simple enough to pick up, while other aspects seem frustratingly incomprehensible (at first).

The Good:Can choose the colors of your character's clothes and hair to stand out from other players
Can change your character's hairstyle to stand out as well
Can not only equip masks to look different, but can equip a style" for masks

This might be catching your interest, and it definitely is very interesting. Even though they still are on early access, then they made a really good job on keeping me going with this game. I usually don't enjoy singleplayer games, so i only play Local Co-op with my girlfriend.

OBS!!! FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LOCAL CO-OP!!
There is just one little thing that made me frustrated. That is how to fix the Local Co-op mode. I had to search around a bit until I found it. You have to download something called steam_appid.txt which you can find on this link down here: (file is from a staff member called Teddy)

http://secretsofgrindea.com/forum/index.php?threads/local-co-op-on-2-computers.913/

Put it in the ...Steam\steamapps\common\SecretsOfGrindea folder. Then you have to run 2 windows at one time and do some other things in order to make each controller locked for each window you opened. You'll find more out on the steps that you will be following in the guide on that page!

It works really good when you get everything to work! I play on two different monitors at the same time, my laptop screen and TV screen using HDMI cable. Works really well! You can also have two windows running in a single monitor ofc, or 4 windows if you would like that. It has its cons and pros ofc.

The best 2D RPG i have played in modern times!

I am captured by this game, it's the only modern 2D RPG that I love and spent hours experimenting in. I have been wanting a game like this for so long, but I could never find any good ones.
Anyone who liked Secret of Mana or the Zelda games are stupid to not try this, you will love this game!

I am so in love with this game that I read the dev blog every week to see if they have released any new content.

+The developers are super friendly and open about their work. They post all their work and progress weekly on their blog, and they anwer most of the questions and suggestions the community post on their forum. Never experienced a more caring and passionate company than Pixel Ferrets!

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

I hate grinding. I really do. But not in this game as the grinding is rewarding and the battle system is a lot of fun.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO GRIND - BUT YOU'LL WANT TOSecrets of Grindea is a 2D Action-RPG with roots in the SNES-era ARPG games such as the Mana-series and Legend of Zelda. The battles are fast and the basics are quite easy to learn. You can't just button smash your way through though. The system is very much reliant on your skills and strategies, despite the fact that you can grind for levels to overpower yourself.

The beauty of the game is that you don't have to grind an excessive amount of time, but often you'll want to. If you just want to enjoy the story and explore the world, you can advance fairly quickly through the story. Boss battles are often very tough if you're underleveled but with a correct strategy, they are very beatable without power grinding. You unlock new areas to explore by advancing the story and you are free to roam the areas you've unlocked. The enemies are visible on the map and they are all avoidable.

A 2D SANDBOX WITH TON OF STUFF TO DOFor the completionists, there is a ton of optional things to do. There's fishing, potion-making, side-quests, secrets, puzzles, pet catching, pet leveling, arena-battles, crafting and a ton of mob drops that are hard to get. I myself have already spend at least 2 times more than my Steam play-time shows in this game, doing all the optional stuff. That was over a year ago when there wasn't this much new content in it yet.

The leveling system is very nice since you get points to spend on skills as you please. There is a good amount of different skills to choose from and all of them have strategic value. There is also a lot of different equipment which you can buy, craft or get as a drop from the monsters.

YOU DON'T PLAY POKEMON-GAMES FOR THEIR STORYThe story isn't awful either. It's not the focus of the game nor the main reason to buy the game. It has enough meat in it to keep you motivated to go further and to give some context to your adventure but don't expect it to move you to tears or grab you emotionally. Think Pokemon games and their story and you'll know what level of story-telling to expect.

As a big fan of stories and powerful story-telling in games, I would've wanted a more compelling story-telling personally but because of the strong gameplay, the lack of PSX-era Final Fantasy-esque story telling doesn't bother me much at all.

TOO LONG, DIDN'T READAll in all, this has been my #1 most anticipated indie-game since 2013, when I bought the pre-order beta. SoG is a a good balance of excellent gameplay, exploration and story. While the story is not up to par with the gameplay, the complete package is still excellent and the 3 Swedish Stooges can be proud of what they've been working on for all these years.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

If you are looking for a game to evoke your memories of childhood, this is it.  Secrets of Mana was bar none my favorite game on the SNES.  Nothing I have played since gives quite the same feeling of grinding on rabites for hours on end to build weapon skills.

Not only does Grindea have a similar battle system, but it adds several customization options, from combat skills to magic to costumes, it also adds puzzle elements and arcade modes for further challenge.  The rare loot drops keep you farming mobs and bosses, and for the meta meta minded, there are card drops from in game enemies, in game achievements, Steam achievements, and presumably down the road, Steam cards.  It's a total overload of gathering meta!

If I had to pick some complaints about the game, here they are:

Arcade mode - I'm not patient enough, and never get passed the first or second stage.  Gimme a heal, dammit.

Greenlight - It took way too long to get Greenlight, dammit.

Development time - Stalking the devblog gets old after a while.  It has been way too long a wait for the complete game, dammit.

I might have an issue with patience.

Do yourself a favor, if you ever enjoyed overhead Nintendo games, support the devs, give this a shot.  It's only an amazing themesong and a fuzzy sprite away from being a classic.

Also, hats.  That is all.

This is a fun little ARPG, Well worth the price, lots to do and smooth gameplay. Reminds me of the good old SNES days, and includes lots of references to other games. Kudos to the devs on a job well done, I've only played a little bit of the game so far but i am really liking what i have experienced. I like the fact you can relive boss fights encase you missed an item or if you just want to practice against them. I get nervous when it comes to Early Access titles, but this one tops every other i have tested. Really like the artwork, sprites and music. Lots of different ways to build your character. Refund stats option is nice. Feels like a finished game, cannot wait to see what the devs add in later on.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

It's a zelda-eqse play-with-your-friends 8 bit RPG + an additional mode where you can play it as a roguelike with your friends. It's incredibily polished and the combat system is well refined and requires more timing and depth than other games of the same genre. While some of the ways to beat the bosses are cliche, this is not necessarily a downside because they are splendidly executed. Furthermore, there are a fair amount of bosses whose patterns/attacks the developers have taken creative liberty to make unique, unexpected, and enjoyably difficult. Characters are not class bound; rather each character has a limited number of usuable skill points and the same pool of skills they can choose from. This allows for multiple unique playthroughs on both story and arcade (roguelike) mode. I haven't found a similar game that brings forth the amount of depth, polish and nostalgia that Grindea has.



Secrets of Grindea

What I like in this game :
- Cute arts, animations, sounds and musics (it's really well crafted and lots of tiny details)
- Cute story (not finished yet, but the beginning is nice)
- Fishing mini game
- Pet collecting
- Card collecting that gives you character stats
- Customisable character, with vanity slots for armors and weapon just for look !
- Skill system (I haven't played enought yet to judje it indepth, but just to play casually for the moment, it's simple and gives you a lots of choices to  build up differently your character)
- Grinding ! (mobs will respawn quickier if you grind in one place, it's also easy to travel around the map without timer or charges or any annoying time gate. Grinding is fun and that's awesome !)
- Combat (not too easy, not too difficult either. It's fun and not boring. It helps a lot with the grinding point too !)
- multiplayer : easy to host or join a game. Just becarefull of the ping :p
- Arcade mode : addictive and hard !

What I don't like :
-

What I would love to see in the game :
- Housing ! I found some housing item so I guess that will come.. maybe ? :D
- more mini games !

Yeah there is nothing in the what I don't like" list

So Hey guys :)
i played the game a lot for a long time and i love it
its like they write in the Key Feature the Skill System is something new so you can build some kind of archemage, aoe barbarian etc.
BUT
it only exists 2 Support skills and the story isnt done yet so if you wanna buy the game think of that
The Arcade mode is a roguelike like in Binding of Isaac
and sorry for my english im from germany :)
so if the devs keep the work like theyre doing till yet and youre a fan of secrets of mana its a must have in my eyes

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

I have over 100 hours pumped into the game [if you include the pre-steam access] and this is one of my favorite games of all time.

Pros:
- Typical story, but hilarious dialog, fun characters and environmental/discovery-based story telling makes it a great experience.
- Super deep and rewarding combat system with a plethora of skills and mechanics to master such as the perfect guard.
- Enemies and bosses attack differently between normal and hard mode, as well as single or multiplayer
- Skill charging makes it so you have almost 3 different skills at your disposal despite leveling only one skill.
- Loads of side quests, mini games and discoveries to be found.
- Multiplayer with up to 4 players that is super smooth gameplay-wise. Connection is also easy via Steam friend list.
- Gorgeous pixel art that contains many little details to make the game world feel alive.
- Music fits each area very well and does not overstay its welcome at all.
- Arcade (roguelite) mode adds a ton of replayability. Beating it is hard enough, the side roguelite quests and high score chasing allows infinite replayability.

Cons:
- Non-hosts may experience lag, which ruins the multiplayer experience [case-by-case basis]
- Would be nice for some skills to interact with each other more for multiplayer mayhem [Earth spike wall + Smash?]

Early Access Review

I loved playing Zelda, Secret of Mana, Illusion of Time and many other games on my SNES. I still own it and from time to time I hook it up to my TV and replay these games.
Secrets of Grindea fits right in.

Pros:
Very well written!
Great Story so far!
Crafting!
Lootz!
Absolutely beautiful in both the sound and art department!

Cons:
Early Access and thus not done yet! :)

Would I recommend this game?
Absolutely!!!
And I really think it is worth its money even in the state" it is right now which is amazing for an early access game!"

Early Access Review

This game is absolutely awesome!
The game provides a great story and a mind thinking gameplay! Every boss needs some type of thinking to be able to beat it with is good! It is competetive which keeps it interesting! The arcade mode is absolutely terrific! Ive been playing for a really long time now and ive only reached floor 7 or something! So its really a challenge, but it isnt impossible!

The only bad thing about the game is that it is not done! But this is only early access, and people who buy it now, agree on that! ;)

Remember that only 3 developers work on this game and therefor it may be hard to release content as fast as we wish! Its epic that they (only 3) are able to release such good content with only 3 people working on it! By time updates have come out faster and I think its super awesome with updates because it is always something to look  forward to!

P.S
The COOP Mode is awesome!

Game isn't done yet, but WOW it's good already. Definitely worth a look, especially since there's a free demo available. Why does nobody else do demos anymore? Such a good idea.

Early Access Review

This game is great Reminds me of Ragnarok online in that you horde tons of sellable junk. It's great the dev. did not choose to make this game another mmo and offered it as a stand alone/multi player game instead. Wish there were more rpg's out there like this.

1. Has a great sound track
2.you can craft items (makes it hard not to want to sell thing's untill you know you don't need it for a reciepe later.)
3. You can fish (alot like fishing in the breath of Fire games.)
4. You can custimize the color of your character and outfite. Also has gender selction.
5. For you card collectors you can collect Cards that inhance your stats permanently, comes with album for card storage.
6. It has multi player yaaay!
7.Fast travel to get around the map quicker.
8. You can fight bosses over again from the collecters HQ.
9. This game is made for horders who doesn't love beating up slimes and rabbits for bits of jelly and hide screw mother nature!
10. If you loved Earthbound and Secrete of Mana with a touch of Ragnarok online then this game is for you becuase it has a well developed story with a variety of characters with unique personalities never a dull moment .

(This game is easily played with a keyboard but i would recomed a controller.)

Oh. My. God. The movie trailer does nothing for this game. They make it look almost too cartooney - however - If Secret of Mana and Zelda had a lovechild... you get this game. It is so FUN and addicting. Ive been playing multiplayer with my brother and sister in law who live 3 hours away and its the coolest way to connect with them. It is exciting and challenging for seasoned gamers, but my sister-in-law who never picks up a controller can play right along with us. The game itself has lots to do - quests, LOTS of side activities so you wont get bored. And dare I say... grinding/farming is actually somehow... FUN in this game? I havent found 1 singular thing i did not like about this game. It's a magestic work of art. For the love of god and all things holy PLEASE keep on developing and adding more content. Not like we need any yet... We've played 22 hours getting trophies and doing quests and upgrading our gear so we havent even made a dent in the story line. But this game is worth every  cent. Buy it. You wont regret it. Dear Developers: YOU STRUCK GOLD, KEEP GOING!

Not a Mexican game but still pretty good. Might be somewhat influenced by Mexican mythology. We have lots of bags, amulets and murder in Mexico.

All in all, probably the best non-Mexican game I ever played.

Early Access Review

Secrets of Mana.... I mean of Grindea is a great game so far, Although unfinished (As most betas are) The secret of Grindea is a homage to one of the best RPGs to the SNES, adding in it's own spin on the classic game style. The bosses are challanging, the animations and gameplay is fluid and really nice, you can fish, there are hats. All in all it's a really solid game so far, and I'm excited to see what they can do with it.

This is definitely a game to look forward to once it's complete. Although I wouldn't reccomend people buying it right now at the stage it is at unless they want that nostalgia of playing this style of game with friends. I think it's still a little too incomplete to be playable for an extended period of time... Mainly because you'll finish how much they have in the game so far fairely quick. But if the Devs read this, Keep up the good work, because if the rest of the game is as good as how much of it I have seen. And if the content of it keeps expanding so there's replayability to it this is going to be a game that brings a lot of people to it.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

I'd would definitely recommend you trying this game out! The whole atmosphere in this game is based of the genre RPG. This game also includes two kind of game modes. Story mode and Arcade Mode. In my personal opinion I'd recommend starting off with Story Mode. It introduces you to the game in such a good way. You'll understand the controls quickly, trust me. The game also features this Co-Op mode where you can create your own world and play together with your friends! Making a Co-Op world is not in any way Time-Consuming. You host a world, create a hero, make a password for it. Done. It's no big deal. As said above, the game also include the Arcade Mode. The goal in Arcade Mode is to beat your previous record, achieve new trophies and upgrade your town by completing quests! Though whenever you die in Arcade Mode, you will spawn in your town from the start. It's not a big deal since you will be able to upgrade your skills from the start. You can upgrade your skills and spells by achieving the so called Essence". Essence is found when you beat enemies in Arcade Mode. By leveling up in Arcade/Story Mode

Classic Legend of Zelda clone with RPG elements and 4 player co-op, and dare I say it, even better than Four Swords. Amazingly fun.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

This game hits all my right buttons, and even after beating the story (so far) in hardmode, I have yet to get anywhere NEAR beating the arcade mode.

Combat is extremely satisfying, graphics are stunning, and the extreme polish on what exists so far is apparent.

Will edit for more detail later.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Charming, fun, vibrant and addicting - this is one great RPG!

In this world you are a Collector, someone who explores and adventures across the world in search of rare loot and items of power! Every enemy in the game has at least one rare drop" to collect so this really is a game for players who love to collect/farm/grind! There is also a crafting system that can *GASP* actually make powerful and useful gear!

The combat gives off vibes of Secret of Mana but its much less rigid and limited than the old school RPGs of yore are. You can choose freely amongst 1h melee with shield

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Secrets of Grindea is an ARPG inspired by old classics such as The Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana etc.

You play as a Collector (or a Collector to be) in the world of grindea, a world where everyone is obsessed with collecting items and despite the word Grind" in the title

One of the few games where fighting the same boss over and over actually makes you feel like you're getting better at the fight.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

This game is one of the most beautiful and wonderfully animated games I've played. Gameplay is addicting and fun and getting friends to join you makes this game that much more awesome. This game has been in development for a good while now (about 2 years I believe) but shows a lot of promise. Highly recommend!

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

I like the game, it's really fun but for the amount of time it's taking them to finish it, it's not worth purchasing at this point. I bought this game nearly a year ago and it had about 5 hours of content, 3 of those hours were spent doing side quests and grinding items... the other 2 hours were the main quest... not a whole lot going on for it right now.

If you started the game over from scratch, you could probably squeeze about 15 hours in right now, and that's grinding out all the items enemies drop, including their cards and doing all the sides quests, including fishing. There's currently two dungeons available which looks to be about 40% of the game.

Once the game is completely finished I'll do a proper review of it but until that time, I recommend everyone stay away from it, don't give dev's money they haven't rightfully earned yet... This game has been in production for too long and I think we as the consumers and fans need to see better results and more content before any more revenue is earned.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Secrets of Grindea is a great game, the fighting is great, I love the art, the grinding/farming is not to horrible either. I love the skill tree also, No set classes are awesome! My only problem with this game is the update rate, I know they don't have a huge team, But I NEED MORE! This game is awesome, I would HIGHLY recommend. If you like Zelda type of art and fighting, or even if you don't, this game could be for you.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

I'm waiting for the main story to be complete to play the campaign, but I've played the arcade mode a decent bit and this is probably one of the highest quality games out there. They just do so many little details right. All the animations are fluid and look great, all the skills are useful, and the enemies are interesting with different attack patterns and styles. Well worth the cost, and it is my most anticipated title for completion.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

Admittedly, I went into this game not knowing much about it at all, which is somewhat rare for me in this day and age. I did this because I felt I didn't need to know much about the game, my very first impression from the trailer and a youtube video sold me on the spot. And I can say, roughly 9 hours into the game as of this review, that my first impression was spot on. If you enjoy the classic action RPGs of the 1990's and early 2000's, such as Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Illusion of Gaia, or (obviously) Secret of Mana, then this game is for you and is well worth your time, money, and intrigue.

From my perspective, this game offers 4 distinct areas of interest that define the experience:
Story Mode
Arcade Mode
Multiplayer
The Progression System (Skills and Talents) I will be covering all 4, explaining my experiences and impressions of each.

STORY MODEWhile a bit lacking in the engaging story aspect, Secret of Grindea's (SoG) Story Mode offers something many RPGs have failed to have for a while now: the elegance of simplicity. Many modern titles have an obsession with creating a novel's worth of narrative. Cutscene after cutscene, wall of text after wall of text, the experience of these titles are moreso about the story and presentation of it than the actual game.

SoG takes the short and simple approach, where it gives enough story and narrative to provide context and motivation, but is spaced well enough where it does not feel like a chore to read through it all (having the option to skip cutscenes helps too). Not to say that the story isn't interesting, though. While simple and somewhat of a parady of other RPGs, many of the characters are likeable in their own right and their clever interactions are both entertaining and humurous. It's clear a lot of heart was put into the devolpment of this game from all of the silly and minor references to other games and characters.

Putting aside the storytelling aspect of SoG, there's quite a bit of content packed into what is currently available (game is still in beta as of this review). From collectables, to crafting, to minigames, puzzles, Zelda-esque dungeons, side quests, arena challenges, and engaging and replayable boss fights, there's a lot to do. But my favorite aspects are the inclusion of a genuinely difficult hard mode that can be toggled on or off at any time and the ability to customize the look of your character in the form of hats and accessories (that override the look of your currently equipped armor).

To review:

Pros:
Simple but effective narrative
Interesting and humurous dialogue
Plethora of activities, side quests, and minigames
Interesting boss fights
Hard Mode
Cons:
Game not complete (with no ETA)
ARCADE MODEArguably, this is where most of your time will go. This mode is SoG's roguelike feature, where you attempt to progress as far as you can through a serious of increasingly challenging rooms and obstacles on a single life. Much in the way of other roguelikes (such as Rogue Legacy), you have the ability the make succeeding runs easier in the form of unlocking perks. These are unlocked via a currency you obtain randomly as a drop and from completing quests and achievments.

The farther you go and the better you do, the more points you will recieve. After each death, your points are tallied up and added to your total score across all games. After certain thresholds have been met, you will revieve rewards, such as cosmetics (hats and accessories), more NPCs to interact with, and more buildings/decorations for your hub. There is also a global leaderboard for the mode, so if you're into that sort of thing you can sate your fancy here.

As for the actual content of the mode, it's challenging but rewarding. Like any other roguelikes, there are a lot of elements of randomness involved. The dungeon layout, challenges in each room, and the loot you get are all up to chance. However, this works as the combat system is based on skill moreso than raw stats. You will get farther in the dungeon because you got better rather than because you got some good luck on your drops. You find that you are excited to get as far as you can as that shows just how much better you got at the game more than anything else.

Pros:
Unlockable Perks
Achievments
Leaderboard
Replayability
Cons:
Can have a somewhat harsh learning curve
Can feel repetative at times
Like story mode, not all of the floors are implemented yet.
MULTIPLAYERWhile I have no personal experience with this feature myself, I have seen examples of this in videos and streams. From what I have seen, multiplayer is fairly smooth and simple to do. Multiplayer is available for both Story Mode and Arcade Mode, so if you have a group of friends you can enjoy all aspects of the game together with up to 4 people.

Be that as it may, it's not perfect. Currently, there is no option to play with your friends locally. You will need to connect to each other through different computers, and each person will need to have a copy. Additionally, it lacks some quality of life functions such as being able to join someone from your friends list. And, as one would expect from online play, there can exist some connection issues and bugs (although I've yet to see any).

Pros:
Can play with up to 4 people
Can play in both Story Mode and Arcade Mode
Smooth and stable online play
Cons:
Can have some connection issues and bugs
Lacks QoL polish
No Local Play
SKILLS AND TALENTSAn RPG needs to have some form of progression, and SoG does it with it's ability system. What makes this one stand out from the rest is its simplicity and its lack of restrictions. There are no skill trees, no level/stat requirements, you just choose the skills you like and roll with it. And so much is added to this game because of it.

There are a varity of skills that appeal to all forms of play, be it aggressive, defensive, evasive, melee, range, single target, AoE, Burst, DoT, etc. And given the lack of restrictions on obtaining skills, you can create a massive amount of different and interesting builds. Want to be an aggressive and fast melee striker? Go for it. Want to be a long-ranged magic nuker? Sure! Want to combine both melee and magic for a hybrid spellsword? That's cool too.

Additionally, a lot of the skills from different branches work well together. For instance, Static shock is a spell that will do additionally damage very time you hit with a physcial attack. You can restore charges for this skill from using physical skills or doing perfect guards, meaning this skill can be used in all kinds of builds, both offensive and defensive.

While I would argue a need for more skills, the simplicity of the current design is also appealing and useful. While some talents prove to be more useful than others, many of the skills have their uses and can work well given the right circumsances.

In the end, what gives this game a lot of replayability, both in Story Mode and in Arcade Mode, is the progression system and the appeal of trying out new builds and tactics.

Pros:
Non-restrictive
Skills work well together
Interesting and thoughtful effects
Easy to make and try new builds and tactics
Simple and easy to understand
Cons:
Some talents not as useful as others
Arguably not enough skills to facilitate variety

I played through an early build a long time ago and absolutely loved it. I have yet to go back as I really want the game to be finished before I take another look.

There are many pros: Quality is superb, GFX are incredible, Combat is fun, multiplayer is great.

I can't wait for this to be finished and I can pretend I am a teenager again and play through the entire game. :)

Great job devs.

Early Access Review

Secrets of Grindea is an awesome little game with a great art style and a lot of care put into it. Has a well written story which is playable entirely in co op (a HUGE plus, more games need to do this) and old school, SNES style action rpg gameplay.

The writing is funny, the world is enjoyable to explore and beautifully crafted, the gameplay is simple but really fun and challenging at times. If you're looking for a  cool co op game, this is it. If you're looking for a cool game in general, this is also it.

One slight downside: I recommend playing this with a controller, since keyboard controls are a bit iffy.

Support games like these!

This is if the old mana games and legend of zelda had a baby and i love every minute off it.
I have very high hopes for the future of this game.
So far you have this story mode wich can feel very zelda'ish with Co-op and you also have an arcade mode wich is Binding of Isaac RPG with coop.
Would recomend over and over again.

Secrets of Grindea
Early Access Review

For some odd reason, the game reminds me a lot of Paper Mario for the N64. I'm not exactly sure why... there's hardly any similarities.

I tried the demo of this game (lead up to the arena fight), and it had me sold. I was hesitant to buy it at the time, on sale, or was released... the formar took over (and I'm glad, worth every $ and then some). This game just... pulls me in and refuses to let go. I have to pry myself away from the game! (or till I feel my bladder being full to the brim...)

I picked hard difficulty as normal felt... easy for me... I have completely underestimated hard difficulty than I usually do for RPG games! At first I thought the game was just a collection of popular and maybe hardly used RPG tropes... well I'm not completely wrong. The story in the game is... interesting to say the least (up to what I reached)... at least I think there's a story? Somewhere? Maybe I overlooked it half way...

The game does encourage AND reward you for grinding/farming. I've noticed several times the spawn rate increases if it registers you grinding/farming, unlike other RPGs the spawn rate will decrease and/or would spawn mobs elsewhere instead of the spot you're on. (Looking at you MMORPG's... especially the F2P ones...) For some reason... grinding/farming isn't so trivial or boring than other games. Probably because I'm not seeing high leveled players showing me up one-hitting everything while I'm struggling (Always saw that as bad form) or the struggle isn't worth it.

Some of the mobs I feel move a bit too fast for hard mode. Strong, more HP, and additional moves I understand but... some just don't pause at all. Rather have the mobs pause less than in Normal than not pausing at all. Be nice if mobs had a weakness and resistance. Having a hard time just trying to kill them with no disadvantages.

The boss fights... either the bosses need a little tweaking, the leveling system needs bit of a fix, and/or the skills need to be reworked. There's been a few boss fights that nearly made me just go to normal difficulty (I had to temporary for the sentry mini-boss due to the stupid orbs!) Either too much is going on for me to register what's happening, I'm unable to get strong enough to properly face this boss/foe, and/or the skills I have are weak than they should be.

I've nearly crafted every item on the current list... on bit of a card hunt now. See cards as a reward for grinding/farming excessively as they give you benefits whether to your stats or purchases (that I've seen so far). Wish leveling actually increased your stats than just give you points to spend... I shouldn't feel so weak than I should be for (current) end-game bosses (toward Winter, Hydras, Toy Machine, etc.). Granted it's hard, but shouldn't be dark-souls difficult! (That's what it felt like most of the time after the numerous times of being frustrated at bosses to the point of nearly tossing my laptop out the one story window!!!)

Pick this up at its price of $15. Shouldn't wait for a sale, unless you're low on cash, to enjoy this. If you rather play a finished product than in development, then you'll be waiting for quite some time. Half of the story content is in the stable beta right now.

I'll most likely either update or completely rewrite this review when the game is finished. I think I'll wait till this game is finished before I continue any further in the story though.

Update: Tried a bit of Arcade Mode... it's not very forgiving that it discourages me. Reminds me of Rogue Legacy but harsher...

Early Access Review

So ing Good. One of the best multiplayer grind 'em up" action RPG's I have ever touched

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
This is so close to being an amazing game that it causes me physical pain. It's that close, but there are a few crippling flaws that just ruin it. First, there's the combat. There are different ranks of creatures, one through four, one being weakest and four being most powerful. The problem with this is, after a certain point, anything below rank three will die in the first turn of battle because the enemy AI consists entirely of 'KILL WEAKEST CHARACTER'. The combat maps are tiny so forget any sort of strategy, mid and end game opponents can hit you anywhere you stand. Oh, and those opponents are almost always all one to nine monsters, plus nine to twelve wizards. There are three wizard types, and you will see up to a dozen in every single combat.

There are dragons in the game, and you can find them as random encounters. That isn't a problem. A single low level dragon can be beaten, but it's fairly tough unless you come loaded for end game critter hunting with high end, high level units. It's cool. You get an achievement. What isn't cool is that the dragons can spawn in groups of up to six, and all of them in the level 15 range. There might be worse groups out there, but this is literally what invaded one of my provinces in my current game. This isn't something you can fight. I also mean that Literally. You can not defeat these multiple dragon encounters. It isn't possible. You can build an arena in your home province and send heroes to battle in it to gain experience. Why am I mentioning this? because as soon as a hero reaches level ten, the enemy heroes you battle in the arena can also spawn with dragons as minions. It goes about as well as you'd expect.

On the plus side, your units can level up and improve their abilities, but it really doesn't matter, because a lvl 30 tier one unit will still be instagibbed by a lvl 1 tier four. And the upgrade system is utterly worthless as well. Why yes random number generator, I did want to improve my crossbowmans hand to hand skills for the fourth time in a row. No, he doesn't need better ranged attacks, he needs to be able to swing that butterknife he has like a man!

There are hundreds of items you can find, which is nice, but there's almost no storage space for them. You get a tiny little vault that can't be upgraded. It wouldn't be so bad but on the same screen you have access to the merchant window to sell stuff, and hey, if you guessed that had a scroll bar and infinite space in it, go get a cookie or something. You can build an artifact shop so you can buy artifacts, but unfortunately it doesn't cycle through different ones. You get the opportunity to buy three randomly chosen ones and it never changes for the rest of the game. Those three items are pretty much going to be terrible and I really want to chalk it up to being a bug that it doesn't refresh every so often, but it's been like that since release so probably it isn't.

There are four types of hero you can recruit, but you shouldn't bother getting anything but a warrior. The warrior is so much better than the other three it defies belief. Scouts can be useful for the rare encounters designed exclusively to kill warriors, but that's about it. Oh, and yeah, there are encounters designed from the ground up to murder warriors. packs of medusa will petrify you and then poison you, giant spiders will web you down and poison you, giant slugs will poison you if you hit them or vomit poison on you from a distance if you don't.

Edit: Okay, so I finally managed to grind a mage high enough to use a specific spell named 'white magic', and basically, it lets you break the game over your knee like a rotten twig. Two casts will clear virtually any combat encounter of critters, barring the two (the latest update may have added more) creatures who are magic immune. Once you get one cast per combat, better beleive that mage is going straight to lvl 30 since he can now effectively obliterate entire armies. Unconquerable foes turn instantly into big, meaty sacks of free XP. Just load up every unit slot with lvl 1 swordsmen, the enemy creatures/mages/whatever will go and kill them while your mage, free and unharmed, fires magic nukes that hit EVERYTHING ON THE MAP FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE. This is a well balanced, well implimented ability that reduces multiplayer combat to 'whoever goes first wins'. Casting it does a small amount of damage to the mage, but a couple of healers can fix it easily before any monsters that made it to turn two kill them for being a weaker, easier target than the wizard FIRING MAGICAL NUKES AT THEM.

Oh, and I hope you like really, really really loud TING! sounds, because the game plays one over and over at random for no reason I can discern.


Edit: I also hope you don't like loading saved games, because doing that while the game is running will cause the entire thing to crash. Not always, but often enough that I had to mention it.




Shouted at by a dev and I didn't even get an acheivement for it.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Ok I always look for negative reviews first. My opinion is that someone who hates the game will over exagerate the flaws, but at least will talk about the flaws where someone who loves it is less likely to. That being said, I still love this game even though it has flaws. However, some people won't like it as I do so I will begin with the negatives then move on to the positives since that's how I approach it anyway.

Negatives:
Crashes too much. I'd say once every few hours of play time you will have the game crash. It's not enough to bother me, but it can be frustrating.
AI can be off pretty bad. Battles that will tell you are impossible sometimes can be beaten manually without losing a single hit point. Battles that say they are so weak they are not worth your time will sometimes wipe you on auto. That doesn't happen all of the time, and with some play time you can easilly judge for yourself. Also computer players will keep throwing themselves at your defenses every time they resurect even if they die every single time in some situations.
Bugs. There are a few, one that for some reason will pop up the AI's hero screen in front of me which has shown me they get a +10 gold per turn bonus per hero at the level I was playing at.

Positives
It is constantly changing. Every time you start a new character or see a new world, the game will be different, different maps, different quests available. It kind of reminds me of Civ in that aspect.
You can chose how you play. Some games require you to be the hero, some games require you to be the villian, this game requires you to be whatever you feel like being.
It is a great strategy game IMO. Losing a single soldier at the wrong time can cost you an entire map, granted like most strat games you can always load fail (load the game and redo a fight because you lost), but not all of us play like that.

So with all of that I'd say the game play and replayability are worth it. The bugs and glitches and even AI issues can be fixed (or modders can fix them if it ever opens to mod on steam). Overall I'd say the positives outweigh the negatives enough for me.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
This is an oddball of a game, on one hand the campaign can be incredibly tedious and repetitive (just got your castle and hero leveled to where you can kick ? Oh well, time to start the next map from scratch!). But on the other hand, it's the difficulty of fighting you're way up from the bottom that really makes this game shine.

I'm hesitant to recommend this game on word alone, find some videos first and see if you would enjoy the Civ/Might and Magic/Kings Bounty mashup. The game is pretty fun, but after a while, I'm finding I have to take it in small doses as repeating the same actions to win a slightly different map gets very boring (even with maps/shards that have different properties to them, they don't seem to be enough to warrant varying from a proven tactic).

It's hard to play a game over 100 hours and then not recommend it.  And yet, I can't.  I wan't to - but I can't.

You've heard the saying that 'the sum is greater than the parts'; in this game, the parts are greater than the sum.  There is such a good game here waiting to 'happen'.  Unfortunately, the overall game design is flawed.

Specifically, the size of the 'shards' and the mechanics of the shards hurt the overall game.  Because of this, you won't even use most of the best units/buildings/etc.  In essence, you've got all this outstanding content that never comes into play bacause of the mechanics of the 'meta-game'.


Eador. Masters of the Broken World
It took me 248 hours to end the campaign - and I chose the quickest way to finish.

If you like to finish your games - beware of the necessary time investment!

The game runs very unstable (release 1.4.5) - during my playthrough I had over 100 crashes to the desktop (seems evenly distributed between Invalid Pointer Operation" and "Access violation...").
The game might run smoothly for 5 hours or crash 5 times in 30 minutes."

-Bought this when feeling nostalgic about Master of Magic / HoMM.  I also like CiV and slower, turn-based games sometimes.
-More complex building options than HoMM and in some aspects MoM..  More specifically the City Build menu can be overwhelming to look at for the first time.  I particularly enjoyed this aspect of the game - its complexity left me wanting more and more so I would restart a game after losing to tweak the build and see what works best.
-The heroes can be viewed as simple/straightforward - 4 classes.  Each time you level you put one point into one skill (out of three offerred).
-Spells are just similar to Heroes of Might & Magic. Build the 4th tower to get the best spells.. except there is a different building for each magic type - there are 6 magic types (I think?) at least as far as buildings / main spells go.
-More complex gameplay & darker theme than Heroes of Might & Magic
-Can't wait to play multiplayer!

This game is really hard to rate. I recommend it because the core game is absolutely great and I love such games in general. I also don't want to harm the devs because they really tried hard and have created a real rough diamond but some mayor design issues will spoil the fun for probably most of the common players!

So I only recommend it to die hard 4x fans with masochistic tendencies and/or you might want to grab it on sale :)

My review became a mini guide so here is the overview and I will post more details in the comments.

Good:
- Very deep 4X game mechanics (with a focus on battles)
- Great turn based battle system (focus on tactics and not luck)
- Good RPG elements regarding the hero/unit development
- Many different units to hire and fight (most or all of the enemy units can also be hired if you are lucky to get an offer)
- Polished graphics and menus
- Nice humor (you can either play a good or evil god and the evil options are really funny to read)

Mixed:
- Not many armies to control or cities to build up so micro management doesnt get out of hand
- Hard to learn even harder to master
- Endless playtime (if you can stand it - might be good for players who rather want to play in doses instead of one huge map/battle)

Bad:
- Tedious game mechanics
- Monotonous game play (most of the time you spend doing the same over and over again until you finally see/find/unlock something new)
- Easy to get stuck in dead ends (as long as you havent learned how to avoid them or have the patience to wait (for lucky random events or gaining gold/experience over time) or reload/restart)
- Still some bugs (Happened once that an enemy unit was not removed from battlefield and I had to reload the fight)


So what to expect from the game?
I expected another Fallen Enchantress/Warlock - MotA clone but this game plays quite different. There are the same features in place but they are used in a different manner. Think of starting one of the mentioned games. Build/take over your first cities on an isolated island and form your armies, then, when you are ready to conquer the next island: you have to start over.
This is basically happening in Eador. You conquer a shard" where you face 1-2 enemies (at the first shards) and as soon as you conquered it you lose (mostly) everything you had earned the last hours. The shards do work on a greater scale though. They unlock new buildings/units and give some mild benefits to the starting condition of the next shard. I also can only speak for the first shards because even though I played 16 hours I'm still on my second shard! (+ the good tutorial that took me 3 hours alone) According to the forums there are 80!! shards to conquer - go figure the playtime you need to beat the game. Though I have to say I always fought my battles and didnt auto resolve them because Im a control freak and dont trust the AI so you can decrease playtime a lot by automated battles.
I also don't want to complain about a long playtime but the simple problem here is: motivation. I think it would have been much better to only have like 20 shards but instead increase the rewards you get for conquering each shard and thus give a better feeling of actual progress.
Which leads to the real problem here

Hello,

This is, in my opinion, a triple A title. That having been said, I would also like to point out that many triple A titles are more often then not unpolished and lacking on release, but patched at some point. As others have said, the game plays somewhat like Civilization/Heroes of Might and Magic. The developers don't seem to be in full swing patch-mode anymore either, which is really sad because it needs it.

One of the things I enjoyed the most was the exploration aspect of the game. Your heroes explore each province to provide more land for the province's population to settle comfortably. In the process you come across bandits, monsters, and unique shops. Sadly, for each positive aspect of the game, it tends to turn around on itself and bite it's own rear end. In this example , the game all but forces to you play with a rush/zerg" mentality. Getting your hero(es) to the enemies stronghold as fast as possible

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Good idea of combining province approach of Total War and Dominions with turn-based battles a-la Heroes of Might and Magic. All wrapped up in meta-gaming - each new map adds new features. Not totally for me, as it have too much content on each map, taunting my completionism. Still recommend it for 4x-lovers.

Remake of Eador: Genesis.

Game was heavy broken on launch, but right now it's quite working. Some issues remained, but nothing that could prevent proper gaming.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
One of my favorite 4X games. If you like fantasy and 4X this is a must buy.

There are a lot of negative reviews talking about bugs and other issues. I just don't seem to notice them. The developer has continued to work on the game and the lastest version seems very very good.

You have lots of choices with buildings and your units level up. There is a lot of decision making involved. Play the game using custom settings to enjoy the full experience.

This is a hard game that is tough to beat. I sometimes wonder if that is what people are complaining about. I personally rank this ahead of games such as AoW 3 because the battles are so tactical and demanding.

This is a great game for those who want a deep demanding immersive fantasy 4X.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
The idea is interesting but the implementation is lacking. Highly random starting positions can vary the difficulty from cakewalk" to "impossible

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Eador -It is a mixture of various games such as Civilizations, King's Bounty, Disciples, Heroes. The hero, as in Disciples is power, pump it, he can compete with the most powerful units. Branched pumping" of heroes and fighters get the experience and the heroes and units

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
tldr:

Fun?  3/5

Work?  6/5  The enjoyability of this game is crippled.

Deep?  5/5

Compelling?  4/5

Pace?  Dog slow out of what it could be.  2/5

Good intro to TBS?  1/5

This game's learning curve is poorly designed and might turn off many beginners to the genre permanently.  A lot of the game is figuring out this map is unplayable - I have to re-roll" or "this _campaign_ is unplayable - I have to re-roll."  Occasionally a really fun map does show up.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My main complaint with this game is the random map generator.  Some maps seem to be fine

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
There is so much here that make this game amazing. I loved the different units and the difficulty of starting off. I loved being able to 100% territories to get more benefits. I loved how there was an overworld with even more shards to take over. As much as I loved this, there was more that I just didn't love.

After spending so many hours on one shard, you start with nothing on the next shard. It feels like a slap in the face. It is supposed to feel like starting another scenario, but there is virtually nothing different from this shard than the last one. Why can't I keep some of my !? What's the point? If I reread my favorite book over and over, or watch the same episode of my favorite show over and over I will still enjoy it, but how often will I want to do this? It will make you go kookoo for coco puffs. That is exactly what this feels like. There may be more enemies and a slightly different layout, but no real variety.

I wanted more from this experience, but I was just left dissapointed. This is fun, but leaves you wanting so much more. This could have been a 10/10 if things were done just a bit differently.

4/10 I wanted to love this, but it just left me wanting a better experience that incorporates all these elements.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Linux logo is just for show. All they did is ship Wine with this, apparently without bothering to test it. The wrapper does allow the launching of the game but the graphics are garbled and the game is unplayable. This problem seems to appear mostly on nVidia binary drivers. There are a number of discussion threads about the problem here on Steam and on their own forums but as of yet the developers haven't issued any statements about this. Apparently they suck.

Wine wrapper IS NOT a Linux port. There should be a warning about this on the store page.

As for the game itself. I don't have a clue. I can't play it. If a miracle happens and it becomes playable at some point I might have to review the game again.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Imagine a typical hex-based strategy game such as Dawn of Fantasy, make it 10x bigger, twice as good, and inject an original and well-written storyline - this is what you get. There are some very minor issues in that the manual is written for acrobat reader but clicking manual" from the splash screen does not initiate acrobat reader so you have to find the file and do it "manually" - ironic. Also

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
As far as strategy games go... I really like it.
The gameplay is quite easy to get, the difficulty is properly set up (if sometimes a bit annoying when you want to rush), the dialogues are quite humourous, and... well, the campaign has been keeping me occupied for quite some time now.
Some people are experiencing bugs that are quite annoying, but without them the game is in my opinion a solid 8 or 9.

TL;DR :

Pro : Easy to play, good gameplay, funny, lots of material.

Con: Maybe a tad repetitive and sometimes bugs.

8.5/10

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
This game is awesome. It's like everything I ever wanted in HOMM but without the crap company behind it. There are a few bugs, sure, but the devs are great on fixing stuff and have personally fixed save files for some community members. Highly recommend.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
It takes a good 2-10 hours to get into this game, but once you do, it is a great deal of fun and the main campaign is good for at least 150 hours.  The play feels like a better-balanced Master of Magic where the strategic (map) play is much smoother (one main city to upgrade, better resourcing) while the tatical (battle) play reminds me of Kings Bounty, but you don't cycle through troops as fast and they end up meaning more to you.

Over all, if you like 4X or strategy games with turn-based combat, this is the best game of 2012 and 2013 in my opinion.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Eador:MotBW is a really good game that i feel does not get the limelight other similar games get. It may be buggy, though the devs have worked hard to rectify most of these, and it may lack polish but what it dosen't lack is gameplay. A fantasy TBS with elements of the HoMM games. the Civ series and Master of Magic, Eador has that  'one more turn' factor that keeps me coming back.
A remake / upgrade of Eador:Genesis, if you enjoy turn based games with a story campign, customisable  random 'shards' (the games' playable lands)  to play, great music and plenty of original game mechanics, i recommend giving this a chance.
Two things i should add : The campaign is long; if you don't auto resolve battles it will probably take over 100 hours to complete.
Also this game can be hard, even on easier levels, so be prepared for a challenge but it is often rewarding when you win because of this. All in all a great game.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
I enjoyed this game for around a week or two before I just didn't have time for it. I think, if I played Eador when I was younger, I would have had 100s of hours spent playing it. It seems like the kind of single-player game that manages to reward you for putting a lot of time into it, which is rare.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Soon to be 200h into the game. Can't say that the campaign is getting to the end basicaly because there are several endings. Each shard is different, and it's not only lands, but the world itself is different too (world of fear, rust, magic and many more), and I unlocked only half of the buildings available, so probably that is why every new shard i start, brings new challenges and tactics to try out. There are 4 hero classes to choose from, that can be mixed together and yet, eventually, you will have to use all of them. There is also karma system in game, so sometimes you will have to be good and sometimes, evil is the way to win. You can amass an army or you can just go with a hero and a few units - it's all up to you. You will struggle to maintain economy but it's good that battles will be the main source of your income, so you will have to pick the right fights, because loosing is crippling, but not necessary deadly.

I really don't understand the mixed score - the game is dynamic, interesting and there is one more turn" feeling in it. Furthermore

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Purchased this because I loved Eador: Genesis. I love this game much more than Eador: Genesis. It expands upon that game in so many ways. Graphics, units, situations, encounters, gameplay, AND MUCH MUCH MORE! My playtime invested speaks for itself. 9/10

**update 3-16-16**

I now have almost 1000 hours in the game. I am very disappointed in all the negative reviews for this game. There has not been a single bug that is 100% gamebreaking for me. All bugs are minor and easily fixed. The game is well worth playing even despite its minor flaws. Don't pass up this hidden gem!

Add me on Steam friends list if you ever want to talk about this game with me or if you are considering buying it.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
For all the fans of Heroes III, Age of Wonders and similar titles.  Not recomended for casuals, they will cry loud..

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
First the bad things:

The game suffers from some balancing issues, sometimes everything seems to be against you and can be really unforgiving as Hell.
There are some small bugs when I'm writing this review.

The good things:
The campaign seems to be going on forever! As a dinosaur remembering Civilisation 1 on Amiga, where I've spent months on one session bringing my country to greatest power ever I strongly appreciate very long games.
Map generator - you can specify how you want your skirmish map to look like and go!
Diverse strategies (not as many creatures as in say HoMM3, but there are so many different tactics!
Unuque game structure, where (in campaign) in order to gain new tech you need to conquer particular shards - this means if you loose one important region, you may not get certain tech and be forced to reevaluate your stratedy.

Summary:
Really like this game - spent quite a bit of time and am already considering the allied forces expansion.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Surprisingly fun turn based fantasy game. Basically you play through 'shards' each turn, building up an army and eventually conquering each shard, which then unlocks bonuses for the next shard. While this game isnt too challenging, it is very fun to play here and there as you conquer more. Similar to Heroes of Might and Magic but with new mechanics.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
I decided to write this review because I've just seen a new update in my Steam download list and I thought:wow they keep patching the game! Let's give it a thumb up!". After years the devs still take care of Eador

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Eador: Masters of the Broken World combines features from several fantasy games into one very nice package. A true follower of the classic Heroes of Might & Magic recipe: heroes, turn-based battles, XP and RPG-style leveling up, fantasy settlements and their management, parties and armies of strange creatures and all that you would expect from a decent fantasy story. Eador: Masters of the Broken World manages to venture into grand strategy, tactical battles and role-playing and come out on the other side as a deep and satisfying experience. After most initial bugs have been corrected, the game stands as an impressive addition to the turn-based strategy genre. An engaging and addictive game that presents you with lots of challenging dilemmas and strategic choices. The presentation might not be spectacular, but youll get loads of upgradable units, buildings and an extensive dynamic campaign. Eador might not be as intuitive as Might & Magic Heroes, but it is just as difficult to get away from it. Eador: Masters of the Broken World is a must for anyone who likes fantasy turn-based strategy games.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
nice tactical system but too long, too slow, too repetitive . On harder than normal it's too hard if you don't do it the only right way after a while in. Prepare to get stuck and owned making it slower and slower. AI hired guards don't scale with you. Item repair also ridiculous. loads of crashes still after 1 year and a half of patching and randomness.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
This game is one of the most enjoyable games for people who enjoy sid Meyers civilization, Heroes of Might and Magic, or Warlock masters of the arcane. Using the might and magic combat system and hero system with more active heroes i combat allowing them to both give and recieve high amounts of damage. The only problem with this game is that some bots in hard story mode tend to cheat to win making the game unfairly difficult. Do not be decieved by their clever disguises as even the morally good bots with do what it takes to edge you out of every conquest. The story mode aside custom and online games are enjoyable, but long. Having to conquer a province and then explore it can become tedious on large maps with little opponents, though they allow you to get to end game scenarios before fighting your rivals. All in all it is a well made game that should be fun for any people who enjoy the games listed at the beginning of this review

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Not what I expected.  This game makes you conquer a small map, which ranges from hard to impossible depending on the difficulty level you pick, and then start over again dozens of times without much to show for each conquest.  Now the game is pretty well made and polished, so it is fun if you're not playing on the higher difficulty levels while you are conquering, but the fact that you have to start over every time kills it for me.

I like playing on the higher difficulties, so now I just figured out a strategy which lets me win and this takes out some of the joy out of it as well - I am forced to use the same strategy over and over, otherwise I will lose.  Got old really quick.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Broken to all hell on Linux. Doesn't launch on most platforms, huge graphical problems with nvidia drivers, and when it does start by navigating to and directly launching the game, it's so hard to see anything that it is unplayable.

Needs to be fixed.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Highly recommend to all fans of fantasy, strategy, and tactics games. Plenty of unique units and buildings, heroes and units gain levels and you can customize their growth, explore the terrain to find new locations and upgrades, manage resources, and increase your own power by conquering other worlds/shards. The campaign does a good job of introducing you to more intricate tactics and developments as you progress. One downside is that with each new shard/map you start over somewhat, but things still manage to stay interesting through new units and buildings, new opponents, and randomized events.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
6/10

I recommend it.

Great game, but quickly becomes very tedious, each shard (map) takes a long time to complete, and win or lose you'll have to start from scratch on every new shard.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Easily one of the funnest games I have played, that being said, I would not recommend you buy unless you have a god tier computer. On my normal computer, this game does not work it crashes all the time, I recentlly built a very nice computer and it runs as smooth as a lampshade made of fresh baby skin. Also the issue with the crashes and errors I got on my other two computers (ones a laptop) will not be adressed as none of my emails or error reports ever got a reply. Maybe the company is not the best at pr. This game is amazing nonetheless, I enjoy the strategy and it is not insanely easy as some others, so long as you dont select skilled or anything below you will have very nice combat that requires actuall planning and thinking, story line was pretty awesome too. Only issue I have had is that you need a strong computer to play it, and the lack of help or support from the creators, but I get that from ea and almost every company too. Another cool thing so far as gameplay goes is that you can use one method to win most battles, for example necromancy, however these battles can be slugfests, and you may end up losing, where you essentially trade blows until one of you manages to get the upperhand and you will end up taking days of back and forth battling to take or lose the shard, when if you just adapt you strategy and maybe add a commander with long range  units in the back and strong defense with low attack to shield the path of incoming land units you could maybe have won the shard or faster if you win anyways. There are flying units too, the strategy is quite varied, really an awesome game.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
This game is one of those thorny rose" games.
I recommend it to players who enjoy learning complex game systems

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Eador, Masters of the Broken World. The best way to describe this game would be that it is heavily influenced/steals from (well, the older version but okay) Heroes of Might and Magic 3. You upgrade cities by making new buildings allowing for magic, income, creatures, experience for your creatures, or special effects. Battle is done on a grid system in a turn based combat manner and as your heroes level they gain new abilites and skills.

However, there is were similarities end. For instance, unlike HoMM3 all cities are equal, which the same creatures being able to be recruited. You explore the map by conquering surrounding provinces - which can be upgraded with buildings but with a much smaller variety than the cities. Thus no free roaming on the map and individual armies of provinces can be daunting to defeat. Furthermore, magic does have some impact, but I would say less in the battlefield that HoMM3, but can be more impacting on a global scale than HoMM3, due to the so called rituals. Another important difference is the 'happiness' factor. If a province gets unhappy it might revolt, that is something you do not see in HoMM making Eador more of a grand strategy game in that sense. It also has more RPG elements than HoMM3 as quests can be given through the conquering of a shard (= one map) and acting differently can have very different consequences. Even more so, if you are friendly some troops will like that and get better morale, where others will think you weak. Likewise, you can not ally e.g. the Elves (some rare neutral provinces on the map) if you play like an evil .

Personally I miss a bit the variety in units from time to time, but that has been partially lifted by the small DLC (allied forces) of 4 euro. Although that states only 2 new units per individual faction, it actually creatures more new units and with a new special building that can be found in a province (the mercenary guild) you can actually hire these troops. This is great because it sometimes tediously long to get e.g. to level 2 unit buildings and this gives your army the edge you need for higher difficulties in my opinion.

All in all, Eador is a good addition for anyone that enjoyed the old HoMM series (not V as it does not have those graphics implemented) and is looking for a different game with a slight twist.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Enjoyable game.  I've been hooked on it for some time, BUUUT -

I've played about 120 hours now and since the new update the game crashes ALOT.  I mean, I'll be winning a battle and getting ready to take on a Hydra or the Dragon and boom, freeze, only thing I can do is Alt, Ctrl, Del and turn off the dam game.  It's very frusterating.

I enjoy this game and like the idea of questing and taking on new areas.  I'm about mid way through campaign maybe but based on how my last few play  have been I'm going to have to give up.

I even cast a golem a few times, but nothing happens or shows up on screen.  A few toons have been invisible.  I don't know what they did on the update but it's terrible.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
I have played this game for so long that it became my nightly ritual.
This game is relaxing yet mind-engaging (perfect combo). It's a perfect game to play after a long day at work. I typically mute the game sound/music, and play my own relaxing music in the background.

This game is a MUST for people that Enjoy:
1) Turn-based strategy games. Some battles are straight forward easy, others you will really need to plan/think.
2) Playing King Bounty (KB ) Games. It is very similar to KB, except soldier units can also level up and perma die.
3) Playing Fire Emblem.
4) Character building by leveling up and choosing new skills (RPG-like)
5) Progressive difficulty that can only be overcome with proper tactics. Example: magic beats physical armor, etc.
6) Many ways of playing a game (4 heros, and tons of soldiers to choose, they all have different skills and builds)
7) Taking your time to thoroughly complete a level rather than rush through it. No need to rush, enjoy the battles.
8) Loot, Loot, Loot. Decent number of items to find and collect with various tiers.

I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys turn based battle tactics.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Diverse and detailed fantasy TBS title with widely branched city building (actually world building) features and god-game" elements extended with a complex economy structure and large number of diverse units. Sheer quantity of content is difficult to describe because after 100+ hours of campaign I did not even get to see half of the story and haven't unlocked good part of the units and buildings. The karma system is ubiquitous and well executed. Sincere recommendation for anyone looking for a slightly different designed TBS."

I've put in a lot of time, so trust me when I say this, this game is not very good.  It's extremely repetitive, virtually every shard is the same, with only a few additional gimmicks (which you are informed of before you start).  The units don't change much.  You don't get to keep your heroes, (unless you pay a great deal of energy to transfer them), but that is okay, because they can max level in any shard.  You see the same scenarios happen over and over again.  Eventually, you just know where in the box to click to get the most positive result for your run.  I'm just so bored of it.  Oh, and technically I have no idea how it ends, and I've only played one campaign.  So all that time in I've spent doing the exact same things on every shard hasn't even brought me to a conclusion.  Make of that what you will.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
A great game, but full of bugs, at least if running on Wins XP. As I count Heroes of M and M III for the best turn based strategy game, I dare say Eador can compete with this title. Fans of strategy games should really at least try it.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Woo Woo this game is intense.  If you play HOMM, you may enjoy this game.  Looks great, flows nice, a bit of a hardware hog, and sometimes timing is off.  Devs are still taking care of it and loving it nicely.  Updates often.  I have already banked a few hours and only dented the surface of the gameplay.  The story is fun and events are unpredictable.  It is immediately challenging.  The tutorial is brief and sets you on your way in the most loving way a game can HA.  Anyway, give it a go if you have much time to spare.  This game is not fast, nor is it repetitive.  Each providence is different and even your own subjects may revolt.  I would recommend printing out the manual and keeping it handy.  There is immense detail in this game.  Plan well!

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
A very clever 4X that follows in the footsteps of King's Quest and Heroes of Might and Magic, but adds plenty of its own to the genre. The scale of the game is horrifying, it's taken me several days to beat my first randomly generated scenario out of what promises to be a 50-100 scenario long campaign.

There's a huge amount of content and plenty to do every turn, but it's presented in an efficient way and turns go quickly.

The game isn't exactly unpolished, but it has some splinters that could be sanded down. Expect a harmless crash every 24 hours or so. There's one bug that can hit fairly often and prevents kills from registering, especially on retaliatory hits and especially on slower combat speeds. It can be resolved without incident by autoresolving at the end of combat and almost always works in the player's favour, blocking its AI reenforcements and almost never occurs on the highest combat speed, which I would recommend using either way, because the second slowest is much too slow. There are other cases in the game where the settings are not as delicate as they perhaps aught to be.

The game seems to be a direct remake of Eador: Genesis. I prefer this version, but there's not a lot between them.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
With all the new patches up and running this game is well worth the money spent. Its map randomizer is a huge plus, as you can make your own random maps with little time yet have full control.  Its AI opponents are particularly well done, with their own agendas and play styles. This game offers many many hours of fun as you explore the shards of the broken world.

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Hope you've got the next year or so free, 'cause Eador eats up free time at an alarming rate.

The basic gameplay will mostly be familiar to fans of the Heroes of Might and Magic series: Hero units, backed by a recruitable army, explore the world and fight with each other. There are towns, equipable items, all that good stuff. However, where HoMM  tends to be fairly simple, Eador has enough depth to drown a whale. What you build, where you build it, and what you stock your army with can have huge consequences, and every turn has dozens of choices about how best to improve your situation. Add in random events, potentially dozens of battles per province, and a solid enemy AI and you've got a recipe for a huge time-sink.

Most 4x games become bogged down in the late game: Your strategy is set, you've built everything you need to, and now it's simply a matter of hitting next turn" until you win. Eador's campaign averts this in a wonderful way: The maps are fairly small by 4x standards

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Great game.

I still havent completed the campaign.  It is very entertaining and maps can take long or you can bull rush and try and finish it quickly.  I don't recommend trying that until you know what your doing.  the ai can be very unforgiving and challenging.  It keeps it entertaining.

o yea, your a demi-god with a gremlin lacky.  Bonus

Eador. Masters of the Broken World
Good concept, poor execution. It plays similarly to Fallen Enchantress, and much like it has constant crashes and errors. It also has an exploration feature much alike Sengoku Rance, a feature I actually enjoyed very much. With some much needed bug-fixing, the game could be quite enjoyable, but without it it is sadly not that fun. I wouldnt recommend, or dissuade someone from buying this, but due to Steam Review's nature, Im going to have to learn towards recommending simply because of the ideas that the game holds.

Someone pointed out that the pointer error" bug was fixed w/ the last patch. The announcement for the patch claimed it was.  However...the bug STILL exists and it is in fact

The Cat Lady
Every once in a while you come across a game that strikes a chord unlike most others. A game that touches something profoundly deep in you and perhaps parallels your own life in many ways. I haven't found a lot of these games. In fact they can be counted on one hand, but The Cat Lady is among those few.

What I am about to write will be a somewhat biased review of this magnificent work of art. Biased because the game touches upon emotions and experiences all too real and haunting to me personally. But I will try to maintain some objectivity towards the game from a more general gameplay perspective as well. So a quick warning to you, dear reader, I may get quite sentimental and soppy writing this.

The Cat Lady is a 2D story driven psuedo-psychological horror adventure puzzle rooted in borderline depression, chronic loneliness and suicide. It puts you in control of Susan Ashworth, a 30-something year old woman who has taken her own life to end her emotional suffering. But instead of death's cold embrace she so longs for, a twisted fate has her waking up in a windswept corn field in Limbo, where she is forced into a mysterious pact with the Queen of Maggots; Susan must return to life and kill five evil psychopaths before she herself is allowed to finally die. Until then, she is gifted with immortality - much to her distress - for that is the last thing a suicidee could have wished for.

The bleak noir graphics and bone-chilling eerie music will plunge you into a dark and foreboding atmosphere with grotesque and nauseating visuals at every corner. Much of the game is portrayed in a borderline black-and-white style, and there is an everpresent gloom shrouding nearly every aspect of the game. It is unnerving and bizarre from start to finish. The bulk of the gameplay is done through find X and use on Y type puzzles, most of which aren't too difficult to figure out.

The controls are a bit clunky and odd, and the volume on voiced dialogue and effects suffer from poor balancing. Although there are a few game-altering choices along the way, most of the story is very liniar and easy to complete. The real staying power of the game is its dialogues, character development and the exciting way the story unfolds. It draws you in and makes you want to continue onwards. The game dazzles you with its intense atmosphere, engaging social interactions and excellent writing. It is never boring; an interactive and gripping tale of fear, angst and a fair share of violence and gore with even some humor and laughs in the mix.

What strikes me the deepest about The Cat Lady is the gradual development of Susan's struggle against her depressive life. As the story progresses, she grows and develops so profoundly. More and more you begin to realize that beneath the haunting artstyle and horror, this is not just a story about monsters and murder; it is a story about conquering fear and negativity, a tale about heartfelt friendship and love. It is inspiring. It is empowering. And it is so vivid and genuine. Even if you have not been through the dark recesses of suicide and depression yourself, Susan's journey will still be a tear-wrenching tale of victory and self-enlightenment.

The Cat Lady is a hauntingly beautiful game that can be very scary to play. Not just because of its creepy visuals, atmosphere and effects - but moreso due to its brutal and genuine delving into the sickness of a broken human psyche. It is real. It is profound. I almost could not get past the first two chapters of the game for these reasons. But I am ecstatic that I pressed past my angst and stuck with it, because Susan's story unfolds into just a mindblowingly amazing telling of loneliness and tragedy turned to life and strength, love and friendship. She becomes an angel of vengeance, sent to kill demons in human disguise, but ultimately conquers her own demons as well.

Thank you, Harvester Games. You are gaming angels in disguise <3

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady!
The Cat Lady is a game following our protagonist Susan: A depressed suicidal middle-aged woman that decided to end her life. She swallows a whole lot of pills and here is where the journey really begins, when you wake up in a dreamlike field to the protagonists confusion. The main story, if you look outside of characters and their interactions and how they end up, is not the most logical or devoid of plotholes, but I wouldn't focus completely on where you are and why due to the surreal nature of the game. Instead the focus should be on the characters, and really think of them as people, mainly Susan and Mitzi. Perhaps this interaction between cynicism and optimism - the existential crisis - isn't relatable to everybody, but it doesn't have to be, it's a game filled with greatly written dialogues and amazing visuals, interesting story elements with profound symbolism at every corner.

Bleak, uncertain, beautiful
This is a game where the visuals really mean something, where the artstyle, while bleak and macabre, is still incredibly powerful with salient bright-red blood and shocking aesthetics. The photorealistic nature of the game makes the visuals really speaks to you, it impacts you in a way not many games do. It makes every moment tense and terrifying especially considering how well the visuals are paired with the music. It creates phenomenally thick atmosphere of eery beauty. The characters move in an uncanny and rigid way which really adds to the overall uneasy feel of the game. It's a game where you can find the ugly beautiful, or just find it ugly. Although ugly would be totally suitable considering the circumstances.

Music, oh wow-wee!
The music in this game goes from heavy distorted riffs with beautiful and powerful vocals to the minimalistic, somber piano pieces. The music is used perfectly in this game. When the piano kicks in during some of the monologues or some of the more laid-back dialogues you are just sat there awe-struck, amazed at how much you are drawn in. The music is overall very fitting and wonderful, matching each moment more or less brilliantly.

Uh oh, characters!
The characters in this game are remarkably fleshed-out. Especially the main character and her relations. The way they talk to each other, they way they seem like they have some real connection on a personal level. How they argue about some of our protagonists more cynical ways of seeing the world, of how she look at other people, it felt very believable, it was written amazingly. From the parasites(the main plot impetus) we get some quite cool performances with some of the voice acting really convincing the player of how twisted, cruel and weird they are. How despite not being able to die we have reason to fear these people solely because of what they might do to us while we're still alive. I could write for hours on the relationship between Mitzi and Susan, but I wouldn't want to give much of it away out from its context.


Conclusiveness!
This is one of my favorite games, although that means nothing, it's really a game that I could insert myself in to, to feel like it was talking to me. It was a personal experience for me, which it may not be for everybody. Probably not for most people. But I think most people can enjoy the quirky/creepy characters, the insane visuals and the great music. That most people can enjoy the story which holds up fine just as an adventure. You can view this game from different perspectives and still thoroughly enjoy it for its different characteristics. I played this game almost a year ago and it's still fresh in my memory, it's truly one of the best experiences I've had in gaming. Personal or not. It's a game that is grown up. It's a game, among many others, that shows that this industry have something to it as well. That this is a valid art form. The thing we spend our time on, the things we think about, is also important, this is more than a time sink, our interests have merit. Our tastes can supersede visceral bloodshed. This game is perhaps not best suited for most gamers, but I long for a day where games like this has a bigger place in our medium, where profoundness trumps fun for a bigger portion of gamers. I only have one thing to say now, thanks, for everything.

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is a game for the mature audiences only. The game deals with dark materials like suicide, death and many more things. But will you want to play it ?

In The Cat Lady we play as Susan Ashworth, she's a 40 year old woman who lost everything she cared about. She has no friends and she decides to take her own life away. But after committing suicide she is given another chance to make things right. She has to confront 5 people so she can live in peace.

Now I was following the project ever since it first launched on Desura, but I've never got the chance to finish the game until recently I decided to sit down and finish it and let me tell you this game is quite the experience.

The game is a very dark game and is not suitable for the young audiences and should only be played by adults. The whole time playing I felt unsettled of the very dark nature. The game's script is it's strongest feature which grips you until you finish the game and see how the entire story wraps up.

The game is a simple adventure game. You can go to two sides either to left or right and you can collect items and interact with the environment. The game is fairly simple and there's not much else I can say about the gameplay since it is fairly simple.

The graphics might not look great, but they're really good. I loved the whole black and white art style and it really settles the mood and makes you feel uneasy the entire time playing. The graphics are accompanied by a great soundtrack. While it's not the best soundtrack it helps build the atmosphere.

The voice acting is this games weakest part. The entire game has different audio quality ranging from pretty good to abysmal. But that's not that big of a problem.

The game ran incredibly smoothly from start to finish, until chapter 4 where there is a massive frame drop for a certain sequence, but it only happened in that part.

The entire game took me 7 hours to finish and I loved every minute of it.  The game does have a bit of replay value because this game has some player choices that do affect the outcome of the story, but it's pretty minor stuff.

Some of the puzzles might seem hard, but for the most part it's really simple stuff nothing really cryptic.

Overall if you're not easily disturbed, I highly suggest giving The Cat Lady a chance as it's one of the best games I've played as of recent. The incredible story and characters will grip you till the end credits and you will love every single moment of it.

Final Rating:
9/10 A must own

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is a rather interesting game, which does deal with a lot of dark topics that might not be suitable for younger audiences. Some of these topics are, but not limited to: death, depression, suicide, cancer, and homicide.
StoryYou play as Susan Ashworth, a middle-aged woman who has just attempted suicide by swallowing a large amount of sleeping pills. She leaves a note with a simple thanks for nothing at the end, showing she has nothing really left to live for. Hoping to be released by death, she is instead offered another proposition, perhaps one she cannot refuse. From that offer, Susans tale begins. The story itself is one that can be a real tear jerker. The plot was interesting, with a few plot twists to keep it engaging and interesting, without making it too confusing. The story, though it is a bit linear, does have quite few choices that can affect the ending to an extent. The characters are all unique in their own respects, with their roles being portrayed in a very realistic way. Such as Susan, where she portrays the role of someone who is depressed very well, and does not make it seem over the top.
GameplayThe gameplay is simple to learn, including a few puzzles to progress through the story; most are fairly simple, but some may require a bit more thought and effort. You can move left and right in the 2D environment and interact with objects, making the mechanics very simple to learn and will allow for easier immersion into the story. Paying attention to your environment and dialogues can help with these puzzles, helping to make sure you pay attention to what is happening.
Aesthetics/AudioThe art-style is very interesting, being mostly in black in white, with a few scenes and objects being in color. Considering the topics that the game deals with, the black and white scheme fits it very well, but does so in a way that is not too clich. The weakest part of this game is the voices for the characters. Though the dialogues from the characters are well put, the audio itself has varying qualities. This can catch one off-guard at first, but if you can ignore the quality of some of the voices, this will hardly be something distracting. The soundtrack on the other hand is spectacular, and fits well with the current mood of the story, plus some of the songs are absolutely great! Perfect for each scene it plays in, setting the mood just right.

Verdict: 9/10

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady" will hurt you.  The story of Susan Ashworth

The Cat Lady
This was an emotinal game. I can't get over it. It stabs you right in the feels god dammit. I just finished it and my mind is still blown away from the experience I lived. I'm so close to crying lol that's how unbelievably beautiful it was. A big applause to the devs.
Even if it takes me not nine

The Cat Lady
The play style of The Cat Lady is simple and intuitive. The entire game is controlled with the keyboard  left and right arrow keys to move, up to examine objects and areas of interest, down to select items in your inventory, and enter to select an option. The interface is minimal as well, with just a bar across the bottom of the screen to display items youve collected.

I really enjoyed that this game was side-scrolling. The ability to actually control Susan, rather than scanning a cursor all around the screen as in traditional, point-and-click adventure games, made the game a much more engaging, organic experience. This isnt -talking point-and-clicks in any way  the ability to navigate Susan through the nightmarish environments just made the game feel a lot more personal, and less zoomed-out, which works since The Cat Lady is more about your interaction with others than solving elaborate puzzles.

The Cat Lady is not a game about ridding the world of evil. Its about accepting that sometimes s rough, but you have to find your happiness in spite of it all. Its about learning to smile in the face of horror, and realizing that your fear of others is just a result of your own weakness.

I dont have much of a conclusion other than GO GET THE CAT LADY. Its a unique and engaging experience that I would hate to see fly under the radar. Its definitely in my top games that I've played this year. If you like adventure games, cats, horror, good writing, and stuff with explicit content warnings at the beginning, this is the game for you!

The Cat Lady
What a masterpiece of a game. Wow.

Art, original music, and writing are all superb. Graphics could have been more detailed, but the art style makes the graphical detail (resolution) not as important, and even more fitting in a way for the darker and grainier feel to the game. Voice acting is some of the best I've heard in a game making all the characters believable and worthy of your investment in them. Especially the main female protagonist, who is very unique for the gaming world and isn't constrained by the typical gaming tropes.

The writing and character dialogue is by far the most mature and believable for any game I have played. You are getting adult level dialogue and script writing here with very few, if any instances of the kind of cheesy video game writing we have grown to expect from video game writers.

This story will present some very dark themes. Depression, suicide, murder, and any other dark thoughts you could have. It's not technically a horror game, but it is psychologically creepy enough to feel like it at times. Something that most of us who no longer feel any fear from the horror" genre are more likely to find unnerving in parts due to it being much more about the emotional level of the characters and their mental state rather than just seeing a ton of  gore. This game does have several  strange and gory scenes in it

REVIEWThe Cat Lady is one sick and twisted game.  It's a noir adventure game with a unique and distinguished identity. At least I haven't played anything quite like this before.  It is an interesting blend of genres and themes that makes for a novel and stimulating gaming experience that doesn't feel played out.

It really pushes the envelope with some twisted, demented scenes that are eerily enjoyable, and easy to become immersed in... even if you aren't usually a fan of adventure games.  If you want something creepy, thrilling, and well-written: then I think you will like this game.

The writing is amazing in my opinion; it has some of the deepest, trippiest, creepiest scenes I have seen in a game like this. And the voice acting is extremely solid for the most part, which reinforces the excellent writing.  It takes really good writing and solid acting to be able to create an immersive atmosphere in a simple side-scrolling adventure game, but The Cat Lady delivers and then some.  I'll admit, the story gets a little ridiculous and/or confusing at moments, but that is fitting of the eerie atmosphere.

Considering The Cat Lady is a 2D game with mediocre graphics, it is actually amazing how nice of a presentation there is. The noir art style works well; even though the graphics are simple, it just somehow fits well with the tone of the game.  The visuals wont floor you with detail, but they paint an excellent picture and perfectly depict the ambiance of the game.

As far as the actual puzzle solving goes, it's a pretty simple game.  Theres really more of a focus on the story and the eerie atmosphere then there is on solving puzzles... but there is some thinking to be done in order to progress through the campaign.

And so if you would be interested in a creepy, story-driven adventure game, then look no further than The Cat Lady. It has a very unique identity and is well worth the experience for fans of the genre looking for something fresh and novel.

While The Walking Dead may be the first game to roll of of players tongues when asking about dark point and click adventure games it's hardly the only title in the genre. Frankly, depending on what tickles your fancy, it may not even be the best choice for those looking for a gruesome, horror tinged experience. The Cat Lady is Harvester Game's entry into the genre boasting a distinct aesthetic and a narrative that handles heavy psychological themes and obsesses with some of the more morbid aspects of existence. With such a benign sounding title, The Cat Lady may come as a surprise to unassuming players but the question remains, is The Cat Lady the pinnacle of recent horror themed adventure games or should it be buried at the bottom of the litter box?

The Cat Lady opens with eponymous Susan Ashworth succumbing to her loneliness and the ghosts of her past by gorging herself on a last supper of sleeping pills. Instead of stepping into the black void that she assumed would be her end, Susan finds herself in Limbo where she encounters a mysterious old woman who offers her a chance at life and happiness. The phlegmatic Susan doesn't exactly jump at the woman's offer but reluctantly takes it upon herself to seek out people that the old lady refers to as parasites in exchange for happiness. In order to help Susan with her new burden, the lady renders Susan immortal before sending her back to the world of the living. Throughout the course of the game Susan encounters the aforementioned parasites who happen to be serial killers who employ some of the most perverse methods and rituals when taking the lives of others.

Themes of depression, suicide and hopelessness pervade The Cat Lady but thankfully Susan's sardonic tone keeps her from become too overbearing and irritating. Such subject matter could easily devolve into the whining melancholic drivel that characterizes a Hot Topic playlist. The focus on Susan's psyche and the focus on her road to depression  makes The Cat Lady feel more like Silent Hill than the past several entries in Konami's acclaimed survival horror franchise. Like the critically extolled Silent Hill 2,  the Parasites that Susan faces are often allegorical. Unfortunately, much of the voice acting can be flat, and in the case of the wife of one of the parasites that Susan must dispatch, it can be rather silly, disrupting the tone of the game. Some characters sound like their dialogue was recorded with a webcam and these inconsistencies can irritate. Despite the underwhelming vocal production the soundtrack is great. With a mix of industrial music, jazzy compositions, string arrangements and piano pieces it easily shifts the tone of the game from tense and unnerving to melancholy and lonely. Some tracks with lyrics interject in key moments and give this simple indie release an almost cinematic quality.

While The Cat Lady employs a unique aesthetic it isn't exactly cohesive or pretty. Characters are rendered like early 90's digitized graphics and move like marionettes. Backgrounds appear to be composed of still photos that are desaturated. Much of the game is monochrome with splashes of color which does a great job of communicating Susan's mental state. Some of the colorized elements are of some significance while others are just random highlights. Some areas are fully colored. With so many different varying elements and shifts in style the visuals are a bit of a mess but the imagery employed by The Cat Lady is effective, channeling a mix of slasher film gore, industrial props, grime and decay.

While many more recent popular adventure games don't really have much in the gameplay department aside from dialogue choices and a few quicktime events, The Cat Lady contains traditional puzzles. These puzzles commendably balance logic and a sense of reward, meaning that not much time is spent guessing what combination of items will allow players to progress. Using cloths to unscrew hot light bulbs, finding a knife to losen a brick which is later used to smash a window and finding ways to coax hostile NPCs from important items are some of the ways in which your gray matter is tested. Also your actions and interactions with others can affect the outcome of the game. It's immensely satisfying in a way that Tell Tale's immensely popular games are not.

Despite its course edges, The Cat Lady is a tremendously engaging adventure game. It fills the hole left by Silent Hill when it comes to psychological horror and provides a glimpse of hat sever depression can look like. The narrative is engaging and slowly uncovering Susan's past is engrossing and the dark imagery is unnerving. It would take more than the flat, low production voice work and a cluster of a visual style to make The Cat Lady unplayable because it gets the things that matter the most right. The puzzles are rewarding while not bogging down the experience with obtuse and inane gags that pretentiously preoccupy themselves with stumping players than making progression meaningful. Adventure game fans and horror game fans take note, The Cat Lady is a worthwhile experience that should be on your radar.

The Cat Lady
Disturbing & Original // Not A Game For Cheerful People
+ The voice-actor for the protagonist is talented and convincing; she did an excellent job with nuances of expressing the emotions of the character
+ Boasts some genuinely disturbing (and sometimes frightening) moments that are delivered with finesse
+ Art style, for both characters and environments, is well-presented and fits well with the theme
+ Ambient sound is deeply unsettling, keeping the player properly unnerved throughout the experience
+ The way the game subdues its colors goes a long way to further immerse the player
+ There is a strong focus on character development
+ Interesting choices of musical score that are well-place to complement their respective scenes
+ Puzzles are interesting and fun to move through; often one will find that they need to be creative to advance beyond an obstacle
+ Multiple endings available, depending on dialogue choices

- Cannot pause during conversations
- Voice-acting for secondary characters is largely mediocre (at best)
- The story suffers some moderate pacing issues, often dragging scenes on for excruciating lengths of time
- Little replay value beyond Steam achievements and multiple endings

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is one of the most unique and moving games I've ever had the experience to play. The story deals with Susan Ashworth a 40 year old woman who tries to commit suicide but fails and then has to struggle to find the will to live.

There's very much a horror element but not without reason or for shock value. Everything has a reason, a purpose and a meaning and while the game can be very dark and graphic I felt that fit with Susan's view of the world and other people in general.

I'm normally not interested in horror stories at all, but I feel that this is an emotional journey with a necessary horror backdrop to bring you into Susan's dark world of despair. I also felt that the unique art style of the game, which seems almost like an animated paper diorama, and the surreal nature of the game in general for me did help mitigate the horror aspect a bit. For those avoiding this game due to the horror factor I urge you to reconsider and push through it even in the areas that are disturbing. The ultimate experience I feel is very much worth it.

In spite of some very unrealistic situations, I found Susan to be one of the most realistically portrayed characters I've ever encountered in a video game. The dynamic between Susan and Mitzi, a young girl she encounters and assists her on her journey, was also excellent and a great contrast.

The game is voice acted and the cast on the whole is excellent, particularly Susan. With every tone of her voice you really do feel her pain and her struggle.

The ending for me was very satisfying, realistic and even uplifting. It was a great closure to a moving experience. Though note that there are multiple endings and even one extra special one that feels like a gift if you work to get it.

I would recommend anyone who is interested in non-standard video game experiences that really make you think, feel and see different points of view to play The Cat Lady and to please stick with it and not be put off by the horror. The experience of the game taken as a whole is very much worth it.

Review: The Cat Lady
Writing a review about this game, although I havent played it for a while now, may sound strange to you, but I cant let it drown in the abyss that is called Steam. It deals with problems like depression, loneliness, social and moral decay of society, problems that became stronger in Modern times. Time is Money"

The Cat Lady
This game is a masterpiece.

I had planned on writing a comprehensive review, but blergh.

Just play this game. It's incredible.

The Cat Lady
Started this game hoping for a depressing horror experience, ended with tears & snot and a greater will to live 11/10

The Cat Lady
It's a perfect game.. or more like purr"fect game! (Hah

The Cat Lady
Loved it!  At times a bit slow maybe, specially at the start. But...

1. Awesome atmosphere
2. Interesting storyline
3. Sick and gruwesome
4. Did I mention sick?
5. Great voiceovers
6. In depth characters
7. Did i mention sick?
8. Low budget , but made in a way that it is just very artistic. Really well done.

Felt more like an interactive story for most parts as a game. ( like a story told with a picture book, not a movie.) But the game part was pretty decent too. Some nice puzzles. Not too easy, not too hard.  Finished the game in one breath.

9/10

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is fanatically sick, twisted, and disturbing. WTF did I just play? And why did I enjoy every bit of it? I am honestly speechless.

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady doesn't make the best first impression. It's a low-res adventure game, made in AGS, it's almost entirely B&W and the animations are really strange. In fact, the whole graphical style is an acquired taste. It took me some time to get accustomed to it, at least.

So what is it about? You're a lonely, very depressed woman, called Susan Ashworth, and on one especially difficult day, you decided to end it all and swallow a bunch of sleeping pills. But you don't end up in heaven. Instead, you're sent back with the mission to rid the world of parasites"

The Cat Lady
I loved the Cat Lady. Whether you will love it depends on what you're looking for in a game.

The characterization in this game is outstanding. Susan is relatable, and her situation is intriguing, as are the other characters. The portrayal of depression doesn't resort to making Susan a stereotype. The gore is not cheap, but is used to evoke emotions including disgust and dread. There were times when I knew what was needed to progress but had to steel my nerves to actually do it. If you're in the market for a story driven and methodically building sort of personal horror, then this game is your genre.

Now, this game has things that will put some people off. It's not a cheerful game. There's a lot of gore and some very dark themes. There is a strong age warning on it, and there should probably be some trigger warnings as well. Additionally the game is slow building, has a very simple interface, and the art/animation, though it has a very well chosen aesthetic that worked for me, runs the risk of looking inexpensive or unpolished. These things might be ok or even a plus for you, or it might put you off the game entirely.

For me, the choice of whether to recommend this title comes down to this. The Cat Lady will prompt you and give you a choice to feel a certain series of reactions, including fear, disgust, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness and occasionally hope. If that is what you're looking for, then this story is worth your time.

Note: This review based on a single playthrough of the Desura version. Crossposted to GOG.

The Cat Lady
A rare creation, a unique study on human behavior that exposes instincts, fears, desires that most of us would not even care to admit to ourselves ;)

The Cat Lady
Have you ever been through depression, had suicidal thoughts? then this game is for you~

This game is a hidden gem indeed.

I see myself in Mrs. A, seriously whoever went through those tough times this game brings back memories, not really the bad ones but I guess you can say the good ish ones, if you're currently depressed or feel weak don't play it or maybe do? it could help~ it's beautiful, emotional and heart warming.

can I hug Mrs. A and Mitzi now?

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is an adventure game in horror style. You have to choose different options in dialogues which change the story (like in the game The walking dead) but you also have interactions and to walk your way through the game. You can find different objects which could maybe useful for the story later so you should remember what you see and what the characters are telling you!

I don't want to spoil so I can't tell you too much, but what I can relate is: the protagonist is called Susan Ashworth, a lonely 40 year old woman. She has a sad life with no friends and nothing which makes her happy instead of her cats maybe. The game deals with themes considered mature and dark such as depression, suicide and loneliness. You have to make decisions like in life do you trust people? Or do you kill them? Maybe you see a friend in someone and later it will be a mistake. You will meet psychopaths and people who need help. How do you act? Do you run away? Or do you help people who dont even care about you. But maybe just you think no one cares about you  maybe others love you. Some moments of hope break the dark but to find out the whole story and what really happened to Susan you have to play the game!

Its a really fascinating game and I totally feel with Susan (The Cat Lady). Im sure it will thrill you too!

The Cat Lady
Only on the 2nd chapter so far and this game is a must play for any adventure fan tired of the usual adventure gaming tropes. This sure as heck strays away from that.

At first I found the interface clumsy and annoying but after getting used to it it's just fine and simple and doesn't get in the way of what really matters in this game, the story, the setting and the dialogue. A steal for 10 dollars and I just wish games like these did better financially because it is well deserved indeed.

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is an indie adventure game. It's typically referred to as a point and click game although it plays without using the mouse.

The premise of The Cat Lady follows Susan Ashworth. A very lonely 40 year old woman who cares only for her cats, who decides to commit suicide. What follows is a very surreal descent as the story progresses.

What I like the most about the Cat Lady was it's self awareness and it's message. The protagonist Susan comes across as extremely believable as a depressed suicidal woman. She's not particularly attractive, she often talks to herself, she's prone to outbursts and she genuinely comes across like someone you wouldn't catch a second glance at on the street. However her character is still extremely likeable, and her story is very well paced. Which keeps you invested until it's conclusion.

The game deals with very complex themes following suicide, grief, remorse, guilt and suffering. Stylistically the game is generally colorless, with high contrast splashes of color following very specific moments in the game. The game has a very peculiar art style where the characters look like very realistic sketches overlayed onto environments. It paints a very depressed picture where the world that the protagonist sees blends in together. Almost like it's all a distraction to her.

But the biggest thing I like about the Cat Lady is it's message. One of hope and perserverance, where one should involve themselves in the lives of others to truly feel any sort of happiness. Every objective in the game almost feels like a step in the main character's redemption. It's very engaging to see her undergo a character arc where she starts out completely hopeless and apathetic, to heroic and selfless.

The Cat Lady tells a story and most importantly tells it very well, and I dearly recommend it to fans of adventure games.

The Cat Lady
I've rewritten this so it wouldn't make someone sad.  So here's a more upbeat review for a game about suicide, torture, , murder, cancer, and just general unpleasantness. Ahem.

In The Cat Lady, you play as Susan, who has been through a lot, but is about to embark on a journey through all of the above, including her own death.  Repeatedly.  It is a thoroughly grim story, every character in it has something terribly wrong with them, and kittens are cute.

This is one of my all time favorite games, partly because it is such a horrid tale, but also because it is the story of someone who is faced with horror after horror, but still goes on living.  Well, except for the times she kills herself, but who's counting.

I think The Cat Lady has a lesson to teach us all, which is that everyone dies, sometimes because we kill them, but generally you should just be patient and wait your turn.  Don't go looking for death.  It will find you.

Chocolate cake is very tasty.

The Cat Lady
Now this is what i would call a game aimed at and for adults,and i say that because this story deals with some very heavy and serious issues (suicide,serial killers and all sorts of other things that are really aimed at adults and not for the ears and eyes of the younger generation).
Now i must admit i havent played as much as i would have like'd to yet (due to many other games getting in the way) but this has been one of the best adult experiences i have had with a game in a long time,excellent story (will not say to much as that would only spoil your enjoyment of what is a very well written and played out story)-the graphics really do suit this sort of game-and the soundtrack and spoken dialouge are all top notch.
Now you start the game and you die straight away,this is a problem in most games but not here as its all part and parcel of the storline,you then meet the QUEEN OF MAGGOTS" and she then preceeds to send you back to the world of the living with a purpose

The Cat Lady
This is a masterpiece.
I have depression and have attempted suicide twice since losing someone loved. When I played The Cat Lady, it was expected to be an experience to make me a better horror writer, but it was far deeper in the end.

This is a game focused on its storytelling. Susan Ashworth is a deep and troubled character, and Mitzi is a character that brings life to the whole setting. It was an unforgettable trip through not only the struggle for life (or death?) but also of how deeply someone full of life can make you change your view about the world. It is a game about redemption and starting a new life, about facing the ghosts of the past and managing to let the sadness go and let the sun shine in your face once again.

One of the best audiovisual experiences I've ever had, under one of my favorite soundtracks ever. Easily one of my favorite games ever played. Thanks, Harvester Games. Thank you very much.

The Cat Lady
I dont like horror games, but I managed to play this to the end, and Im so glad I did it! It is a beautiful game, and it is about people, good and bad people, but also real people. I recommend it for anyone who likes cats, dresses in black, and has no problem dealing with heavy issues. The antagonists are disturbing, mostly because they look so real. And the soundtrack fits perfectly.

Some spoilers below:

1. The puzzles are mostly easy, and I enjoy that.

2. I dont like being randomly scared, so I could do without it, but it is tolerable.

3. The ending is beautiful! Im really relieved that it was not a depressive and pessimist ending. Sometimes the ending makes the whole difference.

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is simply one of the most beautiful horror adventure out there, something that goes beyond a videogame and yet a work of art that only a videogame could have delivered.As long as you're not totally put off by the art design, there's no reason to not play The Cat Lady.A rare creation, a unique study on human behavior that exposes instincts, fears, desires that most of us would not even care to admit to ourselves.It's rare to find a game that deals with topics like depression in such a mature way. If you want to experience an experimental artistic adventure, you're in for a journey you won't easily forget.The Cat Lady offers a unique and deviated world and a setting full of horror and despair, although the keyboard controls and an excessive backtracking remain flaws to be reckoned with.A deep, scary, fascinating adventure with a mind-blowing story, a great acting and a positive utilization of soundtrack; still, there are some little flaws in the plot, and the gameplay is quite classic. Anyway, long story short: this is a hell of a game.

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is a dark, disturbing point and click adventure that truly lives up to those descriptors. I have yet to come across a game which covers such controversial topics and heavy adult material with such...grace. Most games, and media outlets in general, wouldnt get near the plot of this adventure with a 10 foot pole; covering depression, suicide, drug and alcohol use, tragic deaths and psychological disorders in a way which does not sensationalize the issues but instead is able to put you inside the life of someone surrounded by them.
Gripping is one of the best words I have to describe my experience with The Cat Lady. After every play session I was left on edge and more than a little introspective about the issues in my own life. I think this title is incredible, progressive, and truly gives something to the art of game creation.

The Cat Lady
I don't know why I gravitate towards games that deal with mental disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, but The Cat Lady is one that captivated me from the start. The game starts out with you committing suicide and ending up in what I can best describe as a purgatory of sorts. In order to save your soul you're tasked with taking those of deranged and depraved lunatics in trade. Each and every chapter is somber and more than just a little depressing. For anyone who knows what it's like to suffer such things it really hits the mark. The endings (for there are about three or so of them) really make an impact when you take the game as a whole into account. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to play a dark and somewhat twisted game. Just a word of warning, though. Don't play if you're already feeling down.

The Cat Lady
This game is honestly very deep. Meaningful beyond words. To some players the contents might be very disturbing, as it includes suicide, death, depression, cancer, a ton of swearing, and a lot more. If you're easily disturbed, or a young player, I would not recommend you getting this, as it's not fit for young players at all. I felt creeped out through most of the gameplay. I would recommend this to MATURE players only.

The gamplay is simple, fun, and nothing tricky required. The graphics might not seem so amazing, but they are. They fit perfectly with the game, especially considering what it's about. The soundtrack is pretty awesome, aswell. Together with the graphics, the soundtrack gives it that.. uneasy feeling, making it seem dark but amazing at the same time. I wasn't too thrilled with the voice acting. At some parts it sounded terrible, some parts being too soft, or too loud. One thing that really bothered me though, was somewhere in chapter 4 I think, there's a scene with some fog. My frame rates dropped down to 1/2 for that entire scene. I'm not sure if others have had this problem, but everything ran smoothly through the rest of the game.

The puzzles are quite simple, and easy to work around if you stop for a moment or two to think. I got stuck more times than I'd like to admit, some parts can be tricky, but the answer to the puzzle is always obvious. Or so it seemed. If you get stuck, there are some guides offering help.

This is one of those games where what you do, what you decide, will affect your ending. I tried my best to go after the golden ending, and I can honestly say I was happy with what I found. The ending I got made me feel sad, but happy at the same time, and that's just what this game will do to you. It makes the player feel something. Playing through this you'll get a hint of what depression is like, but at the same time you'll see what true happiness is. The game perfectly captures emotions.

Would I recommend it? Yes. Overall I think if you're a fan of adventure/horror type games then this is for you. This is one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing recently, and I think if you give it a go, you'd agree! So, prepare to be hit right in the feels.

Susan/10

The Cat Lady
Rarely have I been drawn into a game like this, especially these days. I'm not just talking about being addicted to a AAA game or some other game where when it's over you kind of start to forget about it eventually, if it's a game you can freeroam after it's over you might play it for a couple of more hours, mod it and so on but eventually it fades.

The Cat Lady however, is like a book that I just want to read about forever and I'm not a huge book reader mind you (American Psycho and anything by Haruki Murakami is basically all I read) this surrealistic world is beautiful and I wish there were hundreds of more hours to soak into. (Going to check out all 4 endings and achievements I missed though)

Not to mention the soundtrack, I'm sort of a video game soundtrack collector but 80% of it is basically memories and nostalgia so it's not just a big collection of pointlessness. Counting only my MP3s (and not FLAC) there's about 175GB in my VGM folder. And this soundtrack is definitely one of my all time favorites, a lovely blend of guitars, dark ambient, blues, jazz, piano and downtempo with a unique personality and style.

Turned out to be one of my all time fave games no doubt. I could go on and on in detail about the story and everything but it's better for you to experience it all, and I would like to end it here with my highest recommendations, fuzzy feelings, goosebumps and aural o r g a s m s. (Why is that word censored?)

Here's a magnificent trailer of the game if you haven't seen it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BczPm1d5_18

The Cat Lady
If your feeling extremely depressed in your life, whether it's contemplating suicide or wanting to hurt yourself. PLEASE play this game, it helps a lot. Always play this game over and over again if you have a single thought of suicide, this game will show you the life of someone who is suicidal overcoming their depression... I won't say anymore about the game, seriously play it its worth it.

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is a point-and-click horror adventure game. You are Susan Ashworth, a depressed woman without friends. Her only companions are cats. She is known in her neighborhood as the cat lady. The game begins with the suicide of the protagonist.  In death Susan encounter the Queen of Maggots, who makes her immortal and gives her the mission to kill five psychopaths referred to as the parasites." Susan then returns to the world of the living to wake up in a hospital bed and is soon forced to carry out her mission.
The Cat Lady is extremely narrative-driven

The Cat Lady
Don't let the game style, artistic decision, or anything else sway you from experiencing this hidden, dark gem.

The Cat Lady is worthy of your time.

The Cat Lady
Have you ever felt like a game was made just for you? Like it was pandering to your own sensibilities and sense of humor?"

Yeah...

The Cat Lady is a 2D sidescrolling adventure title that features dark

The Cat Lady
Where do I begin ... I randomly bought this game because it was very cheap (sale) and because the theme looked interesting to me. I normally never play games like this, but I can say I was positively surprised.

This game isn't for everyone, its subjects are dark: depression, suicide, murder, cancer ... It's for people who want to enjoy a good story about these kind of things. Even if you've never been in contact with them, the game is very good at explaining how a depressed person goes through life. The game can be quite confronting towards people who've suffered from any of the topics above, but it's still an interesting experience.

STORY: really good. At chapter 1 I was interested, but I wasn't blown away or anything. At the end of chapter 2 I was completely hooked though. I thought this game was going to give me a nice, regular story about depression, but I was wrong. It throws things at you you wouldn't expect. Well the game is tagged horror"

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is one of the best horror adventures i've seen, dark atmosphere dark music dark everything. Perfect gameplay weird story but brilliant. You really have to play this game, no screenshot no video can give you the experience you will earn when you played one hour of this masterpiece. So are you able to find your way through this nightmare?

Welcome to a REAL horror game:  T H E   C A T   L A D Y ""

The Cat Lady
9.5/10

What a great game! Perhaps the best I've played in recent years.

Pros
- Fantastic story. Creepy, interesting, engaging. Dripping with atmosphere.
- Wonderful voice acting. Every single character does an excellent and convincing job.
- Despite the low resolution, visually striking.
- Very original altogether. I haven't played anything really like it.

Cons
- Controls are simple, yet still unintuitive and inconvenient. Would have been better to bind more keys for specific action (e.g. browse inventory using different keys than the ones used for walking).
- Resolution is too low for this day and age. You can use GeDoSaToTool to make the game look better
- Some puzzles are too difficult or don't make much sense. I had to check a walkthrough several times. The biggest problem for most (including me) seems to be chapter 2 (the hospital). I created a thread in the forum with low-spoiler hints to help those stuck in it.
- Save game system is limited to 50 saves. There is a workaround to save more, but you only learn that you need to use workarounds after discovering that many of your latest saves are not there. There is also no Cloud save for those using multiple computers, but there is a related workaround to share the Saved Games folder over the network.

Overall: The pros far outweigh the cons. This game is a must!

P.S.
The hrs on record" displayed by Steam on my review is totally wrong. I had this game minimized while I was abroad. Steam really should count gametime only when the game has focus. If you have this issue and want to learn how much times game actually take you to finish

The Cat Lady
The Cat Lady is simply put..a story of a depressed 40 year old that kills herself. But of course there's a lot more to it than that..otherwise it wouldn't be such a well received game.

The horror elements are very well done. There were things even I have never seen before (and I am a big fan of horror movies/games/the genre in general). In this game you WILL care about the characters you meet and find yourself having a bit of an emotional attachment. This will drive most of the decisions you make.

Now with that being said, this won't be a game everyone will enjoy. There is A LOT of reading involved, and it can be a bit slow at times. There is some nudity, and some sexual themes and vulgar language. Stay away from this if you find that sort of thing offensive..(you're missing out though! ;]). If you're into achievements, this isn't hard to 100%. If you're into stories, then this one has a really good one that you may like. :) Definitely worth the price in my opinion!

The Cat Lady
The cat lady is a point and click adventure game, but describing it only so would be an understatement. The puzzles are easy and solving them mainly gives way to an emotionally invested story. You are Susan Ashworth, - the cat lady- and you have just done what you wanted to do for a long time: committed suicide. You soon realize though that this is not the end, as you get sent back to life with the mission to kill some so called human parasites"

The Cat Lady
An exceptionally well-written adventure game about torment, depression, self-destruction, suicide, the burden of existence, the will to power, the meaning of life, and the eternal nothingness of death. Fun!

The Cat Lady
ing awesome and unorthodox adventure game.
Amazing story, great puzzles, unlikely protagonist and very, very dark.

Finished all the endings I could find and will be replaying now I have it on Steam.

The Cat Lady
This game is awesome!
The story is very good, someone should make a movie with it, the music is good, the artwork is not that bad, you get used to it and start to like it and the puzzles aren't boring.
If you like psychological horror games with great story, you should try it out!

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
I was going to recommend this game initially, but one month after release and the developers seem to have gone silent on us, no more updates or messages on the steam community. I am going to split this review into two parts, single player and multi player and talk about the pros and cons. Here we go:

The Single-player campaign - Length: 6-7 hours - Difficulty: Average ( I played about 8 hours of it )

So we get another typical cod campaign, the story is great, altho not at the same level as Black Ops 2 was, your choices do not impact the ending, in fact the campaign is preety much all linear. Graphics are the best the franchise has ever seen, and so are the audio effects, also gameplay has been refined to be extremely fast paced and enjoyable. Kevin Spacey's performance is incredible, at some points the engine is struggling to keep up with his performance, making you wish Sledgehammer would have used live action cutscenes instead of CGI. The campaign is overall a great experience, if not a bit too short, they could have expanded on it and made it longer, it has some plot holes and rushed moments.

Pros:
+ Cool story
+ Fast paced gameplay
+ Great graphics and audio design
+ Kevin Spacey, Troy Baker give incredible performances

Cons:
- No decisions to take
- Completely linear
- Very short, you can finish it in a day or two
- Lots of plot holes

Overall SP score: 7.5/10
The Multi-player: ( I played about 15-20 hours of MP )

The core multiplayer experience is great, the freshest cod we got in years, the amount of guns is lower than in previous cods but they compensate by adding a lot of customization to your character and weapons, game uses the Pick 13 system from BO2 but improved, you get 13 points that you can use to create the kit that suites your playstyle most, even the killstreaks are customizable. The exosuit completely changes the gameplay, making it extremely fast paced and way more enjoyable than the past cods. At this point, you might ask, what's there to hate about it....and here comes the bad part. They done ed it up again.... Devs promised dedicated servers prior to launch, went completely silent about it after launch, they also keep ignoring all the problems most of the playerbase is having, continuing to push updates that balance a few guns and fix a few prestige issues...really? At this point they seem to have completely forgotten about everyone who bought it, playerbase is dying by the day, already at 5k ppl online/day from the 30k+ on day one and they just don't care about it.

Pros:
+ Exo-suit completely changes the way multiplayer works
+ Great graphics and audio design
+ Preety cool future inspired weapons
+ Lots of customization

Cons:
- Terrible post-launch support from Sledgehammer Games
- No dedicated servers ( game uses p2p connection resulting in horrible host advantage that ruins the game )
- Connection issues on a lot of maps, most people can't ever join certain maps cause of sync issues
- Extremely fast progression, I got to level 50 in less than 10 hours ( not that much of a con, still...)
- Cutting off features to sell them as DLC later on ( also splitting the community )

Overall MP score: 6.5/10
FINAL SCORE: 7/10
Game was run on:

CPU: AMD Phenom II x4 955 3.6Ghz
GPU: GTX 760 2GB
RAM: 8GB DDR3 1600Mhz
SSD: Kingston v3 128GB

Settings: 1920x1080 res, all settings maxed out, FXAA

FPS for SP:
Minimum: 60
Average: 75
Maximum: 100+

FPS for MP:
Minimum: 45
Average: 65
Maximum: 91 (capped at 91 -.-)

Game has FOV slider and a lot of options making it run very well regardless of system.

As you can see it runs way better than Ghosts did

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
I truly love this game & respect the hard work you guys at SledgeHammer put into this game,
However Its 2015 and We want DEDICATED SERVERS.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
At launch this game was pretty good. Advanced warfare introduced some new moves that changed the gameplay a little. However, since the first two weeks its been going downhill.

The developers had a smart" plan. Lets make matchmaking skill-based

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
Where can i get the dlc where it adds players?

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
(TL;DR can be found at the end of the review)

Call of the annual Duty - Underdeveloped Lagfare
I've been a huge fan of the Call of Duty franchise when Modern Warfare hit the stores. For years I've been playing pretty much nothing else and dumped hundreds, if not thousands of hours into it. I also played Modern Warfare 2 & 3 but it wasn't the same for obvious reasons. Since then I wanted to buy another CoD that could bring back the nostalgia. Then Advanced Warfare comes along and actually gets a lot of good reviews and I get curios: Another studio, a longer delevopement time and fast dropping prices.

I bought this game for 20 euros and pity the fool who preordered it for 60 euros and thought that he would get a good game. I lowered my expectations as far as possible and still I got disappointed. I really can't see why so many people like this game and where all the good reviews come from. Okay, better than Call of Duty: Ghosts. But being better than something really bad doesn't make it good. You can polish a piece of  as much as you want, you can gold-plate it and wrap it in present paper but it still stays a piece of . On to the actual review:

Singleplayer:

I enjoyed the campaign far more than I would have thought. The story is alright, yet very predictible, the characters ain't great (except Kevin Spacey for the sake of being Kevin Spacey) and the AI is still far away from being intelligent". But all the new gagdets they could introduce with the futuristic setting make up for it easily. On top of that they added a ton of vehicles stages. It's the kind of singleplayer you would expect from a CoD game.
You won't miss anything if you don't play the campaign as it is very forgettable but it's a fun non-brainer if you want to pass 6-7 hours. Sadly it has absolutely no replay value. Less cutscenes

The servers are DEAD!

At later times it's impossible to find any games on any game mode that actually have people playing.

Normally you find like 4 people who want to play but you need 6 people to start the damn game! So you end up sitting in the lobby till everyone gives up and leaves....

I think the big problem here is that the game is so demanding on peoples computers that very few people actually have rigs that can support this game. There is no way to turn down the graphics so unless you got a bad  computer your basically  out of luck.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
So apparantley everyones father works for activision and their kids ed my mom

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
5 November 2014

I want to recommend this game so much, trust me I do. This is the breath of fresh air we all so desperately need after the unsatisfying Call of Duty: Ghosts. Playing through Advanced Warfare's campaign was a blast! The singe player is absolutely worth while. The multiplayer, however, is where things go a bit downhill.

For starters, (as I'm sure many, if not all have heard) there are currently no dedicated servers. I feel like whenever I join a game, it's a gamble on whether or not I'll be playing a nice game of CoD or just sit in frustration as players run in place and teleport around.

Second, the good weapons are actually given to you in the early ranks. Weapons like the AK12 prove to be great for new players who aren't used to Call of Duty games and are still in the early ranks, because the weapons are overpowered. That deminishes some of the satisfaction and incentive for actually reaching higher ranks.

Third, the Zombies feature is going to be a priced DLC. Personally, I think it should have been a part of the base game like the black ops games or even world at war.

I do plan on playing this game more, because I can look through the problems that it has. However, I do hope that some (if not all) issues will be resolved in future patches. Hopefully I'll be able to recommend this game 100%.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
CoD:Advanced Warfare should be named Salmon: Advanced Warfare.

Its a fish like cod, but it tastes better and has a different color.

It also needs to be noted that like salmon, it is quite expensive.

Edit, thanks for the support, i never thought it would be seen by 800+ people.

For an actual opinion on the game i have to say it is really enjoyable and i've had a ton of fun so far.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
For some reason, Steam is showing the six hours it's taken me to finish the single player (during which it crashed or locked my computer up approximately twice for every one of the game's 15 levels) rather than the ~50 hours I have in the multiplayer.

Four months from launch, Activision still haven't added the promised dedicated servers, so the netcode is terrible console P2P networking with aggressively bad lag compensation up the wazoo. The game's population has dwindled to the point where the game will struggle to find you a TDM or Dom lobby, and you can completely forget about playing any other game mode. If you leave a match because it contains a blatant aimbotter (which is the case maybe 1/3 of the time) and requeue, you'll be dumped straight back into the same lobby you just left. The weapon balance is terrible, and the devs went out of their way to buff the guns that were already the most overpowered, meaning 80% of the people you will encounter use one of two guns.

This isn't worth your time or money at 45. It's not even worth your time or money if you can get it for half or less of that price. Avoid like the plague, which is a shame because the exo movement system is really fun.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
Breaking the review into two parts, SP and MP; I'll be trying more multiplayer and might update part of the review:

SP:

The story is . Nothing about it is redeeming, not even Kevin Spacey.  There are lines of dialog that don't make sense (to name one, the two best friends" have a conversation in the first cutscene that only non-friends would have)

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
This is a very fun game, far better than Ghosts and has potential to be better than Black ops 2 HOWEVER there are NO DEDICATED SERVERS at this time despite the fact one of the devs said that they would be available. [Source][i.imgur.com]

The lag is horrendous. I attached several videos showing this below. Sometimes you'll boost upwards and apear to fall, only to magically be warped onto a ledge. Often you'll get hit markers on your screen but on the enemy's killcam they didn't register. Sometimes they won't register when you're blatantly shooting an enemy right in front of you. I've even had matches that failed to start and the odd host migration.  It's a shame because the multiplayer could be great if there was dedicated servers. So for now don't buy until it gets fixed, if it ever gets fixed...

Examples of lag in multiplayer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHzMHi2eUto#t=8
0:08 About a whole second delay before the hit registers on the second kill.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1nLaYiOpJ4
He clearly shoots at the other player, but on the killcam he isn't even facing him yet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muBmBEK2ckA#t=56
0:56 Almost empties an entirely clip into the enemy before hit markers appear even at point blank.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K39whbroQAk#t=35
0:35 Again clearly shoots the player but not even facing the other player killcam.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZYrhe_MAKs
This whole video is a pretty extreme example, but this kind of lag happens occasionally too...


Note: I've played many more hours than what the review actually shows because the singleplayer and multiplayer are listed seperately in your steam account. I have 30+ hours clocked already, check my profile if you don't believe me.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
The game itself is fine, but there's no dedicated servers for multiplayer. The result is lag. Mega lag, hella lag, supah lag, big booty lag. Don't bother with this in its current state unless you're only in it for campaign.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
This game has great singleplayer. I love it...
But then on the multiplayer side... Not so much.

Here's the top 5 reasons why CoD AW multiplayer sucks.

1. Horrible hit detection: For me I experienced dying in 1 or 2 shots. Before I got to react at all.
2. Horrible gun balance
3. Scorestreaks: The score steaks in this game are pathetic and useless... Non of which became helpful except for UAV.
4. Spawns: The spawns are absuletely ridiculous... To the point where enemies spawn behind me.
5. No dedicated servers: The lag is absolutely horrible! I experience it in nearly every game! And still! No dedicated servers! What's the point on buying the next call of duty if they never have dedicated servers?

I give up on CoD...
I KNOW they'll do the same thing again and just rip up the same problems that have happened for years.

CoD Sucks.

Just to point out. The half an hour is only so i could post the review, though I've played through the single player on PS4 and it wasnt bad, its the first that i've bothered to finish since cod4, but I feel that I have more than enough hours logged in multi between the two consoles to post the review.

I really wanted to like this game, and tried so hard not to hate on it after ghosts. I felt that sledgehammer would bring something new to the table and feel they tried as hard as they could to rrevive the series after the failure of ghosts. Personally, I believe that a lot of the really rubbish implementations/design flaws (like the tuning of the lag compensation and fact there is no numeric ping values) would have been imposed on the developers by Activision rather than the developers themselves making such poor decisions.

I honestly tried so hard not to be negative about this game and had an open mind in regards to this title since its their first title in the new 3-year cycle, but after uninstalling around 4-5 days after release due to how rubbish it was, recently reinstalling after the couple of patches and still experiencing most of the same issues and the horrendous lag, this is beyond a joke for a AAA title which nets the kind of profits this series does.

My MAIN issues with this game and why I personally wouldn't recommend it to anybody are as follows;
Firstly, the lag compensation is still brutally punishing (similar to he past few titles which it's so brutal you seem to be punished for having a decent wired connection) and this turns any firefight into nothing more than a coin toss for who gets hit registration rather than being based on skill/weapon/positioning. It feels more like the lag compensation is tuned for and catered to consoles connected via wifi with 150-200ms pings rather than a wired connection (on both the playstation and PC versions).

Toughness is STILL a must have perk in this game, even though the developers said it wouldnt be. It's absurd at the difference it makes to the flinch when you are hit with/without it. The hand holding needs to be toned right down or just removed, the game would be much more enjoyable if idiotic perks like this weren't in-game at all.

There is no numerical ping values, which make it nearly impossible to tell whether the weak link is your own personal connection or whether it's just a messed up host. While having the ping bars back is a step up from ghosts (which had them removed in a blatant and extremely foolish attempt to hide the fact it lagged ridiculously bad) the ping bars are still incredibly inaccurate at best and don't indicate any real kind of connection quality whatsoever.

Some lobbies which I've only had 2-3 bars for the whole round generally feel like they have much more consistent hit detection than most of the lobbies which I've had solid 4-bar connections (some of which I've experienced rubber-banding and having people teleport all over the place).

I can NOT understand why any developer would remove or attempt to change a simple, highly functional and (fairly) essential tool in online gaming, especially one which has been pretty much standard for ~20 years. Ping bars are absolute rubbish and dont really indicate anything, especially when there's no mention of what the intervals are set, at so for all we know it could be 100-150ms per bar. I would bet on this being a decision handed down straight from Activision themselves, but it's a rubbish one.

In addition to my last point, I refuse to believe there are dedicated servers (at least in my country/area anyway) due to the consistently poor connection quality, even a terrible dedicated server wouldn't perform as badly as most of the lobbies i've been connected stuck in. Until there's actual verifiable evidence of their existance outside of the US I refuse to believe they were implemented.

A lot of the weapon classes don't really feel like they have a purpose in-game. They don't feel like they have their own strengths and weaknesses which make them far more effective than the others in the right situations in this game (I've felt this has been a  trend since post mw2 and the MLG scene began to influence heavily). The SMGs outclass pretty much everything in most CoD games post MW2, especially when you factor in the mobility and reload times rather than just damage outputs alone, if it weren't true people wouldn't gravitate to them like they do in every release.

In addition to my last point, the hipfire spread is far too tight and makes hipfire FAR too viable at range. Hipfire should really only be effective as a last resort and getting lucky hits or at close range.

The engine still feels extremely dated and regardless of how much they change it and try to dress it up, it was still originally made back in the days of dial up. Perhaps its time to actually re-invest some of those enormous profits into making a new purpose built engine and focusing on gameplay before graphics/gimmicks, or porting to a different engine (like the unreal engine?) which is more current. No matter how hard they try to hide it, the engine is dated and it definitely shows. New graphics and sound components on a dated engine that doesn't play well to begin with doesn't make for an enjoyable experience AT ALL.

People still shoot out of their eyeballs, headglitching still exists and no the maps are cluttered with crap to make this a highly effective cheap tactic. The delay between the player camera and their model moving is also still present. They're all flaws with no potential to be rectified while they continue to use this same hacked up iD Tech engine and no amount of rebranding will change this.

Also while on this note, in the past ~6 years, the engine should have become more refined and less buggy rather than more noticably broken, no?

While the exo suit is a good idea in theory, the double jump feels a bit excessive and removes the ability to play tactically. It also changes the flow of the maps, and not for the better IMO. Every time I play, I'm endlessly being shot in the back by people jumping over any obstacle in the maps with ease. It also seems common practice for people to just start mashing the jump button as soon as they see another player, double jumping while spraying and praying, all while the host tosses a coin to decide whos hit detection works until someone finally gets a kill.

The double jump is also so high theres very few things you cant get onto or over in a single leap, also there's no cooldown (even though there is with other exo abilities e.g exo dash). This whole mechanic could have been implemented FAR better if jumping high objects (buildings etc) took a couple of well placed jumps and a little bit of platforming, or a cooldown on the use of the ability, perhaps both.

The climbing animation is pretty messed up and generally leads to deaths. When you jump at about waist height it plays a few frames of you falling to the ground and then you're instantly running on top. It's a bit offputting and is really clunky.
Honestly the CoD series is picking up momentum while it snowballs out of control on a downhill spiral, mostly due to a lot of foolish, counter-productive and player unfriendly design ideas/implementations most likely imposed on the developers by the publisher. It's not even 2 months post-release and it's already been on steam on sale for -50% off, this clearly shows the sales are lacking and they are in serious damage control.

I refuse to believe any developer would/could be happy with the final product in regards to the last few iterations of this series and until the community are genuinely listened to the primary focus is on gameplay rather than graphics/sound/marketing gimmicks this series doesn't deserve money from anyone.

If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Eat.

If you've read all the reviews, you can sum up what this game is about. With a story line and new gameplay features that I personally think blow the other COD games out of the water, that alone makes the game worth buying.

Except not for $60 dollars. I spent a good 6 hours on the campaign, so thats about $10 an hour to play a game.
Lets put that in perspective. Ive put 600 hours into TES: Skyrim, and paid $20 dollars on a steam sale for the entire package.  I paid just over 3 cents an hour for Skyrim.

The reason I wont put any more hours into this game is because it is almost impossible to play the multiplayer. I have played maybe one good game so far, because of the lag.

Long story short, dont buy the game right now. Wait for either the servers to be fixed, or a steam sale to pop up. Otherwise, you're overpaying.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
I was on the market for a brainless, fast-paced multiplayer shooter and thought Advanced Warfare fit the description perfectly, but ended up disappointing greatly. Biggest issue is the lack of dedicated servers which is an instant turnoff. Graphical performance is also greatly variable and there are strange bugs like FOV randomly defaulting to 65 in exo mode.
Character customization and different skins are uninteresting, same goes for the unlockable weapons.

I liked the idea behind the co-op exo-mode, but it turned out to be excruciating.
Singleplayer campaign turned out to be the most entertaining thing about this package, so if you're after a short, Michael Bay-style experience with virtual Kevin Spacey, the game could be a good purchase if you find a good deal on it (although Activision will never offer you a fair price)

Friends of previous CoD's might like the whole package, but for me it was the first and probably last COD I purchase.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
Could have been a great game.  Ruined by terrible matchmaking, horrible lag compensation, false promises of dedicated servers which won't ever happen, and unbalanced weapons.

When you luck out and manage to get matched up with a host with a good connection and with players that aren't complete noobs, the game has its good moments.  The new exo movement is a lot of fun.

I'm still hoping they'll add a dedicated server browser.  I'd love to play on a proper server with a regular group of people instead of with random unknowns and dodgy connections.  Until this happens, as was promised, I have to review this as a thumbs-down (especially since good hosts and skilled players are hard to find with match-making).

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
Multiplayer is unplayable with Peer2peer connections. The game feels out of sync all the time and if you watch other player's killcams you quickly get frustrated. Can't recommend without dedicated servers!

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
Great game to uninstall.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
This game is a huge waste of money with no support for PC.  Horrible lag, no dedicated servers, borken cut scenes on sp.  With not a word from SH or Activision about fixes or patches.  This is by far my bigges regret as a purchase.  It is too bad, because with the game works it is fun, fast paced, and exciting.  Too bad it is broken.

How can they charge for a game mode that has been in so many previous games? - Zombies.

And to make it worse, they let you launch in to zombies, only to tell you that you're only allowed to look at the menu unless you give them all of your money.

im done with this series, it all went downhill after cod 4, dont get me wrong, i liked black ops, but please, stop reviving this dead animal

why does this run so crappy on a i7, ssd, 12 gb ram and gtx970? fix your stuff, im done with this

Best description of this game:
take a crap, put it in a bag, write call of duty on the bag, ....this game

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
I Was so excited when i first saw this game on E3 ! iam a big fan of COD and love the CODMW       series
I felt something similar with both names because this time it is Advanced Warfare !
So i hope it will be best ,
but my all hopes went down with a big slap from  Sledgehammer Games -_-

STORY

It's VERY predicable, and has been seen so many times before (especially in Call of Duty). The cool characters(Cormack and Irons) die, while leaving the un-interesting, boring characters for the un-wanted sequel. The campaign is also more of the same, you follow an ally, shoot up the room, then follow him to another room and do the same Overall, The story is ok for me !

MULTIPLAYER

It feels like ever since Modern Warfare 2, they like to use the same formula, but implement in worse every time. A lot of the maps such as Defender, Greenband, Recovery, Solar, and Terrace don't even rely on map design, considering that people just jump over all of the buildings, hallways, entrances etc. It's more of the same, but done a lot worse.


Pros

+The villain of the game Jonathan Irons played by the Oscar winning actor Kevin Spacey
+Some action sequences
+Only stroy is worth a try ...

Cons

-No dedicated servers MP
-lame characters (expect Kevin )
-Everytime it feels like titanfall with COD name
-Shooting online gallery (i didnt feel its a military shooter for me )
-Cant find any players in other modes of mp (expect team deathmatch)
-Overpriced DLC"s and SP

Overall the CodAW is OK if u play only single player because of the
outstanding performance of Kevin spacy
Still COD  games are not just for story

TL;DR AT THE TOP FOR CONVINIENCE

TL;DR CoD: Advanced Warfare is surprisingly great. Pretty much everything I have to say about it is very positive, except for the matchmaking which at the moment at least seems like it's peer to peer so is quite unstable with a lot of spiking [I will update if it changes]. Also, Kevin Spacey.

Here are two first impression videos and a quick 2:30 summary" video

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
No dedicated servers is a big mistake. Peer2Peer cant keep up with the fast pace. Every game feels so out of sync (just as hit registration), especially when you watch killcams to find your killer in positions where he never was on your screen. It's just not fun to play when you get killed before you can see others, mw3 jokes all over again.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
Hackers are ruining yet another CoD. Now AW is about as bad and blatant as Ghosts. If you like the Campaigns then sure get it, but for MP not now .. so NO!

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
It's not ghosts, 10/10

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
I love this game!! I swear the campaign was just awesome almost everything was perfect for me.
The only BIG thing that millions of people have been waiting for was the multiplayer....
I mean the multiplayer itself is great but the fact that you have lag in every server is the reason why many people don't enjoy the multiplayer.
I expected to see dedicated servers just like a lot of people here.
Now we have to live with the stupid lags that make the game unpleasant and almost UNPLAYABLE.
Also for the people who have been waiting so long for the zombies they are disappointed since it will come in a DLC insteat of being available with the base game.
There are ofc some other things like the overpowered starting weapons but there are enough people compaining about it so i will leave it here.
A big title that is known for one of the best FPS shooter have made a powerful game but with serious problems that are still not fixed.
I hope that they will update this game ASAP because our patience is running out.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
As much as i like this game, i can't even freaking touch the multiplayer, i can only play single player, even though it's pretty good but i would like to try multiplayer without having the crappy error server message everytime. I can't recommend this game yet, till it gets fixed, there's still tons of lagg and all, unplayable at the moment, still waiting for them to fix the crappy game and make dedicated servers for us.

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare - Gold Edition
Before I start I just want to let people know that this is a review. That is a personal opinion that I have made based on my personal experience with this game. Under no circumstance should this accurately reflect another person's experience let alone your own. I strongly suggest you look at other reviews, gameplay, or to literally play the game yourself before you make a decision about buying this game or any other game for that matter.

Advanced Warfare tends to be a game that sounds and looks interesting but feels anything but when you really sit down and play it.

Starting with just how the game runs is frustrating. I've managed to get this game running consistent or at least consistent enough to be deemed playable but don't be surprised if you experience massive stuttering, hitching, or just down right low FPS. A lot of this is attributed to the fact that for some reason or another Sledgehammer decided to not cache their shaders and shadow maps by default. My recommendation is to select optimal video and turn on every caching option available. It solved most of my problems.

The single player campaign features an impressive cast of well skilled actors but all that is lost in the bad writing. I know its silly to nit pick in a game like Call of Duty but if you're going to higher skilled actors such as Troy Baker and Kevin Spacey the least you could do is have them in an as competent story that has some gaping plot holes, contradicting dialog, clichd themes, and just down right stupid silliness.

On the multiplayer end get ready for bad netcode as by default the game will search for matched using 800 ping as a basis for good" match quality. There is a work around for this but even after implementing it the lag compensation is just horrendous. I mean you weren't expecting dedicated servers were you?

As far as the game itself you will have that honeymoon period of "Oh Wow" just at the fact the exo movement system makes the game feel better at least in terms of movement over the pass Call of Dutys. Soon though you will realize that this essential breaks the whole three lane map system that Call of Duty is known for

The Bug Butcher
Summary:
Even in this time of indie games reviving game genres of old, the Pang genre hasn't exactly gotten a plethora of games. The Bug Butcher however does the genre proud, with its twitch gameplay doing its best to bring out the strengths of the genre. Great visuals complement action that forces you to keep shooting and killing, but being smart about it and not being reckless. While the game could use a little bit more variety for the long haul, what's there is extremely polished. Great performance plus loading times that are practically non-existent help in getting you right back in the action and keeping you there. It's a genre that gets to the basics, and The Bug Butcher is no exception to that. But small smart decisions regarding the gameplay helps make a game that kept me entertained throughout me playing it, and well worth the price point in question. Definitely a worthy successor in the genre, updated for the new age.

Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-8_5-Suh28

Lists:
+:
Tight twitch gameplay that keeps the action going. Takes me back to the old arcade days.
Solid controls that give you the right amount of control, and can allow you to be reckless and deal damage to yourself. That may sound weird to say, but part of the appeal of these games is the twitch gameplay, and consequences.
Strong aesthetic that complements gameplay. Great use of color choice to make action clear for the player.
Great performance, and minimal load times. How an arcade game should play.
Like the gravity mechanics with enemies and hitting them with your gun. It increases the skill ceiling especially with the combo multiplier.
Honestly, the game is probably under priced, even at it's full price. Feel like for the experience, you get your money's worth and then some.
-:
Do wish there was a little bit more variety in the long run. A couple more weapons, levels, and enemy types would have done wonders.
Feel like the upgrade system doesn't really do much other then add a bulletpoint feature to the game. Very basic.
I really can't put my finger on it, but something feels missing with the sound design. I didn't see a real difference in gameplay when turning the sound off, which is unusual for games like this. But I can't say WHAT is missing.

The Bug Butcher
Excellent competitive based shooter.

+ Cell shaded, well animated and colorful.
+ Well thought out mechanics with diverse gun and character power-ups.
+ Requires strategic thinking with hard to achieve score and combo based goals.
+ Good enemy variety with imaginative behaviors.
+ Single player and local coop wave based survival.
+ Arcade mode spanning 30 stages across 5 environments.
+ Steam integrated leader-boards, achievements and cloud saving.
+ Responsive developers.  Example; re-wrote the entire save system based on user feedback.

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

The Bug Butcher is a cool spin on the classic Pang genre with new school upgrades and boss monsters.

The game is currently in early access where i finished it in around 5 hours but for a good player they could do it much quicker. Hopefully with the full release they add more content as it is a highly addictive game which i completed in just a few sittings but left wanting for more still worth the price of admission if you loved the classic games of the genre.

The content after you finish the 30 missions is just going back to set global high scores which could be quite addictive but very much for the perfectionist. Im just hoping they add another 20 or so missions to flesh the game out.

Im gonna leave this short review here until it goes to full release where i will update it with a full fleshed review.

Even for early access it is well worth owning and playing id give my big thumbs up

The Bug Butcher
Remove the co-op" tag and keep the "local co-op" tag. Tyvm... Still a fun game

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

The Bug Butcher starts off as a tribute to 1989 bubble-dividing arcade game Pang, but quickly mutates into a turbo-charged, explosive twitch blaster.

On the surface it's simple - run horizontally, shoot vertically and blast everything before the time runs down. Shoot a large alien and it divides into two medium ones, shoot THEM and they divide again into two small ones. If you fail to mop up the smaller aliens, you become overwhelmed.

But as the game throws more types of alien at you, it becomes a game of tactics and timing. Can you dash under those five bouncing aliens to get to that crucial power-up? When do you set off the kill-everything homing missiles? Which alien is the priority kill?

Gameplay video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_sJdW4x58I

Soon enough the aliens require your every reaction to deal with. There's a roof-crawling ant thing that blasts down a vertical pole of lightning for several seconds at a time. There's a leaping facehugger that means instant death. And one plant-like thing slowly sucks up your NPC friend in the background and, if you don't kill the plant in time it'll fail you the level. And so on.

The cartoon art is excellent and funny. The alien pests are full of bug-eyed charm, explosions feel satisfying and your hero Harry gets all the best lines.

The levels are scored in a very Angry Birds three-star system. You can progress just for completing the level, but getting just one star does hurt and you'll want to try again. The key to high scores is keeping a chain of kills (ie combos) going without being hurt. Some levels you'll unlock new weapons and power-ups.

Every coin you collect on a completed level earns you coins that you can spend on permanently upgrading your character (weapon power, power-up strength, speed boost etc). Flipside, there's less incentive to keep plugging away for three-star ratings early on when you know your character can be much stronger after a few more levels.

The levels are split into groups of six, each group taking place in one location in the research facility. Six feels like a lot - by the fifth, it feels a bit this room AGAIN?!". But then the final level suddenly throws you into a confined elevator level

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

The developer said this game will have bugs.
I don't see any.

The Bug Butcher
The Bug Butcher is an action indie game with both singleplayer and co-op gameplay.
If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.

What is happening in the game:If you're similar with Pang or maybe Bubble Trouble, this is exactly the same type of game. You have to shoot the enemies that are bouncing around the room and the only direction you can shoot at is upwards. You play as The Butcher, who specialises in killing monsters in this exact same situation.

Pros:    Gameplay | It's always nice to see when somebody makes a remake of an old classic game, but these remakes are usually just counting on player's nostalgia, instead of making a genuinely good game. Fortunately, this is not the case in The Bug Butcher. The gameplay is smooth and works as well as it should. It doesn't change the principle it's based on, but enhances it.
Graphics | This game has a really nice colourful appearance that really makes this game stand out. I mean, just look at the Store page screenshots! All the effects look really nice, although they can get for a slight bit too confusing at times.
Weapons | There are different weapons in this game and you can also get a lot of upgrades and pickups that boost your performance, for example faster shooting. Variety plays a really important role in this remake.
Co-op | You can of course also play with your buddy, if you're having him in your home. There is also controller support, so you don't have to be cramped on the same keyboard.
Pricing | For such a nice game, I don't think $8 is a lot. It has hours and hours of gameplay, Steam Achievements and Leaderboards.
Stages | There are 30 story-based stages in different environments and there are also survival mission for both singleplayer and co-op modes. This is great if you want more fun after you completed the story missions.
Cons:    Controller Chaos | So, this game sometimes doesn't really let me play with my keyboard. The controls in game are always appearing as controller buttons, but in the options menu, everything is shown as keyboard buttons. This can be sometimes very confusing.
Learning Curve | Although this game is very easy to understand, it becomes too hard a little to quickly. But that is just my opinion.
The final verdict:This game is a really nice remake of old classic called Pang and it's really well-made. The graphics are awesome, there is even some story included. The confusion with controller/keyboard controls are the biggest problem in this game I see.
For its price, I think this game is definitely worth checking out as it offers quite a lot of fun.

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

In The Bug Butcher you take on a role of Harry, a intergalactical mercenary bug exterminator who has been given a task on planet Zoit to deal with an bug infestation in a research compound. You must clear the research lab of bugs in order to keep the scientists working there safe.

Graphic design and visuals could be defined as grose and cute at the same time. All enemies you encounter are unique in terms of how they look and what they do, wrapped up in a cartoonish colorful look.

Before long you are freezing, bursting, frying and lasering hordes of strange-looking alien bug-beasts, and it feels so damn satisfying. Gameplay evolves around a static and unchanging environment where enemies dodge, crawl, fly, smash, bounce and even give birth to smaller versions of themselves.

As you progress through the levels you will acquire more powerful weapons, upgrades and power-ups. You will also collect coins from bugs you slaughtered in order to upgrade your stats and equipment.

Soundtrack is absolutely amazing and I wouldnt be surprised if one day we get a soundtrack edition of the game.

The Bug Butcher is a fine example of a old-school style of gameplay with a lot of fun-factor involved. Although it lacks some verticality The Bug Butcher will make you spend hours on end progressing through the well designed and easy to look at lab slaughtering relentless hords of interesting and unique bug-like aliens.

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

A game about shooting bugs vertically. It gets pretty intense after the first few rounds, but I mean if your not here just to blandly grind off bugs moving in different ways than it's not the game for you. If you are, i'd recommend it, the game, for an early access is empty of bugs and runs very smoothly, it's quite well polished and has a nice soundtrack to happily blow the balls out of bugs.

The Bug Butcher
I want to start this review off by letting everyone know that I am by no means a professional reviewer, i'm just someone who really loves games, and I like to play indie gems from time to time.

Alright so going into this games I kept my expectations in check due to being burnt by other games in the past, but I figured for $8 why not? But to my great pleasure this game is FANTASTIC.

Graphically the game looks handrawn reminds me of games like Critter Crunch with the 2D art work, the bugs splatter, the blaster/power up effects look good, and the bugs themselves look really good for what it all is.

Gameplay wise it's fairly simple but challenging, the bugs bounce up and down across the screen and you're character runs across the same screen only allowed to vertically (up), now on paper this sounds fairly boring and standard, but when you consider other elements like; creatures breaking into smaller variations of themselves, some creatures shooting little beams that could hurt you, stage hazards and more, it adds variety and challenge to the gameplay all while you're trying to keep a combo meter and your high score rising in order to reach individual goals in each level.

It seems pretty simple but as i went on and was pushed to increase my combos and score I found myself becoming more agile and offensive in my appoarch against these bugs, as opposed to waiting for them to bounce and go on killing them, more often than not i would rush them before they even hit the ground once.

The audio in the solid as expected, the musical score isn't anything too blaring or annoying, and usually i'm too focused on keeping my combos up to really care about the music.

Finally the replayablity in this game is actually quite excellent, mroe often than not I found myself repeating levels to hit each of the goals with in the levels, and even switching to a harder mode to challenge myself...I failed to mention this earlier but I actually enjoy how the harder mode mixes up the enemy spawns as opposed to just being the same as the lower modes with more enemies.

All in all, I love this game, the moment I played the demo, closed it out, and kept coming back to it over and over again, I knew I had to buy it, I reccomend that you do the same :)

The Bug Butcher
This game is ridiculously addictive.  My wife and I can't stop playing it.  The general idea is kind of simple, but it's executed in a way that it's crazy fun for hours.  I played through the single player missions quickly, but now we keep playing the panic co-op to get better and better scores.

Personally, I've never been into competing for a high score, but this game just makes it impossible to resist.

The Bug Butcher
You remember PANG ?
Imagine it with:

- Perfect controls
- A lot of bugs instead of balls
- Extremely enjoyable combo system
- Cute, colored and detailed cartoon graphics & characters
- Power-ups, barriers and other stuffs
- Dash (fundamental for comboes)
- Weapons and ability upgrades

This is The Bug Butcher.

Great idea to reboot Pang gameplay.
One of the indie that you cant miss.

Suggested without any doubt !

7.4/10

The Bug Butcher
Has to be one of the coolest, funnest games i've played. Definitely in my favourite games of all time even though i only got it recently :P One of the best things about Bug Butcher is that not only it is fun to play, but it is also super fun to watch! I highly recommend this game! Co-op is the best!

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

Alien bugs - Terrifying menace or cute.... nah, I got nothin!



Pros

Sweet futurist guns!

Evil bugs from hell! So many variations!

Hard mode that makes you want to pull your hair out - yes, that IS a good thing!

There are more game modes coming!! Feels complete already so yay for extra stuff!

Conversations between The Bug Butcher and the survivor!

Powerups, powerups everywhere! So many, so cool, so many ways to butcher!

Art style. Game looks beautful!



Cons

Lemme know if you find any, game is solid in my opinion.

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

Great game, very addictive and challenging.

The Bug Butcher
Game based on the successful formula of Pang, enriched by a lovely graphic style and good soundtrack.
The single player mode is based mainly on a campaign divided into missions whose plot and dialogues though simple and minimal are still funny and humorous and well suited to the aforementioned art style.
The package is completed by an arcade mode, even in this case single player, and the co-op offline however I haven't yet tested.

Controls are good.

That is indeed Awfully Nice".
The game reminds me of an retro game titled "Dig Dug" that got the same mode for this type of gameplay.
The gameplay is simple

Pang lives...

The Bug Butcher
Finished Arcade mode in 3 Hours, 3hours of insanity I must admit! Such fun! Let me start off by saying that I rarely ever sit through a game, I have a very short attention span, but I found myself constantly grinding out wave after wave thanks to the fun gameplay, great graphics, and fun soundtrack! The dialogue between the bug butcher and the scientist is really funny, a nice touch of course. The game play is super easy to get the hang of and there is a degree of skill to be achieved while playing (knowing when to use powerups and so forth). This really is a great game if you're into this genre and I would deffo recommend it! The Devs are very active in the community and they role out updates often to fix issues players are having (though I didn't run into a single one playing it all yesterday, minus the achievement bug, but that's fixed with the new update and I got all my achievements when launching the game yusss).

So, in conclusion, I would urge you guys to try this game, there's a 20% discount now so grab it and support these great devs, they deserve it, the game is absolutely addictive too! (Level 30 is insane, you have been warned)!


The Bug Butcher
10/10 - Bug Butcher is fantastically beautiful, extremely fun, such a perfect successor of Super Pang and absolutely deserves more love. Great job Awfully Nice team, looking forward to see more games from you guys!

Great design and animation
Lots of unique enemies

Elementary school humorCONS:
No online coop

Now this is a great game. Remake of a very fun game Pang, only better. Fast paced, rewarding, nice graphics, tight controls. Real Gem among the crap that pop ups on Steam. Buy it, enjoy it, slay them bugs!

Awesome game =D

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

Absolutely incredible, the game design, the gameplay, the music, everything. I can not fault this game in one way or another, it has ticked all of my boxes. Anyone who wants a little bit of a challenge purchase this game, you can tell the developers worked hard on it. Maybe not for those looking for an in-detail story-line, but an extremely intense, exciting game. I've never been happier with a purchase.

The Bug Butcher

The audio and visual design for this game is all beautiful. The controls are tight and responsive, as they should be. I definitely insist to anyone reading this that they give the game a try.

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

Bug Butcher is a good-to-pick-up indie game with awesome graphics and a humor that you know from games such as Castle Crashers or Battleblock Theater. It's the developer's first game, but it is still amazing! So far are 18 levels full of action released, but there are more of them, a multiplayer and a survival mode to come

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

Nice art asthetic. Great catchy booming music that gets you going. The Alien blasting maddness is fun, inducing adrenaline fueled excitement. I am a huge fan of super pang, I played a ton of it as a youth so this was a no-brainer for me and so far I am digging it. I had forgotten all about that game but now that it's here I wonder how I ever forgot. Been a while since I have felt this nostalgic.

My biggest complaint is that there is no co-op multiplayer local or online. If it had either of those things I would be satisfied but I guess I will have to settle for versus when it comes out.

YEAH, the more I play the more I want to play. It's just so much fun. and boy was I not kidding about dat music. I kept wondering what song was in my head thinking it was some of my music but it turned out to be the song playing in the main menu.

FINALLY ANOTHER ENTICING INDY TITLE WITH BEAUTIFUL GRAFX AND FRESH GAMEPLAY!
I just played the game for a bit over three hours straight until my fingers started to hurt. Let me say this: Normally I'm not a big fan of 2D platformers, but this title got me hooked from start to the last level of the current beta!

It has been a while since an early access indy title caught my attention. Last time it was The Darkest Dungeon". In therms of level of polish this title reminds me a lot of the latter. But let's go into more detail:

THE PROS:
Purely amazing grafics! I just LOVE the style of the characters

If you loved Pang, you will also love Bug Butcher.

Funny game ^^

The Bug Butcher
I really enjoy the style and basic controls of the game. It is one of those games that I can just sit back and casually play after a stressful day or just whenever I feel like messing around. 10/10

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

The best part of this homage to the Pang/Buster Bros. arcade games is the enemy who turns into an  and farts out smaller enemies.  The game is pretty short, but its Early Access and has other modes and hopefully a longer story planned.

Full Video Review and Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqEnDcJaT-4

One of the best indie games I've played in a while! I don't usually play action shooters, but I couldn't put this one down.

Pros
- Easy to learn, difficult to master
- Great risk/reward balance
- Highly addictive with lots of replayability
- Amazing flash-style animation (reminds me of carbot)

Cons
- I wish there were more upgrades
- I'm drawing a blank

Just buy it! I promise you won't regret it

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

The Bug Butcher is a fast paced action shooter with many hardcore weapons and special abilitys to kill aliens either with keyboard or controller vertically in increasingly challenging levels.

The Bug Butcher should be named The Bug struggle"

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

It's Pang! Just that with a few twists like a bit of story and less varied locations (for now). The controls are responsive, the graphics look good and the soundtrack fits. Already very entertaining and it's still in early access, so it'll only get better! If you like Pang, it's worth a look right now for 10$, otherwise wait for a sale and get it then :)

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

Great game, very addictive and challenging. The visual is charming and the music is great. Gameplay is inspired by the classic arcade shooter Buster Bros/Pang where you shoot vertically against swarms of enemies that bounce around.

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

It's really hard to recommend this game. There are external problems and minor annoyances (menu isn't that user friendly with a controller) that would prevent me from recommending this game. However looking past these problems and only considering the quality of the game itself (in particular the graphics and the gameplay), I can do nothing else than recommend this game.

It's a very beautiful game, it runs smooth and the animations are great. I haven't had any performance isssues and it runs at a smooth 60 fps. The core gameplay is very solid. It's a vertical shooter where you have to defeat wave of increasingly harder (and different) enemies. It's easy to get in a great flow and there is enough of a challenge to keep you entertained.

So why is it really hard to recommend this game? The developers say the game has 30 levels (although only 18 are available in Early Access) and though it's technically accurate, it isn't really true. The real levels are called floors, of which there are only five. This results in very repetitive environments. The things the developer calls levels is just increasing the number of enemies (or adding another type) after a series of waves (four or five waves per level). This means there is a severe lack in content. In Early Access this is even worse.

A lack of content doesn't have to be a bad thing (if the quality is good, which is the case), but the game has to be priced accordingly. This however isn't the case. The price of the game is way too high. The developer even says they plan to increase the price of the game after Early Access. This would be a grave mistake. Even with the planned features it simply isn't worth  9,99, not even by a long shot. This is a game that shouldn't be priced above  4,99. I wouldn't even consider buying the game at  9,99. If by mistake I did buy it, I would have asked for a refund based on the lack of content. I don't think I'm alone in this and the developers should really consider this. It would be a real shame this game would fail, because the developer didn't understand the value of the game. It shouldn't fail based on quality, but it will fail if the price isn't lowered.

TLDR:

- Should you buy the game in Early Access: No
- Should you buy the game for  9,99: No
- Is the game worth playing: Yes
- Should you buy the game if has a lower price (4,99 or below): Yes

FULL DISCLOSURE: I have recieved this game for free from the developer.

Simple arcade shooter. Shoot, grab power-ups, avoid enemies, make combos.
Nice 2D graphics. The biggest downside is framerate drops.

The Bug Butcher
Early Access Review

WOW this game is a big wow for me. Seriously The Bug Butcher is one darn fun game with very solid controls, also can get challenging really fast. The art style is very nice and clean, every enemy was adorable, colourful and bright. Really is a must play for anyone who enjoys unique Shoot 'Em Up games.

Even in early access this game has the potential to be a great title. You will want to keep an eye on this one as it develops!

Playthrough 3 - business student. I didnt give a  about her either, and now in 2015, I am making a $486,000+ net gain (including annual salary, my stocks and assets) as I work in downtown Seattle. I am married with 2 kids (1 more on the way) with a beautiful wife who actually shows me some love. My house is 5,000 sq feet two floor home;

Last I heard, emily was a drunken mess. Brad or travis whatever that 's name is.. well he and her are white trash. She didnt get through school. She lives out in kansas now, working at some fast food joint. They're on welfare and i think do meth even.

Time is the longest distance between two places.  Tennessee Williams, The Glass Menagerie

Uhm... I have complicated feelings about this game" nonetheless. Yes

Emily is Away
thanks 4 the depression.

Emily is Away
This game actually  me off.
No matter what way you try to put it, Emily is actually emotionally abusive. Like seriously, she guilt trips and gaslights you, both of which are forms of emotional abuse. Yet the game tries to guide you towards appeasing her and acts like she's the one in the right. I ing hate that. It makes me feel like a  for doing absolutely nothing wrong.
Go to the party at the beginning of the game? You get cucked by Brad.
Don't go, and tell her to not talk to Brad? You get cucked by Travis anyway. Both of whom are jerks to her.
You try to get into a relationship and try to be as nice as you can? She acts like you're a complete creeper and wanted nothing more than to have sex with her, she's weirded out by you.
Act like just a friend? She gets all weird on you asking why you didn't come on to her.
Call all of her friends out? She just laughs in your face.
Be a  back to her? She stops talking to you. And that's what you want. You don't want her to talk to you, because she's a genuinely terrible human being.
On top of that, the main character is a ing cucklord and I hate him, he missed his chance of getting with the decent girl because of his dumb obsession with Emily.
I'm not really for a game that's supposed to have moral choices but you can do nothing but wrong because the character who the choices are aimed towards is an insufferable, volatile .

If your choices meant something, and Emily wasn't a completely horrible person, it'd be a neat concept. I like the whole idea of a visual novel-esque game set on an early IM chat interface. It's a neat idea. But being honest? dont take it personally babe it just aint your story" did a similar thing and did it better because your choices actually MEANT something. And if you complain about Emily being a more realistic character than anyone in that games

Emily is Away
Before I talk about the ending I just want to say:

The chatlogs that happen is pretty realistic, feels nostalgia in a way as when leaving school, I had friends that I grew apart from because we never saw each other anymore and thats what this game feels like. It makes for an interesting playthrough (only 1 though) if you used AOL or MSN when you were younger.

PLAYTHROUGH 1:

I was pretty amazed not going to lie, the game felt almost real to me because I felt like I was having conversations like this when I was younger. Obviously when you're younger you say things without thinking of the meaning, so I played the game in the mind set of going through college and became more harsher as it went on. This pays off because I thought the ending was pretty realistic to my choices. So I tried again this time doing everything I thought Emily wanted to hear:

PLAYTHROUGH 2:

This is where I started to see a problem, my choices didn't make a difference to the outcome of the ending. Emily still got with Brad, my character is still the beta idiot he was in the other playthrough. I was hoping the game would be different in some way so I played it a final time:

PLAYTHROUGH 3:

I was a complete  to Emily during this playthrough and first major choice is I didn't go to the party in the first year. This changed the story a tiny bit as Emily now dates Travis which is whatever. So I thought this playthrough I would get with Emma. It's going well I get to the final chapter and to my disappointment the ending still didn't change. Even to the point where I thought he would get with Emma, he didn't in the 3 YEARS he could have got with her. He did nothing which generally got me mad because this is meant to be an interactive story" where none of your choices matter

Emily is Away
How to get the best ending:

Step 1
Don't play last chapter. ( ;  ;)

Step 2
Uninstall

Step 3
Cry profusely

Emily is Away
I friendzoned Emily around every corner, and became a successful businessman.
The game forbade me from being with my real crush - Emma, but i don't buy it.
I'm pretty sure we bonked once or twice offscreen. I bet that my character went to buy flowers, chocolates, and roofies right after saying goodbye. Gotta go and apologize to Emma for making her wait too long".
Well i'm awfully sorry that i only exist ONCE A YEAR in this quantum continuum

Finally after years of training online and offline, Hours of guides, Hours of grinding, Suffering. Regret always in the back of my mind for the time wasted on this. It has officially happened. I am a master hacker. Rushing through the logs deleting with the percision of a scalpel, never wasting a moment dedicated to filling my billion dollar bank account with more money. Trying to simulate the initial rush of robbing a bank. I rush in with a bounce network all around the world starting with InterNIC. I quickly start up my timer and turn on the proxy and firewall Disable tools. Brute force but neccesary for speed. It shuts off and I run the admin account I had stolen from early contacts. I'm in I copy all the accounts down, I find the prize i'm looking for. Killian Hoyal, a 967 million dollar account, a legend hidden inside of my personal gameworld. It had taken years of searching and doing favors to gain the proper knowledge to find this account. Quickly I delete disconnect from the server and rush into my log database at InterNIC, deleting all traces of my connection. Yes, I had finally found everything I would need to stage the largest bank robbery in the history of the world. From the comfort of my home. I go and make an anonymous bank account under a pseudonym. The bank is small so it wouldn't be a high priority target to search if the FBI caught onto my trail. Finally I take a deep breath, 4 minutes 11 seconds says my timer. Wasting no time I quickly connect to the bank where Killian Hoyals money is kept. Running bypasses, disablers, and all manners of illicit software designed to slow down any one looking for me, and to make sure I don't leave a trace. I log into his account using the details I found from the admin account. I go into transfer funds and make the trade to my bank account in Monrovia, Liberia. The transfer goes through. I go into his transaction logs and edit the log showing the money was sent to another hackers that had previously done me harm earlier on. I disconnect and reconnect to my account in Liberia. The money is there, perfect. I go into my transaction logs and delete the log showing the money recieved. Almost done, I connect to my home bounce and log into the logs. I delete the log showing me connecting to the banks in the first place. Just like that, his money is mine with no trace to be found of it. A job well done, I am officially. A master hacker.

All I know about real-life hacking is that it looks incredibly boring. It's all command prompts and IP addresses. Who wants to type in hexadecimal? Ew. It's nothing like TV hacking, where you are a magical techno-wizard that's all about throwing programs like spells and racing the clock in a dramatic race against the significantly less attractive system administrator.

Uplink is TV Hacking: The Game.

Uplink
This game is old, showing its age, and may not be supported on future operating systems well. As an example, the IRC program inside doesn't run well with current IRC security protocols (it /does/ connect to real servers.)

But that doesn't mean this is a hell of a good game and still pretty much one of a kind.

This game takes inspiration from Hollywood hacking and turns it into an excellent simulation of such. A sandbox roguelike of sorts, you need wits, some planning, and a little luck to become rich, powerful, and save the internet from some bad guys that feel it's time to unplug everything.

I believe Introversion could make a new Uplink with the skills they've gained from the games they've created since 2001, and release something truly golden. The market for hacking simulations is pretty much dominated by this decade old game, something more 21st century would most definitely be a hit.

Until then, enjoy Uplink, and good luck on the net.

Uplink
This is really everything I wanted from an indie hacking game. It is a vast and glorious sandbox brimming with opportunity. To tell its tale, let me start the story about twenty-five years ago, with a little gem from Interplay called Neuromancer."

Neuromancer was an amazing piece of work

Uplink
Text-based

Made in 2001

Still a better hacking game than Watch_Dogs.

11/10 Would work as Uplink agent again

Uplink
Uplink. Where do I start?
Its got such great game-play; it was inspired by Hollywood hacking scenes where the character or antagonist rapidly types at keys in vain hope to cause lots of damage. And given its base, it fulfils it well. It has high passed action scenes where youre screaming at your screen to rapidly crack the password while trying not to get caught. Who says that you need the latest 3D graphics to engage someone in a game? I mean yes Battlefield 4 looks pretty but it will never be able to tell a story like Thomas Was Alone. If you can look beyond the dated graphics then youll see a great game. I think it was such a great first game for Introversion and cant wait to see how Prison Architect turns out to be!
Overall, I think that everyone should give this classic ago, grab it while its on offer. Itll be a decision that you wont regret, trust me.

Probably THE best full-hacking experience available in video game form.
Encompasses what you would expect from Hollywood-style hacking, simple and accessible enough where playing it isn't a chore, but still challenging and interesting enough to have you hooked for countless hours, and you're sure to play the game from the beginning many times.

The main story is actually quite engrossing too, it kicks in after about an in-game week of freelance hacking, and not all is what it seems.

The game is entirely text and 2D graphics based, so even though it's from 2001, it doesn't suffer for it, it looks just as fine as it did the day it was released.

No other game, past or present, has captured hacking in video game form better than this game. If you've admired hacking in Hollywood movies and want a tense gaming experience mimicking that, chances are you've already played and loved this game. But if by chance you haven't, pick it up immediately.

Uplink
Uplink sets itself up like a modified computer desktop, and casts you as a wannabe hacker. From your terminal you'll receive missions, install new software, and try to sneak undetected into the digital infrastructures of some made up mega-corps.If you want to get in and out undetected you'll need to bounce your connection around the world, crack passwords with decryption programs, and delete any trace you've left of your time stealing business secrets and changing personal information.The game hides its mechanics behind a veil of realism. There's no pause button, and plenty of typing, emails to read, and bank accounts to create and manage.In fact, if you turn off the techno soundtrack it's easy to pretend you really are a movie hacker, diving through firewalls as you try and pull off the perfect digital heist from the comfort of your tablet.The game punishes mistakes with swift retribution, and the fictional company that you're working for is quick to disavow your actions and kick you back to the bottom of the pile if you're caught poking your nose somewhere it doesn't belong.Watching a trace creep ever closer to your location can turn even the simplest of hacks into a frantic race against time. The problem is that those moments of real tension are few and far between, and more often than not you'll complete a job without batting an eyelid. Things get repetitive, too, and while you'll unlock new hacking methods as you progress the back doors you use to sneak into systems are always basically the same.Uplink is clearly a labour of love, and if you enjoyed the original you'll feel the same about this version, but newcomers will likely find the slow pace and esoteric style a little off-putting.

Uplink
*Real Events*

I sit back in my chair as the Database swiftly searches through the profiles counting from A-Z, as I wait patiently I reminise about the time where I was a mere novice, slowly cracking passwords and deleting logs yet here I am, a millionairre with the best equipment money can buy. When the database stops on the name I check my email and do as requested and when I am done I confirm it and reply. I wait for confirmation before disconnecting and deleting my logs just incase there was a spelling error. The email comes as expected so I disconnect and proceed to delete my logs from INTERNIC, I connect, select admin, choose the passwor- and then everything goes black. My heart stops, what happened? Has the game frozen? Did I press the windows key? No my hand was only on my mouse it's impossible but then wh- and it hits me harder than a brick to the back of the head. It was over, atleast that's how it seemed but that was impossible, I deleted my logs, there was no trace or proof what was going on?! I frantically waited for what seemed like hours as I stared at my own reflection awaiting the inveitable...It was over, my gateway terminated, I had failed. All the time spent learning and perfecting my skills wasted all because I had forgotton 1 log or at the expense of just my gateway turning on my motion sensor.

10/10 Would become millionairre and then lose it all because I'm an idiot again.

Do you still marathon all the episodes of Reboot on occasion?

Have you ever wanted to be the hacker 4 c h a n ?

THEN GET THIS GAME!!!

This is be best 1337 H4X0R simulator you will ever find.  It's realistic enough and uses enough real-life terms to make you feel as if you could totally hack someone's computer if you went out and bought the right software, totally bro, I mean you already did it in Uplink.

Bad side is that it's one of those games where it's possible to miss the trigger for the storyline, and if that happens, the story just kinda goes on without you....

Also, sometimes the game kind of just expects you to know stuff - like where and which logs to delete so you don't get caught by the feds for a job you completed 3 days ago......

Also the game can get really repetative really quickly.....

But then you hack into a LAN system and you have to bypass the Proxy and brute-force crack the password so you can trace throught the system to unlock the file server locks and hack into the mainframe database! <- I didn't even make any of that up, you actually do that in this game.

Get dis.

Uplink
Uplink is a mostly text based game released in 2001. This cyberpunk title is set the near future, the year 2010, and hackers slither around the interwebs. You play as a hacker working for Uplink Corporation, a company that offers illegal hacker services to others.

The aim of the game is to climb up the hacker fame ladder and make cash. You do so by completing contracts, making relationships with others and upgrading your software, hardware and gateway. All together, it feels like a shadowrun type of game.

You're breaking into the Knight Tech" computer network. Your mission is to locate and destroy a file. You gain access to the file storage system and your proxies fail

Uplink
I think I could probably rob a bank right now. Very addictive. Easy to learn, hard to master

Uplink
A fantastic game. I was so immersed into hacking that I had a mini heart attack when my mother called me on skype, thought the bank traced me.

Uplink
Warning: This game does not teach you how to do real life cyber-crime. Steal from your local bank at your own risk.

Uplink
Still the best Arcade/Sim Hacking game you can get.

You start as an normal Hacker with low equip but after some time you get more and more randomised missions with a higher payment. And who knows? Maybe you will hack the Governmant or your boss to add more money to your account? This is a pure sandbox-joy. But beware: If they get you, everything is lost. Like for real. Perma-Death. Start again. Noob.

Get it if you are interested in a dark (some sort of)-RPG (-> you can upgrade your hardware) Hacking game.

Worked as a hacker for infamous hacker agent corporation, hacked into their system itself, stole personal info of all other hackers, and made them got arrested by FBI. Several months later, got arrested on the accusation of spreading dangerous computer virus on the internet. I regret nothing.

Uplink
Fun to learn and exhilerating to master.  One of those games that forces the player to break into the 'fun'.

This game is very interesting. You work as an agent for a company that basically hacks into other folks' computers/servers to do a variety of tasks that you accept to earn money to upgrade your hacking capabilities. While the concept is fun, it does get tedious. Having to bounce your connection from many different places, disconnecting and connecting to the main server, and repeated assignment types get old pretty quickly. However, if you can get past that, then you have found yourself a little gem of a game. 8/10

More seriously, it is a fun game which is about hacking, and only hacking. It does a better job at it than any other game I've seen so far, so it gets an A+ in my scrapbook. Would be quite nice to get a remake with more game mechanics, but that is just wishing.

Easy to learn, very, very hard to master. In this realistic hacking game (yes, that exists), you will probably lose at least three or four times before you even reach the top-10 list (you start at 20-something). Then you'll lose again because you forgot to delete you logs properly that *one* time.

This game's fun is not about the excitment of hacking into secure systems and performing movie-geek-like feats. Most of the hacking is done by automated scripts, and your sole job is to make sure you don't get caught.
That's where the fun lies. Being methodical, precise and never allowing yourself to make a single mistake. Give the feds a single opening, and they'll be on you faster than you can say 

Uplink
hands down my favorite game of all time. hacking like it's an 80s movie

Uplink
I enjoyed Uplink very much, and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hacking simulator. [*NOTE: This is not a command prompt hacker, like other games, it's a simple, yet comlicated, easy to use, hard to master, point and click.]

You start off by registering as an Uplink" agent. Fancy words for freelance hacker. You select a Gateway

Uplink
Uplink is a surprisingly fun game that you can play over and over again.  The learning curve is pretty steep and will require some online research in order to understand and play the game properly.  The text is also hard to read and strains the eyes over time.  This is probably due to that fact that it is a 13 year old game and isn't properly optimized for HD monitors.  Anyways, outside of that, it is a very well thought out game that actually becomes a little addicting.  The storyline has a few different endings and you can decide to play along or ignore them all together.  The HUD and music are extremely dated which adds to the whole experience in such a great way.  For the age of the game though, I think that $10 is a little too expensive.  It is most definitely worth a buy if you can find it on sale.

Well, pretty much another hackin' game w/o too much cmd line hassle. Though it's not the way I want it (you know, more cmd thing = more zhuangbility[www.urbandictionary.com]) but still pretty nice done a game, in comparision to Hacker Evo series... The tutorial was made for human comprehension, and the difficulty was well adapted to each lvl. No major bug was found, which IS a plus nowadays (sigh). Can really make you nervous at times though, esp when you hear the Trace Tracker beeping while you're hacking... Good for killing times and, well, learning NSA essential concepts :P

Hacker pls no."  10/10 - Ilurminoty Sacret Base"

Uplink
Unique hacking game by Introversion Software, which currently are the developers of Prison Architect.
Uplink was released more than a decade ago, yet it aged well.
In the game you're a hacker working for Uplink, a company which employs hackers (agents) providing them with remote gateways, which they connect from their personal computers.
You are one of those agents.

The goal is to hack your way into richness, so you can buy the best software and hardware available, and eventually you will receive e-mails offering special missions, which is the plot.

The bad parts is that figuring out how to play the game and hack advanced systems (like Banks, Mainframes and Lans) is a lot of fun, but doesn't offer much replayability once you've got everything figured out. This results in a repetitive feeling. Plus, the plot and it's results are a shallow, leaving the player wanting for more.
It is, still, a great game.

Unfortunately, the developers didn't make a sequel (even though they had planned it), but it's a game you won't forget after you play it.

Uplink
Hacking simulation are an entirely different breed all together. They stand apart from your typical simulation of any other kind (to the extent of my knowledge, which is mostly shooters). It's certainly a game for the more analytically minded people or for someone who is looking for something ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from the rest of the crowd. It can be a bit tedious at times because there's a lot to worry about in order to succeed.

DO NOT BE FOOLED. This is not a game full of hacking minigames that you're used to seeing in many other larger titles. It is NOT a guide the virus ship thru wave of attacking enemies" game. It's build a rig

Uplink
This is a really great hacking game, by the makers of Defcon and Prison Architect. Great tension and ideas. You take contracts for stealing, sabotaging or deleting data in rival companies of the contract givers.
Hacking quickly while trying to escape opposition tracers from getting back to you generates a nice tension.
Buy this game!

Uplink
This game is phenomenal. It is minimalist, dynamic, and incredibly fun. The only weak point is the repetition, but otherwise it does not have a major flaw. 10/10

Uplink
Classic game. Was really happy this made it's way to steam after such a long time floating around on the web. Most people, if you're used to console commands, shouldn't have an issue using the more advanced" features of this game. Pretty straight forward/fast. Not much else to say really. If you're looking for a masterpiece of graphics

Uplink
Fun but stressful, If you're able to handle it, you might just like it.
From the developers of Prison architect, comes this fun little movie-hacker centric game that pits you against the world in a game of intellectual property cat and mouse, completing contract work for those who want to one up their competitors, or just screw them over.

If you want to exercise your skills of being a world renowned hacker (Without the cops kicking down your actual door) you should definitely give this game some play time.

Uplink
PC Version:
The game is brilliant.
You live in a distant future, able to own a Gateway.
Gateway is a hacking dedicated hi tech machine.
You connect to a special company interface and the fun begins.

It isn't for everyone though. You have to dig a little to learn how to play.
It has a tutorial of course, but you have to lose some times before learning how to turn the bank system into your bit-ch.
On the other hand, after learning your how to do stuff, you can start a new game at any time, play a little, get some credits, buy the essentials and then do it again. Hacking banks early actually speeds up the game.
What else do you wanna do as a hired hacker in this game?
Maybe steal or desrtroy data?
Change academic grades and titles for someone?
Maybe incriminate someone, or clear criminal records?
How about get involved into the virus vs anti-virus global battle?
The game has an ongoing story. Keep reading the news. Better yet be part of the news.

This game with its simple interface worth your attention.

Only if you  run Steam on Windows.
The game crashes on start in Linux. What the heck guys?

I first played this game on GameFly.com when they did the unlimited PC play, so the number of hours i played it is off. But, on to the review of Uplink. Uplink is THE hacking" game (all others are compared to it)

Uplink
I really love this game. It's the definitive hacking sim out there, a little worn by time but still a tried and true classic.
It's a little expensive at full price, but when it's on sale it goes for around $1, if I remember correctly.
When it's at that price, it's an absolute must-have.

Uplink
You play as a script kiddie in a world of hollywood hacking where a 60GHz processor is considered  slow  and the passowrd cracker looks like a slot machine. You can hack an international corperation as soon as you boot up the game, and there is only one government. And also egfbsj" is a word in the dictionary."

Nothing will ever be more frustrating than pouring thousands upon thousands of dollars into software and hardware, setting up a perfect log-deleting system, creating a flawless networking path, and losing the whole f*cking thing because  you forgot to change your time acceleration speed from super fast to normal.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
If you're into the penny-arcade humor, characters and comic strips then this game will be a very fun and hilarious ride. It takes about 6-7 hours to complete on normal difficulty and the game progression is pretty linear. The story is very penny-arcade in fashion so don't expect anything logical happening at all. That's actually where half the fun is.

The combat is turn-based but you need to press buttons in right sequences or pump them up in order to deal heavy special attack damage. It's a pretty fun albeit shallow combat system to be honest for the amount of game we have here. You can also use simple buff items and traps.

Other than that, not much else to experience here. You can beat the game on a harder difficulty or try to hunt all the achievements but a short, sweet game nonetheless for PA fans.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Blends arcane horror and Penny Arcade humor into an adventure game/old-school RPG with active-time battles and rhythm minigame supermoves.  The world of Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness is fascinating, the story is unique, and the game is usually fun, but it has a few difficulty spikes and it's easy to slip up and lock yourself out of endgame bonuses.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Do you want to play a fun RPG? Then Penny Arcade Adventure is the game for you.
This game it's just great from the beginning: you can create you own character that will actually appear in the comic-cutscenes, and for most of the game you have do deal with fruit-ing robots, mimes and clowns. And your only weapon is a rake. Yea.

The story is  amazing and fun, the drawings and the art-style it's really good looking, and each character haves his own personality, expecially the ones that will escort you.

The animations are nice looking, sadly they didn't really made a lot of them, same for NPC civilians moving around the city, so some npc might look like duplicated dools staying here doing nothing.

The combat sisteam is kinda unique: it's a classic RPG combat like MarioRPG or Final Fantasy, but with some sort of quicktime event that you'll have to do to block incoming attack or to make your special move way more powerful. The items sistem is unique too: did you know that slot balm make you more slow? Me neither.

Final Score: 8/10

It's fun, it's cheap, it's amazing. Get it.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
The story was unusual, but in the end it didn't feel very thrilling nor important. The storytelling, on the other hand, was gold; filled with random, dark humor and countless profanities thrown out casually.

The gameplay is JRPG-style, *without* random encounters and with great Active Time Battle-like system.

There are three difficulty options, but the hardest one is not too difficult.

The graphic was okay, comic-style. The high" visual setting wasn't well optimized

If you enjoy Penny Arcade webcomic - you will laugh playing this game.
Pretty fun adventure RPG.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a great title all-round. Featuring humorously witty dialog episode one has plenty of laughs in store for you, but what can you expect when it's based on the webcomic Penny Arcade[www.penny-arcade.com]. Not only does it tell you a story in a humorous fashion, the story itself sets you off on a grand adventure of whimsical proportions and mysterious intrigue. To top it off it has one of the most fun real-time turn-based battle systems which has more involvement than just waiting for cooldowns. Seriously buy this game and the second episode too.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Hothead Games did a really good job with PoD 1 & 2. There's alot of fun packed in this episodes, even if you dislike Penny Arcade's very premature humor (like I do)! Prepare for the coolest mixture of Action Adventure and RPG!


Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
This  is not a bad game and it's good in order to spend four hours, but I would suggest to buy it on sale or with some bundle as 8  is too much for it.
The story is fun and also the locations are well drawn, anyway I can't define it a GDR.
The three players advance on a rail, no point to change stats, only one equipment with fixed upgrades, no real customization and it doesn't matter what dialog you choose as it doesn't change the results. In the end I can't catch how someone could call it GDR

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Just like a really okay RPG with a coat of Penny Arcade paint. Writing is good, but you'll spend more time fighting the same five enemies over and over again than laughing at its wit. Pick it up cheap if you're interested at all.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Personal Rating: Boring and Repetitive
Classic Rating: 

I haven't played much and i think i won't play more.
I have unlocked four areas, completed 2 as far as i can tell and the game is truly boring because of the repetitive gameplay: the only things you do are clicking to fight and read dialogues" and "pressing the spacebar to block attacks and do special attacks".. it's a two inputs game

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
As someone who was once a fan of Penny Arcade but who has no enthusiasm for it at time of playing, I believe I am in a good position to say that this just isn't a good game.

The game is too short and confined.  You visit only 3 meaningful locales multiple times, and those locales are uninteresting.
Combat is QTE-reaction based for the most part.  It works okay, but some QTEs are very easy and some are not so enemies are trivialized or a nuissance based purely on this.  Thematics for enemies work fine though, they were creative for the most part (aside from fruit er who is more or less just a meme).  You find items and upgrades but they aren't very rewarding because the scale of the game is too short.  The formula of the mechanics just doesn't appeal here.
The world has lots of text descriptions attached to objects in it, but they're all meaningless nonsense weirdness.  Sort of a mix of Hitchhiker's Guide with Jerry Holkins normal melancholy / grandiose style.  It doesn't grate on me, but its still meaningless.  Personally I just don't find his style all that appealing.
The thematic of the game... its just Penny Arcade memes with a game as a shell.  I don't mind it, its just not going to be enjoyable if you aren't really into Holkin's writing or a PA fan.  I bought this and the other games quite a few years ago, maybe back then I would have felt the appeal more.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Great fun.  Not exactly advancing the genre in any way, but it's hugely amusing and very Penny Arcade.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
A simple and fun RPG that is very enjoyable due to gameplay and dialogue, but very short.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Has it really been 4 years since this came out? As a PA fan, I am fail... oh well, better late than never. I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it ended up being pretty good - not perfect, but satisfying enough for the price and length (5-6 hours). OtRSPoD is an interactive story wearing the clothes of a real-time turn-based RPG. What I mean is that there are never really any choices to make or side quests to take on, like you'd find in a typical RPG. From beginning to end, everything you do is part of a linear path (including a finite number of battles that leave your characters at their max level with full upgrades when completed). That said, I still found it fun, as the battle system was pretty cool. And if you are a fan if PA, you will also love the humorous story/interactions with Gabe & Tycho. It's a short ride and there's not much to it, but as you're slaughtering fruit-ers, hobos, clowns and mimes, you'll probably be too entertained to notice any of its shortcomings.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
A fun game with turn-based combat, but not as fun or funny as I expected.  Beautiful artwork, but not much voice-over, mostly text conversations.  I finished the game and will eventually play episode 2, but I'm not rushing to do it.  There is crude humor in here, so not for kids.

Penny Arcade Adventures: Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a rather simplified RPG. It's main selling point however, is in the dialogue where Gabe and Tycho throw witty banter at one another almost like the online comic strip.

Pros:
Plentiful combat items
Custom character comes to life both 2D and 3D
Witty writing

Cons:
Simplifed RPG


Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
This game is so underrated. It's hilariously good. Gameplay is cool and a nice break from the typical stagnant RPG conventions. One of the coolest features is your custom character will get rendered into the 2D Cutscenes. And they're not just 'here's your base sprite watch it do ' it's like, actual cutscenes. Where everything is unique.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
I wanted to like this game but I couldn't. It's a shame too. I love the console games this game is based on but I found it boring. I didn't find any of the humor funny or the combat interestesting in any way. If you are a fan of Penny Arcade I guess you would like this.

This game could have benefitted greatly from controller support.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
An excellent turn-based RPG in the vein of Costume Quest, combining the humour of the Penny Arcade comic and the irreverancy of the creators of DeathSpank.  Highly recommended.  If just to have an ordinary cat as a supporting character...

Game Name: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Original Release: 2008
Genre Tags: RPG; Adventure; Parody; Comedy
My Overall Grade: A-
Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours
Multiplayer Aspect: None
Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Casual gamers
REVIEWOn the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a very amusing indie RPG; and it is splendidly short and sweet.  It boasts solidly designed and enjoyable RPG elements, with a light and hilarious story.  This is a good pick-up for any casual RPG fans out there looking for some lighthearted fun.

Technically, this is a parody game but to be honest it plays better than many modern real RPGs that are emerging from the indie realm.  It plays like an old-school, turnbased-combat RPG, complete with leveling-up elements and a mild form of gear upgrading.  The gameplay is definitely fun and the RPG elements will keep you addicted to the progression.  You will find yourself striving to reach that next milestone of development as you play through the hilarious campaign.

On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a Penny Arcade game. The story is fun and funny; it doesnt take itself too seriously.  It is very lighthearted and the game is packed with hilarious and immature humor.  The characters are likeable, and cartoonish.  The art style is charming and fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.  It all comes together as a very comic-like production.

It is the perfect game for a casual RPG fan that wants to play something light and easy, and may not be in the mood for one of the more in-depth, immersive, and incredibly long RPGs out there.

this game is to funny not to have. from the narator to the robots and mimes its just a damn good time

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Penny Arcade
RPG

That should be enough to sell most.  If you're not familiar with the PA humor, you may not get a lot of the in jokes and references.  But PA comic fans will be delighted to see all their favorite characters show up in this RPG and get to enjoy loads of references.

I originally owned it for Xbox 360 and re-purchased it on Steam just to support the game.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
For those who've been living under a rock (that is to say those unfamiliar with the dynamic webcomic duo that is Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins of Penny Arcade) or take issue with having to read a fair deal, this game may or not be your particular cup of tea. It's writing (and by association the JokesTM") was a little bit hit and miss for me

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
A fantastic, focused, potential-filled first episode. Precipice of Darkness plays out like a western made JRPG centered around Super Mario RPG style combat with some light (classic) adventure game elements. The story stays on track for the most part and has enough side quests to flesh out characters and keep you interested in the few areas available for exploration. Inventory and equipment management are kept to a minimum with weapons being upgraded through point-and-click adventure mechanics. Just don't expect much of the comic's humor; I guess 4 pane webcomic humor doesn't translate well to a game so the devs just make everything wacky and so randumb.

Clocking in at around 7 hours this is a healthy episode" and worth picking up if you like JRPGs. Just don't expect much humor from the PA characters."

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
A good one time playthrough. Combat is fresh and unique, and you beat up mimes with a rake. Enough said.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Fun point and click game.  Lots of inside jokes for fans of the online comic.  Plays like a game that the Castle" guys might have put together had we gone into video games back in the day.  Well worth it."

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Somewhere between the early final fantasy 'light' and psychonauts, i was delighted to play this game. Not as humorous as it means to be but still quirky and quite enjoyable. Played from start to finish in a few hours just couldnt stop myself.

Very good indeed.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
This is really a golden egg amongst all of the average games nowadays. Every episode takes around 8 hours depending on your playstyle and difficulty. you may recognize the mechanics from other games but they are very well done and very well implemented in its own playstyle.
This game was one of the most enjoyable ones i played for quite some time.
With every new episode gameplay mechanics will change so you never get that feeling you are playing the same over 4 episodes. for this cheap price definetly a must buy if you are even barely interested.
You will have your fun with this game

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Worth getting, a quick and fun turn based RPG game.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
It's a good rpg with funny dialogue, good cell-shading graphics.

Game gets ruined a bit(in my opinion) because you gotta click every single part of the screen to make sure you collect everything(100% completion)

Yet, a good game, you should try!

Overall: 7.5/10

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
After playing through both episodes, I've got to say that these two games have to be one of my most favorite pair of Indie Games ever. I never thought I'd hear myself give such high praise to a turn-based RPG(of which, I'm not too fond with turn based combat systems.) The writting alone makes these two games worth playing. It brings the humor of the Penny Arcade comics and the fun of an RPG and mashes them together, upgrades feel rewarding, the character customization feature is a really nice touch.(No matter what, your character looks like someone out of a Penny Arcade comic) and the enemies range from strange to down right bizarre. I was never a huge fan of the Penny Arcade comics, but these games are really fun. I've found myself laughing pretty hard at the comedic vulgarity which has a quite prominent existince throughout both of these games. There is a consistant atmosphere spanning each episode with each location being unique and fresh. These gems are a steal at retail price!

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Pretty fun game, provided me with around 6 hours of fun.

6.5/10

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
good game get this and number 2, the 3rd one is totally different and feels cheap compared to these 2

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Precipice of Darkness is a memorable role-playing based adventure game that draws you into the comic genius of Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik. The gameplay is similar to that of the classic Final Fantasy games, but with a modern touch along with quick-time events (QTE) that relate attacks. While the specialized QTE attacks can be off-putting, that's no reason to pass up Penny Arcade's touch-in-cheek adventures.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
I don't really follow Penny Arcade, but I found it easy to pick up anyways. Has a Final Fantasy type battle system and a fairly straightforward storyline (I don't often feel like I don't know what to do next). Seems interesting.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Foreword: I know most people disagree with my opinion, but I'm just being honest. Please, don't rate it down just because you loved the game =)

Short Verdict: An okay humorous short RPG that has all my sympathy, but ultimately falls short. Although not entirely bad, mainly saved by its atmosphere, I can't really recommend it as a game. But I have to say that choosing between recommending it or not was a tough decision. By the way, I played it only because I got it in a bundle, but even so I almost couldn't get through the first hour. Still, I intend to play Episode Two in the future.

Pros:
Builds an awesome atmosphere, kinda reminded of me Sam & Max
Packed with quality humor (I'm not the right audience for it, unfortunately)
Funny, interesting characters
Nice headquarters with a lot of info, like game stats, dossiers, bestiary, collectibles, missions etc.
The artwork is awesome and I loved the comic-strip scenes
The BGM is also very good
Being able to customize your character is a cool feature
Cons:
Fights are boring and very repetitive and the mechanic is poor, making them a slower process than it should be
Mouse controls are bad, both in battle and moving your character around
Difficulty is a roller coaster--sometimes really easy, then suddenly unforgiving, then back to a walk in the park
Levelling up and upgrading your weapons were really not well implemented
Collecting items is way too random and tedious (you have to break items that constantly respawn in the maps)
An RPG with limited encounters? Check =( Really, it was an awkward feeling coming close to finish the game and not knowing if I'd be able to do all I had to do in battles.
Most cases (missions) consist simply in fighting enemies, which is a bit lame
Basically, it's a bad RPG game...I wish it were a point-and-click adventure--I would probably love it!
The main story (if you can say this game has one) is pretty shallow and was poorly scripted, like someone was making it all up as they were writing
Bought on / for: Vancouver Edition by Humble Weekly Bundle for an average of US$ 0.25 (R$ 0,62). Great price for what you get, but I don't think it's worth its full price.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
This game is very entertaining to play. Super funny comedy the whole time.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Just couldn't get into it.  I tried but the combat was so simple the humor just was not enough.  Its like a very simple turn based RPG where you have attack and... attack X 2.  No magic or additional skills found, just items and attack in a time-turn based combat.  The story is funny and some of the concepts are really fun & silling.... however the super simple gameplay made me not want to play it.  Could have easily been a funny RPG parody cartoon, but falls short of being a fun game for me.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Most horrible game I ever played. Script writer thinks every sentence must be crude and uninteresting. Art style is very bad. Couldn't return it. Couldn't force myself to play it.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Are you a Penny Arcade fan? No? Then avoid.

Precipice of Darkness, Episode One
Gameplay gets old, humor isn't really there.

Blood Knights
I love vampire games and I will forgive them many things.

However  no matter how I try and justify this game to myself the truth is I wasted the money I spent on it and the time I spent playing it.

The voice acting is terrible, the combat is boring, pretty much none of the cool vampire abilities you would expect are in this.
The story is just painful, seriously painful.

But ofcourse this isn't the worst part of it.

It is fair to say that pretty much none of the monsters will kill you, if nothing else the AI is too dumb for that.

What will kill you and kill you alot is the most brain dead camera perspective.
Expect to be killed by off screen boses, have all the directions mid platformer jump, run off a cliff due to sudden perspective change.

Seriously if you want a Vampire game that is platforming and is an action rpg just go and find an old version of legacy of kain.
Learn from my mistakes and dont waste your time or money on this painful experience.


Blood Knights
Man i preorder this one on greenmangaming for a decent price, just over $10 which I thought would be safe since I know people who like this dev.  Never gotten into the one other game of theirs i tried.  And man this was worse.  Also now its on sale 2 weeks after release anumber of places for $6 from $15.  wow.  i can handle bad acting, voice stuff, but man the the levels and gameplay are jsut so unispired.  its like a bad dragon age 2 which should speak for itself.

Blood Knights
Well really did think this was going to be my sort of game and oh boy was i wrong.
I have actually finished this game and overall found it to be a very frustrating experience,for starters the graphics are ok,the sounds ok,the voice actings ok and thats where it stops being ok.
Most of the time when you get in fights including the BOSS battles (so called boss battles) you just mash buttons and hope for the best and its this way with most other things to,jump from one platform to another and it can sometimes be pot luck if you land on the platform of fall to your death.
This game could have had real potential to be something other than what it is MEDIOCRE and thats really all one can say about the whole of my time with this game,and thats a sad thing-it will appeal to someone (all games do) and we dont all like the same sort of games,but i dont think that this game will really have a wide fan base and as the ending drew near i was like thank god its over and then HURRAY" the typical ending for the sequel that hopefully will never see the light of day."

Blood Knights
At first, you see the vampire chick with the classic high level armor" and you're like "Hey

Blood Knights
Blood Knights pretty good game...

Gameplay: The gameplay is unusual, namely, during battle, you can switch characters. Only two of the hero, one of them have the skills to melee and one ranged and is very comfortable. Good pumping capacity, as well as the selection of equipment, which can be found or purchased.
BUT! Problems with the camera, the camera view is sometimes not comfortable for the game - it's one of game problems.

Price: Game cost 14,99, maybe would be price 9,99. Better buy this game on sale.

Story: Not bad story. Two people become vampires...

Graphic: I don't know what to said about graphic. I think it's not bad for this game with her price.

LoL, I got to know about co-op in this game when finished. So #facepalm

P.S. Sorry for my English :3

Blood Knights
I really enjoyed this game. It is right up my alley. If you're looking for a Game of the Year contender, this isn't it. But this is a simple, entertaining, fun little adventure that I would recommend to anyone looking for a little mindless fun.

Quick summary:
Fun, mindless hack 'n' slash. In terms of gameplay, it is similar to The Bard's Tale, which I also enjoyed.
Takes about three hours for a single playthrough, and fun enough to go back to play to unlock different endings.
Decent story for a video game, with branching story options, though generally quite linear.
Some minor character upgrades.
Simple loot system, where new items found are better than existing items, and it really only makes sense to save your money to buy the best weapons in the game towards the end.
Gamepad controls reasonably intuitive.
Graphics and voice acting are good enough.
Very stable. Not a single crash.
All in all, I would give it a 7/10. There is nothing in this game that is bad -- it's just not going to be on anyone's top 10 list ... except maybe mine.

If this were a film, it would not be an Oscar contender, but it would be one of those movies that you'll just sit there and watch and enjoy whenever you see it playing on the TV years later.

Blood Knights
It's more action than RPG, with only a handful of side quests to distract you from the main plot, despite having mechanics similar to Diablo or Torchlight. There's loot, but it seems largely inconsequential compared to the ability upgrades that you'll receive. There's no way to max them out, though, as once your finish an area, enemies do not respawn and you cannot revisit them for more loot or missed blood coins.

Which leaves us with a fairly short (5-7 hours) main story. It's by no means terrible, but its' the sort of thing that you'll see as a somewhat unintelligible direct-to-TV b-movie. The voice acting is generally well done, although some of the scripting strains credibility and intelligence. If you're not laughing out of embarrassment by the third time the priest says but first I will use my healing powers" in the introductory battle

Blood Knights
Blood Knights is possibly the worst game Ive played this year. From top to bottom, nearly every aspect of this vampiric hack-and-slash is unapologetically bad, yet I find myself in an odd situation. As terrible as it is, and it really is, I enjoyed playing it.The games plot, which is often told through hilariously stagy dialog, revolves around a vampire-hating Templar knight who, for reasons never fully explained, gets eternally bound to a vampiress archer. Then the knight becomes a vampire himself, which really makes it a game about two vampires bound together. The obliviously shallow story continues all the way up to the games not-shocking-at-all ending.The combat consists of a regular light attack and two power attacks that are on cooldown timers. Characters also harness their vampiric magic to push or pull enemies and key environmental elements which sometimes became part of the games simplistic platforming segments. Feeding on the blood of enemies serves to replenish health and was probably the most satisfying aspect of the combat, however for reasons that are never explained away, strong enemies and bosses are immune to these powers.Hacking away with a sword and then seamlessly switching to Alysa in order to fire off a stream of arrows works well, but the action fails to evolve in an interesting way throughout the game. Boss fights suffer a yawning lack of imagination, with many encounters amounting to little more than working a strong enemys health down only to have them heal and send in a wave of lesser enemies while you rinse, wash, and repeat the process a given number of times.Worse yet, when bosses reach a defeated state the game cuts to a cinematic scene.The lack of transition and the speed at which these scenes engage is disorienting. Worse, when it happened in the middle of an attack chain ending the final boss fight it caused me to inadvertently skip the majority of the games concluding scene.While its okay to like a bad game, its not an excuse to call a bad game good.With so many true classics now available on download services, there is really no reason to pick up Blood Knights.Overall 4/10.

Blood Knights
I recommand this game only if the following criterias are filled:

[ ] This must be one sale (bought it 0.74, won't be worth more than 5)
[ ] You shouldn't have any expectation. If you're expecting something like Fable, Castlevania or whatnot, well... This is not the game you're looking for.

If you match both the critearias listed above, you're good to go.

Pros:
***Customization system (equipement and skill trees). Weapons and armors have a cosmetic effect on the characters which is a plus.
***Ability to switch between characters at will (with a small cooldown). The two characters have different gameplay and can do have separate skill trees, skill points and inventory.
***The graphics aren't fantastic but they are FAR from ugly.
***Fixed camera doesn't impair the gameplay (exception : see below, in Cons" section)
***Supports local coop multiplayer
***Fun to play

Cons:
***I needed 5 hours to complete the game

Blood Knights
There are janky games and then there is Blood Knights.

3rd person hack and slash action RPG with a camera that zooms around as much as flies around a turd.
Over-the-top voice acting of lines that'll make a 6th grade school play sound like the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Digital cleavage in mini chainmail bikinis and a story about the moon crashing into the Earth... I think?

And yet I played it to the end because it was kind of fun in that so bad it's... eh at least decent" way."

Blood Knights
Not such a bad game.
Focuses more on the action rather then the roleplaying and while the story isn't bad it's nothing you haven't seen before either. Just don't go into it expecting a deep vampire rpg rich with lore because it's 'not' that game.

Gameplay is your typical story driven arpg, quite linear. Get shuffled down the corridor killing guys, hitting checkpoints and eventually coming to a cutscene. Sometimes this scene will give you different dialog choices but nothing changes the outcome of the game. Just elaborates on the current situation. The 'twist' here is you have 2 characters which you can swap between on the fly. Which does add something to the otherwise stale attacks. (standard, standard, special).

Skill trees are basic. You get access to almost all abilities from the get go and can just select what you wish to put the points into as you level up. Collecting 'red coins' along the way will also allow you to bump up the characters basic attributes.
Item randomness doesnt really exist. Had a couple of playthroughs and each time I received indentical loot from each chest (no loot grinding here). Voice acting will probably make you cringe a little at times with its stiffness but overall it's acceptable. Soundtrack is slightly higher quality but does get a bit repetitive.

If you enjoyed Dungeon Siege 3 for what it was (not the dungeon siege we remember) and don't mind your vampires. Pick this one up when its on sale. Otherwise probably avoid as there is better options out there. Would definitely be recommending a 360pad for this game as well.

Blood Knights
the Good:  - graphics, sound, story, combat
- controller was perfect
- encountered no lag or glitches
- combat is fairly strategic requiring a combination of ranged, melee, and special attacks to deal with various enemy types
- the overall story was good, even though it feels rushed
- local coop play

the Bad:  - voice acting, writing, platforming
- the dialogue needs more editing, the voice deliveries lack emotion
- there are a few annoying platform jumps, mostly due to the inability to move the camera
- no online coop play

This game is neither good nor bad.  You'll probably either love it or hate it.  The first chapter makes the game look very bad.  It gets better once you move beyond the introduction so if you're going to give it a chance, then be sure to put a little extra time into it.  (It's a pretty short game anyway.)  For me, it's one of those games that grows on you the more you play it.  It's unpolished, yet charming.

Blood Knights is just a fun little action game that's a little rough around the edges.  It has potential and a little more time and money in development may have produced a suprise hit.  If you're feeling adventurous you may very well find a short but entertaining story with this game.  Just be prepared to look beyond some of the design flaws.

Blood Knights
Before we start let me use my healing powers..

This game is overall something I have been wanting for a while but stopped for a few reasons

pros: easy to learn
A decent story
A dynamic dialouge between your main character and your companion
Some really fun moments

Con: YOU DIE... YOU DIE BY FALLING OFF AN EDGE AND LANDING 1 METER....

That of course happened right before a save spot, the issue with this game is that you're not allowed to save unless you find one of those save slots.. :( that's just a big no no from me... If just they had a fixed save like F3 for quicksave...

due to that reason I am no longer playing it :( I will reccomend it, but not if you're bothered about the savings. so it's a neutral thumb for me.
6/10

Blood Knights
Fun little hack 'n slash.

+ Decent graphics, fun locations, okay story, short playtime. Game ran smoothly and without a single bug or crash. Some fun platforming puzzles. Music and ambiance is good, though nothing special. There are some branching narrative choices that seem to affect reactions and outcomes.

- Linear progression. Annoying camera control  - as in, there isn't any. All movement is done via WASD on the keyboard, and the camera auto-rotates. I got used to it, but it felt unnecessarily restrictive. Other users have complained about the voice-acting, and yes, it is pretty terrible. Lack of tutorials - had to look up a walkthrough several times to learn a key combo so I could progress (when in doubt, try Shift + LMB).

Not a must-buy, but if Blood Knights tempts you, get it when it is on sale for around $1-2. Otherwise you'll feel ripped off. There simply isn't enough content or replayability to justify the $15 retail price.

Blood Knights
For starters, I did not know what does it mean that when Kalypso is one of game makers it surely will be a mediocre title. Soon enough I was given an opportunity to experience that. Blood Knights is one of those vamphyric games that I like. Running along and killing bad guys, monsters, warewolves sure is fun. And it is in this game. What is more, graphics are really juicy, and beautiful. But when it comes to the story itself it is as shallow as a hole dug by a child in a sand with a little spatula. Come on guys, you could have done better! It takes about 4 hours to finish this game on medium level of difficulty. At this rate heroes have best equipement and burst through waves of enemies without sweat. Dear player, a fan of vampyric games,  if you are reading this, please mind that it would be better if you spend your money firstly on LEGACY OF KAIN series and then come back for BLOOD KNIGHTS. Cheers!

Blood Knights
Simple hack n slah game with very good music and graphics. It can be completed in around 5-6 hours. I can see why so many people puts negative reviews but if your expectation is not much it is a good game. Typical Kalypso game with two main characters that you can switch in between. Do not expect something like Dragon's Age or Skyrim and you will enjoy it.

Blood Knights
It took me 4 hours to finish it. I encoutered quite a few bugs while playing it. For an indie team, the graphics are decent, but it laks a lot in gameplay terms. The story is boring. On a sidenote, the game is set in Romania... they didn't actually read anything about this country before working on the game - it was awkward at times for me to play it.

Blood Knights
Its a pretty good action romp if you play it in coop.
For singleplayer perhaps if its really cheap on sale.

Note that is local coop only, and you basically need 2 xbox or compatible controllers. If you got that, your set for a decent adventure with really cheesy voiceacting and some pretty good action.

As far as vampire games go youd by default suspect they suck, but this sucks in a good way :)


Blood Knights
Wow. I'm really baffled reading all of the negative reviews this game got. Maybe I'm just easier to please than most people but I absolutely loved this game! It was a real gem. I was fortunate enough to get this on the steam summer sale for three dollars, but after playing it, I think it's worth the full price tag. From what I can gather reading the negative reviews, the majority of complaints seem to be that it's linear, a poor pc port of a console game, doesn't have AAA graphics, and poor voice acting. Other complaints are repetitive combat, boring musical score and poor story. These last three I strongly disagree with, and I thought the graphics were pretty good for a $15.00 title. First of all, I loved the story which revolved around a world where humans and vampires are at war for dominance of the planet. Some spell forges the souls of two enemies: your character, (a male human) and a female vampire, (admittedly this is never explained but it's supposed to help the humans turn the tide of the war somehow). They are stuck with each other and have to keep each other alive because if one dies, the other does too. Well, your character gets turned in the first chapter of the game, so now you are a vampire also, as well as your companion. I very much liked the dialogue and chemistry between the two main characters, which I thought was pretty entertaining. The combat was very fun. If you are anything like me, you will probably use the male, (former human) 70's percent of the time because he uses melee attacks which I find to be a lot more fun. However, you will find yourself relying on the female (vampire's) ranged attacks  more as the game progresses and the enemies get stronger. I found the combat to be very fun and fluid, and didn't get boring to me at all. I liked the two main characters and the story, which unfolded more and more as the game progressed, with an interesting turn at the end. The final villain, (who is not introduced until fairly late in the game) was very VERY cool, not just as a final boss, but as a character as well, and is accompanied by an awesome musical score during the final battle. It is my favorite musical score in the game! Sadly, my copy of the game did not come with the soundtrack. I would have liked to have put it on my i-Pod.  The aesthetics of the game were very visual rich, (if you read any of my other reviews, you will see that aesthetics are VERY important to me). I especially liked Noah's pass and the second to last level, which has the ruins of Noah's ark mounted in the sky on top of a mountain peak.  The controls were very easy to pick up on. I normally hate playing rpgs with controllers, perfecting a mouse and keyboard, but this game was incredibly easy to play with a controller. This is probably because it's not really an rpg. It is primarily an action, hack-n-slash, with only the bare minimum elements of an rpg included, (basically leveling up and earning gold for better equipment). There is also skills to be learned as your character gets stronger, but they are very basic skills. This game is fantastic for what it is: a very linear action hack-n-slash with a cool story and mediocre voice acting. The length of the game is roughly 7 to 8 hours on normal difficulty. This was just perfect. It told a neat sci-fi/fantasy story without being dragged out. If this has been longer, it might have started to drag out a bit. Here is some advice for anyone playing for the first time. Don't buy anything from the trader. All equipment you need can be found during the quest. Save all gold you collect until about 3/4 the way through and then buy the bada$$ sword called SATAN'S JUSTICE!!" ...best name for a sword ever! LOL! I really get a kick out of that. I guess I never really thought of Satan as caring too much about justice.
The only two flaws I can really think to say about this game is that you can't control the camera angle. But don't worry

Blood Knights
It is a interesting game with some good moments, a little wierd physics that affect gameplay in strange way that sometimes can make the mechanics work against what you are trying to do, the story is a mess and doesnt really catch player attention, voice acting also seem to influence the detachment from game.

Even with some fun moments trough the campaing, i cant really recomend this game, mostly because it doesnt let you configure the controls, such simple feature that Devs still disregard nowday and have huge impact on how each player experience the game.

Blood Knights
As of right now, I cannot recommend this game, at least at full price. I haven't tried the controller yet, but the keyboard and mouse controls are pretty bad, especially as the female/shooter vampire. I find her aiming system pretty hard to get used to, but I've had similar problems with similar controls. The voice acting is a bit shoddy, sometimes the animation is off, and some of the characters sound.. hollow, as if there's an echo behind them.

That being said, once I get past the intro and become the actual vampire, it becomes a bit better. I haven't gotten very far into the game yet, but I WILL be trying it again, and giving it another shot with an actual controller, hoping that it's a bit easier to handle (it reminded me toward the end of my play session of the old Gamecube Baldur's Gate games, which means that I owe it to myself and the developers to give it another try).

It DOES get a bit better as you continue to play, as you get used to the controls, so I'm going to give it another go and then edit this review after.

As of right now, however, at full price I cannot recommend this. I picked it up for pretty cheap on the Humble Store during the Spring Sale (I would say around or less than $5, but I'm not entirely sure) and in my opinion if you get an hour of playtime per $10 price, you're at least getting as much time out of the game as you spent to buy it. So, if you want to try to grit your teeth and get past the difficult/clunky controls and just play a hack'n'slash, and you have the chance to pick it up cheap, you may enjoy it. You may not.


Blood Knights
Blood Knights is a game based on that you actually play it co-op with a friend.
I did indeed play it with a friend and well, we enjoyed it while it lasted. Full 3 hours. Yes thats the whole game.
Anyways, the gameplay is quite okay, just mash buttons over and over. But there is a cool feature where you can grab people and push them around in the air and or away. Thats possible too with your friend so you had to do , lets call them little riddles, where you had just to push your friend up, then he you and that over and over until your upstairs. A little bit funny to push your friend instead down a cliff and get him killed. Very funny indeed. Anyways, there is an upgrade system that is completely useless. Like 3 % Crit chance etc. You can buy and sell loot , but mostly you didnt had to. Game is pretty easy . The story is okay, i liked it, but nothing really impressive. The story behind the vampire and templar that have to work together should have made a cool story, but well the dialogue sucks, pretty uninterestening and boring. I had my fun with it, but only because it was so short and stopped when it got boring. If you are looking for a quick co-op game for the evening, go ahead and buy it at a sale. Otherwise no i cant recommend it.

4/10

Blood Knights
I just finished the game in under three and a half hour and had a great time playing.
Things that i experienced
- The voice acting could have been better, they all sound like robots when they speak.
- The gameplay and graphics was good.
- The game could have been better if the developers would have put more time into it.
- The story was a little bit hard to follow since it started to hop a little in the middle of it.
- If you like hack and slash you should try this game out.


Oh and one more thing...
If the game lags like  when you start it for the first time try to update graphics drivers and windows updates. That worked for me atleast.

Blood Knights
A halfway decent game, I'd recommend it more strongly except for a single really bad design choice, but I'll get to that in a moment.

Story was standard but enjoyable. Voice acting was fairly poor, but worked alright with the writing style I think so I didn't actually mind it that much. Environments were beautiful and varied considering the size of the development team. Gameplay was pretty good and the combat was responsive and seemed to be balanced really well. I played on normal and still died a fair few times, but always because I was stupid in combat rather than because of anything out of my control. Navigation was a bit of a pain at first, but I got used to it slowly. I did enjoy the different characters you could play and swapping between them during combat turned out to be useful. I thought it was just going to be a gimmick at first. It had some RPG elements, but nothing too great. Just inventoray management, limited skill and attribute leveling and a couple of story decisions that really didn't make a difference in the long run.

What I didn't get used to was the directed camera. I HATE directed cameras and it served no purpose in this game except to make some areas more hidden than they would otherwise be and to make combat more difficult. When an enemy is in front of me, I want to be able to see them, not have them hidden off my screen by a camera that randomly decided to zoom in on my character cause I entered a particular section of the map. I think directed camera's are one of the worst design decisions a developer can make, and it annoyed me throughout the game.

If you want a quick, fun dungeon crawler and don't mind a directed camera, then I would recommend this game. Otherwise, you may find it too frustrating with not enough good elements to make up for it.

Blood Knights
I wouldn't recommend this game for single player. The story is really cheesy, but your choices seem to not influence the story. Dialogues are written badly and synchronisation is out of character most of the time.

On the good side you will have some fun in local Coop, besides the bugs and aweful camera . I think it doesn't scale with player number which make it too easy.

If you can get it for a low price and want some fun nights with a friend in you basement it's adecent choice.

7/10 (Local Coop)


Blood Knights
I picked up Blood Knights" as part of a bundle some time ago

Blood Knights
I only write this because I thing the game it is rated here to low. Bought it for %50 it took something like 6 hours to play through. I think that it is a short but good game.

Played only single player with keyboard and mouse.

Changeable controls would be better but it was still quite playable with the fixed key setup.

It didnt crash a single time. Sure there is a lot of potential to improve it, but this is always the case. In the time you play the campaign it will rarely happen that you think, well that should have been made different / better.

For example the fixed camera can sometimes be a small handicap. Or you get new armors and weapons really fast in the beginning and to the end you get far less. (There are only three kinds of armor designs per character so you will get old designs with better stats later...)


Blood Knights
It's not bad at all, a cool little RPG game for all vampire lovers.

Blood Knights
LOVED IT !!!
Love this game, had NO expectation & glad i didn't cause it has made my day & i want more of this.
This game is fun, has some simple to understand features that ANY1 can understand N move forward.

I know the voice acting can be cheap sounding some times but it can also be funny.
The game isn't difficult at least not on normal & the combat isn't the greatest but i had a blast once i figured out how to switch between both characters to get the most out of the game play.
I will definitely play this through on the harder level & try out the coop.
It doesn't have a long Play through, i like to take my time, but as others have said this game prolly takes 7-8hrs if ur good @ it.

Graphics are decent, they're not killer but this isn't a killer AAA title either.
This isn't ur typical rpg, it's an action rpg with little dialogue & some may say not enough action but i found it was a good mix for me, some times i'am NOT in the mood for reading much & just want to kill ShhhhiiiTTT & this had what i like.
This could be compared to van helsing in a way, it's far less complicated & not as graphic hungry.
Overall i'd say this was worth the $ i paid & if it was as long & detailed as van helsing i'd pay full price no problem.

I really enjoyed it & WANT to see a sequel to it.
Overall i'd score it 7/10 & recommend it to friends.

Blood Knights
Nothing special , worth 6 hour of game time if you have a xbox 360 controller, if not you will need to buy one.

Blood Knights
You're a knight of rome who gets bonded to a vampire, while fighting something goes wrong and you get turned into a vampire too, now you're stuck to your vampire partner till the bond is broken. This is where blood knights begins.

Blood knights doesnt look particularly pretty, or plays very well, the platforming is downright horrible and you can tell its a low budget game. It also feels very sluggish like the game itself is slowed down, but thats not the case, its just how the game is. It takes a while to get used too.

I wouldnt recommend this if you want AAA+ titles, this is done by a team that probably had a very low budget. But its story and combat is quite fun, overall, I had fun playing it from beginning to end and thats all that matters to me. Certainly worth my money, and I hope to see a sequel that has a bigger budget.

Blood Knights
Blood Knights... Blood Knight?... well it should be called Blood Knight because there is only one knight and the Vampire Mistress Alysa... isn't exactly a knight but more a Huntress.

Okay now that the basic title misleadings are out of the way, lets write something about the game itself.

Well you might have guessed it, Blood Knight(s) is about Vampires, you play as either a Vampire Huntress which was bound by a contract or as a human knight.
The basic idea behind this is / was, to exploit the Vampires power against their own kind... but as such plans are always prone to fail, this case here makes no difference.
Very early in the game, the male human counterpart finally dies and turns into a full vampire... much to the displeasure of his following knights and the priest Bartholomus.
The priest and the knights, now your enemies, catch your strange duo in no time but fail to properly execute them, again these type of mistakes are prone to lead to ones downfall.

You don't push a hero from a cliff and leave in the thought that the fall has killed him. You behead him, chop him into pieces, burn his remains and spread them in the ocean.
That is proper hero disposal procedure, to be read in the The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord" paragraph 13

Blood Knights
First, I'm going to preface this review with a couple notes.  If I could I would give this game neither a thumbs up or down.  So the best I can do is give it a thumbs up but I'll also give it a 4 out of 10.

To sum up what this game is, a poor man's Castlevania.  It feels like there is a rich world to explore but ultimately falls flat in showcasing it.

Character progression is done through leveling and assigning points to various passives and finding predetermined gear scattered throughout the linear levels.  Ultimately you will be using the same attacks and strategies the entire game.  Though I suppose the progession doesn't have to be too deep considering how short and easy the game is.

The voice acting is atrocious.  You will either become very annoyed any time someone opens their mouth or you will get a good laugh in between combat sequences.

There are worse games out there but Blood Knights isn't a whole lot better.  If you love vampires this game will quench your thirst (pun intended) for a few days.  15$ is way to much for this title though.  I picked it up in a bundle that is still available here: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/rpg-heroes-2-bundle

Blood Knights
Good game with interesting setting.  Couch coop and gamepad support.

Blood Knights
Great game although a little short. Fun and nice storyline. I do hope for a seguel.

Blood Knights
Not bad, not great but definitely a spot in a Games made in Germany" collection. Dont expect huge production value behind this

Blood Knights
As much as I would like to be able to recommend this game, there just isn't any good reason I can think of. So much potential seems wasted on this title I feel. It was a wonderful idea that somehow got mutilated into a horrible shell of a game. Lag is ridiculous due to optimization issues I assume, (no matter how nice your rig). Control reaction is absolutely horrid, it's as if your character has a 1 second lag on reaction time which makes for near impossible gameplay. The storyline leaves much to wish for and seems very choppy and forced. Voice acting and animation is terrible, no sync at all. I really wanted to like this game...I really did. I can't honestly say I recommend it for any reason though. As I said, it just feels like a hollow shell of what was a wonderful idea for a game. Final verdict, 3/10

Blood Knights
This game is horrible. Amongst its many flaws are

- Bad Graphics (you could live with that if the rest were fine, which it isnt)
- Controls suck (XBLA port so its not that bad with a gamepad)
- weird Camera Angles + Jump Sequences = 'nuff said
- Skill & Perk System is really basic
- only about 4.5 hours to finish the Campaign
- and since even the Story sucks there is no replay value whatsoever

If you see the Blood Knights coming - run as far away as possible.

Blood Knights
A very fun, polished little Action-RPG that is short, sweet, and to the point. Don't expect a decent story, or voice acting. What you can expect is solid, fun, polished gameplay, and a moderate challenge depending on what difficulty you play on. A healty amount of weapons, abilities, and a reasonable amount of content for the price. I completed it in a couple of sittings, took me around five or six hours to complete, yet for the time I spent with it, it was rather enjoyable for what it was.

Blood Knights
Blood Knights is a good mini RPG game..

It has all of the things you like in RPG like this..
Controllable Crew
Customisable armor
Skills points
Talent Tree
Health bar

Unfortunatly, I call Blood Knights, a mini-game, because i completed the game in less then 3 hours on Hard on my first try.
The story is so short, that you might want to restart all over on an higher difficulty wich might double your playing time. Still great issues with the game durability..

7/10 for RPG 4/10 for game life (BUY it if its cheap like during steam sale)

Soz for my english

Blood Knights
Turrrible voice acting. Fairly simplistic combat. About 5 hours total to play through. Sometimes the aiming mechanism on the ranged character is just fail. Not half bad scenery/ characters though and the combat is fun if simplistic. Would like to a sequel with bigger writing/ voiceacting budget and improved combat mechanics. Buy this on sale ;]

Blood Knights
Short but a good dungeon crawler. A very high B + rated game to me. I got hours of enjoyment but no replay value sadly.  Enjoy the journey!

Blood Knights
This was a really good game and had the same fighting style as dishonoured. However, the voice acting was terrible but you shouldn't let that bring down because it is still a really good game and if you like vampire games then you will love this.

Blood Knights
I like the game, it is a nice game you can play if you are bored one day.
I have played it 3 times (About 8 Hours each time)

First time i just played it and did what i wanted to do.
The other 2 times I played it, i went the 'Pure Human' and the 'Pure Vampire' paths.

Blood Knights
+Action is smooth, switching between character works seamlessly.
+Game gives you options to pick side and that decision has minor effect on game/achievements.
+-Short game, can be finish under 5 hr in normal difficulty.
+-Too easy in normal difficulty, i recommend start with hard.
--Horrible camera control. You die from falling more than killed by enemy because of this atrocious camera.
-Visuals, voice acting and sounds/music are not the strong point of this game.

Blood Knights
I'm actually enjoying this game more than what the reviews on Steam give it credit for. However, I can understand why people would suggest that it is a poor game. However, having only bought this from the Indie Gala Blood Knights Bundle because it was a part of the Steam Trading Cards program I have to suggest that it's been worth my while. I'm not certain that I'll finish this but  for now I'm satisfied.

It's your typical A-RPG style game. The camera is a negative - I wish it were controllable but it apparently isn't. If there are secret" areas that can be found the camera is a hindrance in that department. The first boss battle was more pot luck mashing buttons than knowing what to do. The game tells you to destroy the alter but doesn't give you anything else to explain how to do so.

If you don't expect an epic game

Blood Knights
One of the worst games I've played in a long time. It is horribly generic. I bought a $3 bundle with this game in it because it looked good in the videos on the store page. It is a flawless example of good looking video then you actually play it and it's sh-ttingly bad. Its regular price of $15 is laugh out loud funny. The combat is extremely clunky and generic like something you would find at the bottom of a flea market bin like a unknown action game from 2001, and a bad one at that. If I had to pick a game to describe what cheap feeling" is

Blood Knights
A little over priced for how short it is, but other wise a wonderful goth-vampire game, with immensely action oriented combat. How you can use the swapping of the 2 characters is really cool, and the storyline is pretty adventerous.

Blood Knights
I like this game.  Which is not to say that it is a good game.  The voice acting is terrible, the maps feel cramped, and the one time I made the mistake of playing it in front of another person I felt like they were watching me doing something embarrassingly private.  But when I'm by myself and I've got my controller handy, I am 100% down for a fast-paced, strategy-fueled session of pure, unadulterated violence.

Blood Knights
This game makes me a bit sad. The story could have been really good, the characters too, but overall the game is extremely lacking. It feels like a good idea that got stolen by a very poor game company that couldn't afford to just do it RIGHT. It's not a BAD game, but it's really not that great either. It's okay. Good for killing an afternoon, but not something I'm going to make any fanart for. It's a fun buy if you catch it on sale and  don't have anything better to spend your money on. Otherwise, give it a pass.

Oniken
The review blurbs don't lie: This game absolutely feels like it came right out of the late 80's NES but with fine tuned controls. Everything about it screams classic from the NES style color palette that neatly separates foreground from background and makes sure enemies stand out clearly  to the hard as balls platforming and combat, to the sparse checkpoints and lives and unforgiving boss battles that can crush you in an instant if you don't learn their patterns.

Gameplay feels like a mix of Strider and Shatterhand with swords and grenades as your primary weapons. A power-up item lets you cast a crescent shaped beam half the length of the screen with your primary attack but fails after you've been hit twice, requiring you to not only master the new attack range to keep enemies at bay but also hone your platforming and dodging skills to maintain your elevated attack power for harder enemies later in the stage.

The Terminator meets Vexille meets any kind of robo apocalypse storyline is pure '80's cheese and it's glorious, especially when a dude called Rico calls you on what looks like an '80's portable TV while you're riding a bright green rocket powered jetski. There's even a villain that feels like a pure throwback to the infamous Cats from Zero Wing.

Despite all the homage to action games of the late '80's, Oniken manages to be its own beast. It doesn't feel especially unique but it doesn't have to as it's a masterfully crafted experience that's equal parts nostalgia trip and exciting. Even with the harsh difficulty I find myself wanting to see what the next screen will be, what the next villain will be, what's the next enemy the game will throw at me and what will it do.

The audio feels ripped right from the era too, a masterfully crafted score of synthetic sounding music that perfectly fits the tone and transports you back to a childhood full of bleeps and bloops and incredible ear-pleasure that you're sure your audio chip is having an  to produce.

Controls are tight, responsive and the ability to use the dpad or analogue stick makes everything a bit easier (or more authentic depending on how you look at it). Restricting controls to two buttons (attack and jump, with grenade being up+attack) feels like an unnecessary nod to the NES but it's not restricting or annoying. Neither is the game in general - when you die it's almost always your own fault, you own mistake or lack of attention that causes you to fail. That said, enemies are fast and unpredictable (at least the first time you meet them) and you'll get caught off guard by a rushing machine or chucked grenade more than once.

So do I recommend the game? Absolutely. No other game even comes close to the level of authenticity that Oniken achieves and it's obviously a labour of love from the developers who are very talented. The game isn't perfect though, for all the praise I have to give it the flashing backgrounds in some cutscenes are an epileptics worst nightmare that can't be disabled (except by skipping the whole cutscene).

Score: 9/10 robots stabbed in the faceplate.

Oniken
There are TWO games on Steam that play and feel like classic NES / SNES games.
Oniken is one of them.
Many side-scrollers and platformers claim to play and / or feel like they're out of the 80's. Like they are from the (S)NES era.
They all lie!
Some of them really do look like NES games. Some of them look like HD NES games. Some of them claim to play like NES games while looking totally new-age?". None of them really plays nor feels like old-school retro side-scrollers tho.
I'm not saying they're bad games. They mostly aren't. But they don't feel nor play like (S)NES games.

Oniken

Oniken
A hero reminiscent of Kenshiro from Fist of the Northstar, 8-bit action and simple controls. Oniken is a snacksize-loveletter to oldschool gaming. Time flies as you run, jump and slash your way through six worlds of postapocalyptic battlefields, from underground facilities to cyberninja-infested forests. Many challenges await as you conquer one techno-dungeon after another in order to blow up the core and save innocent people from the robotic Deathforce.

Joymasher didn't hold back with the 80ies cheese and present a story heavily influenced by some of the greatest oldschool anime/manga you can imagine - any game that thanks Koichi Ohata in the credits can only mean action all the way and that is pretty much what Oniken delivers.

It's a throwback to the days of 8bit, equally inspired by NES as well as Master System titles, feeling like a lost game of that long gone era that suddenly appeared again. Obviously this means you spend your time jumping platforms, collecting powerups and slashing away at all kinds of badniks - only interrupting the carnage for massive, screen-filling bossbattles at the end of each stage while rocking out to some very cool chiptunes that remind me of various compositions on the MSX2.

Learning patterns and figuring out proper positioning is key to stopping the evil machines. While nowhere near as polished or deep as titles like Vlgarr the Viking, Oniken's simplicity, combined with the high speed of the game and it's great sense of anime-schlock" set it apart from similar titles on Steam

Oniken
Sometimes you just want to slash people in half and use no more than a couple buttons to do it. Reminiscent of games like Strider, Ninja Gaiden, and Shatterhand, Oniken is a brutal and brutally difficult 8-bit platformer that isnt for the meek. Games of its style have been common as of late, but none feel as authentic as Oniken. For better and worse, one could easily mistake Oniken for a lost Nintendo game by Nastume or Tecmo.

Call it indie if you like, but teams of two to three people were commonplace during Nintendo game development. Some did great things within the action-platformer genre, of which Oniken belongs. What we now see as limitations of hardware, they saw as a framework to build within. With 56 colors, a goofy-sounding synth, and four buttons, a few talented designers made games that continue to entertain us many years later. Oniken aspires to be in their company, even if its from a different era and on a different platform.

As an outsider, simplicity and difficulty appear to be the two main design philosophies of Oniken. Well talk about the former, before my blood starts boiling at the thought of the games bosses. Designed with a gamepad in mind, Oniken centers around one mercenary ninjas ability to jump and slash dystopian future jerks. Zuku, the games protagonist, isnt as fluid and fun to control as Strider Hiryu, but his sword has a nice reach. You can extend that reach by collecting power-ups. However, you can easily lose these upgrades by taking damage. If it isnt clear by now, Oniken loves to punish the player for making dumb mistakes.

Luckily, Zuku has a couple of extra tricks up his sleeve. In addition to extending attack reach, Zuku can sacrifice his power-up in order to go into berserk mode, where he deals more damage and takes less. Just as the power-ups render deadly enemies harmless, berserk mode can turn some of the games most difficult bosses into a 15-second slashfest. Only the most masochist old-school players will complain about these cheap victories, because even when you do manage to berserk a boss, you likely have died from him many times before - if not during the long trek to his room.

And finally, there are grenades. These are used much like items in Castlevania: awkwardly hold up and press attack to throw in an arch. Unlike Castlevania, this is the only item you'll have which is pretty disappointing. You get used to jumping and throwing grenades, but it never feels quite right. This is one of many instances of how Onikens earnestness to emulate Nintendo games disservices the overall experience.

Oniken packs a lot of variety and creativity in its six levels which contain three areas each. Sometimes youll be platforming across conveyor belts with lava beneath while other times youll be force feeding grenades to a cybernetic polar bear while jumping spikes on a speeder bike. One area you will find consistency in, however, are Onikens tough-as-nails boss fights that demand you to quickly recognize an enemy pattern and stay the hell away from projectiles.

Most of the time, these boss encounters are a fun challenge, but a couple will frustrate in a way that is neither fair nor entertaining. One such boss is a snake that breathes fire down on you if you attack it. Not taking damage is a matter of endurance and luck. This boss is followed by an even more maddening boss: A robot you must fight from a small, moving platform - fall off and it's instant death. Until you recognize the specific attack pattern and necessary approach that a boss demands, Oniken will put you in a world of hurt. Once you run out of lives, you'll have to start the ~15-minute journey to the boss again.

While Onikens difficulty is decidedly old school, there are many times where I think the developer could have reconsidered its approach. Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden may have contained instant death traps, pits, and cheap aerial enemies, but these were not the things that made those games good. In fact, these are the things that keep many players from returning to them.

One aspect of tribute that cant be knocked is the games presentation. 8-bit indie games are a dime a dozen these days, but rarely do they sound and look as great as Oniken. Though the backdrops and animation lack some detail displayed in the best Nintendo games, its an impressive effort nonetheless.

Oniken isnt quite the magical pairing of nostalgia and great game design that Mega Man 9 was, but it comes close to scratching that same itch that few other games have done since. If you love 8-bit games and hate yourself, dying repeatedly within Onikens six merciless levels brings its own form of joy that is rare in games these days.

Oniken
Oniken is a 2D run and sword action game. The controls are simple, attack, jump, duck, berserk and up + attack to throw a grenade. It is all so nice. The attack distance is good and can be boosted with power ups you find. You can hang from things. This game really goes the extra mile to make you think you're playing something for the original Nintendo, while most other games going for the nostalgia feel don't have actual 8 bit graphics and music. I feel such a buzz playing this game unlike other 'retro-ish' games that miss the mark with modernized graphics and sound.

The cut scenes are nice to look at, but the real fun of the game is the game play and the enemy variety. You'll see a lot of enemies and tackle them in different ways. For modern gamers the game might be seen as difficult due to the fact if you die, you restart the section of the level. Die at a boss, restart that entire section. You'll get better! Lose all of your lives and you'll have to restart the level.  Each level mainly consists of 3 sections, each with a mini boss of some sort. Since the save file allows you to just jump to a level, if I die on the first section of a level, I just go back to the menu and warp to the level I was on. Kinda makes lives on the first section of each level pointless. You have a hefty health bar like Mega Man, so the game is pretty forgiving. Pits are of course instant death.

The level variety is a mixed bag. Some levels are just bluntly walk to the right, others make you scale to the top and still others put you in a jet ski with a scrolling screen. There are a few sections that feel open where you're free to make your own path, which feels good. Some levels are needlessly difficult with a lot of action happening, but if your a veteran of old Nintendo games, you should be used to it. If not, then make an angry video about it.

There isn't that much replayability for the game, there are a few hidden items, one per level, and there are achievements for beating a level without dying. The game saves your high score for each level, but really, once you've beaten the game, there's no reason to come back to it.

Again, this is an awesome game well worth $10, it is so awesome that I'd buy any other game this studio comes out with. They hit the nail on the head. If you aren't into old school Nintendo games, avoid it.

Oniken
HOKUTO NO ONIKEN. ONIKEN NO KENSHIRO. Whatever, THIS is the true 8-bit stuff. No pretentious, faux retro pixel stuff, this could've been a proper NES game back then, period. Only mechanical carnage, dismembering in technicolor. THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT, EVERYONE GO GET THIS. 100/100

Oniken
I have mixed feelings about retro style games that are mere copycats from the golden age of video games. I get the nostalgia aspect, but the odd reality is that I cherish the memory of playing those old school games more than I actually enjoy playing them today. When I do play them, it's an immediate reminder of where games are today and how far along games have come and why products have advanced the way they have. While old school games were considered technically superior in their time, they are considered technically inferior today. In fact, most games of yesteryear made the most of the technology available to them. So designing a technically inferior product today, on purpose, is not that impressive to me.

Many great old school games are classified as abandonware and the ROMs and emulation software can be easily found to play them for whatever gaming system you cherished the most. Find them, play them, and try to enjoy them the same way you did 30 years ago. I've tried, but it's not the same. Reflecting on the memories of playing them gives me more pleasure.

Oniken is a good copycat from an era gone by, nothing more, nothing less.

Oniken
Obviously the retro-style 2D platforming repopularization results in some awful quality games that aren't worth a penny. Luckily, Oniken is no such thing. Oniken is a beautiful gem of a game that I am so happy I encountered. Yes, it is frustrating; yes it is difficult. But that is precisely why you will love it. Too many of the games in this style have the visuals but lack the heart of old school NES-era games. This game gets it. And so should you.

Oniken
Excellent NESdie game, very authentic to the roots of 8-bit era with modern gameplay !


8/10

Oniken
I follow the development of the game since the beginning and I'm glad to see Oniken on Steam. Great platform game, tough as hell to beat and gives the player tons of fun. Highly recommended! =D

Oniken
Very fun action-platformer with a great soundtrack and high difficulty, that unlike most attempts at retro games really could pass for the real deal.

Oniken
Oniken is one amazing game from the times where games taught us about persistence and strength. It's not hard just to  you off, it's hard but very rationally logical. It challenges you and progressively teaches you to master the gameplay. You finish the game feeling awesome for actually accomplishing something, which is a feeling many players hadn't had in 20 years.

Oniken
My problem with this game is that it doesn't inspire me to continue.  Like other modern throwback platformers (Meatboy, I Wanna Be The Guy, WHATEVER) Oniken sets out to make you die and try again until you get it right, but unlike those games you aren't dying due to a brilliantly crafted trap or deviously challenging stage design but instead due to an unclear boss attack pattern.  Oniken never makes me say, Oh ho

Oniken
Oniken is the first of Joymasher's games I played...  (Odallus doesn't disappoint either)

Oniken is everything you want in and 8-bit side scrolling platformer!

+The music and art are SUPERB
+The controls are tight, and you'll never blame them for your deaths
+The bosses are EPIC

- The core game may seem short, but...
+There's more!


Oniken
Feels like the old NES, and it's beatiful.

Oniken
Possibly the best NES game ever made. The controls are snappy and perfectly responsive, the gameplay is straightforward and both fair and punishing, and the art style is the same one that made the ninja boom of the late 80s worthwhile. Oniken is over-the-top, simultaneously brutish and elegant, and full of robots. It's perfect.

Oniken
In the age where most indie games feature pixel art graphics of some sort just for the sake of style or nostalgia, the developers at JoyMasher bring you the real deal with Oniken. How authentic can a modern implementation of a classic 8-bit action platformer be? Probably not much more than Oniken.

You play as Zaku a ninja mercenary, who helps the resistance in fighting the titular evil military organization (Oniken), that's attempting to control what's left of the post-apocalyptic world. If that doesn't seal the deal for you in itself, then continue reading :).

This whole game reeks of eighties, not only in terms of visuals and sound, but the overall game design as well, not to mention the story, which is told in short cutscenes between levels. The artists did an amazing job with the visuals: the graphics aren't stylized to look like 8-bit they are 8-bit, and great at that. The same can be easily said about sound  both music and sound-effects are unmistakably 8-bit and fit the overall game well. The levels in this game have their own different look and feature various gameplay elements and mechanics: there are classic horizontal scrolling segments, vertical scrolling segments, auto-scrolling segments and platforming segments. The boss-fights are epic, with bosses ranging from regular-sized enemy characters to bosses in crafts, mechanisms with turrets, gigantic fire-breathing snakes, etc.

Oniken doesn't boast a large arsenal of weapons  you're pretty much limited to using your massive sword (which you can power up) as the main weapon and grenades (which you'll need to pick up) as a sub-weapon, but that's not really a problem, since slicing your way through enemies is the meat of the game. Despite this, you'll have your chance to shoot some enemies via some shooting segments, which also exist in Oniken.

it's true that sometimes Oniken may seem a little bit too authentic for it's own good, with the game being rather challenging, both gameplay- and game-design wise. Think Ninja Gaiden" on the NES. Some levels throw a crap ton of enemies at you

Oniken
I was a little damning with faint praise when I mentioned Oniken in my review of Odallus: The Dark Call. I wasn't really sold on Oniken when I picked it up during a holiday Steam sale, being put off by the somewhat stiff controls and punishing difficulty, I didn't see it through past stage 3. However, coming off the high of Odallus prompted me to give Joymasher's debut another shot.

Oniken is tough. Sunsoft tough. Players who cut their teeth on games like the NES Batman and Journey to Silius will know what I'm getting at. Fast reflexes do play a part in your success, but memorizing the kinds of things a stage will throw at you and being able to consistently execute are paramount. It will throw you into that good kind of old school difficulty rage fit, that which motivates you to keep trying and not let that cheating- game get the better of you. Unfortunately it also suffers from try to get to the boss with enough health and wail on it in hopes that it dies before you do" syndrome

Oniken
The NES classic you never played!

Oniken
Killer 8-bit sprite art and chiptunes. It's essentially an NES game without sprite flickering and slowdown. Gameplay is pretty straight forward but I'm just in love with the aesthetic.

Review in English/Spanish
Anlisis en Ingls y Espaol:
English:  Oniken is a big homage to old NES games, the kind that made you scream in agony and throw your control in frustration a la Ninja Gaiden. Thankfully the developer knows today standards arent so trite and the game is actually easy if you know what you are doing (Perseverance, GUTS and finding out that you can actually consume your blade power-ups for UNLIMITED POWER!)

For those masochistic enough the game offers a hardcore mode (unlocked after clearing the game once)

Espaol:  Oniken es una carta de amor a los juegos viejos de NES que te hacan gritar en agona por lo difciles y frustrantes que eran, es muy parecido a los Ninja Gaiden tanto en jugabilidad como en las escenas que tiene entre niveles. Afortunadamente los desarrolladores se apiadaron de nosotros y el juego es de hecho fcil si sabes lo que haces (Perseverancia, coraje y tener en mente que puedes consumir los power-ups de tu espada para conseguir poder ilimitado)

Si eres masoquista te alegrar saber que hay un modo hardcore que se desbloquea una vez terminas el juego.

10/10

Honestly, one of THE BEST retro indie games I've ever played.

Brings back the good memories from the NES era: great old-school graphics, epic soundtrack and amazing gameplay.

I would recomend it to every side-scrolling platformer/NES lover. Buy it, play it. You won't regret that.

Oniken
Died a million times. 10/10 would die again.

Oniken
No naive sudden death traps (for the most part), no floaty controls, only legit challenge for reactions and wits right here. True NES-style, doesn't feel like cheap flash copy/paste. Bad guys are vile, good guys are badass, story doesn't take itself too seriously but remains loyal to 80's cheesy action flick/videogame style. Music also works for what it is. What else do you need? Worth every cent if you are up to some side scrolling action.

Oniken
A very well designed action platformer based on Nes Ninja Gaiden with Kenshiro as the protaganist. I'll probably say more once I beat it, but those two should be strong enough selling points for now.

Oniken
This is a slick throwback game, with very tight controls and challenging level design.  It is meant to be played a certain way and it teaches you the proper way to play along the way by killing you repeatedly.  If you die in this game it is your fault, which is part of the learning curve.  They did a good job of simulating the NES difficulty from back in the day, but without the sluggish controls that plagued many games from that era.  Protip: Read the manual to learn the secret technique to beating time trials.  Overall if you love retro style games I would also recommend picking up the Oniken + Odallus combo back as both games are excellent and made by the same studio.


Oniken
Love the art style of the game, it reminds me a lot of Fist of the North Star. The game is an adventure game that is a tribute to the old school NES days and it plays like one too. This is NES hard. Excellent soundtrack, the graphics are nice in an old school style sort of way. The controls are a bit hard to control with the keyboard so I highly recommend playing with a gamepad. I used a wired xbox 360 controller and the controls were excellent and very responsive. This is an 8/10 for me.

Oniken
Loks exactly like a NES game and even plays like one. Can't say how good it is though, have to play more. I am so bad at it and I didn't even finish the first level. Shame on me, huh?

Oniken
So basically Strider and Kenshiro from Fist of the North Star made an  baby and out pops Zaku, the hero of our game.

It's cliche, it's drivel, it's akin to an NES D list action game from 1988... and it's awesome.

The controls are a bit too precise and the speed is a bit too ridiculous, it's a game built for zero error, however it's quite forgiving and fair if you learn to memorize it. It's kind of like Ninja Gaiden only much faster... so let that sink in for a bit.

If you don't have cat like reflexes and if your memory is poor, you need to steer clear of this game as it will drive you mad. If you're up for a challenge I would definitely suggest buying the game when it's on sale.

Oniken
I'm a huge fan of old NES action games and I'm really glad people still make games like these.  Everything about Oniken feels like a game from the 80's or early 90's (Ninja Gaiden or Strider are the best examples) except you don't have to start from the very beginning of the game when you run out of lives (Something that I'm actually really glad isn't like how it was back in the day) which is good considering you'll do a lot of dying your first time through a level, just like any good action game.  Even the story and achievements have an classic vibe to them!

Oniken delivers a pretty genuine 8-bit experience, it absolutely feels like it came right out of a NES game from the late 80's, I've been following development for a long time and as it's not an AAA game the main developer really put his soul on the game, it's a really nice experience and with this improved version the game is even better

Oniken
Great Throw-back Action-Platformer!
All the negative reviews here were whining about the Game being to hard, well I don't agree.
Of course the Game is hard, it's a NES inspired Platformer after all, buit it's way more forgiving than Games like the original NInja Gaiden. While the challenge is constantly high, Oniken features several little things that still keep it very much do.able -  if you keep trying. Every level ist cut up into three segments, and finishing a segment completely refills your health. Combined with completely strict enemy patterns and platforming rythm this leads to a wonderful curve of dying a lot to dying a lot at the Boss Fights to knowing the level Pixel by Pixel and getting through without a scratch. Oh, and speaking of Pixels, the Art and the Music are glorious, especially the Cut-Scenes are a lot of fun. Control ( with an 360-Pad ) is spot on and the short levels have an unmistakebly One-More-Try" quality to the.
Absolutely recommended if you're into old-school action."

Oniken
This game is kicking my  and I love it.

Oniken
Just like the action side scrollers made by Capcom, Temco, Taito, Konami, etc on our NES systems we enjoyed as kiddies in the 80's. Some of our most fun gaming moments of all time.

Strider, Shatterhand, Ninja Gaiden, Bionic Commando, Vice Project Doom, Shadow of the Ninja, Powerblade, Kick Master, etc come to mind.

There were so many of them that were simular they kind of overshadowed each other were forgotten or didn't get the reconition they deserved.

The best part about types of games  are that they are still fun to play. Among the best of the 8- bit era. Lots of nostalgia and not as many blisters on my thumbs since Xbox 360 gamepads are much kinder than my old NES ones.

As with Axiom Verge(Metroid clone) I am pleased this looks and plays like the original Strider. I wouldn't want it any other way.

Oniken
Probably the best Brazillian game you will ever play.

As a reto-styled indie game, Oniken is hardly unique in premise. However; most retro-styled indie games are only retro" in terms of visuals/sound and do not capture the enticing gameplay aspects of retro gaming. Retro games were about introducing new challenges to the player and making the most out of the limited hardware available at the time. Since graphical fidelity has progressed well past 8-bit sprites no indie game can capture the latter aspect

Oniken
Forget about feel like 8bit". It`s a 8-bit game! All of elements of that era

Oniken
I am 7 years old again, sitting in front of the TV playing a NES game, I remember how hard Contra was back then, using my cartridge that let you use cheat codes. ahahah... Maybe I shouldnt have cheat my way through Contra... the experience is NEEDED to play this game, IT IS HARD. You want challenge? this game is for you, you're a whiny ? The only game you're good at is Cod of Duty??? Pass. true gamers will love and cherish this game for a long time. I wish there was more devs out there giving love to the games of our childhood, just like Oniken does.

Oniken
Overall - Very fun Ninja Gaiden-esque side scroller.  A little less limber, a little more walking apocalypse.  Not as difficult as the old nail biters for us who love them... but also not easy enough to get bored.

I love speedrunning games.  My main game was always Demon's Crest and Gargoyle's Quest 2, both of which I've spent thousands of hours on perfecting in order to get the times I've gotten.  I feel the same pace of action in these games even if its more sword less shooty.  The controls are tight and feel right.  Attacking has some really cool little gimmicks behind it.  Most of you from Symphony of the Night / other Metroidvanias will fondly recall the Jump slash land slash combo.  But more than that, you can cancel your slashes by crouching, so that you can Slash crouch slash slash crouch slash over and over for a really cool trick.  Things like this make games replayable, little skillsets that you can improve at and get better with.

That said, this game is not flawless.  This game has major issues with difficulty.  Now, most of you might wonder why.  Enemy placement / attacks are good and difficult to get around.  The problem comes from this -

1) Your health - You have too much health.  By simply brute forcing your way through levels and bosses you generally have enough HP to get to the next section.  Enemy attacks are not very damaging in general.  If you just keep moving forward and jumping, you'll likely make it to the next section with 2 bits of HP left only to be fully healed on the next section.  Combine this with the fact that you're likely to find 1 or even 2 health ups per section and you're blazing by pretty healthy.

2) Grenades - Strong enough to kill many problematic enemies in one HP as well as abundant enough to never worry about them.  Some minibosses can be killed by simply spamming your grenades a few times.  I like that they are not easy to land and thus grant a bit of a bonus for your effort, though I would have been more appreciative of a slightly less damaging item.

I realize as someone who's played the unholy hell out of Demon's Crest / Gargoyle's Quest II I am probably biased toward more difficult games.  And don't get me wrong, this game isn't 'Easy'.  If the developers wanted a 'Medium' for difficulty, they're certainly not far from it.

I'll be honest - I expected another 'Retro' game that misses the point of going back to the old days.  You guys did not miss that point.  You captured what was fun in these games by meticulously getting the controls and fighting right.  And for that you do deserve praise.  Keep up the good work and Odallus will be just as good, if not better.


Oniken
This game is uncut dope. Awesome graphics, great gameplay, and good replayability if you are into achivements or speedruns. My best time for Oniken is 23:19, I reccomend anyone looking for a hardcore platformer to pick this game up.

Oniken
Its name is Oniken, a remake of Kage from nintendo famicom

Oniken
I've actually died once because I was crouching and standing up so I could pretend I was dancing to the background music.

They got everything right, it really feels like a real NES game with 8 bit graphics and music.
And I'm not talking about those pretentious indie games with pixelated graphics"

Oniken
To those of us that remember the true difficulty of the age of the NES, this game will seem like stepping back to when we were kids staring in front of the huge TVs with our controller in hand, getting upset at the slightest misstep killing us. This game stays true to its form and its homage. A warning though, not for the faint of heart, as most might lose something (be it keyboard or controller).

Oniken
Retro style game. Ninja Gaiden-ish kinda game. Fun game. I died a lot. Would die again.

Oniken
Oniken
Man do I have a lot to say about this game.
I'm already nearing 5 hours and i'm still not done beating the game!
Anyways, I absolutely love this game. By far one of my favouites in my collection.
From art style to gameplay, everything represents NES. (Besides not being able to despawn enemies through screen switching hehe.) I can see myself still playing this once I beat the last missions only because I'll want all these achievements and then eventuall I'll get the foil trading cards for that superb badge!
If you love games that have teeth grinding challenges with old school pixel art style, then this game is for you.

Oniken
If you want to play yourself a hella-NES game, then I'd highly recommend grabbing yourself a copy of JoyMasher's Oniken, because believe me, it's a hella-NES game.

Oniken's reproduction of a retro style goes far beyond its pixelated visuals or its rockin' chiptune soundtrack. It mines the depths of those special things that made games like Contra, Power Blade, and Ninja Gaiden so good. Oniken doesn't just LOOK like the era it's trying to recreate, it feels like it too. Maddening difficulty set on top of a set of simple mechanics and insidious level layouts that will take you more than just a few tries to slash your way through. On top of that, the game packs in lots of fantastic bosses, hugely varied stages, and some very clever throwbacks to the game that inspired it.

While Oniken is definitely a fantastic retro-styled game, it manages to go beyond that by being a pretty damn great action game on top of that.

Oniken
Reminiscent of old NES classics, Oniken is a tough-as-nails game which relies on twitch action and pattern memorization. And, well, it's pretty damn fun! It's really hard on your first way through, but learning the stages bit by bit is one in a whole part of the fun.

If you like the kind of old-school game in the vein of Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi and Castlevania (or even modern classics like Super Meat Boy), you'll probably like this one.

Oniken
Oniken is a merciless Contra-like in which success depends largely on knowing what's coming, which means repeatedly playing through the same area and hopefully making it a little farther each time.  I understand that that kind of gameplay appeals to some people, but it's definitely not my idea of a good time.

Oniken
I can't recommend Oniken because after a certain number of levels, the gameplay becomes un-fun and a trial to slog through (I know, I know. It's NES hard, but that doesn't mean it's fun). The grenades are next to useless if you're not facing a boss and the sword's damage enhance leaves after one hit. I know you must be thinking, Those are just NES game mechanics."

Oniken
Positives:
+ This game will take you back to the late 1980s where NES hard is king.
+ Can be finished in 2 hours. 1 hour more if you try to rescure all hostages in the special mission
+ Good chiptunes
+ Good NES quality aesthetics

Negatives:
- The controls are not tight. I got hit because of missed inputs.
- No auto-fire for attacking. Getting blisters is something I do not miss from the NES days.
- If you get hit, you fall backwards ala early NES games. The problem is that modern games has shown us that this is bad design. Its very frustrating to get sniped and fall to your death
- Weird timing on enemy shots. I played a lot of NES and retro games. Enemies have this 1-2-3 timing. Oniken's enemies has an awkward 1-2-2.5 timing that throws me off.
- Missing startup animations. Its so weird to see your enemies suddenly firing without cheorgraphing their attacks. I understand that they are going for an NES game design, but even old games like Contra will freeze their enemies in ready animation" for a few milliseconds before firing. Because there is no startup animation

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Even though this is a spin-off and not a main Tomb Raider entry, this game is pretty Tomb Raider-tastic.

Lara hunts down an artifact no one should wield and sets off apocalyptic events that only she can stop? YEP.
Plenty of shooting of natural and supernatural enemies in well-paced fight encounters? YEP.
Lots and lots of booby traps to avoid, disarm, or survive? YEP.
Puzzles that usually involve timing, platforming and typical Lara acrobatics? YEP.
Smartass one-liners and quips from Lara almost everytime she opens her mouth? Yep.
Well-placed and often hidden collectibles? Yep.
MANY, MANY GUNS? YEP.
Tomb raiding? You bet!

The controls are snappy and responsive, the puzzles and platforming are very satisfying, and ultimately pretty much everything about the gameplay is rewarding in some way. Every level has a handful of optional objectives you can try to complete for even more rewards -- such as artifacts or relics that boost your stats or combat ability in various ways. The game's visuals and audio both are actually a hell of a lot better than I expected, and I often found myself gleefully looking around to admire the level design or dancing around a boss in time with the boss stage's music.

Bonus: You can play this with a friend, and the game even redesigns much of the levels' puzzles to accomodate 2 players. The second player character, Totec, CANNOT be played on his own, i.e. if you're playing on your own, Lara is your only option. But, well, she's the far cooler option anyway. :P

A tip: Use a controller. The game only fully recognizes Xbox 360 type controllers but you can very easily fool it into accepting others by using a controller emulator (x360ce). Mouse and keyboard controls have much more precise aiming for shooting, but I found they just were too clunky for me for -everything- else.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Short Version:

Pros
+ Great puzzles
+ Good level design
+ Most bosses are great
+ All levels have challenges which enhance the replay value
+ A good amount of collectibles
+ Enjoyable singleplayer
+ Amazing local co-op

Cons
- Paper-thin story
- Cheesy, dumb villain who is also a coward - he runs away from you from start to finish
- Buggy online co-op
- Voice acting is weak
-Cutscenes are lackluster - The characters lips do not move; the camera angles cleverly" change to make that unnoticeable.

"Long" version:

I'm a big Tomb Raider fan and when Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was announced

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Works fine as a nice single player adventure too, but it's best to play in coop mode. Great looking, varied and complex levels with awesome puzzles, tricky traps and some nice action moments. I love how clever some puzzles are, and that there are more than one solutions for some of them, you really need to use all your gears and your brains to solve all the obstacles. The replay value is also good, as you have many weapons, upgrades and challenges to complete. All in all, it's a fun adventure!

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This is an amazing game! A Tomb Raider game from an isometric perspective letting you complete it in coop mode, too! You cannot go wrong with such an approach! You have action, you have puzzles, you have collectibles and you have a very good level design. Some of the collectibles are difficult to obtain so there is replayibility here. Also, some puzzles / challenges are completely different in coop, thus, the game should at least be completed twice (alone and with a friend) for the different experience.

For me Guardian of Light was a nice surprise after the many third-person shooter episodes. Interestingly, the idea and the development came from the same team so this really is a thumbs-up!

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This game have been created especially to play in co-op, and I recommend to play it with gamepads. I really enjoy this game when I play with my girlfriend ;)

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This game is very great for relationships.
My girl kept sabotaging me by bombing me or trapping me with the bombs.
:(
Although to be fair, I kept telling her to jump on my golden rod.
:D

Surprising depth and interesting gameplay for an isometric game.
It has good thoughtful puzzles and the achievements aren't absurd to complete.
The single player and multiplayer use the same maps, but the puzzles are different and require both parties to work together to solve.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is exemplary coop ingenuity.

Transplanting the Tomb Raider franchise onto an isometric shooter, its genius lies not within its clever puzzles or satisfying combat, but the lengths at which it has been designed from the ground up as a brilliant coop experience. It forces you to think with two players in mind instead of opting for the far simpler solution of just dropping another player in beside you, and this devotion makes for refreshingly unique puzzle designs and the means with which you navigate the world.

The focus on teamwork is in large part based on the different character abilities between archaeologist, Lara Croft, and the ancient Mayan warrior, Totec. Each has various gear and moves (from a grappling hook, to a shield that can be raised and jumped on) and it's in using them in tandem that you can manage to make your way through environments that one person couldn't. It inspires cooperation in ways that simply providing double the fire power doesn't, putting you in situations where each player has a specific role and no one feels the lesser for theirs.

It's a fairly radical departure for the series traditional gameplay hooks, but Guardian of Light still feels distinctly Tomb Raider. Though the perspective has changed and there's less of an emphasis on platforming, there are still plenty of supernatural monsters to kill and tombs to raid, with puzzles that are probably the best the series has ever seen. They revisit many of the same designs but in a way that's constantly layering on new challenges, requiring you continue expanding your perception of them even when on the surface they're born of the same basic template.

I don't doubt that it's entirely possible to play Guardian of Light as a solo adventure and have a good amount of fun with it, but to me that would be missing a huge portion of what makes it so enjoyable. There's just nothing quite like the sort of beautiful coop design presented with a game like this, with playing with friends already being generally more entertaining and something so tailor made to that playstyle elevating it to new heights. There's something really special to me about games that can serve as essentially bonding moments between friends and family, and ones as smart and polished as this are all too rare.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Review by xKraykoz [Eric]

The game Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is fun game.
There is option to play story as a single player or Co-Op with a friend [which would mean harder puzzles, teamwork, more fun].

Pros:
- Good level design
- Cool bosses
- Nice puzzels
- Lots of weapons
- Challenges [good for replaying same map over and still enjoy it]
- Nice voice acting
- CO-OP
- Leaderboard
- Easy Achievements

Story sadly was not that great but not so bad either.

Only thing that bothered me was the DLC's are really not worth of buying.
-The Charecter pack Kain and Raziel"

Its a shame they didnt take notes from Guardian of Light when developing the most recent reboot of Tomb Raider. While Lara croft in the most recent core entry in the Tomb Raider series is trying her best to shed all the enjoyable puzzles and adventuring that made the series famous to instead become the new quick time event action movie star and dethrone Drake from Uncharted, Lara Croft in the Guardians of Light offers everything that made Tomb Raider great.

The game is centered on fast paced action combat, exploration, and completing various interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles.  Unlike the core entries in the franchise, Guardians of Light takes the approach of having players control the game from an isometric view point, this type of view point allows for a very enjoyable seamless co-op mode experience.

As far as visuals go theres nothing in this game that will overwhelm you, but for an isometric view game from 2010 it holds up very well. The level design on the other hand is absolutely brilliant, offering a wide variety of puzzles ranging from one room dungeons to entire expansive multi-tomb map sized puzzles. The puzzles are normally completed through various interactions between Lara and her co-op companion Totec, the Guardian of Light. Each character plays slightly different from one another, each with their own pros and cons, Totec is bulkier and has a shield so he fits more into the role of a tank, he also uses throwing spears as his primary weapon that can also be used to make platforms for the much lighter and more nimble and agile Lara Croft. Totec can also raise his shield above his head to use as a platform and then Lara can use her grappling hook to pull up Totec or make rope bridges for him to climb up. There are many instances in the game where you are put into a situation where you have to act very quickly and rely heavily on your partner to either lift you into the right position or to carry you to safety before you are either crushed, mauled, or mutilated, and in these intense, fast paced, high pressure situations is where the game shines.

The combat handles just the way youd expect it to for an isometric view arcade shooter. There arent really any complaints as long as you arent the guy who gets stuck as player 2 using a gamepad controller, because youll be SoL and instead of a crosshair you will get stuck with the tiniest little light that shines on the wall in the direction you are facing as your point of reference for the general area in which youll be firing. This honestly wouldnt be that bad, when you see the light it works really well, but the problem is that its constantly being hidden behind objects in the foreground and you have to blindly fire at enemies while you franticly search for your little light. The game does offer a fairly extensive variety of weapons to choose from, from pistols to assault rifles to flame throwers, theyre all present and accounted for.  Each character has their own primary weapon; Laras being her pistols and Tecos being his throwing spears, both of which have unlimited ammunition, all of the other weapons are useable by both characters and their ammunition is monitored by a depleting ammo bar below your health bar that is replenished by the abundant ammo drops located on the map and from enemy drops.

The game tries to shake things up and keep the gameplay from feeling stale by adding various challenges for each level such as reach the end of the level by X amount of time, or blow up a certain number of random objects placed throughout the map. Completion of these challenges result in acquiring a unique perk or item that can be applied to your character to greatly aid you in your adventures.  An example of the most beneficial perk I came across during my adventures was a perk that became activated if I managed to chain together a large enough kill streak without being injured by any enemies, my gun would then switch over to rapid triple shot mode and allow me to plow through hordes of enemies like a true bonafide bad . The best part is that all the perks and items you acquire are useable on both characters, so you dont have to worry about your partner hording the juicy loot.

Overall Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light provides an excellent experience that becomes even that much more enjoyable when played with a friend in co-op. The fast paced action combat is thrilling and there is an abundance of quality puzzles that keeps you engaged and entertained. With the only complaint being minor control issues for player 2, the Guardian of Light is truly a game worth buying and enjoying alongside a friend.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Good controls, fun levels, probably one of the best local co-op games around. Works well with 360 or compatible gamepads.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This game is great for Co-op play. The puzzle and actions are not hard but enjoyable. Check points are awesome, too. I highly recommend it if you want something to play with friends.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Nothing was better for my relationship than Guardian of Light, because it taught me to never trust my girlfriend when I cross a pit of spikes.



The experience of playing GoL can easily be compared to Trine, and approaches the same level of co-op/ killing each other excellence. GoL is a mixture of puzzles, combat, arcade elements, and platforming all done from an isometric perspective. Most of the puzzles are clever and juggle between challenging players finesse and problem solving skills. There are deadly traps to avoid, and a fun physics system helps transform something as mundane as a boulder into basketball, transportation, or even makeshift artillery. A lot of these shenanigans will lead to player death, but that is also part of the fun.

The combat is a mix of shooting and planting bombs that are detonated remotely. The controls feel tight, and dodge rolling keeps combat fair and exciting. Combat is also the area where the arcade elements are strongest: each level has a set of various challenges that are completed to boost score and unlock new items directly. The unlocks ranges from new weapons to stat boosts and offers players a healthy amount of options when comes to fighting foes. The arcade style of challenges also pushes players to die less, complete levels faster, and complete some neat tasks. None of the challenges ever get in the way of enjoying the game, and are generally a mix of things that can be done easily on the way to completing the campaign, and more difficult tasks that require practice.

The absolute most important aspect of the game is the cooperative experience. Having someone to race with leaping across platforms, blow up with bombs, drop into a pit of spikes, leave behind, lock into cages, lead into traps, and just betray in general is a large part of what makes this game fun. Lara and her partner Totec are designed to rely on each other: he has a spear that hes too fat to climb on but can help Lara reach new areas or a shield to lift and shield Lara, and she a grappling that can support the elephant that is Totec. Co-op also allows players to revive each other, which comes in handy when killing each other. Throughout the game it is simply a lot of fun to work together to find secrets, complete challenges, win, and mess around in general. With every person I play this game with, we end up making our own little challenges and games: balancing on a boulder as we mow down enemies, tag, horse with explosives and boulders, testing how far we can fall into spikes before being saved, etc. and it is an excellent diversion.

Lara Croft and The Guardian of Light hits all the marks of a great spinoff and a great co-op experience. I had more fun with this than any other Tomb Raider game, so much so that I bought it multiple times on different platforms. The levels are well designed, the mechanics all feel balanced, and the game is well paced. Sure there is a story that can easily be ignored, but that pushes the game towards an arcade experience focused on having fun with your friends. Out of all the local co-op games I have played, including the old console days, GoL easily ranks high up on the list. That being said, solo is pretty fun on its own, but never quite reaches the same level of satisfaction.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This is a awesome game. It's lots of challenges in games that are REALLY hard. The co-op is funny and challenging - the graphic is good. I loved this game! 10/10
Thank you Aleksander for giving me this :)

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Love It x)

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
A great diversion from the Tomb Raider series. Excellent co-op elements. If you want to introduce a girlfriend to gaming, this is the game as it includes local co-op and other appealing elements, and is not too difficult. Some challenging puzzles and the game is fast paced and full of action.

Excellent re-play value because each level will have multiple goals that you can achieve, like doing level speedruns, or colloecting all the skulls and powerups etc. Each goal will give you rewards, also, once you've played through all the levels, you get to keep all your artifacts/weapons that you obtained, making the second play through easier if you like, but you can also increase level difficulty when it gets too easy.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Nice little couch co-op action puzzle. No network co-op though. Best played with gamepads.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This game doesn't get enough credit. It's fun, exciting, easy to learn but challenging if you want it. It's co-op mode is really well done and I honestly wouldn't recommend playing this alone if you can play it with a friend. Movement feels really responsive but this game begs analog movement so you should probably grab a pad. The story is paper thin but the thrills and intelligent puzzle and level design more than make up for it.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This game is pretty good and kinda surprised me.Its in short a top down Tomb Raider game.Kinda feels like a hack n slash mixed in with a puzzle game.The controlls are pretty tight and can use controller or Keyboard and Mouse.The game has SIngle Player and Co-Op so thats pretty neat.One player takes control over Lara and they other plays as Totec an ancient Mayan warrior and leader of the Army of Light.So do you have what it takes to stop the evil Xolotl !! If you do give this game a go.

P.S cant wait for Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light 2 !! =D

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
I enjoyed this game a lot, great level design, nice puzzles, nice overall gameplay.
I played this game completely on coop,which was super fun, the puzzles were just perfect, not too hard and not too easy. The level objectives were fun to aim for and the rewards were very cool, new weapons and relics, which can alter the power of your character, like more movement speed, more damage on weapons, more bomb explosion etc.
The game sometimes gets a bit buggy, nothing game breaking, but you are definitely going to find some bugs when you play.I also found the game to be a bit short, it was super fun, but for me it could maybe have 3 or 4 campaign levels.
I don't recommend the dlc tough, just skins and level challenges, with puzzles and score(killing enemys) being the only ones available, i was hoping for more campaign content, not random challenges.
Overall i recommend this game, fast paced combat, nice weapons nice puzzles, nice game :), and of course play it with a friend, its always more fun :)

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Short Verdict: A great shoot-and-blast" (how I call "hack-and-slash" games with guns and bombs) adventure game with heavy puzzle elements

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This is a simple but really fun co-op game - it's really cheap at the moment so you might as well get it for a friend and yourself. It can get quite intense at some parts but it's definitely an enjoyable game (although watch out for the glitchy bits - swapping your characters can help). The soundtrack and graphcs, although nothing special, are still well matched with the game, and overall, playing this game as multiplayer is really really fun.
PLUS PLAYING WITH MY BABE #1 FROG IS SOOO HOT #teamwerkbich

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Enjoyable mix of rpg-style skirmishes, platforming & puzzles/traps.
Challenging but not punishing.
Not a great variety of foes, but each area is interesting & there is some replayability with various challenges (time, loot, etc.).
It's a fair buy, especially on sale.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Brilliant game ! Really addictive gameplay and excellent co-op gameplay. Can be played solo just as well by the way. (but is still more fun when you play it with a friend).

This is not your standard action adventure-Tomb Raider game. The game has an isometric view and is all about small puzzles and killing enemies, while still collecting treasures. The awesome graphics really add to the atmosphere and the level (not Steam) achievements keep things fresh and interesting, with a high replayability.

As I said before, the game truly shines in co-op mode where you actually have to depend on each other to complete objectives.

Lara Croft And The Guardian Of Light lasts about 6-7 hours or so, depending on if you're a collector or not.

Highly recommended !

[Rating: 88/100]

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
A new adventure means another story unfolds.
This games takes on a new perspective, not like Tomb Raider's fps (and that's why this is Lara Croft and simply not Tomb Raider - you'll probably read some reviews about people complaining about first person and third person). Overall, great combat allows you to show off your fighting skills and puzzles to get your brain going. Single player achievements are easy enough except the one where it asks you to collect all relics

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Not a typical Tomb Raider game. This is a cartoony looking tomb raider that is a top down action game. Its a moderately fun time waster. My biggest issue with the game is that controls are a little clunky at times.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Very good and fun game to play, especially with friends and family :D It's working very good for me, no crashes or freezes, overall performance is very good even with many enemies on the screen. The puzzles are very interesting and I loved those ''treasure'' tombs. I finished it with my brother and we both enjoyed this game very much!

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
single player = good

co-op = great

i use controller and i think this game is good and fun <3
(i didnt try keyboard so i cant judge about that)


for people who dont like games easily , you can try the demo  so you dont buy it and cry and rage on here.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This more Tomb Raider then new Tomb Raider.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
So far so good. A great co-op game. I can not speak for single player.
It does a really good job of making it a team effort and is fast paced fun.

Not your average tomb raider but in a good way.

Very easy to setup for local co-op. Keyboard + mouse or controller are a very comfortable gaming experience.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Good isometric action.
Some of the achievements are really hard! I had so much butthurt when I was trying to earn time challenges on a few levels. Almost broke my keyboard, can't even imagine what would happen if I used the gamepad.
Puzzles are interesting and tied to game mechanics. Also they're allowed to be completed with different ways.
Unfortunately, camera is awful.
Co-op works fine, I liked to play with my friend who was Totec.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a great game overall. You get a great Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter game mixed with Puzzles you need to solve and a wealth of collectibles to find! This will definitely take you some time to play through the whole adventure and collect everything as there is just so much to collect and so many challenges to solve. I completed Story Mode in Single Player which is a great way to sharpen your skills if you have never played a Tomb Raider game before, but the Multiplayer is also nice. I prefer Single Player as I can get challenges done on my own time and can explore the land freely, but the Multiplayer has some nice advantages and the good part is you can actually play the game with one of your friends!! Aside from the Challenges and Multiplayer, you have a great arsenal of weapons. Anywhere from Spears and Flamethrowers to Pistols and Rocket Launchers, this game will keep you busy trying to choose what weapons you want (as you can only have four equipped, however you can always change them out in one of the Menus.) I still have not quite 100% completed this game. This game will keep you playing for a while after you buy it! If you are willing to spend a little extra dough, the Challenge Packs are always a great add-on. While not incredibly long, they are challenging and it's nice to see if you can beat the time trial they have set (let me tell you they take some strategy and thinking if you are going to go for a Time Trial.) I don't like the Character Packs though. I don't even use them. They are just sitting there in my DLC Menu. To some people it may be a nice addition but I don't use them so I can't say much about them. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan as you can probably tell by the Profile Picture and I own all of the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft games to date. This is definitely a great edition to the Tomb Raider and Lara Croft series and I recommend it to people who like Tomb Raider and to people who like Third Person Action-Adventure Shooter and Puzzle games!

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Funny co-op experience,interesting puzzles.
I played local co-op with brother,because i didn't find anyone to play online(only few times).

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
A good game, but I don't fall asleep dreaming about how great it is either.

The game can be played in single player or in coop.

The action starts almost immediately - which, on one hand, means you aren't bored for 3 hours before the game actually starts, but on the other hand means there is very little plot development before the action begins. And this doesn't get much better during the game - pretty much all of the plot development takes place either before or after the game.

The game is easy to learn, and a bit too easy to master. The combat is exciting and dynamic, and the multitude of weapons means more and more ways to destroy your enemies. The puzzles are at the perfect level of challenge - they aren't incredibly easy, but they aren't so hard you spend an hour just trying to find out how to get a boulder from point A to B.

The achievement system makes this game definitely worth another run, and there's plenty of DLC out there for when you finish the main story. The action sequences and boss battles are entertaining and challenging (though some of the bosses are a bit on the easy side).

I was not expecting this game to be this good, voice acting not super, music average, but over all I can't stop loving it.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Obviously a console game, and one that hasn't been well translated to a PC because the way the menu keys are done really sucks, Quite often we found ourselves trapped in the menu system, unable to get back to the game. Apart from that, the wonderful graphics and the sheer playability of the game more than make this worth buying. The game is a lot faster paced than previous games. Many of the puzzles are bonuses off to one side of the main game, so they don't stop you proceeding if you can't solve them. And puzzles are not too hard.  It usually only takes a minute or two to tackle one.
The game really is intended for coop play, the two sets of skills compliment each other, the two character really do work together to get through the game. although very cleverly they made subtle changes to the single player so it can be played solo.
So, all in all, it's great. Buy it.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Suprisingly fun game, good challenging puzzles but rarely too taxing or frustrating. Well worth a Steam sale price.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Note: I only review when I finish the game.

So much fun and hilarious, but it is better to be played with a partner. Laughed several times when one killed the other unintentionally. The puzzles are intelligent, making us to want the game to last more just to enjoy more and more. 9/10

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
LC: GoL is a much more arcade-like game than many of the others in the Tomb Raider franchise, but it is no less fun to play.

The story follows Lara and Totec as they attempt to prevent Xolotl from destroying the world. The story is told through various means within the game, from narration at the start to comic and live" cutscenes. This could have possibly been made more consistent throughout

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
90% of the game in multiplayer is Totec falling to his death cus he's too heavy to grapple.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Not a great game, but it's fun. The full game is about 8 hours of play.

More importantly, it's one of the best local co-op games available. (Two player, one computer).


Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Good game,
Pros:
-Graphic
-Lovely gameplay
-X360 Pad support
-Music
-Control
-Archivements
-A lot of fun
-Traps
Cons:
-Story, this is a big mistake xD
-Too short, only 14 levels

Final Score: 9/10

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
great to play with friends : )

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
This game es easily ment for local player coop or coop only.
The level of care , design of puzzles, environment and gameplay makes it easily
the best coop game (3rd person) I've ever played.
Wife and I are playing local Coop, still on the main story but willing to play all DLC as well.
It's so good that I dare to say forget about the single player, ditch it.
If you have a friend /partner to coop with, and you haven't played this game,
you willl be sorry.


Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
So, here's a little hidden gem from Eidos/Square Enix: Take one of your best-known franchises, strip off the name, and re-do it as a twin-stick shooter. Do keep the puzzles & non-shooty action segments. Then, for good measure add in a co-op mode where puzzles are re-worked to actually require 2 people to solve. Oh, and make sure the levels are designed for fun.

Despite the genre-shift, and despite being a non-canon spin-off, this game does keep the Tomb Raider spirit, and is pretty solid. Main game isn't too long (I'm close to the end in 6 hrs, and taking my sweet time), but various challenges and such help extend that. (Speed-run and score-mode challenges on the levels in particular).
You get equipment upgrades from the challenges as well (any required weapons you will find in the wild though) - the later ones are pretty powerful, and especially the relics can border on being broken - only kept in check by the fact that they'll stop working for a while if you take any damage.

And like with the older Tomb Raider games, blindly rushing in will get you killed more often than not. Better keep an eye out for the various tells & signs, and make sure you time your jumps correctly.

The game does have one annoying bug: It'll just crash if you die frequently enough on the same map.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
(I decided to make a review for this game because it was one of the first digital titles i played and loved,
opening the doors for me to indie titles. And also, because its sequel is right around the corner!)

Forget Tomb Raider!
No, i dont mean to insult the revolutionary franchise, i'm a long time fan myself. I mean this game has
little to do with it's main franchise, at least gameplay-wise.

Or maybe not!
-The scenarios are magnificent temples, ruins and... tombs!
-There are a ton of traps, which means a lot of platforming.
-There's also a lot of epic puzzles (in sense and scale).
-The combat is very fluid and intense, with a lot of variety in the weapons department.
-The story is decent, if only a bit relegated into background.
-There are very few characters... but one of them is Lara Croft, and she's amazing! I wish there was more dialogue, though.
-The sounds and music... well, i dont remember! But that's probably a good thing, 'fitting', i say.
-The collectibles. So many relics and artefacts and stuff to collect, truly an explorer's fantasy.

About the coop, i tried it very little, but it seems to be well implemented and make an already great experience,
even better.
Maybe im a bit biased, but this is one of the best digital titles i've played and i highly recommend it to anyone
who wants 'the whole package' in a game, and is not afraid of some isometric views!

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
Lara Croft and the Gaurdian of Light is an isometric platforming-puzzle game developed by crystal dynamics.


Plot
Lara is on the search for the Mirror of Smoke thought loss long ago in Central America. The mirror was originally formed by the keeper of darkness, Xolotl, to unleash monsters into the world. His nemesis Totec, the gaurdian of light, used the mirror against Xolotl and sealed him within the object. Many years later, Lara finds the mirror hidden within a temple. Unfortunately, she is ambushed by mercenaries who carelessly take the mirror and releases Xolotl and Totec from their slumber. With Xolotl free to unleash his monsters on the worldagain, Lara must work with Totec to stop Xolotl.


Gameplay
The game is a mixture of puzzle solving, platforming and combat. Each level sets you in a stage where you have to solve puzzles and platform around in order to progress. Along the way there are a wide range of enemies such as spiders, monsters, giants and skeletons, some of which have unique strengths and weaknesses. You also find plenty of traps such as explosives, spike traps, flame traps and pitafalls which will hinder your progress.  There are also unique challenges in each stage which when completed will offer either upgrades, artefacts or weapons. You have a health and ammo bar. Should your health depelte, you will restart at the latest checkpoint and lose score. There are plenty of weapons to find such as pistols, assault rifles, smg, minigun, sniper and spears each with different stats. There are also artifacts which give you a bonus of different stats.


Controls
The controls work well with a mouse and keyboard, however ther were instances where it was difficult to compplete challeneges and platforming due to key arrangement. I would highly recommend you use a controller.


Graphics
The visuals in the game are decent. The environment looks good with plenty of objects and flauna around which a well detaled. The character models, unfortunately don't look good with lack of texture detail.


Sound
Audio is a mix between good and not so good. The sound effects for weapons, traps and such are great. background music is good as well. While Lara's voice acting is good, Totec and Xotl aren't that great.


Extras
As you play the game, you get score based on how well you performed in each level. When you reach a certain scroe threshhold, you unlock new costumes for Lara to use. There is also a free Kane and Lynch character DLC included witht he base game. Similar to the Kane and Azarael DLC, this basically changes the character models and some dialogue during campaign.


Overall if you are looking for a good tomb raider game to play with a friend or by yourself, this is the game for you.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light
GoL is a different experience than the regular" 'Tomb Raider' games. It's full of fun

This was really a surprise, great game with a 360 controller, had more fun so far with this than with the classic TR series.

Early Access Review

I am making this post for my guild as well as several other frustrated players on the forums that have been deprived a voice. My hours are not high but many of them were not logged to steam. Consider this a shared experience based on what I have not only experienced directly but witnessed many other players experiencing. The unhelpful votes at the top are most likely going to pile up as the griefer guild and admins find this post. Just look at its contents and decide for yourself.

Don't get this game. It might look ok at first but the melee combat is roughly based on circling around the opponent repeatedly and smacking them in the rear quarters then rinse repeat. The diversity is mostly just reskin of the same character types.

In addition, PVE is full of griefers which we as well as several other groups on the server were suffering from due to their use of exploits and/or hacks to grief while in PVE. They would hack into bases and destroy generators/shields/etc of every other player that wasn't from their little group. The server in question was EU 9 and the players in question do not attempt to hide their actions even on the forums admitting to it. That is the treatment new players were given once they had set up a protected base that should be protected from destruction. We had plenty of wood for 5+ days in the generator but exploits were used against us and basically every other player on this server. Due to the fact the moons are connected it means other servers were effected as well.

What happened when we tried to bring this to admin attention via email and steam correspondence? We were blocked and the players are still doing exploits and destroying peoples protected pve structures to this day.
Wow. Talk about -fantastic- moderation.

Alot of people would say to move to a new server however in this game that would require starting over and this player seems to do this kind of thing on multiple servers and/or moons so that wouldn't really help. If admin action were taken, like it should have been, the problem would be solved.

Currently, expect to lose your stuff to griefers even in PVE and expect the admins to do nothing about it.

You might ask WHY it is that noone has done anything about *names omitted due to political red tape in steam TOS*?

By my research of simply looking at publically available shared friends lists and the fact that I was ignored by the admin as are their griefing posts on the forums.. I'd say they know each other. There you have it. Nepotism. It is the only rational explanation I was able to come up with to explain the ultimately either lazy or malicious lack of action.

A player that uses hacks and/or exploits to glitch into peoples PVE bases and destroy everything including chests and spends 90% of their time bragging in global chat that they are on their train" of destruction then also brags on the forums will get away with it due to poor support for this game.

The game wasn't really anything to write home about before the fact that exploiting griefers can destroy your chests even in PVE game modes and force your entire guild to start over on a new server that may suffer the same problem.
The game looks somewhat flashy but there really isn't anything to do for a sandbox and the building and gameplay are rather limited and poorly balanced. A similar game that is in development that might need support is Planet Explorers. Really

Early Access Review

Landed on an alien planet with a knife (now you get a club) and a multitool.  Only hint I got was get wood and fossils to make an armory (they have added a great tutorial that gives you exp and mats as you do basic tasks now).  Saw a giant flying alien bug and poked it with my knife, it expolded with a squish sound.  Repeated several times to hear the squish sound.  Accidentally ran into a bug that made me make a squish sound.

Made an armory and got a rusty gun and killed the bug that squished me.

Found a cave but there was a big pit in it.  The monsters chased me to the edge of the pit.  I fell in.  Second time I built a bridge over the pit and stood there pointing and laughing at the stupid monsters.  Monsters destroyed the bridge while I was standing on it.  They pointed and laughed as I fell to my death again.

This game is a blast!  It has survival elements, but no so hard core that you have to count how many M&Ms you have left in your pocket before you die.  It also has RPG elements where you can upgrade some skills (active and passive) and get new jobs that have a new set of skills with them. And you can build.  Building is fairly simpled but lots of fun.  You can also make a variety of weapons, armor and vehicles...like monocyle, jetpacks, tanks and jets.

You will die...you will laugh...and you will die some more while you learn.  The folks playing are helpful and fun.  This game is more than worth the money right now and is being patched frequently.

My best advice is to build a little base as soon as you get a shield generator blueprint.  Use it to store your extra mats so if you die you don't loose much.  You DO NOT drop your armor, ammo, or weapons when you die, just a percentage of your mats on hand.  You can also train a skill up to reduce how much you drop.

There are PK gankers of course, but there are anti-PKers as well that tend to balance it out.  You will get PKed.  The best thing to do is Don't Panic!  You are much more likely to survive if you keep your head and fight back.  Or run around some cover and pop and invis stim and run away.

Updated a bit.  There has been much patching and improving recently.  The game is better than ever.  The player base has grown after a recent free weekend.  There is so much to do in this game you shouldn't get bored.

Yes it can be a big grindy at times as some people have asked.  I don't find it bothersome.  You can have about 8 different jobs, which are like classes.  You can level each one seperatly or just focus on one.   Each comes with benefits.  I don't find lvling up other jobs that hard as I gather mats while I level.  You can hot swap any job at any time just in your inventory screen and any passives that you train remain no matter what job you have active.

Openworld, scifi style sandbox survival and building.  Try it!  You just might like it.

JANUARY REVIEW.
Loving this game so far, community is great. Most people tend to cooperate and explore with each other and disregard PVP. The potential is very very great in this game, I personally love it. The building, resources. Visuals are stunning. 10/10. The other negative reviews probably are just on the wrong servers and doing the wrong things. I'm having a very smooth time and so far there are no game killing bugs as of now. Respawning is designated with a craftable item and putting away resources is also achieved by making an item. Both that are very easy and cheap to make. See you in game!

Update: After an extensive amount of gameplay I quickly grew tired of it, I constantly stuck with the game hoping that an update will fix lag issues and after some few updates it did, but what got me was the leveling and crafting. Grinding was like a Job, you are forced to do it or you won't get anywhere. I'm talking in the sense that building a decent base will take almost half a REAL life day. Then the amount it takes to actually make the item takes away almost half of your resources you spent grinding for about 30 minutes. I am sad to say that I have left this game, it has potential yes it does but the image it's creating now is not the image I saw in my head when I saw this game on greenlight. I expected Borderlands/Minecraft/Terraria. Crazy adventures and fast paced action with some nice base building that is easy and fast. Maybe next time I'll come back to this game but for now it's out of my To Play List.

JUNE REVIEW
So I just took a look at the summer trailer and it still displays so much misleading and flashy visuals that can instantly capture a person who takes a big interest in suvival open world games such as me.

Definitely not Open World, It's just one piece of a huge land with only mobs and resources laying about with a few dungeons, nothing to interact with, just a barren wasteland. The combat is a looping cycle of meleeing and backing off, or with guns it's just unloading bullets on the mobs.Jetpacks take years to make, the fuel it uses is also a pain to get. PVP is still laggy and somewhat broken. Monocycles don't go as fast as you really think they do. Building the claim" in this trailer would take IRL days to make considering all the resource farming you'd have to do. Still waiting for that lovely overhaul to resource gathering and actual things to do in the game rather than just kill mobs

Early Access Review

Before I review, I do want to mention, this is essentially a BRAND NEW GAME as the Reborn update has dropped.  It's radically different from what the game was, so in my opinion most of the reviews prior to mine are no longer accurate.

I'll keep it short.  This is one of the most unique games I've ever played, it's essentially a dedicated-server based online RPG with some slight survival influences, extensive base building, fun sci-fi, and an awesome resource centric progression system.  It's very much like starbound in this fact.

Pros:

-You can travel to other planets as you level up, they rotate on a loop about 3 planets per tier so it never seems to get boring.
-Very diverse crafting system
-Persistent vehicle like Dune Buggies, tanks, jets, etc.  Prepare yourself for epic endgame battles over territory.
-Territory system!  You can conque grids and form mini kingdoms on each individual planet having separate grids.
-Class system - allows you to specialize or diversify, this game is all about choice
-This game is very fun with friends
-Complex PvP and raiding system.  Guys can't just show up with pickaxes and raid your base like some survivals
-It's a very playable Alpha game, DEFINITELY worth it for the price
-PvP is balanced, gear is a factor but a dude with a t1 pistol can very realistically challenge a top tier player

Cons:

-This could be a pro or a meh" depending on your mindset

Early Access Review

Played this game for around 270 hours, also reached the endgame long time ago. Let's sum it up:
PROS
-nice graphics
-the idea of multiple planets and moons with different hazard conditions
-official servers divided on PvE and PvP
-the game has a lot of potential
-lots of weapons to choose from (also balanced)
-many different resources to get
-great community (at least on EUR PvE server, which i played on)
CONS
-resources' and monsters' grindfest to the point of extreme boredom
-more than half of all planets (except homeworlds) look similar or identical
-only around 11-12 type of monsters
-building anything more complicated than a simple cube is frustrating
-there is a single player mode, but use it only for a tutorial to learn basic things - advancement is impossible there (unless You play 1000 hours) because of the way resource nodes spawn (multi is fine)

And the last, most important one - LITTLE TO NO UPDATES SINCE HALF A YEAR! There were some small patches, that brought new hats (hooray...) and a few changes in game rules on official servers, but there's a complete lack of new content since October and no major bugs were fixed throughout those few months. The devs' support and contact is also greatly lacking.

Would i recommend this game? Right now - no. As i mentioned - great potential, but squashed by people with no heart to finish their product.
If so, then why did I play it for so long? I guess I just like to finish things, also other people on the server made it more fun to play.

GRAV
Early Access Review

Game is ruled by high level players.  Being there is 0 risk to them they spend most of their time taxing (as in they gain a percentage of all the resources you farm) and killing low level players and destroying anything they want whenever they're bored.  You can't do anything to stop them but watch what you have built be destroyed and you have start over.  Luckily your levels and equipment don't reset on death, but you'll lose most your resources and the people who killed you can take the rest.  At least with other survival games, the risk to them is bigger the more they have.  So you're not always constantly attacked.

The combat is also boring.  You have several jobs to try to make the game look like there is a reason to keep grinding.  The jobs offer new passive skills and active skills to use, but don't offer any gameplay differences.  They are there strictly to drain your time.  Because when you start a new job you start with level 0 stats.  Even with your more powerful gear you'll have to go through the same grind as when you first started.  You'll have to do this on all the jobs if you want all the percs.  But unlike a MMO where the classes/jobs would offer unique gameplay, Grav offers no such thing and it's strictly there as a time sink.

And all the monsters of the world are pretty samey as well.  Even as you gain new levels and go to new places you'll fight the same monster over and over.  And most monsters even of different kinds have the same attacks.  Most have some sort of spit attack and those that don't have a small AoE.  That's it for diversity.  Speaking of the worlds.  Theyre pretty small.  Those big worlds they show in the trailer?  Thats about the size of em.  Very small.

So there you have it.  Grav, a game where you get tortured and picked on by the few high levels, while grinding against the same boring monsters, farming the same resources, so that one day you can be a high level to pick on the low level guys as well, because there is no endgame besides that.

It really isnt worth your time, this game has nowhere to progress.  A cross between a survival game and an MMO and not very good at either.

Early Access Review

Asked a question, got an reply from a dev within 3 hours. 11/10

Now all jokes aside, this game has potential. It seems like combination of Rust and your average RPG, combined in a Multiplayer experience--don't get this confused with an MMO experience. The world looks amazing right now, but what else would you expect from a UnrealEngine game. The base game seems to be a level grind and resource grind to build your house/town/city!? Probably like you, I thought the video/pictures were misleading--like usual, but it's NOT, the game actually looks that good. However, you will encounter some bugs from time to time.

EDIT:
After playing for 25+ hours, the GUI is no longer complicated, and you'll know what to do and how to get it!

Pros:
-Decent EA game, with decent content for now.
-Really good looking.
-Tons and tons to explore.
-Base building.

Cons:
-Bad GUI.
-Hard to understand what to do and how to get for instance a Generator.
-Servers are really really laggy, pretty much all of them.
-No Linux Dedi Server support, yet.

Early Access Review

This game is tons of fun, devs are active they reply on steam forums and keep on patching bugs.

The game has vibrant colors. Imagine Rust and Planet Explorers had a baby and named it GRAV.

I have played 5 hours straight, was killed in PvP once, owned by flying bugs, made friends, built a base with them, explored caves. The game has tons of potential, but requires your patience, I believe as more players join, more servers will come up, creating another succesful survival game, but this time with a different feel to it!

Totally recommend the game for those who understand what Early Access Games with tons of potential require.

Edit 1: after playing even more, I've noticed some bugs but they never ruined the fun! the only issue is the lag at times, but the devs are working on it!

Edit2: crowded servers tend to lag a bit more than servers with 8-16 people on is what I noticed from trying out different servers. The game is enjoyable in less crowded servers at current state.

Edit3: as of Patch 4, the lag has been reduced and server performance really improved. Looking forward to future updates.

Edit4: as of the 18th of January, Patch 7 is released, more improvements (CPU/GPU-wise) in bay as well as further graphical enhancements. see the announcments for further info.

I don't know anymore. Still positive though.

21st of May 2016: I miss GRAV </3

GRAV
Early Access Review

First of all,note that GRAV doesn't have the 'survival' element in it.The RPG element is the most dominant one in this game.You don't have 'hunger' 'thirst' bar like those true survival games.GRAV is a hybrid between TPS,open world,and RPG.

Pros :
+ Beautiful graphics ! Like PlanetSide 2,some places can make quite a scenery and I love it ! Just remember to turn Post Processing ON.
+ Cool vehicles designs with a wide range of variety,from wingsuits to fighter jets,each with its upgraded version that consume less fuel and have more speed.
+ Humor element included.Dancing Gangnam Style beside a campfire with a dubstep music will replenish your health and stamina.You can also poop anywhere you want.
+ Fun building.Bases are some kind of your personal trophy,and designing it is a lot of fun,especially preparing your base to punish griefers.
+ Your character can do a lot of emotions,it decreases the crude feeling of the game.For example,you can wave,you can clap,you can vomit,you can say hi,you can salute,etc.
+ Very friendly and supportive community.They will help you level up,they will help you farm,they will give you high level weapons and multitools,they will guide you,and some of them will give you a ride to certain places if you don't have a vehicle yet.(Asia 01 server)
+ Very active and communicative devs that will help you with any kind of in-game issue
+ New players won't suffer from high level players,since there's some kind of protection policy on Asia 01 server.High level players who kill new players will get punished by the level 300 guy.Big shoutout to Klipwc for the great guide and his support for new players.

Cons :
- Game performance is dreadful.You will experience crashes mid-game,connection interruptions (ur character blinks around the map),fps spikes,ping spikes,endless loading screen,game suddenly not responding after loading,and sometimes,you will have to wait around 25 minutes after loading for the map around you to load.During this wait time,the map around you will refresh constantly and you will get 5 to 20 seconds freeze each time you try to move.The problem is from the game itself.High end gaming PCs won't fix this.
- Spotlights will drop your fps to 5-10 if you fly near them,despite your strong PC spec
- Very few players(2-10 players each server).This is due to the high system requirements and the current state of the game.
- Needs a lot of time to farm.The resources you get from the sources are so low that it makes the majority of time you will spend in the game is for farming.
- Monster spawning system still require a lot of work.Monsters still spawn behind you,on top of you,or sometimes doesn't spawn at all even if I already waited for 15 minutes.Imagine high level bosses spawn on top of your head.
- If a lot of people play this game,this game will not be ready for 32 players on each server.I'm sure it will increase the loading time,and your bases will get destroyed everyday.People will attack each other for the resources,since it will take a long time to farm,and they will also try to get the 100 kill hat trophy.
- You will lose 90% of your resource when you die (50% if you maxed your Astronaut skill).As I said before,this game is not ready for 32 players.Imagine 32 hostile players attack each other for resources and no high level player protect the new players.It will be a total chaos.Bases will be destroyed easily by the players that already has rocket launchers or tanks.Losing 90% of resource is a pretty ridiculous system and it's one of the biggest factor that make this game isn't ready for 32 players.
- Classic RPG mentality problem.Some high level players are very proud of their bases,vehicles,weapons,etc.They show off their things everyday to the new players and tell them to do stupid things for their amusement.
-Griefers alert.Griefers are extremely annoying in this game and one of them are very active going around the servers to troll.They will destroy your bases,change your signs,steal your resources,etc.All experienced players are currently hunting griefers even though it's very hard to find and punish them,since they always move from server to server.Beware for M.F Thatherson.He is the infamous griefer that goes around the servers.
- New player spawn point system is ridiculous.There is a chance for you to spawn inside hostile base even though it's your first time playing.Auto turrets will shred new players that're the victim of this spawning system.I was forced to leave my old base because I accidentaly built it on the noob spawn point.
- You need 16 gigs of RAM if you want to run your own server,and at least 8 gigs of RAM to play with maximum settings.This requirement really shows that this game isn't optimized well and perform horribly.Note that not all country has cheap access to computer thingies.
- New guns only means new colors.No new designs from each guns.There's only 1 design for pistol,1 design for shotgun,1 design for SMG,and 1 design for Assault Rifle.The melee already has a lot of designs though.
- No headshot hitbox,makes combat system very boring and requires a long time.Imagine holding LMB/clicking LMB multiple times for hours on each cave with no variation at all.
- No new weapon sounds.All weapons have the same sound,except SMG and shotgun.
- Boring and dreadful soundtrack,except the campfire dubstep music.
- Building bases maybe fun but the building system is still not perfect.It's pretty complicated and made a lot of my friends frustrated.
- Bases lack of decorations.They should add chairs,tables,or any other decorations that has actual effect on the game.For example,a daily EXP/resource buff if we use certain furnitures.Today,all bases are only filled with crafting stations,composter,stargates,and their defense systems,which make the bases look horribly empty.

Suggestions
1.Fix the performance of the game ASAP.The game's performance today is extremely horrible.It's worse than horrible.There's no word to describe it.It's just a total mess.Imagine losing 90% of your resources only because you disconnected by the game's ping spikes and the game killed you with CDT_ForcedSuicide"
2.Increase the farming speed.Harvest pets should give twice resources and each resource points should have more resources available.Farming 20 woods from each tree while you need thousands to build a base and craft things is ridiculous.
3.Ban griefers.I know it's PvP and griefing is technically not an illegal thing.But remember that it hurts the player base because common sane people hate and avoid games with griefers.Griefers are trollers.They are people who have questionable sanity and mentality

GRAV
Early Access Review

TL;DR: Should have returned this game instead of looking for the good in it. Does not match advertisement or expectations. Several environments in preview videos do not exist. Previews suggest gameplay that is not present in current stage of development. Gameplay is exceedingly simplistic grinding for numbers. Game is in alpha stages with resource, stability, and memory leak issues. Potential exists, but no amount of quantity makes up for the lack of quality.

What follows is a section by section commentary on the about this game" bullet points.

Early Access Review

Okay from the time I'm writing this I have 36 hours of game time in GRAV. This game has considerably exceeded my expectation from the being as an early access game in a difficult genre. Not only is the game both beautiful and fun to play the community and developers are pretty amazing. From day one yes there has been many bugs but those are expected, in an early access game. Almost immediately they were dealt with in a patch released hours after. If you're willing to contribute and help the game grow and develop buy it. If you want a more finished product wait a little while. My recommendation is to buy it and get in on the GRAV! :3

GRAV
Early Access Review

Well, what to say... From the few videos you see you really want to get it, at least that happened to me. Is it fun? Yeah, but it won't last long.
I felt attracted to the game mainly because of the looks of it and the fact that it was a survival/crafting game.

:: SURVIVAL ::
-The only survival aspect if you play singleplayer (hosting your own server to play alone in it) is the fact that you have that hunger bar, that, if you just farm for blueprints, exp, and materials from mobs you'll get plenty. Nothing more, you won't even see it, like, NEVER, going down to half.
-In multiplayer the survival aspect comes from trying to survive from other players, if you are on a pvp server ofc.

:: ENEMIES ::
Little variety. You have slimes, something that resembles a really fat bee, a tick/louse thing that barks, a blue humanoid alien that you really don't want near you and another mob that's called Day killer and Night killer (depends on the time of the day) that runs fast and wants to kill you. The only thing that change with this mobs is that they are elemental based (Icy slime or blaze slime f.e.). Can't remember if you have more enemies.

:: CRAFTING ::
Don't, just DON'T buy this if you assume the crafting system will be like Minecraft or Don't Starve. You can craft very few things at the beginning, and if you want more, you need to kill everything on sight hoping to get a blueprint. This is easier if the mob or boss you are killing has a few levels more than you (1 or 2). The red crates that drop stuff just gives you materials, not blueprints. A thing devs might add to the crates, at least basic bp's.

:: WEAPONS ::
You have the basic item, and the same with an elemental damage type to craft (fire, ice, poison, electric, and maybe one more). U start with a hunting knife, then you might get a club, a wooden sword, pistols, rifles, and even a shotgun.
Firing weapons sux, really low dmg even with the Pet that buff that. I used a wooden sword, and a wooden sword with fire damage until lvl 14. Remember, if you don't get a blueprint from monster drops, you are gonna have a bad time...

Foreword

My initial review was Negative. The game was extremely buggy, laggy, bad performance and there was no single player ( multiplayer server you could play alone but it required a lot of resources ).

Bear in mind that we can only make first impressions / review of the game based on what is released" or presented to us. Game was in terrible state but it was a rough diamond. That being said

GRAV
Early Access Review

I really can't wait for future updates this game is really fun and already has alot to it.

So far i've found a pretty active public server with lots of people on it.
All the servers have their own home planet but once you head to a other planet by building a stargate, all the servers ( about 12 at the moment ) are on common ground.

You have the possibility to create building blocks with ladders, doorways, closed rooms, open rooms, teleportal rooms, glass rooms, shields, gun turrets, material factories, armories, spawn uplink points, stargates and alot more. I'm sure ALOT is going to be added in the future.
These buildings can all be protected from outsiders or be set to public if you wish to share with others

The game is heavily material grind and PvE based wich in my opinion is great cause you feel that you have progression but ofcourse that differs for others.
That said PvP is also a big part of this game. At the moment when you kill other players you can loot all their resources if they aren't able to pick it up within 15 minutes. The gear will stay after the resources are picked up so you won't be completely useless after you've been killed.

Combat takes abit getting used to i'm hoping to see future improvements since the animation when swinging your melee just swings your arm rather then seeing your body put weight into the swing.
Would also love to see more diversity in melee weapons as the begin we're able to make a 'club' while the rest of the melee weapons are all knifes ( wich look pretty badass )

For guns there is a good diversity from what i've seen. Assault rifles, pistols and shotguns at the moment.
Combat with those also needs improvement since now whenever you shoot you always have to be zoomed in wich is quite annoying since you cant really see what's going on around you and walk into mobs or against walls wich gets me killed most of the time.

As for teams we're able to set a 'FoF' up at the moment that way you can share structures, portals and other stuff with your buddies.

I've had tons of fun so far and will continue playing this. Already been in a conflict with other players where i got ganked on the moon and retaliated by seeking sweet revenge upon their base !

Bring it on players !

Oh and if you don't like PvP you can always choose a PvE server :)

I hope this review gave you enough information, if you have any questions feel free to ask.
I always keep steam broadcasting on for everyone so if u want to see gameplay footage you can always check it out too !

In the past few months, Grav's playability and players' confidence (evidenced by poor player numbers on servers) with the game has tanked.  The devs pushed out the Reborn Update, which got lots of people into the game, but neglected to fix a number of annoying Quality of Life bugs for weeks on end.  (One of which could have been fixed by a // or /*)  Players hemmoraged as soon as they added overflow servers" to handle the free period players that swarmed in.  Older players left during this period and didn't bother to return.  These overflow servers

Early Access Review

This game might be one of the best games on early access, I would recommend this to anyone who likes survival games as it's not like the other generic survival games you'll see here, no, this one is special.
This one has a bigger potential than my , literally! I've got this game yesterday and I have already spent 7 hours playing it and it actually got me off my Counter Strike - Global Offensive addiction which is pretty impressive considering I haven't tried a different game for months, but let's get to the point:
What this game has:
-Great graphics (for an early access)
-No pay to win
-Great combat system (atleast in my opinion)
-Very fun to play, especially with friends
-Great crafting system (Basically, you gotta get blueprints to get certain items which keeps the pump to play, I've been trying to get this cool motorcycle at the picutre for my entire playtime so far)
-Regular content update
Now this is a list of what this game has to fix (keep in note that it's in alpha/prealpha so I suppose this list will get fixed after my review has been posted):
-Optimization
-Single Player
-Lag fixes
-Add an option to crouch
-Implementing more ideas into the game (as I've mentiond it's still in early access and I'm 100% sure the developers will add great content to it)
In my opinion this game is fun for whoever likes survival games as it might be a bit repetitive it's not as boring as the other generic survival games which wont be fun to play after 1 hour of playing.

GRAV
Early Access Review

For the Price of a Movie ticket and a soda I got a little over 3 hours of entertainment and overall I enjoyed my play of the game and look forward to what features and advances the game will add as it progresses
(EDIT: I should perhaps specify that I purchased the game while it was on sale during it's being launched on Steam, the standard price of the game is of course more)

GRAV is a crafting/resource/survival game...one of many that have sprung up from the success of Minecraft and DayZ
What I find attractive about GRAV is the Sci-fi setting, I'm not really into the swords and zombies direction most survival games take (just a personal preference)

The game is currently in Alpha and at this stage is more a proof of concept, while future features and functionality will most likely be patched in as the game goes through it's journey from Alpha to Beta and finally to RELEASE, this is what we can expect from the core experience

As of now I had no trouble running the game, nor any trouble finding a server
While at the time of this writing there is not yet a singleplayer/offline mode, this I expect will be added in the future
For now it was best for me to play on a public server, especially since there is really not much to this game except the bare bones functions and interacting with other players and what they had built gave me a jump start on the begining of the game and gave me something else to do beside the few functions available at this time
There are most certainly bugs and glitches and wonky controls, but since this is an Alpha I'm willing to set aside these flaws with the assumption that most if not all will be addressed at a later date
What I'll be focusing on is what the core elements of the game are like as of now

-IMPRESSIONS-
You spawn in the wilderness, most likely near other players which makes resource gathering a bit of a hike...since you'll have to travel to find the resource nodes you'll need to craft your items
You have only a knife and a Multitool at start, and you can make your way just fine with those alone, though stronger enemies and dungeons might require stocking up on better gear
You'll fight weird aliens and gather resources to build a home base or try your luck in one of the leveled dungeon instances that spawn throughout the world
You'll explore weird alien landscapes where the laws of physics seem to bend if not break, with rocky deserts and lush yellow forests, from floating rocks to poison seas, from abandoned structures to crashed spacecraft
All randomly generated so each trip over the mountain offers a chance at something new

-CRAFTING-
While I played I found only 5 nodes to gather resources
Trees = Wood
Piles of Bone = Fossils
Shiny Rocks = Ore
Smoking Crater = Element X
Each node has a chance to drop a more refined or rare resource, but overall these are all you can expect to find as far as gathering/farming is concerned
You use these resources to craft buildings and crafting stations
As of now there is no way to un-build what you've built, but I'd expect this to change in the future
Crafting Stations are where you'll build your equipment and refine your resources, Upgrading your stations allows for access to more items
Enemies are currently the only way to gather new recipes and blueprints

-COMBAT-
Combat is real time and skill based, you'll have to time your swings and stay outside of the enemies range of attack
You'll gain levels from killing enemies and each enemy has it's own level, so don't be surprised to see yourself die at the hands of a higher level enemy
Death is not perminent, in fact you don't even lose all your items, only a portion of your items are left at your corpse (and that portion can be reduced by spending skill points in the appropriate skill)
Your lost items will remain where you died and will be Loot Locked" for a period of time

GRAV
Early Access Review

This game crashed my PC
Gave me severe fps drops
Made me frusterated af when you are getting ganged  by non stop spawning monsters
Left me in complete confusion as a level 0
Disconnected me from the server multiple times

BUT

I ing love this game. As I spawned into the game having no idea what I was doing or where I was I was stunned by the almost dream like graphics. As night comes by I build a campfire and around 3-4 other level 0 noobies like myself gathered around and chatted. After one of us found the x button (the dance key) we all went ham. The stunning realization that this dope  music was implemnted as the main way of healing in the game just adds to my respect of the creators. The amount of hype for 5 level 0 noobies was something I have never experienced before, we exchanged stories and went our seperate ways. As morning one of my fire buddies and I began to finish the objectives until around level 5 where it really started to get interesting. We started to get blueprints for vehicles, assault rifles, wing suits, and frog feet (<-- actually quite helpful). Campfire buddy and I have mics so we can enjoy our adventure togethor as we conquer dungeons, wreck n00bs, and pillage from the rich. I soon invited a friend to play with us, so campfire guy and I tp'ed to his world and proceed to waste all of our wood and fossils searching for this scruberino by shooting flares every 5 seconds, but eventually we found him and pillaged togethor once again. As you can see after only my first day of playing this game I have already logged 5 hours into this game.

Side Note: I was originally only going to play about an hour of this game and go back and play fallout 4 but this game just grabed my attention.

Early Access Review

HIGHLY RECOMENDED TO THE FOLLOWING: 1. any fan of minecraft, 2. any fan of the forest, 3. any fan of starbound (this game STRONGLY resembles a 3d starbound to me)

PERKS/PROS
+Sand box
+Survival
+Vehicles
+Guns
+Swords
+Buildings
+Challenging as you must unlock more blueprints
+Levels
+Skills
+Dungeons

BUGS/CONS:
-Sometimes buildings will disappear after reloading your world (quit/disconect and rejoin)
-A.I. are incomplete and all are pet vendors as of now (People and robot A.I.)
-All A.I. seem to be able to No-Clip thru natural structures (Trees, Rocks, (etc.))
-Some resources (trees, ores, gems, (etc.) trees mostly tho) will sometimes also be clipped thru natural objects such as rocks.

Overall rate = 4.9/5 or 9.8/10
This game has a very strong potential outcome to be one of the best on steam (or atleast very close to minecraft equivalent) seeing as whats already here and it still only pre release.

GRAV
Early Access Review

So I'm writing as of the current state of the game now, by date of its launch ( 8/1/2015 )

Even though I'm giving it a 'thumbs up' it's not recommemed for anybody aside from the people who label themselves as bug finders, as it's not playable to be enjoyable for the average consumer right now. The issue(s) that plague the game at the moment is lag, lots and lots of lag, to the point where it's unplayable to check out the other parts of the game to decide on its quality and whether it's good or bad, but from the parts I've played and managed to look into it is as follows..

The graphics are decent, with the art style being really colorful and good looking, same goes for the level design of the game with how nice the landscape looks, kind of reminds of No Man's Sky, but it definitely has its own unique fun look.

The controls are nice and responsive but a bit floaty/boaty, and the UI/Interface of the game are really basic, you can see that it's sort of a place holder. Crafting and building structures and objects/items are easy, but not that convenient/enjoyable with how basic the UI is at the moment. Also, there isn't much to do at the moment aside from crafting, building structures and items, exploring and killing monsters, there may be a lot more stuff to do but it's hard to tell right now, since there is no offline mode too (at the moment, not sure if it will come later on)

So yea, that's what I got from playing the game at the moment, with how massive the lag is right now. The game has great potential to be a lot of fun, looking at the videos, and getting a quick play session of it now. I don't recomemend it right now, but will definitely check the game constantly to check if it's an ok purchase or not, because I do have really high hopes for this one.

GRAV
Early Access Review

Really enjoying this game. I find myself to be easily distracted due to the urge to explore and find new blueprints. Whether you're playing on your own, with friends, or with strangers, it's always a lot of fun. There's PVE and PVP servers to suit the experience you're wanting from the game as well as Official and Unoffical servers. Like I said, it's incredibly easy to become distracted in GRAV. I often find myself gathering resources, then spotting a dungeon and being drawn to the idea of killing mobs and finding them precious blueprints. GRAV  can  be a very unforgiving world, you'll have to watch your back whilst gathering, ensure there's enough wood in your generator to power your base and be very cautious on new planets you travel to. All in all, it's a fantastic game, despite some optimisation issues and bugs (remember people, this  is  an Early Access game run by an Indie Dev). With a recent major update and an enthusiastic and active dev team, this is a game that is sure to have a great future ahead of itself.

GRAV
Early Access Review

With over a 160 hours on Grav as of the time this review was written. I did like to believe I can at least write a decent one.
I now clock over 400 hours as of build 20.

I have also written a guide for this game. Reading it will help you address the common annoyances people have with the game and also further influence your decision to get it.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470854662
The review has had stuff added due to patch 19. Nothing was removed though.
This review has been re-written for build 20 due to the large amount of stuff and improvments added to the game. New players have a much easier time starting the game now due to the new damage curve, area level re-rolls and tutorial objectives.

Firstly, Grav is a sandbox open world, much like the other sandboxes on the market, you farm for resources, craft stuff, build bases and consume stuff to survive. It also belongs in the Sci-fi theme. The game does start out alittle boring, but once you get to around level 13 and make your first trip to the moon, the game becomes infinitely more fun then. I would suggest trying the game till this point before asking for a refund.

What sets this game apart from the others? Honestly I cant give a definite answer to this yet, and I am not gonna mention dancing. The game is still in development and community suggestions on stuff to be added to the game are conflicting. [ e.g building decay ] But still I am recommending it  based on several factors.

Pros:
Large maps
Game is gorgeous
They got the basics right
All basic resources are always useful
Great developers
Early access, updates come hard and fast, a new build every 2 weeks
Vehicles, jetpacks, wingsuits
Problems are solved fast
Building stuff is great if you are innovative

Cons:
8GB RAM requirement
Repetitive combat [or rather, non existent combat changes across levels]
Repetitive dungeons [see a few and you see it all]
No end game content [yet]
Insufficient playerbase
Resource farming requires some knowledge of where to get the fastest amount
Some lag is present
Griefers. Like almost every sandbox game? Griefers is a problem.
Building stuff is horrible if you dont excatly excell at doing stuff like that
Early access

So allow me to elaborate on the pros.
The maps are pretty large maps. The starter world for example is consisted of 2 - 3 Islands and each Island is serval kilometers wide. By basics I mean, combat, movement, UI and stuff are all decently done, there are some problems and room for improvements but updates are comming in fast for them.

The game is gorgeous? A picture says a thousand words.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482330205

Comments saying the game did not ship with graphics shown in the store screenshots? Rubbish... They didnt turn on post proccessing, obviously it wont look the same.

All resources have a use for them, you wont, lets say... have no need for wood when you reach max level. Far from it, wood becomes more important than ever. This applies to every single resource. Something which you thought useless at the start, for example, I thought plasma was useless after I got off the moon, little did I know my vehicles and drill platfolm required plasma to run... until I got them that is.

The developers are great, they are actively talking with the community, suggestions made by the community have even been added into the experimental build within hours.

http://steamcommunity.com/app/332500/discussions/3/530645446313592491/

Proof that I aint just pulling your leg.
There is a normal build, and an experimental one. Roughly every two weeks, all the patches added to experimental is released to the normal build and the build number goes up by one. Currently waiting on build 21.

What I mean by building stuff is great if you are innovative? Well...

The ultimate killer for this game IMO, the game requires at least 8GB RAM to play properly at the moment. You can disable all the graphic options to enable GRAV to run at 4GB but thats the very bottomline it can go for now. This basically means unless you are using a custom laptop / high end one. You will not be able to play GRAV on a laptop.

Like a few other reviews have mentioned. There isnt much variety, Once you see a level 1 slime, you have seen the attack patterns for a level 60 slime as well. There are also NO headshot hitboxes in the game YET. I have personally confirmed with the developers they are adding this in, but no ETA on it yet. So what does all these mean? Basically PvE combat in this game boils down to kiting over and over again. But considering its early access and they are planning to release more content for combat its excusable... at least for me.

Currently the game has basically non-existent replayable end game content. But as you can probably see, the devs are starting to prepare and release stuff for that. Vehicles for upcomming warzones like the build 20 released hammerhead [ VTOL Jet ]. New monsters, stuff like that.

Insufficient playerbase is related to its somewhat bad start and also the lack of end game content. When more content is released, I do believe the playerbase will increase substainally. This game has alot of potiential and the devs are living up to it.

Resource farming on the other hand isnt as bad as some people made it sound. As with a majority of the cons, I have covered ways to make your life easier in the guide above.


The game is horribly optimised for large scale building projects atm. Patch 19 is supposed to fix quite alot of it but we will see.
EDIT
As of patch 19, Building large scale projects no longer lags the game to kingdom come. I now run at a pretty smooth 20 fps around my base. Previous was 9 - 15 FPS along with severe lag spikes. Do note that my base is HUGE and filled with dymanic base items like laser fences. I play with 30 - 60 FPS on other planets. This is with a custom laptop.
Another EDIT
Patch 20 further improves on building with serval optimizations and also introduces building decay into the game.

And.... griefers. This one is a major blow to the game. I will be upfront and say this. The PvE servers are even worse for griefing than the PvP ones. This is because a griefer can shoot your buildings and you cant even damage them while they are doing so on the PvE ones. They are planning fixes for this but I did not ask for an ETA for this [because there are ways to grief proof your buildings]. Also there are alot of stupid things that are done [e.g new player killing] by a small minority of jerk players... well you get my point. If you do intend to get this game I recommend you head to the offical server in your region with 01 in their name. For example, I am based in ASIA PvP 01. These servers normally have an active community that will help and look out for each other to keep the griefers away.

Building stuff, this one took me hours to learn. Once you learn how to utilise the system its easy, but before that its a pain in the *ahem* to do so. Just building a simple house with a single door to a balcony can drive you nuts when you are first starting to build stuff. I have covered how to use the system in the guide.

And so yeah, do I recommend this game?
If its on sales? Of course
At full price? Sure, I gotten more than my money back already.

Early Access Review

If you're reading these reviews, you're probably interested in GRAV.
Good.
Because this game deserves your interest.
In my 3 hours of playing this game, which is a Early Access title and is in a very early build, I can safely say that this is a game worth it's money.
Even being Early Access, the game offers amazing graphics, surprisingly in-depth crafting, base building, loot based combat and even enjoyable dungeon crawling.

It's too early to accurately review this game, but I will give you pros and cons from the perspective of an average gamer and consumer-

Pros:

1.Beautiful graphics (especially considering how early the current build is)
2.Loot based combat
3.In-depth crafting
4.Fun dungeon crawling
5.Coop

Cons:

1.Unoptimized (Even at it's lowest settings, my FX 8320 @ 4.2 GHz and GTX 660ti will dip down to 25 fps at times)
2.Harvesting resources can be VERY grindy
3.Blueprints and crafting could be explained better


Overall, the game is amazing when considering what it is. If you want to explore a beautiful alien world, battle through caves with your friends, or even build bases and craft by yourself, GRAV has you covered.


GRAV
Early Access Review

Totally worth the bucks. It may play a bit like a MMO as combat is essential to progress, but so far I have almost no con.

Pro:
+gigantic open worlds
+dungeons
+already a vast amount of biome variety
+Campfire!!! (Press X and let the party begin)
+good crafting system
+great looks

Con:
One downside is that you cannot hunt for specific planets like desert planets or tundra planets, so there might be a little frustration there, but it's not that bad and will hopefully change in the future.

GRAV
Early Access Review

At first i didn't think I would like it. Sure I read what it was about and everything but, since its early access i didnt think it had much to offer. Damn I was wrong!

Just bought today and put in a good four hours so read this review with some caution. I'm not fully capeable of giving a in-depth review.

I started out by playing with two of my buddies. Making a server wasn't that hard it's almost like making a vannila Minecraft server. (Need help go to wiki) Then loaded into the world. The first 20 secconds will be a bit laggy because, everything rendering in. We got a house going and started cave hunting. The enemies scale nicely and theres not much of a learning curve. I would also like to add that I absolutly love how the developers of this game update it almost daily! Thats somthing i love to see. It shows they care about their consumers and game! Keep up the good work!

Pros~
-Small learning curve
-Looks Beautiful (For alpha)
-Lots of content (Was very surprised)
-Updates almost everyday!!!
-Noticed little to none bugs
-Enemy Scaling system
-LOTS OF ITEMS! :D
-Price
-Much much more


Cons~
-I run a r9 290x OC and a i5 2500k and its choppy (56 to 32 FPS) at some points which is disapointing so i find it hard to belive that lower end PC's can run this game well.
-Better looting system with friends (No loot hog)
-Same enemies
-Graphics options!!! <---- That's what really got me

Tips~
-New enemies
-Extra Vehicles (Gyrocopter?)
-Optimise
-Mod support (later on)
-Space travel instead of portals? (Build your own spaceship)
-Pets that attack for you

If you read it down to here i appriciate the time you took! I definitly recommend this game because; The developers update often which you dont see a lot! Lots of content! Low price for a game you can play for hours. And in my opinion i find it actually relaxing building and chopping down trees.

Early Access Review

I had high hopes for this game and realised quite quickly this game is nothing but a daily grind.

The setting is quite interesting and I quite like the graphics. Though after a while it gets quite boring as everything just looks the same.
There is no manipulation of the surroundings, no landscaping. All you can do is build certain devices and pre-factured containers. Wooden containers, stone containers, glass and metal (which you can't build unless you level a certain profession up, which takes forever...). No free building as you would be used to from other survival/mincraft genre-like games.
And these pre-factured blocks are the main problem. All items have a certain amount of degrading time (unfortunately usually quite short, something like 2 days). If you don't login over the weekend, you'll suddenly stand there without your house. The only way to keep them from degrading is to build a certain type of shield. This shield needs a generator. This generator needs wood. So what you basically do is logging in every day, grind wood to keep the generator and your shield going to keep the house from degrading. And this is literally your own purpose in this game.
Apparently there are more features, like claiming land which then makes you be able to claim tax from other players. But unfortunately, as blueprints need to drop from bosses, after 2 weeks of playing this game and basically mainly logging in, gathering wood for the generator and killing endless mobs outside and inside of caverns I didn't get anywhere.

As it is bad enough already, I played this game with my brother, so technically there was twice the manpower, twice the chance of dropping blueprints and you would suggest twice the fun. But it wasn't. We just both got annoyed really quick and as you might be able to see in my playing time in other games, I am usually not giving up that easily.

No quests, same monsters over and over again, random NPCs called Wei Wei the Wanderer" appearing wandering about and being killed by the monsters. Same with Vending Machine robots.

Unless you're an old-fashioned WoW grinding lover... you should avoid this game."

In all seriousness though this is actually a pretty good game, it kinda reminds of a starbound+rust+mmo-ish hybrid type game ( cant really explain it better sorry ). You might want to play it with someone though as it could get a little boring by yourself, though it takes a while for that to happen. The graphics are really vibrant and juicy in this game, youll have to turn on post-processing though to really get these colors, but if you dont like post-processing effects, the colors will be a little washed out without it on. The only thing i dont like about this game is takes a while to get resources, or at least enough to build something good. Another thing about this game is that playing on high population servers might be a little annoying when youre trying to build a base and the crafting stations and such gets destroyed a lot when your offline, and building a turret to defend that stuff while your offline requiers a LOT of wood, which will take a while to get. One last thing i have to say about this game is that the landscares are gorgeous and have a true alien planet feel, which is different from most space type games out now.

Actual Review Score 8.5/10 - Its a VERY addicting game, even better with friends, though the grind may turn people away,and building a worthwhile base may be somewhat annoying with lots of other people around,although im sure the developers will improve on this sometime in the near future. For an early access game, this is one of the best, most content rich ones ive ever played.

GRAV
Early Access Review

If you have played ARK like me you will be disappointed about what GRAV has to offer. As much a grinding game as any of these types, but it fails in being attractive. It get repetitive easily, the amount of content is disappointing, the state of the UI, the absence of a dev / progress tree, etc.
And then there is soo little support from the devs. ARK has updates daily and they almost alway offers something for everyone, with at least one content update per week. This game hasn't been updated for weeks!
I tried it, convinced some friends in doing so too. I really shouldn't have done that. Nor should you. This is early access at its worst.

GRAV
Early Access Review

I played over 270+ hours of this game and met some very nice people in game.   But...

forums:

Within two weeks so many things have happened in this game, The PVE East server US IOTA starting world was completely destroyed after the new 9.2 patch! Nothing at all was responded by the devs even after multiple bumps in the thread keeping it utop the forums for over a week nor the other posts by other members had any responses. People quit becuase of this. On Desolate moon I made a Drill high up utop one of the rocks and it does not work at all, it just stays blue and takes plasma decreasing it over time but always says 2+ hours, once again, wrote on forums - no response from the devs. Recently after upgrading myself to having 4 drills on one planet I tried that and after over half a week of me collecting over 100s of thousands of materials to upgrade these drills THREE of the four of them this morning are completely GONE! This also happened to a friend of mine on the same server earlier this week. One drill said INF time on it the other three said 12+ days till decay well they decayed within a few hours and I lost a weeks worth of mats. I went to a PVP server and the exploits are ridiculous, everytime we make a home it gets destroyed (shields are up and everything, we know how to fortify). The composters do not work properly and take 50 of your wood before you can even start putting wood in them cheaing you out of your gathered resources. The list goes on.

You couldn't even fix something as easy as the Chinese New year hat, that was bugged nobody got it, if thats the extent of this game I can tell the future of this product is very bleak.

-- I actually did get a response back from the Bitmonster devs, saying they do care and to contact bitmonster support through an email in which myself and and some other friends did to urgently let them know the issues with the game.  Over a week later we recieved emails from the Bitmonster email with an automated message (no fooling) and it said to register with another site and send an email through that way...... .are you kidding me....

I find it funny the moderator said they do care, but then deleted the post.  How hypocritical.

Let me start this review by saying I bought this game on release, it is now 02/06/2015 I've played a lot of hours (this was more so when it first came out where I could forgive glaring errors with the typical saying hey man it's early access so it'll get sorted" wow was I wrong!!

First of lets get the graphics out the way

GRAV
Early Access Review

This game has some of the usual EA problems but the foundation is rock solid and I have had a lot of fun in just my first couple play sessions.   Compared to many EA games this game has a lot of content and variety and the frame rate is smooth even on my mid tier rig.   The landscapes are gorgeous and the art style works with the music to produce some real immersion.

I enjoy PvP and so far I like what I see.  Gear and level is important but so are tactics and aim.  At level 4 I was able to scare off a level 19 just using the starter pistol when he had an assault rifle.    I was also attacked by a level 9 when I was level 7 and was able to down him mostly because I had better gear (had the better pistol at that point) so it's a good mix of skill and gear based victories.

The gunplay feels  a lot like Halo to me and I mean that in a good way.  It's arcadey but still feels like skill matters and accuracy while shooting on the run is critical and can be practiced.

The end game seems completely different then the beginning so I will update my review when I get to that but so far so good with Grav.  More people should be playing this game IMO it's highly polished and fun for an EA game.

GRAV
Early Access Review

This game has a good start for a good game.  However, in its current state, it is limited and buggy - as to be expected for early access.

The good:
Graphics
Combat
Exploration
Simplified resource gathering
Vehicles
Guns
Pets
Wide variety of items to craft
Classes with bonuses

The bad:
No real level progression*
Collision detection
Rarity of certain common resources*
Lack of base defense options
Lack of harvestable resource types
Lack of monster models
Very resource intensive
Small groups are ineffective*

The bad will probably be resolved, but a few really stick out.
*No real level progression: Sure your classes can level up and you can create new weapons and armor.  However, it doesn't matter.  All weapons are level based damage.  This means if you give a level 1 character the max level weaponry, they will still hit mobs that are only one level above them for minimal damage.  This is not apparent at lower levels, but after one reaches level 20 or so, it is an obvious pattern.  Bosses that used to be challenging turn into a huge time and ammo sink instead of being fun.

*Rarity of certain common resources: There are a ton of resources in this game.  However, you will run into a brick wall for one or two of them that are extremely rare - even though they are marked as common.  These resources will be staples to your progression and will basically stop it until you run around gather the 1 or two around the entire planet for a few hours.  But even then - when you do build that upgraded equipment, it won't have a noticeable change on combat.

*Small groups are ineffective: If you want to play this with 1 or two of your friends, it will be fun for the first few hours.  However, after level 20 or so, the no real level progression" portion kicks in.  If you find a loot chest or an artifact

Early Access Review

I have played a significant amount of survival games. DayZ, Rust and Nether have been the dominant 3 for me. So far (I know it is early) Grav has all 3 beat. It seems like the dev(s) haved played all of these games as well and has corrected mistakes that the others have made. Here are a few benefits of choosing Grav over the rest.

- Penalty for dying isn't ridiculously brutal. Sure you go back to level 0 and lose some of your stuff but you keep the important stuff and get a shot at retrieving your lost goods from the spot where you kicked the bucket.

- Playing with friends. Rust and DayZ had me spending the entire time searching for my buddy so we could go.. survive. Grav has you build a Locator which gives you your lat/long. After building the Locator you never lose it. That's great.

- Food bar. No mare having to go somewhere and do the pointless activity of sitting and eating. You must collect food but eating is a passive feature.

- Traversing. Your dude moves swiftly and jumps and dances like no aliens are watching.

- Low-level areas are not overly punishing and aliens drop health. Tired of grinding in these survival games for an hour or so to start only to die and have to start over with this cycle repeating itself? Grav allows you to get going and keep going and progressing relatively easily unless you are KOS by another player which brings me to...

- The community is not full of KOS s. At least not from my experience.

Another thing I dig about Grav is while playing it, I feel like I'm in a really cool 80's space-flick. Not sure if the devs meant this but I definitely get this vibe. The music and dancing is great as well. This game is basically the MMO survival version of Planet Explorers with Unreal Engine 4 behind it.

My beef at this point is only with the lag. Lag at this point makes the game unplayable at times. It's very early access so I'll give them a break for now but that needs to be priority 1. The UI is god awful as well but you can tell it is just placeholder stuff that will soon change so no biggie.

Other than that I hope they fix the lag and focus on keeping the hackers at bay and we will have ourselves a winner.

**update 3/5** Game is currently dead. Maybe due to stability issues or lack of end game, people are likely waiting for bigger updates to hit the game before logging back in. Keep this in mind if you plan on purchasing at this time**

**Update 4/7** The devs have released some big updates and the game is coming along wonderfully. People are beginning to trickle back in. No reason at this point to not have confidense in the team behind this game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW

22 hours was played thus far on a PVE server

I will start off with the negatives, if you don't like the look of any of these, stay away and come back later. If not keep on reading.
Lag issues:
-Lag is still an issue right as of now but the dev is working on it and commited to fixing it right now. A special test server is up and a patch has already helped part of the issue but there is still a way to go.

Somewhat barebones:
-You can't take down the stuff you build at the moment (well in PVE, I havn't played on a PVP server so I can't tell if it's PVE related only).
-No clear friendslist you have to make parties with custom codes and key commands.
-Inventory system is minimal and missing features like displaying the look/picture of an item when selected.

The Positives!
Alright still here? Good because what is there is really enjoyable. Did you see all the stuff in the trailer? You can do all of it (well ok 90%) at this very moment! (unlike StarForge *angryface*) You can level up to max level (30) and gear up accordingly. You can play co-op with friends and run dungeons and fight bosses together (or alone you Einzelganger you). You can build really neat bases, craft armor, weapons and yes working vehicles and jetpacks. The graphics are bright and the colorscheme is nice. The aesthetic has it's very unique, silly and somewhat cutesy personality.

All in all it's impressive how complete the game already feels for a 6 month old project and there is a lot of fun to be had already. If the developers keep this up this will be a fantastic game. But you do have to realise there is still work to be done. You must understand this is still an Early Access game (in alpha). So things will break, bugs will annoy you (and I'm not only talking about the enemies)  and stuff will be missing.

Give the trailer another go! Does it look apealing? Yes? Don't you mind alpha/beta testing? And do you want to add to the development of the game? Join in have a blast. (playing with friends recommended, game may be addicting)

lack of must have menu points , even colour of char must be done with the right code and command
No varity of enemys
boring KI
many players left already actually maybe 100-150 PPL online in the whole Game and different servers!
very very small maps ( there wouldnt be space even if there more players lol)
Many Bugs and glitches which still stay for months even if many ppl report them.
huge lack of right translation skills (probaly only english is well and correct translated lol)
5/95 Chance that a dev will respond to your problem in the forum.
The Survival Part of the Game is a joke and shouldn't be called as that.

Cashcew Game?


Pros:
Graphic (not the effects)
Buildings
Most ppl are nice (the rest which still stay)

________________________
That Game started getting boring ruthly after you reach first time lv 60 with one job, after that there is nothing to do instead of building or pvp or lv again and that 7 times . but there is no system for PVE and PVP Rewards at all for late game and no motivation to play that game again. (just another EA Title which could be good if the devs would be care at the right points, but no chance)

I should stopped it after the first 50 hours.

GRAV
Early Access Review

Let me preface this by saying this game does have a lot of potential.  I have put quite a few hours in it, and in the beginning it was quite enjoyable.   Lets look at the good AND the bad.

Good
1. Graphics are quite nice.  The style is unique and pretty.
2. The crafting system is fairly robust.
3. Good music and sounds when they aren't bugged.
4. The IDEA behind the game is sound, if realized I may recommend this game.

Bad
1.  This has improved slightly, but this is still the most poorly optimized game I've ever seen.
2.  The sound is bugged badly since release, hasn't improved at all.  Random sounds and music at random times.
3.  This is FALSELY advertised as both Single-Player AND Survival.  It is neither of those.
4.  A better name for the game could be Grindy McGrinderson lands on the planet Grind and builds Grindytown.
5.  It literally seems to get worse with each patch.  Sounds have gotten worse, the events are no more than large groups of random mobs (unless you get slimes, then you might see some bosses), the resource placement is appallingly bad right now, and the instances are scarce and nearly useless.
6.  To call combat rudimentary would be generous. Imagine Minecraft combat, only not as intricate.

The game IS an EA title as some will surely point out.  This MAY all get ironed out by release, but I don't recommend games on what they might be.  At this state is not really worth $10, much less $20.     Do yourself a favor and let them sort out this mess, don't toss your money away just yet.

GRAV
Early Access Review

GRAV is a sci-fi themed survival game with action combat.
It feels kinda like a mix of World of Warcraft and Minecraft with a solid third-person combat thrown in.
The game is build using Unreal Engine and looks absolutely gorgeous.
And there's plenty of procedurally generated content to explore.
On top of that you can build your own base, which will undoubtedly be attacked at some point, so don't forget the defences.
Jetpacks, monocycles and pets are included.
Oh, and dancing around campfire to increase healing rate is there too! :D
Plus, developers are pushing out updates like crazy (just look at those build notes).

On the downside:
- Game in general is not very well optimized at the moment (and there are no options to tweak, only ini files). So, unless your machine meets min reqs (have at least 8GB of RAM, this game loves it), you probably shouldn't get it.
- Net code seems to be unoptimized at all - having any latency and lags to local server is a bit strange (although that might be related to fact that server as well eats tons of RAM and 8GB is just not enough for running both - server and client)
- Current (v7) progression is limited to getting all blueprints from monster and leveling your character does not do much.

Oh, and it's definitely more fun to play with you friends.
If that sounds like your thing - you'll probably enjoy playing GRAV!

GRAV is an incredible survival game, the vibrant colors and fun art-style is a perfect mix. The game is mostly online only, I imagine there is probably a way to play by yourself, but that wouldn't make for a very entertaining experience. There aren't a lot of enemies right now, I have been told that this is due to a bug. So far I haven't experienced much PKing (Player Killing), though I have seen it happening according to the chat. The game has a nice friendly/unfriendly system, which makes playing with friends a lot easier. The caves/dungeons can be really hard to find, and leveling up can be very difficult as well, but this game is still extremely pretty and I hope to see this game get even better over the next several updates.

If you are thinking of purchasing this game, I would highly recommend it, there are a lot of friendly players and the game is very well made.

World of Goo
World of Goo is to this day one of the finest indie games one can find.
It is, in my opinion, one of _the_ best physics-based logic games currently available.

It looks great, plays great and is overall an amazing and unique experience due to many factors. It does have some flaws, but they are minor and almost insignificant.

A one-of-a-kind setting, quirky and strange humor, a challenge to both strategic and quick thinking. What else would you need?

Highly recommended.

World of Goo
The goal is simple, yet changes every time. The game lasts long enough so as to not outstay it's welcome and the art style of the game is great.

For extra challenge every level has an OCD" challenge. The OCD could be to complete the level in X seconds or it could be to use a trick to get an extra few balls that might not be immediately obvious.

The physics work

Years ago there was this cool demo called Tower of Goo" which I played for hours! It was directly an advert for this game. So I felt familar with the physics engine and the mainly game concept. You have to drag drops of goo which generate connections between them and lets you build up complex structures. These structures are flexible and react on the physics around them. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=313216017
You have to think a lot not to break down your structures and reach mostly above the tap. When it's done the tap changes to a kind of vacuum cleaner and sucks the rest of the goo drops into. Most challenging is after you finished a level to do it in OCD (Obsessive Completion Distinction) mode. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=314343308
That means to do it best and collect all max. possible goo drops. Which feels hard as playing golf and reach on every course an hole-in-one ..."

When it's done the tap changes to a kind of vacuum cleaner and sucks the rest of the goo drops into. Most challenging is after you finished a level to do it in OCD (Obsessive Completion Distinction) mode. That means to do it best and collect all max. possible goo drops. Which feels hard as playing golf and reach on every course an hole-in-one ..."

World of Goo
If this game isn't considered a classic yet, it will be... it's that good.

- Graphics are still not outdated, still looks very nice and clean
- Soundtrack is still awesome, feels like it was uniquely designed for this game, very moody too.
- Game is very balanced in difficulty
- Connecting online doesn't seem to work anymore to compare tower heights. Boo hoo...
- Story is interesting, gameplay is addictive.

What more could you possibly want from a 69MB old game?

World of Goo
This is honestly one of my favorite games of all time. Addictive, physics-based gameplay is coupled with the most amazing soundtrack and stitched-together with humor, satire, morality, and just enough of a storyline to make you think. Equally fun on PC and Android/tablet. Grab the demo, I assure you you'll end up purchasing.

World of Goo
If you want to play one of the best games ever created with awsome music and atmosphere, this game is for you. Seriously this game is art.


11/10 -The Sign Painter





World of Goo
Cute, intriguing, challenging. Wonderful gameplay underscored by a beautiful soundtrack.

World of Goo
One of the best puzzle games I have ever played. The music, the art and the physics make this game a must buy. ~10/10

World of Goo
One of the best bridge/tower building puzzle games of all time.  Even those who don't understand physics or the construction process will get a handle on this because the ability to connect the balls together is so intuitive.  The devs did a great job of simplifying a complex process.  The game runs from very simple to absolutely difficult, and near the end you'll find yourself restarting levels many times in order to successfully finish them.  There are some special achievement like building a bridge with only so many balls that add more complexities to the game that I really enjoyed.  The graphics are gorgeous and I love the artstyle that is used.  A must play for all puzzle genre lovers.

World of Goo
This is just one of those indie games everyone needs to play at least a bit of. Its a very well thought out physics puzzler where you use your goo-balls to build structures under different rules depending on the level, and the balls at hand. While the graphics are cute you should not be fooled to think the game is very easy, it actually gets really challenging at times and requires a lot of skill, patience and luck to fully beat. Strong recommendation.

If you just play through the game you wont be getting very many achievement from this game as most of them are tied to the games OCD flags which are a more challenging way of beating all the levels in the game. This will be a very challenging task and something that might very well pull your hair out. Be ready for quite a challenge and look forward to that great feeling of unlocking some proper achievements.

Time to 100%: 15+ hours


World of Goo
By far, my very favorite game, even though I'm not a fan of indie games in general.

This game is really charming as hell, you start off around some neat hills map where you get to know what this game is about: building. Building up, left, right, down, DOESN'T MATTER. The graphics looks really cute, even though, minimalistic, the sound, the sound is a ing masterpiece, the very best original soundtrack I've heard in my life, every track if filled up with emotions, the author of these (Kyle Gabler) did a great job.

The physics of this game is yet another thing. This is  A THING. As you're supposed to build in this game, the main role physics does play. It is just plain immaculate, you won't get disappointed. Yeah, for kids who haven't studied it yet it might be pretty difficult, but if you got some knowledge in that, you can beat it. But, again, you'll have to think.

The  whole story looks pretty simple at first: balls sucked by a pipe, wow. But the deeper you dig in the game, the greater the actual plot is, it is full of allegories, metaphors and what not. In the end, it reflects our reality, which is 2D Boy's major feature - a simple childish game with deep sense. No spoilers, of course.

This game makes you think. This game makes you feel. This game lets you be creative. This game is awesome. In my opinion, everyone should play it at least once.

9.9/10

World of Goo
The original indie game. Buy it if you like puzzle games.

Be aware that it's a game that was made available when indie games were beginning to be mainstream, so it doesn't have a lot of replay value and it is a really short game.

World of Goo
Do you like crazy puzzles? Do you like cute things? Do you like a game where they try to make a story that makes no sense to the game at at? This game is definatly for you!

World of Goo
In the end I really don't understand why I couldn't stop helping these little goo balls... I mean it's just goo... or is it not? Maybe it also was the soundtrack (the AMAZING soundtrack) and the overall style of the game.
I don't know, find it out for yourselves, more than worth it!

Do it now!

World of Goo
A puzzle game with a heart of gold, telling a strange and twisted tale of a dystopian consumer-culture run amok, while slowly introducing you to ever more varied and interesting things to do with goo.

A great game to pick up for puzzle fans.

-Quick Review-
World of Goo is an Indie-Physics-Puzzle Game developed in 2008 by 2D BOY. World of Goo is one of those quaint games that you would probably prefer to play on a mobile or smaller electronic device (with touch screen capabilities); in World of Goo you create bizarre contraptions with Goo to get to the end of the level.

Gameplay

World of Goo is a 2D physics-based puzzler with gameplay that revolves around building structures out of goo balls" in order to reach a pipe at the end of stage. While this is a relatively simple set up for a puzzle game

World of Goo
World of Goo is an absolute classic by my measure. It shines very brightly, and is a must-play for any indie game enthusiast (I have many many hours in this game, just not on Steam).

Essentially, the goal is to build architecturally-sound structures to bridge gaps. Its like a wild version of Bridge Simulator. The building mechanics are really fun, but arguably the best part of this game is the artwork and definately the storyline.  While the story is quite abstract, but absolutely emotionally engaging.

The only negative I can really mention is that the game can feel a bit dated, at this point. I loaded it up this year and all the charm is still there, but the graphics and controls have not aged all that well. Regardless, its a classic.

World of Goo
This game will make you goo yourself.

World of Goo
Excellent game! I use it as a real world break. It's perfect for that, take half an hour out and play a few levels...

World of Goo
This game is like a piece of art.

World of Goo
The world is LITERALLY made of goo. Go check outside. See, it's made of goo.

World of Goo
Puzzle games are often seen as boring, frustrating and spiritless. However few games are as entertaining, funny and beautiful as this one.
Whether you fall in love with its art style, its physics engine or its level design, World of Goo will amaze you.

To sum up : it makes puzzles FUN  !

8,5/10

World of Goo
A very enjoyable and simple game. Some of the later levels really make you think. A classic. :)

World of Goo
Where to start with this...
I originally played this on a Powermac G5 when it first came out around the end of 2008, I remember that I originally got it sometime around the 2008 election. My attention was focused on this game the whole time.

It's one of those games where it seems extremely simple at first, but then the complexities and depth of it gradually shine through. The puzzles are neat, and I never had to use any skips until the last part (and I normally sucka t puzzles) but they don't feel easy, they feel satisfying regardless.

The visuals are nice, and they're crisp and good looking, and most importantly they do NOT resort to trying to look like pixel art. However, the game does run at a low resolution and there is no way to change it.

The soundtrack... Well, let's just say it's one of the best soundtracks in an Indie game ever produced. It is well performed, it is entirely originally composed, and it doesn't resort to sounding like chiptune or 16-bit stuff to try and manipulate nostalgic nerves. One of the best parts of the game for certain, and even better is that all of the soundtrack (the full versions, not the shortened versions in the game) can be found right on Youtube. Very memorable soundtrack, I can say that about very very few games.

Buy it? YES! It's on sale frequently anyways.

World of Goo
nice game!

World of Goo
Amazing game.
If only I was good at puzzle solving...

World of Goo
an incredibly original and entertaining physics-based game featuring charming design and funny writing. each stage presents a puzzle that must be solved by creating structurally-sound towers and bridges

+ challenging without being frustrating
+ good fun when trading off attempts with RL friends
+ even your girlfriend will like it
- World of Goo 2 please...

score = 5/5

World of Goo
Years ago, when World of Goo was released on the first Wii I purchased it and had a really fun time, I was even able to complete most of the OCD challenges! (pssh, not doing that again). Anyway I was not willing to spend another 10 dollars on it, I guess I am cheap like that, so today on the day I am writing this recommendation I find that its the 5 year anniversary sale dropping the price to 0.99 cents on all digital marketplaces so I picked it up again. Just figured I would let you guys know that With its fun art style and quirky story I feel world of goo is a worthwhile puzzler

Edit: Stuff

Edit2: I did it again, to OCD for me!

World of Goo
Goo building at its best - build ways to get across - then try to beat the world record for the highest goo building with your winning goo

World of Goo
It has racial diversity,

World of Goo
Absolutely funny, definitely awesome. Stimulates imagination and creativity but being an engineer is not so easy and it drives you totally mad when you need just one more goo to get OCD.

World of Goo
Classic bridge-building puzzle game with nice art style and soundtrack.

World of Goo
This is the definitive game about goo, for goo lovers and goo sympathizers. One of the best experiences with goo physics you will ever have. But the one thing that chocked me was about beauty. That part where you have to kill the ugly to save the beauties All pollution and violence we create to produce useless beauty goo.

World of Goo
Surprisingly simple gameplay mechanics become unexpectedly elaborate.  The gameplay design, artistic direction, musical score are all top notch and you will be hard pressed to find other games of its quality.  Story is not a focal point, but even that is well done in a low key manner with some cool twists.  Suprisingly cheap ($1.49) for one of the best gaming experiences you will have.   After reading this, the word surprise in relation to this game should not be in your vocabulary.  Buy the game.  Currently, the game is worth it regardless of whatever price it is set at now.

World of Goo
Easily one of the finest examples of recent gaming innovation.  It's one of those games you pick up every once in a while and play through again.  I don't think I'll ever stop being amazed at the creativity that went into making this game.

World of Goo
Totally fun casual little game.  Very clever concept.  Frankly one of the most fun games I have played on steam and a must have for any collector.  Great fun for both children and adults.  What you do is build towers of goo up and around obstacles to a pipe to collect the leftover goo.  It is a great game to play a level here and there on a weekly basis or when you just wanna chill a bit.

World of Goo
A fun puzzle game where you have to get goo to get into an exit pipe by creating structures out of goo for the goo to move upon. It's a pretty simple concept and a good game to relax to, but it can get pretty tricky when you're trying to obtain the maximum goo possible.

World of Goo
World of Goo is love, World of Goo is life.

World of Goo
Nice game.  statics and dynamics!!!

World of Goo
Fantastically entertaining, with a weird sense of humor. At its core, it's a puzzle solving game, where the solution is more about careful execution than puzzling out a difficult answer. But failure is perhaps more entertaining than success, and the game has a built-in rewind" mechanism in case your plans don't work out the way you expected.

This game has a lot of kid-appeal

World of Goo
World of Goo is a puzzle game all based in physics where the goal is to build/construct different apparatuses with wobbly black balls of goo that you have to catch while they are rolling around on what ever it is you are trying to accomplish.... You have to build these apparatuses in order to get to the pipe system" so the leftover goo balls you didn't use to get to the pipe can be be sucked up.  This is the levels/score part of the game. Each level you are required to suck up so many goo balls in order to advance to the next level.  This has always been a very fun game.... simple and casual play .... worth a look.

World of Goo, what a great game to start your day of, or to end it, if that suits your fancy.

Not too many games can bring a smile to my face from the first few minutes, but this one made it happen. :D

It's physics-based puzzles, colorful presentation, and unique presentation for its time make it a game that almost everyone should try at least for a few minutes.

It's not a long game mind you, but the story in the background and the game's soundtrack makes it so every second of your experience becomes unique, memorable, and all around worth your time.

The game is cute, funny, with more than one clever puzzle take makes coming back to the game after a few months, or even years, a delight, bringing a smile to your face every time you figure out the right way to advance, and in the end hopefully, to finish the level.

To summarize the world of gooy goo in just a few words...it's fun on a bun. :D

World of Goo
One of the best indie games of all time. Beatiful, addicted, hard and remarkable.

The best puzzle" game you can find."

World of Goo
I played this game before it was released on steam, and I played it on android.

Really fun, interesting, and garanteed fun.

You will definetly laught your  off. Some maps are difficult, but never impossible.

Best physics game ever. It's got best everything. I have it on Wii AND PC. I'll probably get it again if i get another console that has it for download.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
This is equivalent to crack cocaine and therefore it should be prohibited.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
In reference to this weekends new necron overlord last stand character. Well done! Seriously, this new character is refreshingly different from the other classes to make it an interesting play. It will be good to see what it can do when everyone else stops playing necron! Releasing it for free is a nice touch for fans but I fear within a few weeks it will disappear into history and be forgotten by all but the die hard fans.

You've (now refencing the creators) made this new character from scratch prooving that it's not that hard. So why not continue to make content for this brilliant game mode? It wouldn't require much effort to copy in some of the campaign weapons, or say add a new character for each race would it? Hell you could even just copy across the multiplayer classes, techmarine, plaguemarine, ravenor, lictor, ork warboss... or make new ones like kroot shaper or eldar aspect warrior (with different sets of armour).

I feel it must be pointed out that whoever currently owns and operates this game is sitting on a CASH COW/GOLD MINE as this might make them pay attention to the community who desperately want more stuff! It is truely baffling that companies don't pay attention to the gaming community when there is clearly demand for stuff.

You've done really well with this necron overlord content, now please continue to make additional content annd the community will love you!

PLEASE THUMB UP THIS REVIEW" TO ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCTION OF MORE CONTENT!"

This is the version to get. Ignore all others. Standalone product. Retribution has no Games for Windows Live instead opting for Steamworks integration. All races: Chaos; Eldar; Imperal Guard; Orks; Space Marines; and Tyranids, are included. Save yourself the pain of Games for Windows Live and enjoy Dawn of War 2 the way it was meant to be played.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
So youre ready to join the Gaurd and take on the enemies of man are you?

Well we have quite a few:
Between the flesh eating might of the tyranid swarm that consumes all that it touches .
The unrelenting strength of the orc hordes that revel in eternal combat.
Swift moving Eldar that will flay you half without making a sound.
Walking tank armies of Space marines, trained to know no fear for they are death incarnate
Or the servants of the Chaos lords, twisted shadows of their former selves that now only seek destruction and death.

But being in the Imperial Guard isnt so bad. after all they give you a laser rifle



Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
Even after several years, this game still looks and plays well.  A shame they never got to release all of the armies, but it's still fun to go in and enjoy a game with friends.  Last Stand was a suprise hit that is remarkably entertaining for something so simple in its setup.  All in all, this game is definately worth your time and money.  Now integrated with Steamworks, there is renewed hope that Sega may bring the series back with more titles - fingers crossed !

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
As a developer, what would you do when your game is loved by a dedicated fanbase, but mired in dislike for it's stifling DRM? You make a stand alone expansion that is six times the original game and streamline it for an excellent online experience. Good guy Relic.

Real Time Tactical Roleplaying Game. That is how I would describe Dawn of War Retribution. It is focussed on character building, and using special abilities to clear obstacles and objectives. Clearning these obstacles rewards you with gear and other sweet loot to use and to adapt to circumstances. However, unlike the original Dawn of War 2, this one does it with more than just the Space Marines. This time round the campaign is open to the zealous Space Marines, the dogmatic Imperial Guard,  the enigmatic Eldar, the barbaric Orks, the horrific Tyrranids and the eldritch Chaos Marines. Each faction proceeds through the same story and events, but does so for a different purpose. The Space Marines need to clear their name, as their chapter master allegedly has fallen to Chaos, while the Eldar pursue the same cause to prevent their planets from being destroyed by the Inquisition. The Orks just want to fight and the Tyrranids hunger. The voice acting in the game is top notch and delivers the ruminations of each character with gusto and panachel; Slightly over the top, yet in tune with the material. The overal experience is entertaining and diverse, allowing for many hours of gameplay on your own, or with a friend.

The game also features and extensive multiplayer component to go head to head. It plays like your ordinary RTS, but allows for so much customisation in regards to outfits and paintjobs. You might be forgiven for thinking that Valve made this game. The overal experience is a fast paced stratagem, with more focus on skirmishes between parties than massive clashes between armies.

The last mode, and perhaps the most entertaining is Last Stand. In this mode, you and two others try to fend off twenty waves of enemy hordes with customised hero units. The mode is amazing for its many options and rewarding gameplay. No matter how far you come, the game will always reward you with points or items for your effort. Get a friend to two and tackle this beast. You will be entertained.

I could go on to muse this game for another while, but if you're not really into the compact rts style, or Warhammer for that matter, then this game might not be your cup of tea. It can also get a bit boring after five campaigns. Especially the more human oriented races do feel a bit stale after a while.

What? Of course not! Humans? Stale? Art thou mad? Humanity shall prevail. The Emperor wills it. The day that Chaos rules the minds of men shall never come. Stand fast fellow warrior and join us in the eternal battle against the foul beings that the vile warp hath unleashed. Forget you money; human lives are the Emperor's currency. So spend it well, and pay your debt to his Greatness!

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
the singleplayer campaign isnt too good but its also not very bad. repetitive levels though and a rather weak and short told story. still i had fun to hunt the achievements there and to play it with friends in coop-mode. bit annoying bugs there were, even before the migration from winlive to steam when achievements wont unlock, i had to play some races multiple times to trigger them.
the multiplayer is really great though. its just a good concept to ignore base building (which is boring in my opinion) and focus on the micro management of your army fighting for points. i like the great variety of units and abilities which allow different playstyles and lots of strategies. the biggest issue is and was the small player count in the multiplayer mode, still you find and found enough to pretty much always get some games going.
the greatest mode for me is the last stand mode, i dropped hundreds, if not thousands, hours into leveling my heroes and playing for score or just for fun or to help others. it never gets old and you can always jump back in after some time. you will always find players there immediately.
really poor is the support from relic though. the game still has quite a few bugs, especially after the migration from winlive, where the game started, to steam. this update really put a lot of new bugs in the game and took some good functions away and more or less was left in this state.
there is also a so called elite mod, which truely most veteran multiplayer gamer play today. its different balanced and features some more units and even a new faction. personally i dont like the balance there and prefer the balance in the original game. it ever and ever gets modified which maybe has a charme in its own, so you can adjust yourself ever again.
after all superb game. im hoping on dow 3. but i dont have great confidence in relic when i see all the balance mess they made in coh2 (which is now after quite some years, at least at the point im writing this, in a decent state, but the way it took...)

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
When I was 10, I asked my dad for a bb gun, I'm fairly certain he said no at that very moment, but being 10 I didn't hear him, and went around putting fliers from toys r' us in all of his stuff ala Christmas story with bbguns circled,
well come christmas I did not recieve a bbgun.
I got Warhammer Fantasy Battle.
I looked at my dad, and he just laughed, and told me something like go play
I did.
I don't think to this day he realizes what he gave me.
For inside was the warhammer rule book, and this contained not only the rules of playing the first versions of warhammer tabletop, but also the stories and art of warhammer.
I was instantly enthralled, blood, violence, betrayal, sacrifice, crazy insane heroes, epic battles
skip ahead to my discovery of 40k and the fleshing out of the warhammer universe and story led me to consume the books, and art of the universe, my world has never been the same, I gave up Christianity because Jesus couldn't hold his own against Khorne, I mean really, Peace be with you? Lame.
now I'll actually get to  DOW2:Retribution,
Take the massive epic scale of warhammer, condense it down, down to small unit tactics, and you get  to the very heart of Warhammer, the tales of Individual squads and heroes taking part in the struggle of the  Eternal Galactic War,
Every race is  balanced to a T, what at first appears to be a very limited set of units, and heroes, actually becomes an incredible and fluid tactics game, the ebb and flow of battle, the constant tug of war, ambushes, assaults, defenses,  last stands,  the epic clashes of heroes, and dread warmachines,
This is hands down, the best multiplayer Warhammer Game, it captures a very beautiful piece of this amazing universe and brought it to new life for me.
Blood for the blood god, and skulls for the skull throne!

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
Gameplay wise, it has deviated a bit from the traditional Dawn Of War 2 campaigns in favour of a more Dawn Of War - Dark Crusade like meta campaign. You can now choose between Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, Chaos and the Imperial Guard. The campaigns are the same for everyone, however each race has their own agenda. But the goal of every race is to eliminate Azariah Kyras. That means even though the campaign feels redundant, it is refreshing to be able to change tactics and play the campaign as other races.

Retribution also brings some diversity to the campaigns, such that unlike the previous Dawn Of War 2 installments, you can now further diversify your forces by replacing your regular deployable hero units with other honor guard units, depending upon your play style or according to what sort of opposition you expect to face in the campaign. You can also now field a larger number of squads by capturing Relay Beacons (or equivalent for races other than the Space Marines) and call in additional squads or vehicles subject to the amount of Requisition you have captured during your battle. This makes your campaign similar to a skirmish game albeit with campaign like objectives.

You can also gain traits for your hero units faster since you get a guaranteed trait every time you level up, unlike previous Dawn Of War 2 installments, where you have to level up 2-3 times before you get a trait.

Though I feel its somewhat inferior to DOW2 and Chaos Rising story-wise, it is nonetheless interesting to see how the story ends for the Blood Ravens in the Space Marine campaign (which I believe is canon for this series).

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
INTRODUCTION:
Dawn of War II: Retribution is the third and final expansion to the Dawn of War II titles. (Also see my Reviews for Dawn of War II and Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising).

The story takes place after the events of Chaos Rising where Gabriel Angelos and his followers were labeled as renegades by their own Chapter Master Azariah Kyras. With the Tyranid invasions, Ork assaults, Chaos Incursions and Eldar Raids, the Imperium has had enough and has now sent the Inquisition to wipe Sub-sector Aurelia from the Galaxy. The player assumes the role of Captain Apollo Diomedes of the Blood Ravens Honor Guard in his quest to uncover the truth about his Brothers and the Chapter Master he serves.

PROS:
+ More Factions in the Singleplayer Campaign: -  It is refreshing to see that Relic decided to bring back their old formula where other factions are now playable. This includes, Orks, Eldar, Chaos, Imperial Guard and Tyranids. No Tau though.

+ Active Multiplayer Scene: - I normally don't care about Multiplayer in games but I found it very impressive that there still exists a very active online multiplayer community. Last Stand is always fun to play.

+ Imperial Guard: - This faction is the latest addition to the multiplayer / skirmish mode and is very fun to play. Well balanced in my opinion and has added new and interesting characters with likable personalities like Sergeant Merrick.

+ Hero Replacement: - You can now field special Honor Guard units rather than the Hero units you are given. Example: Leave Scout Sergeant Cyrus and deploy a Terminator Honor Guard Squad instead.

CONS:
- Dumbed Down Action RPG Element: - What made the Dawn of War II Campaign unique was its RPG elements. It was seriously disappointing to see it virtually stripped to its bare minimum with only 10 levels as the cap and severely limited wargear selections.

- Poor pathfinding: - Some of the larger vehicles will literally block your army from passing through and will do some really strange movements when it tries to make room for them to pass through. This will result in a very disorganized troop movement specially in some of the smaller maps, or maps with very narrow bottlenecks.

- Short Campaigns: - As a whole, the entire campaign is long if you play through all the factions, but individually, they are shorter than the previous titles with some very weak or hastily put together plot.

- Some unresolved bugs: - At the time of this review the game should be 3 years old but still I encounter bugged missions or bugged units and sometimes out right crashes. Not game breaking but this should have been fixed a long time ago.

CONCLUSION:
GOOD EXPANSION BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND PLAYING THROUGH THE ORIGINAL GAME AND CHAOS RISING FIRST. Retribution adds new factions and units to the game both in Single and Multiplayer, it gives back life to the series with a lot of interesting new characters and story. It does suffer from a rather weak campaign when compared to the original, but makes up for it in a fun multiplayer experience.

New players might enjoy this more for the multiplayer / skirmish rather than the story so I recommend new players to try the original Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising first or even the first Dawn of War game if they want to be invested in the Story.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
Dawn of War 2 is a wonderful tactical strategy game.  Overall, the game is terrific with the only drawback being the miniscule size of armies you're allowed.  Compared to the first installment, it seems like a step back in most areas.  Campaigns are inventive and unique, making the single player just as enjoyable as the multiplayer.  The addition of the Last Stand with Retribution makes this an amazing game.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
For Anyone who is a 40K FAN and RTS Fan this Game is a Must in your list  of games

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
This game is everything you could want from a Warhammer 40k RTS. It functions just like company of heroes, probably because theyre both made by relic

Overall this is a wonderfull game to get if you like warhammer 40k. Theirs 6 factions to play as, each with its own unique machanics and play style, The Space Marines, The Imperial Guard, The Eldar, The Tyranids, Chaos, and my personal Favorite, The Orks

each faction has 3 different commanders you can deploy and the game is very well balanced, the sories are decent, and fun, but sometimes lacking depth

Multiplayer is the key feature of this game, as it is the most fun you'll have. Stand against an ork waaaahg, or a tyranid invasion, or fight against the ruinous powers as the guard or the angels of death. The games are just long enough, and the learning curve isnt too severe if you know how to play an RTS

The Elite mod for this game has kept the community alive, as it rebalences the game, adds new units and another faction (The Grey Knights) and is updated frequently. The community for it holds monthly tournaments, has a number of game casters, and is overall a great community

Pros
+ 6 differnt factions that are very distinct from one another in how they play
+ Lots of maps and worlds to choose from
+ Graphics are pretty good
+ Lots of different units for every army, as well as commanders
+ good resource managment
+ Multiplayer is amazing
+ campaigns are pretty fun
+ Elite mod has completely taken over as the official support and keeps the game alive
+ AI is decently challanging
+ Lots of solid DLC that isnt stupidly expensive and can easily be forgone if you dont want them

Cons
- Only 2 multiplayer modes
- Only can have 2 teams in multiplayer, so no massive 6 army free for alls, which was a wasted oportunity in my opinion
- No more official support as THQ doesnt exist anymore
- Controls are a bit wonky
- Unit pathing can be weird at times

On the whole, this game is well worth the mere $30 it asks for, and theirs plenty of DLC for it that is great, such as more wargear for you campaign commanders, more skins for multiplayer armies, and additional gear for the last stand

i give this game 10/10 Ork stormboyz rocketing into the imperial guard lines. Get the game, you wont regret it

Apollo Diomedes; also known as Day-o-MIDIs, Abaldo Diomedes, Boreale 2.0, and BRUVAIAMHITT, is the captain of the Blood Ravens honour guard and the main Space Marine protagonist of Dawn of War 2: Retribution. He also seems to be a close relative of Indrick Boreale due his unique intonation and highly elaborated ingame responses. Ohh, and he's also bald, as in Captain Boreale bald. He is also notable for constantly soliciting Eldar Farseers for sex on the battlefield with bellowing cries of; FAHSEEYAH LET US TO IT!!". In essence

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution is an excellent RTS-style game where base-building itself is dropped, in favor of more strategic combat involvement. While this may seem initially like a dumbing-down from DoWI, the playstyle it encourages is more fast-paced, usually more aggressive, and leads itself to large armies splitting off across the map. This has ended up being a very fun way to play an RTS.

The campaign has benefited from this style in that in place of a Commander unit, you can have up to four Heroes that are powerful (typically single-person) units with Wargear upgrades and stat boosts while in a mission. These heroes can be substitued for an Honor Guard unit, which is a stronger version of a standard army unit. While building an army is fun, I also had a blast clearing the missions with only my Heroes and their witty banter.

Multiplayer has become faster, which is usually a plus, as it allows us to play more games, or to boot up a match when normally we couldn't. I enjoy that gameplay feels more aggressive, with players capturing Requisition Points and Power Nodes in order to increase the speed that accumulate resources to purchase army units, and with holding the Victory Points, in which you must hold more than your opponent for a period of time in order to win. This leads to a very active playstyle, where you're balancing defensive capabilities with offensive, and mobility with firepower. Nearly every unit has potential upgrades, either as stat increases or new weapons, allowing them to be good against, and bad against, different types of enemies. Something as small as purchasing a few Flamers will make your unit that much stronger with melee engages, and constantly staying one step ahead of your enemy in upgrades, or creating units to counter their build, will often be the deciding factor of whether you fall from grace, or rise in glory as a successful tactician. The Hero system also carries into Multiplayer, as you select from one of six races, then one of three Hero units per race. These Heroes have different skills and Racial Abilities, and encourage different playstyles. Similar to the Campaign, these Hero units can purchase Wargear ingame once they have met the requirements (per game, no carrying over), to grant higher stats and capabilities against different enemies.

The Last Stand, also sold as an individual DLC package, is a great mode where three players try to survive, and conquer, 20 waves of enemies. Each player selects a Hero and their Wargear before entering queue, with seven different Heroes, and a LOT of Wargear options. Mirrors are possible, but do not generally affect gameplay, and will likely have different builds. Wargear is obtained through leveling up, where you gain experience points at the end of the game, or through special, sometimes difficult, achievements. Most Heroes have two achievement Wargear unlocks. The Last Stand is incredibly brutal, very unforgiving, and you may never beat it. Players have the ability to revive fallen teammates, though this immobilizes the reviver, and reduces their firepower greatly, easily causing their death as well. Also on the map are two Point Multiplying Nodes, similar in appearance to Power Nodes, that add a x3 multiplier to your team's score each. Certain types of enemies will try to capture these points for themselves. Each Hero is vastly different, and every team composition is as well, leading to immense replayability, especially if you haven't beaten either of the two maps yet... (It's always that blasted Wave 20! ;-;)

Lore-wise this game is both engaging and genuinely gets the grimdark feel of the WH40k universe. As the story progressed, through the earlier two campaigns (DoWII and DoWII:Chaos Rising) and this one, I felt the tragedies come one after the other, and each victory feeling less and less impactful until you get that one killing blow that just brings everything you've done all together, and you can feel the weight just disappear off of your chest, and you sit back in the chair and let out this sigh of relief... until you are informed of another emergency happening almost immediately. It kept me on the edge of my seat with its grimdarkness, its surprisingly fitting comedy (especially playing as those 'ard Ork boyz), and my genuine interest in how it was going to play out. While a lot of people feel that the campaign is short, and it kinda is, it certainly isn't lacking in content or gameplay, and it was very fun.

Pros        Cons                Engaging campaign, interesting and fitting characters, fun take on an RTS.        Short campaign that may be a little lackluster if you haven't played the other campaigns in earlier games.                Fun multiplayer design that encourages constant action.        May take a while to get into the mode as there is a lot to learn, and a lot to manage.                The Last Stand is a great mode with high replayability and a fun premise.        May be repetetive, harder for lower-levels which may discourage Hero diversity, and one Hero is locked behind paid DLC.
TL;DR: 9/10 A very fun game that successfully captured the essence of the WH40k universe, and gave me three fun modes to play. There is a modding community as well, keeping it alive, and encouraging its growth. I highly recommend it to any WH40k or RTS fan.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
Amazing game though quite different for soul storm and dark crusades game play style. However is similar to DOW 2 (the first one) continue the story...

Campaign is good but doing it more than once is boaring as EVERY SINGLE ONE IS THE SAME or very similar. Last stand is awesome didnt play it on the first DOW 2. DLC for online last stand is very useful so I recommend that too.

Great game campaign is fun once or twice through though doesn't have much replay value.

Worth getting it and its last stand DLC you can get this game in a bundle for cheaper than all or them seperate (DOW 2, DOW 2 Chaos Rising and DOW 2 Retribution in the pack) Definatly worth the buy.

However I got this on sale and payed about 15 for all 3 games so 19.99 does seem steep...

8/10 - Price and repetitive campaign let it down but Last stand is awesome and the campaign 1st time is awesome too.

Standalone expansion to DoW2.

Singleplayer is a bit dull. It is too damn linear. But, after Gorgutz, it has one of the funniest Ork ever, Kaptin Bluddflagg.

Its 1 of my best games. Over 700h are the proof. Mayby compaign isnt the best (all fractions have almost the same missions) but multiplayer is great. You can play last stand on 2 different maps and defeat 20 waves of enemys with 2 friends. If you are bored or its not your style you can try multiplayer but its really hard (veterans with over 1000h will crush you or call noobs but its normal). Learn, find friends, make team and fight in epic 3v3 battles where super heavy units will fight under your command and powerfull global abilities will crush whole armies. Im waiting for you on the battlefield with my friends to crush you or admit that this time you were better.

Well,

As an absolute Warhammer 40k Universe Fan there is indeed something to say about this game.

I played the Dawn of War Games since the first one came out and I was a little bit dissapointed when I first played DoW II.
Beside the better Graphics, I missed all the other playable Races from Soulstorm and hardly the Planetary Conquer Mode. After playing trough all stories I really became sad, because it doesnt matter which race you choose, the levels are all the same. A shame!

BUT

and here is the but: The Arena Modes are still awesome. Very much fun guaranteed.

Well, since THQ isnt anymore I give up all hope for a conquer mode or a better DoW III

Campaign - Not as good as DOW2s and DOW2: CRs campaigns, but it makes up for this by allowing you to play the campaign through as all the races, Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, Tyranids and imperial guard. imperial guard is a new faction added in Retiribution we saw a little of in the previous 2 DOW2 games. overall the campaign was pretty decent.

Last stand - Pretty much identical to the DOW2/DOW2:CR Last stand modes, adds one new map and a bunch more gear. Last stand is basically a horde mode, in an RTS. yes its interesting. there is a standalone game called the last standalone" which is just the last stand mode.

Multiplayer - Now i play the game mostly for the mutliplayer. i could make an entire essay about how the multiplayer is good

My favourite RTS series of all time. The vanilla MP is unfortunaly dead but elite mod is where its at
http://www.dawnofwar.info/ link to the elite mod site, download the mod with all the patch's needed and start playing games!
If you aren't very good or new to dow2 then join the begginers steam group, introduce yourself and play some beginner games. The group is really friendly and supportive for new players therefore i highly recommend it.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
In the mold of the Dark Crusade expansion for the original Dawn of War, Retribution allows you to play a campaign for each available faction. Unfortunately, the Risk-style campaign map present in Dark Crusade does not exist in Retribution. Instead, each faction plays an almost identical campaign on a set path, with the only major differences being the characters you use and what your characters say. While it's fun to play the new heroes from each faction, the campaign rapidly becomes repetitive. I played through the space marine and ork campaigns and had fun, but I couldn't bring myself to finish yet another campaign with a virtually identical story and identical missions.

Not recommended.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
Almost 5 years old and still going strong, Dawn of War II Retribution is a pretty fun game that'll keep you coming back for more with its addictive gameplay and strategic battle scenarios. It's not entirely perfect, but it can be a very enjoyable game for both old and new fans of the Warhammer 40K series.

The Pros Awesome intro
Six playable races (Space marines, Chaos, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, and Tyranids)
The Last Stand is the most addicting. Eight heroes(two of whtich are DLC) to choose from, 20 waves of enemies to fight off, and each of the two maps has special gimmicks to make the experience different.
Can create custom color schemes for each race to use in Multiplayer and Last Stand
Pretty cheap when it goes on sale
Mods make it fun for those who play the Multiplayer mode by adding new units and increased pop cap (+300!)
Final boss is fun to fight
Lots of potential for a Dawn of War III
You cam wage a massive WAAAGH!
TYRANIDS!!!!

The Cons  Campaign is repetative. Each race goes through the exact same missions with different dialogue, different commanders, different units, and different prologue and epilogue cutscenes.
Some glitches have yet to be patched. Don't worry, there isn't that many
Multiplayer is not as newb friendly as Last Stand. If you haven't played the first four Dawn of War games, stay away from it
Tau Efficiency achievement
100 unit pop cap in Multiplayer makes it hard to get a good assault.
Dark Eldar Archon and Sisters of Battle Canoness are not DLC heroes for Last Stand  :'(  Some DLC isnt worth it even when on sale, specifically the ones for Multiplayer that offer special color schemes that dont appear in Last Stand
Space Marine and Imperial Guard campaign DLC is $2 whilst all other campaign DLC is $1
Space Marine ending is only canonical ending
No third map for Last Stand
While it does have it's fair share of ups and downs, you can always be sure it will keep you coming back for more

9.5/11 Here's to hoping they got something big planned for this game's 5th anniversary! -chugs fungus beer- WAAAAAAAAHG!!!!!!

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
The last installment of Dawn of War II. Finally you can play as any race in the single player campaign. There is no carryover component from the previous games, and the game itself is standalone. The abilities and wargear are fairly fun to customize, and the game is not hard even on the highest setting. A second map was added to the multiplare arcade mode, which was harder waves than the first. There is a purchaseable arcade-mode DLC that adds a Tau crisis/broadside unit as a playable hero, which is very interesting.

I guess overall this has to be my favourite series of all time, although I don't play this game at all anymore. Across the three games in this series I have logged almost 1000 hours of play, most of which was single player.

Maybe it's a bad idea to review all three games under one title, but they are best viewed as parts of a whole. The vanilla game was really challenging when played on Primarch; there was an intricate re-deployment system that encouraged you to play every mission to the best of your ability, as well as a ton of wargear that wasn't guarenteed to drop at fixed points. Chaos rising was my favourite, offering maximal flexibility in squadmates, gear, playstyle and choices. Once the Chaos Rising patch is applied to the vanilla game, playing the vanilla part on hardest becomes really hard. The Corruption system in Chaos rising was great, decently complex, and have a bearing on the ending. Retribution was the easiest game out of the three, but you can play as any race you want and the ending is open-ended. Once again, Retribution does not require the first two games to play, and it has no carryover mechanic, although the storyline is officially continuous. If you don't like to play as space marines but like the single player aspect, just play Retribution.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
Pros:
-Death Korps of Krieg
-Six campaigns
-Six factions
-Good multiplayer
-Fun last stand

Cons:
-Can't spawn enough guardsmen to drown the enemy in all the blood

Totally worth it just for Last Stand horde mode and there still hasn't been anything better since 2011.

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Retribution
A wonderful take on RTS. Relic has once again made a stupendous game that combines great rts elements like cover, choke points, scouting, etc. And blends it with the intense micromangement of individual squads. The campaign is good, and well down, giving a good balance of missions to play through with different difficulties. However it lacks in preparing you for multiplayer, and the skills needed to really be able to compete against others. If your wanting a great rounded RTS, then pick this up, but be prepared for very hard, skilled opponents in multiplayer. There is no skill based matchmaking.

4/5 Would pick this up again in a heartbeat.

Dear Esther
It isnt a game, its an experience.

A lot of the criticism and confusion of Dear Esther is brought about because it is not exactly 'a game'. There are no enemies, no objectives, no inventory, nothing we've come to expect in video games. It is where art, storytelling and games intersect, to create a masterpiece.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=553155472

Dear Esther is visually astounding. Journey deep into the island's caves and you will be utterly in awe of the beauty therein.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498467039

The music is beautifully haunting, always appropriate in intensity for the situation, and never overwhelming it.
The narration contributes significantly to the player's emotional state while traversing the island. His rantings and musings, his rage and his despair, all help lend color to the landscape, and keep the player firmly rooted in the world before them.

Whether you would define Dear Esther as a game or not, if you have any interest in narrative driven adventure games, youre sure to find a new favorite here and it is without a doubt an experience you will not regret.


Verdict: 8/10

Dear Esther
Well there's something you don't see everyday - Dr. Peter Venkman, Ghostbusters

THE GOOD
Dear Esther is not your ordinary game. In some respects, it is not a game at all. Focusing on environments and atmosphere rather than gameplay and action is a nice way to change the pace, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who prefers Serious Sam and Doom over Amnesia and Proteus, I do not think this game is for you. The sound in the game is, well, not very exciting overall. The intro plops you into the island with explanation of why you are there, if you pay attention. The story is told by a nameless narrator, who talks about the island, his hobbies, and the mysterious Esther. Digging deeper into the story explains more about the characters and the settings, but only if you are willing to look.

THE GREAT
The game can be frightening and intense if you let it. Beautiful environments are accompanied by the haunting yet calming voice of the narrator, who tells his life to you. While not the best decision for gameplay, Dear Esther provides with an amazing narrative and an atmosphere that is so thick you could wrap yourself up in it. The first chapter is the make or break point in this game.While not looking very stunning, the first part does do its job to set up the second half of the game. Not giving away too much, but not boring you to the point of no return. The end of the second chapter is where it is its best. The aesthetic changes completely, music greets you immediately, and the haunting feeling kicks in. The third chapter is my personal favourite, with the climax of the game leaving you able to interpret it however you please.

THE UGLY
There is no gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted gameplay, they could've at least given you the choice to turn off and on your flashlight, or maybe do some simple puzzle. Face the facts: You walk extremely slow. Perhaps for pacing, but it can be frustrating whil you spend the whole damn game going 10mph (That's metres, not miles). Also, for a game about discovery, there is very little to discover, not that you'd feel inclined to due the the speed of your walking. It can be quite boring if you're playing it after watching a walkthrough of it on Youtube, TwitchTV, or whatever place you use to watch gameplay videos, so I'd recommend not watching gameplay of Dear Esther before playing it. Also the visuals of Dear Esther deteriorates when it is put into videos, no matter how you set the graphical quality (1080p does NOT do this game justice via video).

THE VERDICT
There are two types of people in the world. Type one is the type who prefer Proteus over Dear Esther, and the other type of people prefer Dear Esther over Proteus. I fall into the latter category, for many reasons. If in doubt, get it on a sale. If you like it, great news! If you don't, you spent $5 and 1.4GB 'playing' a game that you didn't like. Personally, I think that the third chapter is the best chapter in this game. For the first two chapters, you explore the island, and at the end of the second chapter, a forced plot point happens which sends you to the most beautiful part of this game. The final chapter wraps it up nicely, and some people will like the final chapter more, so suffice to say the second half f the game is generally liked more. Also, this is NOT a game for children. It can be difficult to understand and there are so many plot elements that are metaphors or relatively unusual.

SIMILAR GAMES
-Proteus, in many ways, but also differs greatly
-Amnesia: The Dark Descent, although without being as scary

Dear Esther
Dear Esther is beautifully designed, hauntingly atmospheric and splendidly narrated. It also has a couple of very big problems...

<Contains minor spoilers>

The Old Argument
...but funnily enough, the question of whether or not Dear Esther is a game isn't one that bothers me. Gaming is still a relatively young medium, and writing off a game just because it doesn't meet the traditional definition can only stifle innovation and discourage others from experimenting. Ultimately, I'm more interested in the question: did Dear Esther succeed in what it set out to do? Well, allow me to elaborate on what I think.

Hebrides
Dear Esther is a so-called walking simulator" (i.e. has very little gameplay besides walking and looking) set on a bleak Hebridian island. This island is perhaps the most compelling character in the entire story: it is nothing short of breathtaking. I regularly visit these islands in real life

Dear Esther
This is a work of art.

There is little story, and even less gameplay.  You're mostly railroaded along a path, where you will hear and see things.  The world is visually appealing, and the voice work is wonderful, but the overall mood may or may not appeal to you.

Like any purely artistic work, it either speaks to you or it falls flat.  Personally, it's not my cup of tea, but it might be yours.

Dear Esther
As always, TL;DR at the bottom. This game deserves more though.

In recent years it has become more common to hear gamers, and even some non-gamers giving credit to games as pieces of art. Truly all games are art in some form as they provide a visual and narrative experience no matter what type of game they are. Some games are simply greater classified as art than others, but even inside of that it seems something such as 'Dear Esther' should be given credit on the art scale much higher than any old video games are art" scale.

'Dear Esther' is claimed by many as "not a game". This is a debate I am no longer interested in

Dear Esther
This is an excellent way to share some time with yourself, in a very intimate way. Only for loners.

Dear Esther
During the first 10 minutes or so of this game, while I was wandering (slowly) through the game's initial area, I was bored. Very, very bored.  While I was bored there was a pretentious British guy babbling to me in an overwrought poetic manner about something that had happened and for which I had no background information to help me understand what the hell he was talking about.  That changed (thankfully): the backstory filled in, the environment and audio changed, and things improved dramatically.

This game has very impressive visual and audio aesthetics.  The background sounds and ambient music enhance the experience significantly (you should play with headphones on).  The voice acting is also compelling--you can really feel the narrator's internal turmoil as he struggles with what has happened.  The world the developers built here has a sense of mystery, purpose and beauty, but also sadness, introspection, and the portent of dread.  As I progressed through the game" I felt more and more anxious about the revelations to come from the narrator. The suspense was palpable

Dear Esther
I love this game.
Why? Cause it's unusual. It's not like any other exploration/adventure game i've seen on steam.
You can compare it to book with missing pages and those pages that you have are not in order.
It was so beautiful in term of visual appearance and atmosphere back in 2012.

Dont buy if you are looking for any kind of action and can't spend few hours just walking around this island, slowly unfolding story.

Dear Esther
I really enjoyed Dear Esther. Whether it be the beautiful visuals, the powerful ambient music or the in-depth analysis into the human mind. Dear Esther has it all.

I was perplexed upon reaching The Caves, it's truly stunning at what can be achieved within the parameters of the Source engine.

I'd consider this as more of an artistic experience than a game. I found myself questioning so much during my playthrough and for that, I'm thankful for such a wonderful journey.

Dear Esther: Games as Art
Up till five years ago, discussions about games as a form of art, were largely considered as non-important. There was a more or less clear distinction between the higher" arts

Dear Esther
Published by: Thechineseroom
Developed by: Thechineseroom & Robert Briscoe
Genre: Adventure/Walking Simulator
Release Date: February 14, 2012

IntroductionThis 'game' truly is an artistic masterpiece. Being a walking simulator, the aim is simple; you walk around an island, taking in it's beautiful surroundings. The protagonist of this 'game' is a man set on a journey across a seemingly abandoned island. As you walk, fragments of a letter sound, and you're left with questions, allowing your imagination to run rampant. Who is Esther, and why does this quiet island resonate such familiarity with our protagonist? Are the surroundings real, or imagined? Abandoned buildings, caves and shipwrecks, this island brings forth an eerie yet calming atmosphere, and the raw emotion is exemplified with the stunning atmospheric soundtrack.

Graphics The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and there is no lack of stunning landscape and imagery throughout the hour and a half (give or take) of game play. However, to call it a game would be entirely misleading; Dear Esther is more of a immersive movie, taking you on a beautifully narrated story around a mysterious island.

Verdict:
As the graphics are generally a main focus in a walking simulator (being that there's no real 'game play'), it's super important that they get this right- which they did, perfectly. The only negative thing I could say on the visuals of this artistic masterpiece, is that it ended too soon.
Score: 8/10

Soundtrack The beautiful instrumental soundtrack, composed by the talented Jessica Curry specifically for this game, has a tranquil, soothing vibe that really adds to the feel of the story. Add to that the calming narration by Nigel Carrington, and you're set to go on a relaxing and encapsulating first person experience.

Verdict:
The beautifully orchestrated soundtrack perfectly fits the mysterious and engrossing story line, filling the story with a soothing atmosphere.
Score: 9/10

Overall VerdictThis visually appealing game is definitely worth experiencing if you like peaceful games with a rich storyline.

Overall Score: 8/10

First off, let's be clear: this isn't a game for everybody. Nor is it really a 'game'. If you want fast paced action, turn back now, but if you're looking for something different, something a bit avant-garde and arty, Dear Esther is well worth your time.

You play a nameless character (first-person) who wanders along a basically linear path accross an abandoned Hebridean island for about 2 hours while a narrator intermittently reads fragments of letters to a woman named Esther. Interaction is minimal: you can walk, look around, and zoom in slightly. A flashlight automatically turns on when you enter a dark place. That's it in terms of gameplay, but Dear Esther's focus is not gameplay, it's on story.

And what a confusing story it is. Piecing together the narrative will require you to listen carefully to everything the narrator says, read past the symbolism and shifting characters, and to play the game a few times (the fragments are mixed semi-randomly each time you start the game, so you won't hear every fragment until you've played the game at least 4 times). On top of that, you'll have to look around for visual clues on the island: objects littered on the ground, books in houses, diagrams and messages painted on walls. Even then, you'll still have trouble figuring out everything exactly what happened. However, you'll be able to work out the bare bones of the story from one playthrough.

As mentioned before, the story is primarily told through letters read out by a narrator who is the protagonist of the story. The writing is poetic, symbolic, and digressive, often making it difficult to follow, but this is intentional I believe. The writing is really excellent (although a little over-wrought at times), and is delivered fantastically by the voice actor. Without giving much away, the story concerns a tragic accident in the narrator's past, and explores themes of guilt and redemption. Its stunning conclusion nearly brought me to tears, and loses none of its power on replays.

The visuals of Dear Esther are stunning, wonderfully complimenting the loneliness and sadness of the story. You get a real visual feast, from the rugged hills above ground to the etheral caves below. The music is also beautiful, and goes well with the visuals and story.

By now, you know whether this game is for you or not. If you think it is, buy Dear Esther right now and get ready for the experience of a lieftime.

Dear Esther
...but your fascination with the empty

Dear Esther
This game is a gamble. You'll either have a near-life changing emotional experience and come out a changed person, or... you will be bored witless on an otherwise pretty walk on an island. I fell in the latter group unfortunately, and I cannot recommend this game.

Dear Esther
I did really end up enjoying it even if I can't recommend it. On the surface this has a lot going against it. Dear Esther feels like less of a game, more of an experience. You awaken on an island at one end under a lighthouse and you walk your way to a red beacon on a radio tower in the sky. The whole thing takes an hour or less to complete the experience. The controls are simple, walk and zoom. There is no jump or sprint.

You will experience the morbid and yet gorgeous island in all of its glory. I say experience more than explore. As much as you can walk around and think you're doing your own thing, you're really just on a set path that is highly detailed and winds through coastal beaches, caves and cliff sides. It is a beautiful game and might be one of the most beautiful games ever visually.

The day turning into night was a nice touch, even if at night you can end up completely blind by the dark. It seemed like the day and night wasn't random as the game claims, but if I died, it did become darker until I was unable to see.

The whole thing is very immerse with only 3 loading 'screens' once the game begins. The game is short and sweet, it doesn't overstay its welcome for what is basically a glorified tech demo of the Source engine. Supposedly no play through is the same with different audio for each run, but when I played a second time everything felt the same even if I didn't hear the audio at the exact same spot. I explored a lot more, but everything was the same.

You can also find it in a few bundles for less than $10 which then the price is worth it, but for 1 hour of an experience, I can't recommend it.

Dear Esther
In Dear Esther, you'll wander beautiful environments with no interaction or objective while listening to soothing ambient music, with any hope of immersion ruined by pretentious narration where every disconnected, nonsensical reference is emo's first metaphor.

--SPOILERS--

Finally, after an entire grueling hour, you will discover the two redeeming qualities the game has to offer: its extremely short length and the fact, I'm pretty sure, you ultimately commit suicide.

I'd urge anyone planning on enduring this experience" to enable the developer console in the options and increase your movement speed so you can kill yourself faster."

How many dead shepherds could fill this hole?"

Dear Esther belongs to video games which are doomed to be criticized. The reason is gameplay for you only do three things: walk

Dear Esther
NOTE - This game has been provided to me for free for review purposes.OverviewDear Esther is not a game, it is a walking simulator, and it is an experience. You walk on a deserted island, while your mind narrates some letters you wrote to Esther (hence the name). It focuses on the environment, the music, and the very detailed world to amaze and relax you.

The Pros:Beautiful - The game is beautiful. The world is very detailed, put together with much care and thought. Every scenery is breath-taking. Lots of dense foliage, rocky cliffs, and watery caves. Wonderful lightning as well! This is a walking simulator, of course. It is meant for you to behold, to explore, to enjoy.

Great Narrative - The narration is very well performed, and the contents are nice as well. Pay close attention and you will get a grasp of what happened in the past. I won't give details about them here. Experience them yourselves.

Relaxing - Besides buying a game, you also get free relax pills. This is excellent for when you are stressed out. Just enter the game, pick a chapter, and slowly walk, breathe in deeply, enjoy the beauty. Works like a charm!Cons:Linear - The game doesn't allow you to stray too far off your obviously paved paths. There are some occasions where you will encounter dead ends, but fear not. Just turn around, look for 5 seconds and the true path will surely be revealed to you.

One Hour - That is the approximate time you will spend walking around. This is the standard length of this type of games, and I am not disappointed with it's length. But the world is so well made, I just want to see more of it!
ConclusionFor a 2012 game, this was a fresh breath of air. Good looking, interesting, and highly relaxing. If you like this type of games, get it, you won't regret it.

Dear Esther
The main problem with Dear Esther (contrary to popular belief,) isn't anything to do with the gameplay. It's 'exploration-focused' and lacks any form of conflict, but I have no real problem with that. You'll find some who spend time debating whether or not this is a game (it is,) but I think this is a useless diversion here. It doesn't really matter one way or the other.

What does matter though, is whether it's aesthetically any good. It clearly attempts to deliver in two ways here, through the writing alone and through the connection between it and the world you're exploring. This means that the opening conceit which justifies it being a video game and indeed having any exploration is that the narrator says: I sometimes feel as if Ive given birth to this island."

This leads to a game-length extended metaphor tying his emotions regarding the actual events of the story (which take place on the motorway in Britain

Dear Esther
I don't normally do reviews because I'm too lazy and stuff, but this is such a good game that I have to write a positive review just in case I can persuade someone to buy this game and try it for themselves.

Arguments about whether it's really a game or not don't matter, the point is that it's a deep, thought-provoking experience that I enjoy each time I play through it.  It's all about story, and this game tells its story in such a way that you kind of have to interpret it for yourself.

No NPC's giving you exposition, no fetch quests, no half-naked elf women; Just a tragic, romantic, and deep story told amongst the beautiful scenery of an uninhabited Hebridean island.

I definitely recommend giving this one a try.  Also the soundtrack is awesome.

Dear Esther
This is not a game. This is an experience. A damn good one at that.

Dear Esther
A nice game with perhaps some of the best graphics ever seen in a sourc-game, but it is a walking simulator. If that's not your thing, look elsewhere.

Dear Esther
Well, I finally got around to playing this after years of languishing in my backlog (3 years I think?). Initially, I didnt play it because my computer couldnt handle it and it kept freezing. However, I realized that since I had upgraded my GCU, there was no reason not to, and on maxed out settings no less.

The game is in a word: BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, this might be one of the best looking games if not THE best looking game ever. It's probably a bit messed up, but I kept thinking that this is how Skyrim should have looked (not that Skyrim looked bad). Anyway, I digress. This is actual a mostly linear exploration game, where the story is revealed as you check out locations.

The story itself is the subject of much speculation and debate. One thing that is not debatable is that this isnt exactly a happy story being told, although possibly it has a hopeful ending depending on how you perceive the entirety of the story. I will give my take on that at the end of this review so it wont spoil the game for anybody who doesnt want to read it. It is told in narrative fashion.

The gameplay itself is simply you walking around, looking at stuff. You can zoom in, and that is exactly all your actual gameplay options.Keeps it pretty simple that way.

I mentioned the graphics before, but seriously, the attention to detail, even the minutia of a scene, is fairly well flawless. I can find zero fault with it whatsoever. You will be truly amazed with this aspect of the game in my opinion. There are some really jaw dropping images in this game. If you are curious, take a peak at the 140 or so screenshots I took, lol (but be wary of spoilers in them).

So, that is pretty much it. This game is perfection as far as walking simulator/exploration games go. I've seen nothing better yet. 10/10

Alright, now to the SPOILERS

It is my opinion that our protagonist is a ghost, revisitng his final days, his final regrets, and finally coming to terms with everything. I am of the opinion that, whether or not s/he was actually dead (the voice is male, but the reality of his gender is ambiguous at best), he was at the very least hallucinating and/or in a hospitalized, drug induced state of disorientation. His mind is clearly fractured and I think the people he references (himself, Jacobson, Esther Donnelly) are all parts of his own consciousness. The cause was obviously an auto wreck, although maybe this was just metaphor as well, and I coulnt help but think that he had lost a daughter, which was the source of his wrecked mind.

I dont know though. This story leaves a lot of your own subjective interpretation, which is actually another appealing aspect of this game

SPOILER/REVIEW END.

Dear Esther
More of an experience than anything, Dear Esther delivers the stunning and riviting tale of a man who reflects his memories of his past wife who fatally died in a car crash. Exploring the area allows you to further understand the story, with a well laid out path for you to follow. The tale also inspires extremely beautiful visuals for just being a Source game, known for their fast pased gaming titles previously released. At a slow and easy pase, there's absolutely no distractions from a unrelaxing experience, rather you'll actually get some sort of sadness out of it.

My experience playing it was great. I understood everything from the story, and was instantly hooked by the second of four chapters. The visuals were added bonuses. I loved every minute of it, up to the very end of the tale, with the game ending in the most scenic way possible, and provided a lovely score to it as well.

I encourage you to give this game a try, no matter the price, because at the price I got it ($2 USD) I feel I should have payed more for such a beautiful and relaxing tale.

10/10 Would walk again. Great syphilis simulator.

Dear Esther
I've recently been exploring walking simulators and unfortunatley its been in descending order. Firewatch was engaging, interesting and immersive. Gone Home was slightly less immersive but still interesting enough to finish with fond thoughts.

Dear Esther is far and and way the worst of those three and really is just a terrible game. Even for a walking simulator it was far too light on the game aspect of being a game. The lack of an interact button should have been a giveaway. At least in the above mentioned games you can amuse yourself throwing mugs off towers or turning on every light in the house. In Dear Esther you wander (VERY SLOWLY) around a deserted Island, probably in the Northern Atlantic. While you do so fragments of a fairly obvious story are told to you in a disjointed, fragmented manner. This makes its tough to figure out what's going on but even more confusing is that most of the time the fragments have nothing to do with what you are looking at. The much touted soundtrack cuts in and out with awful editing, at first i thought it was to add to the disquieting atmosphere but in hindsight it was probably just lazy like the story.

Whats worse is that it felt like it was punishing me for exploring, as is basic instinct for gamers i dutifully went down every path and looked in every cave. Without fail there was no reward, no pay off, no collectables and mostly no new information. I think twice in the whole game my curiosity was rewarded with a little two line explosition that revealed nothing new. There are open-ended games but there is a different between open-ended and just adding random things. Twice i found a suitcase of clothes at the bottom of a cliff, why? Who knows. I found three bedrolls which make no sense if this is *SPOILER his mind/puratory*. The game touts its own mystery with things like What is the significance of the lighthouse?" but honestly i don't think the writers even know.

I finished the whole game in 2hrs which was both too short and too long. Too short in that it felt like a waste of money and too long in that the cripplingly slow walking pace

Dear Esther
I'm a proponent for expanding our limited and stagnant definition of what constitutes a video game;" that games like Dear Esther exist is a good thing for the medium. The more we challenge the status quo through the creation and the experience of such games

Dear Esther
9/10 Best walking simulator I have ever played.

No need to run (not that you can), just enjoy a nice leisurely stroll around a deserted island. Game contains varied environments to appreciate. Savour the beautiful scenery while free roaming and exploring.

I deducted a point because of some narrator that kept interrupting my otherwise  immersive walking experience.


Dear Esther
Dear Esther is the remake of an experimental mod for Half-Life 2. The original was developed by a research project at the University of Portsmouth led by professor and media researcher Dan Pinchbeck.

The first thing that is to say about Dear Esther is: It's not a game. It has no gameplay elements and its experimental approach makes it impossible to categorize. The author calls it a ghost story

Dear Esther
It's a poem where you get to walk in it. It's short so it won't have any chance to bore. It looks great, music is absolutely awesome and it makes you think and comment on it  (while you're alone in your room, talking to yourself)

If you have the patience of someone who even can't stand game intros (you idiots) stay away. Otherwise take a walk, listen to the wind and see the reflections of an old man on a beautiful island.

Dear Esther
Very emotional, very beautiful. The atmosphere is stunningly strong and solid. There is a feeling of something dark and mysterious always lingering around, makes you paranoid, scared. The poetry is hard to understand and I didn't know what the man was talking about half of the time but it was beautiful and mysterious. The Source engine is perfectly utilized as the environments and all the details are absolutely breathtaking. The music and sounds are significant parts of the atmosphere. The game design is so good it doesn't need any item pickups, puzzles or any sort of advanced controls and that's a very unusual feat. It just works on it's own as an emotional, artistic experience and I think that modern games should be heading that direction to support the gameplay, or as in case of Dear Esther, be completely symbiotical, to create unforgettable games.

Dear Esther
Positives:
+ Visually stunning, the scenery is beautiful
+ Enjoyable soundtrack

Negatives:
- Doesn't really feel like a game.  The only controls are to turn and move forward, with a zoom feature I never needed to use.  There's no interaction at all, you just walk along a mostly railroaded path, with occasional snippets breaking in to tell the story
- The story is somewhat convoluted, and while it makes you think a bit, it didn't really hold my interest enough
- It's extremely short, I finished the game/story in just over an hour

Comments:
The graphics, scenery and sound track are excellent, but I just didn't really enjoy this game".  The lack of any real interaction meant the story would have had to be incredible to really hold my interest

Dear Esther
Product received for free

Incredibly magical experience after this game. Everything fits together like a puzzle. You know the feeling, when you want to end the game (to know the ending) but also do not want to end (because the game is really good)? I had this feeling after finishing this game.

Story
The story begins on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere. Deserted island has one charm - nature. You have to go on a journey and with exploring the island, you also uncover parts of the story to the end, which is perfect.

Graphics
I don't know what to say. The waves beating against the rocks, cold wind, in dense fog shrouded lighthouse, amazing night beach, gorgeous moon, caves - such a visual experience offered by Dear Esther. However, I miss there any wild animals on the island (i've seen just one seagull).

Audio
Beautiful soundtrack by Jessica Curry plays a big role with a voice of a narrator, who is very important in the story games. I must also mention great sounds of nature - like the sea, the wind, falling drops of water in the cave.

Gameplay
Well, all you need to do in this game is just walk around and listen to a narrator, what is a great pity. Story like this just needs some investigations of items or searching for clues, eventually some easier puzzles. But I have to commend the developer console, which is enabled in the settings. Gameplay is really short (1-2 hours).

Price
I get this game for free from my friend but I think that 9,99 is enough because you can finish it in two hours.

9/10

Dear Esther
Come back.

Dear Esther
Honestly, I am lacking the motivation to say much about Dear Esther. The fact that it is not a game" does not bother me. The fact that it is literally a "walking simulator" does not bother me.

There are many games (yes

Dear Esther
Absolutely mesmerizing storytelling, with the tone of a masterfully penned novella and music that bears the weight of endless sorrow. An island that feels more like a character than a place. The only choice you have is to keep advancing or stop playing.
Dear Esther manages to be a profound and unique experience, even though it consists solely of walking through a virtual environment and listening to a man slowly lose his sanity for a little over an hour. I've replayed it many times and loved it more each time, while still feeling like I hadn't understood all it had to offer. Whether you consider it a game or not, Dear Esther is certainly a work of art.

Dear Esther
A game that is not afraid to change up the formula by reducing gameplay and adding an amazing atmosphere. Instead of gameplay Dear Esther focuses on conveying a meaningful, interpretative story with a soundtrack to match it. If you are looking for action you have come to the wrong place, if you are looking for a game that has will leave you with something more then your typical game I recommend this.

Dear Esther
I want the reader to completely understand that I do fully recommend Dear Esther.
Even though I don't have any idea what it can be defined as.

To call Dear Esther a walking simulator" is unfair.
However calling it a video game is also unfair.

A game is: "A competitive activity involving skill

Dear Esther
The journey is the reward."

Dear Esther (DE) is a first person experience developed by the company The Chinese Room with emphasis on exploration.

Atmosphere & presentation:

+ A gloomy

Dear Esther
It's a pretty game, but that's about all the nice things I can say about it.

There's no real exploration" when you're almost totally on one path to the end.  So a game that took the creators 2 years takes about 2 hours to complete.  Only changes that could justify another playthru is dialog changes at certain points.  But the story doesn't seem to matter

Dear Esther
A glorious piece of art telling a story through a progressive narrative. Dear Esther is an extremely moving journey of self discovery and acceptance, a truly moving narrative of a mans journey to seek peace. A game that I personally found beautiful. Dear Esther is in the top tier of essential games to play in anyones life.

10\10

Dear Esther
It's not a game, it's a scripted story that you slowly wonder through whilst staring at the scenery. The whole thing works because the levels are so beautifully and artistically rendered. Don't expect your questions about this game to be answered, it's a very abstract and surreal experience but it really is worth trying. It's a virtual world, a place that you can get lost in for an hour or so. Escapism at its best.

Dear Esther
A game that can be accurately re-created in real life! All you need is a beach, a Brittish man to follow you around and say pretentious things, and two broken legs to match the ingame walking speed!

Dear Esther
If you want some peace & quiet then i would recommend this game for you. It's simply perfect and tranquil. It's such an amazing game that really gives you a huge impact at the end.

Dear Esther
This is the first time I'm going to use this phrase:

It's so deep

Dear Esther
You walk around while the narrator reads you an irrelevant story. And pretty scenery?

I could get behind this game if the story being read at least felt relevant to the stuff I was seeing or doing, but otherwise it just all feels lazy and boring. The story itself isn't even very interesting, and uses annoyingly flowery prose. The graphics aren't quite pretty enough for me to get by enjoying sightseeing, and the setting/environment doesn't get my curiousity going.

If you want to see a game that takes a similar idea but does it better, look at Gone Home, where the story being read to you is related and relevant to the things you are seeing and interacting with (and said story is actually *interesting*).

I guess I would give Dear Esther points for originality at the time, but I would rather just go for a walk in my local park while listening to an audiobook; same base experience, only better.

Dear Esther
Creepy walking simulator made in Source Engine

If you love taking screen shots, this game is a must buy. This game is a beautiful piece of art. If you love sceneries, fantastic sound tracks, and poetic stories, buy this game. Make yourself a hot drink and enjoy this magical, soul-cleansing journey.

Dear Esther
It's often difficult to write about something that means so much to you personally. For me, Dear Esther lies in category. Over the 2 and a half years that I've owned and loved this game, I've tried to write a review, but often gave up because I could never find the words to describe my thoughts on it.

It's one of the first and only games to move me emotionally, to make me truly  feel  something. A chilling sense of wonder about the beauty of life, and yet, the frailty of it all as well. Hope and hopelessness, both at once. Even as I wander down the same paths I have several times before, I find myself awed time and time again by the astounding beauty of something so simple as the view of a moonlit beach or a gentle breeze blowing through the grass. I load it up every so often, just to experience that world again. It's almost turned into a kind of private escape for me.

To truly enjoy and appreciate this game, you must let yourself become immersed. The sights, along with the sounds, are stunning and realistic. The music and voice acting are top notch, and easily lands itself high on my list of favorite game soundtracks. There is no gameplay to speak of; it's simply a walking, exploration game, as the background of the characters and island are revealed as you move along. That being said, the world as well as the characters are interesting and mysterious, and drive the desire to keep diving further into the island.

If you enjoy this type of game, do yourself a favor and get it. If you're not sure, get it, and remember to keep your mind open.

Larva Mortus
I enjoyed this game immensely. It was very obviously made by an indie studio and it shows in the minor grammatical errors (which do lend it some charm). There are lots of different types of weapons, each having their strengths & weaknesses. You can only carry a limited amount of ammo which means you'll be using all of the weapons instead of just the most powerful one. Has minor RPG elements. Graphics are good and quite charming. The dungeons are randomized, but the game probably doesn't have much replay ability. I heartily recommend this game!

Larva Mortus
This game gave me flashbacks to a Haunted House I visited once as a child.

There were no witnesses, so keep this between us, Steam. Don't snitch on me. I'll make you pay for it.

As far as top down shooter goes, this game does what it needs to do. It's not a masterpiece, nor does it try to be. Just have fun with it. Shoot some zombies. Shoot down some floating, screaming ghosts. I didn't know it was a lady in a costume on ropes, okay? I didn't know.

Just...

It was an accident.

Larva Mortus
Well this game definitely wont be the best you ever play. Its simple but not easy. Weapons offers enough variety to spend cuple hours filled with good amount of fun. On the other hand its a little bit repetitive and for sure you will encounter some annoying bugs. But after all you wont regret buying it in sale or in bundle. 6/10 (Sorry for my English and have fun)

Larva Mortus
Larva Mortus is a top-down shooter. You go from room to room killing everything with up to eight different weapons. You can level up your stats, play through tons of levels, or you could just play something else.

The biggest problem with LM is that the difficulty is unbalanced. When you select your difficult setting, you're actually deciding on how much you want to be annoyed. This game features a lot of small enemies, some that leave trails of fire everywhere, spit multiple projectiles, and even randomly become invincible. The harder difficulties mean you have to put up with more of their crap, blow through all of your ammo, and possibly get killed in the process. The easiest setting seems like the best choice, since all difficulty really affects is how much the player does and takes damage. However, this setting also makes the game too easy...which I guess is to be expected...hm. Regardless, the alternative is pointless frustration.

Insta-death also starts to become a common theme later in the game. Devils and Champion Knights have attacks that'll kill you regardless of health or difficulty. Circle-strafing is a good method of avoiding this deadly attack, but these jerks tend to attack in groups, and other enemies lending a hand. Still, death really isn't very punishing, unless of course you managed to collect a rare item. There are a number of unique treasures that strengthen the player or offer a big XP bonus. These are lost if you die before completing the stage. Strangely, all of the achievements are tied to these rarities, you don't even get a cheevo for beating the game.

Larva Mortus is just a very dull game. Within 15 minutes you've seen most everything the game has to offer, and yet it just keeps going for hours, without purpose or entertainment value. There are a few moments of satisfaction, like blowing up a half-dozen monsters with a cannon, or shooting a werewolf in the face with a shotgun, but you can get more entertainment from playing a classic FPS like Doom. This game consists of running through rooms, occasionally finding something interesting, sometimes dying, and just never really caring.  Your free-time is more valuable than that.

Larva Mortus
I received the 90% coupon from forging and decided to give it a shot, and to be honest, for .45 it's a pretty decent game. It gets a bit repetitive and I'm expecting a low replayability from it. Here's to hoping for a sequel!

Larva Mortus
Larva Mortus adds a sinister horror environment to the classic top-down arcade experience and with its surprisingly fun gameplay and ominous storytelling, it was very entertaining! Demonic rituals and classic horror creatures like werewolves, vampires and zombies fill up every corner of this game and are complimented by perfectly eerie, evil-sounding music and ambient whispers and noises that invade the players head. All of these aspects make up the spooky atmosphere Larva Mortus boasts, and the story, conveyed in an awesome graphic novel-type style, lives up to the games overall horrific demeanor and is actually very interesting. As you progress through the game, you'll discover new weapons at a pretty fast pace and you will have the opportunity to personalize your character a bit with upgrade points gained by leveling up. There are also A LOT of side missions to tackle other than the main story line which can really help you catch up if you're stuck on one of the main quests. One of the best things about the gameplay though is the fact that the levels are randomly generated. What that means is that if you do happen to die near the end of a level, you do have to play through it again, but the level will be re-designed with different rooms and monster spawns. This keeps the game from getting tedious on some of the more difficult parts. I did encounter a bug that would cause monsters to occasionally not spawn where they should. It doesn't affect the gameplay too much though, it just means that you have to run out of the room and back in to reset the spawns. I also really would have liked to see some multiplayer in Larva Mortus. Hopefully the developers will eventually get around to adding it. I think that would be a blast! Needless to say, the gameplay itself is smooth and enjoyable but there's nothing amazing about it alone. It's the combination of the gameplay and the demonic-horror style that really makes the game shine as a whole. In conclusion, I absolutely recommend Larva Mortus, especially if you're a horror fanatic like me.

Larva Mortus
A top-down horror shooter with very arcade-like action; you'd think it would be twin stick but it's not. The game is mission-based and you select from either story or randomly generated missions on a world map. Missions take place in a small, NES Zelda-style dungeon with an objective. Random missions give you a chance to level up, find artifacts and better weapons before progressing with the story.

Upon leveling, you can put points into stats like max health, regen, run speed and resistances, adding some lite rpg elements. You'll amass an arsenal of weapons you can switch between at any time, from the basic revolver and shotgun to flamethrowers and cannons.

Natively, the game runs at 1024x768, but looks fine and the Steam overlay works. The story is dull and short; most of your hours will come from grinding, due to the difficulty. Repetitive and shallow, I can't really recommend it with so many other games to play.

Larva Mortus
if you like to kill some zombies, bats, skeletons, werewolves & other creautures of the night then hell yeah!!! very low price for a coffe brake game! :)

Larva Mortus
This is a top down retro shooter. Each level is randomly generated, and you must clear every bad guy in the room  before progressing. If you die, you start the level again on a new completely random map. I normally would find it annoying starting all over again, but this mechanic stops you from just running trial and error to eventually get through.

You get a pretty standard set of guns, twin pistols, shotgun etc, all of which can be upgraded.

I ran into no bugs and the games run very well on new operating systems.

The price is right and the game play is good. If you like the horror genre, and love the arcade games from the past, then you will get plenty of enjoyment out of Larva Mortus

Larva Mortus
General
Larva Mortus is a typical example of a isometric budget shooter with semi-cartoonish graphics. The interesting in it is the extremly low price due the constant 90%-off price label, which puts it into the bellow 50 cents category. And for that it offers quite a few good things.

Gameplay
We are controlling a monster hunter looking guy from a birds perspective, which gives us a quite good overview trough combat. Our hero is easy to work with, which is definitely welcomed as combat always happens in cramped rooms. The mechanics is exactly this - you basically go from room to room and clean them out from monsters. Levels are generated randomly so you never know into what you go, but as long the level design regardless of the environment serves the same purprose, it doesn't really requires you some change in tactics or would surprise you in any way. The enemies vary from basic undead, flying bats to spiders and poison spitting fat zombies. Except the boss level templars, they don't really represent any serious force and usually are trying to make up for the lack of their power with rather high numbers. Very importantly - try not leave the room until is not cleared out entirely, cause the room will reset even if only one enemy remains and you need fight the horde once again. Exceptions might be missions where you need to rescue a certain number of civilians, blasting trough the rooms and just focusing on the rescue can save some time and nerves.
Sometimes you need to find a key in order to continue, but it means cleaning a few more rooms into a other direction, until you eventually find what you searched for. Except the enemies the room also contain furniture" like coffins and crates

Experience to gain, skills to develop, 10 Weapons, different enemies who'll drop trophies and equipments (You may find out or just imagine that some weapons are more effective than others against some monsters), random generated quests and
dungeons. Not challenging but not even relaxing, it's a cute game to kill time (And some money) with.
The storyline is nothin' of complex but still deserve appreciation.
Even after ending the main game, you can still play it and complete Jobs".
You can give it a try by downloading the demo

I bought the game using a coupon with -90 percent on it. I'm pleasently surpriced. Though the graphics are bland and the textures are repetetive, it features pretty solid mechanics and a grand variety of monsters (each with different abilities)
and a wide array of weapons and bonuses. Overall its a solid game, but not for everyone. Even though I found its artstyle incredibly lacking, I will reccomend this game and give it a solid 5/10. If they were to introduce a sequel, refine their mistakes and add more animations and textures, Ill be buying it in no time.

Yours truly, CB

Larva Mortus is a top-down shooter with nice 2D graphics and fast-paced combat. While it has a campaign with a story it's nothing you haven't seen elsewhere already. Still, completing the story still makes the world map available where more and more quests pop-up so that you can play for a long time.

You have a decent array of weapons and a few dozen unique enemies and of course some RPG elements just to make sure you like getting things going. Achievements are related to special objects found throughout the levels which randomly pop-up - if you have only a couple of more left you may find a bit tedious to lay your hands on these few.

The game is regularly on sale so this is an easy grab for a couple of hours of pastime.

Larva Mortus
Cheap? Yes. Bad gameplay? No. Larva Mortus I bought in an Indie Pack that constantly goes on sale. I didn't expect this game to be so much good and be under 2 quarters (When on sale) So next time it goes on sale, grab it for the cheap price and have fun in this arcade game.

Larva Mortus
This game lacks any remarkable quality that justifies buying it, even on a sale. It's basically a twin stick shooter (without controller support) where the player scuffles through randomized (but persistently unstimulating) dungeons, fending off flocks of uninspired enemies to tediously grind through a few repetitive mission objectives, all tied together by the most perfunctory of stories.
The game's design and visuals transpire blandness. Enemy variety consists of the trite assortment of bats, spiders, skeletons,  zombies, werewolves and respective supersized variants. Moreover the monsters are afflicted by extremely constrained behaviour types, limited to either rushing the player, casually flying around or throwing the odd missile. This cognitive impairment makes the enemies prone to getting stuck behind objects and frequently kamikaze into the environmental traps, and the only challenge comes from the occasional overwhelming numbers of enemies.
Due merits for the low hardware requirements, which allow to run it in a modest 5 year old computer, but when the game looks over 10 years old that's hardly a redeeming feature.

This is an inexpensive game that nevertheless feels too cheaply made for its price, and I can't find any reason to recommend playing it even if it finds its way into your steam account after a bundle sale.

Imagine being Gothic and badass at the same time.

Larva Mortus
This game is a guilty pleasure for me.
There are lots of mechanic glitches/shortcomings that impede progress that you have to deal with ---- such as being in a dungeon then finding yourself at the map having to start the dungeon again, losing your total score (keep a careful eye on the score, and if it happens, exit the dungeon, and your score will be where it was), difficult to understand instructions, and the lack of any sort of in game help.
But in spite of all this, I love the game.

The challenge is high (even on easy), the fun level is great, and the music is great.

As you travel from one monster lair to another, you build your experience (points), and maybe ultimately defeat a difficult boss.
The story is presented well, and motivates you to keep hunting for the pieces of the missing artifact.

I like that you can play in short sessions, or devote most of an evening if you want ---- so I'll keep at it. But, be warned, even with all its problems it is very addictive. There's a demo, so give it a try.

eta ---- there is a basic manual available on the store page that offers some help.

Larva Mortus
It looks like some cheesy top down game about killing monsters, but don't be fooled. Larva Mortus has a plot, good story telling, monsters that you shoot up, lots of different weapons, acheivements, and a whole lot of fun!

Buy this game!
Definately worth it.

Larva Mortus
Would be a really fun game if it didn't constantly prevent you from completing levels. When you finish whatever the objective is and no exits spawn, it's really annoying.

First time I was OK with it. Thought it was just a bug.

Second time I was annoyed.

Third time I uninstalled the game. What a waste of money.

Larva Mortus
A pretty boring and repetitive game really. There are much better top-down zombie shooters than this. Nation Red is one example. Story's kinda boring too. Too simple a game to recommend.

Larva Mortus
Larva Mortus, a top-down retro shooter, kinda like all of those flash games out there like Dead Frontier. You're playing as some kind of monster hunter, and you travel across the world to certain hotspots where monsters, ghosts, demons, werewolves, or whatever kind of evil have been causing trouble freely to end their mayhem spree.

This game is a weird one. I know for a fact that people frequently disagree when it comes to this game, some say it's bad, some say it's pretty decent. My opinion? Well, I would personally recommend it.

It's buggy, sure, it gets kinda repetitive, sure, but the gun combat is quite satisfying, at least to me.

You start the game on the map screen, and across the world, you'll find missions that you can do, a few story ones, and lots and lots of optional missions, from killing ever single enemy to destroying altars that summon them, to killing special champion" enemies

Larva Mortus
Not one of the best PCgames out, but...  Well, its better than many of the games that were coming out for the Atari 400 back in the early '80's.  In the '90's it would have been shareware or freeware.  But due to inflation over the last twenty years what used to be free now costs money.  Well, maybe that's not exactly why, but it's the best lie I could come up with on short notice.

The game isn't all that bad if you come home from work or school brain dead and need something really nit-witted to unwind with, or if you happen to be an anacephalic gammer, in which case you probably aren't reading this review.  For those of you who are off to uni and have to work your way through, this is the game equivilent of ramen noodles for supper every night.  You put up with it for a few years so thatyou can get a better job and the better standard of living that goes with it.  Or so the schools' admissions propaganda would have you believe.  The fact is that you can get an Ox-Cam education and still end up eating dry cat food, living under a bridge, and playing the solo version of tic-tac-toe in the dust.  That's when ramen and Larva Mortus start looking really good.

The game does have its place,even in the library of a power gamer.  Just make sure you get it when its on sale, and preferably when its under 75p (1 dollar for those of you in the US.

Larva Mortus
10 of 10! This is the best game ever! If you didn't play this game yet you must do it!
If you're tinny kid don't play it! If you will I find you and eat you!
This is my favourite game! (After TF2 of course)

A really really fun horror game to play on your free time- But it will give you nightmares!

Larva Mortus
An old but not superannuated adage is applicably germane.  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Presented in glorious 1024x768, Larva Mortus is a pleasing overhead arena shooter with an RPG component and weapon and item drops to facilitate your pilgrimage through the ho hum narrative.  A more than decent arsenal compliments the massacre of an array of imaginative aberrations under an umbrella of vampiresque themed music.  More than meets the eye and worth a play through if your taste encompasses arena shooters.

Larva Mortus
Cool game, worth buying it! :)

Larva Mortus
Old Retro game. Did the achievments and never gonna play again. Not much replay on it and gets boring after like 5 hours.

Larva Mortus
A fun little gem of a game.  It had a dark, Van Helsing detective-like overtone to the story.  It packed a diverse arsenal of weapons, all important to taking out the variety of vampiric creatures.  Some creatures are easy, others are tough, quick, or powerful, with one-hit kill abilities.  Maps can be both easy and hard at the same time.  Movement skill, multiple strategies, and how you build your character is very important.  Know your weapons.  Know your enemies.  Know how to move your character around the rooms.  I enjoyed this little RPG, top-down-shooter game.  It's well worth its' price tag.

Larva Mortus
- Enemies can spawn outside of the current room you're in unable to be killed
- Sword swinging animation and hitbox together don't match properly and can be very confusing to figure out what should and shouldn't hit
- No real death animation and dynamite can be accidentally wasted post-death with no benefit
- Maps become redudant
- Random popping out colorful zombies and eyes become more of a nuisance than thrilling

- Some RPG-esque upgrade stuff
- Can be tough

It was okay for the first few minutes for me but even after upgrading myself quite a bit I'm still just doing the same map with a slightly different objective over and over again.
Very playable but not something I can enjoy from beginning to end.

Side-note: every achievement is luck-based.

Larva Mortus
You are a hunter of supernatural creatures in the 19th century, sent to performed exorcisms on the demons and hellspawn that litter the land. Five men stumble across an evil artifact and split it between them, now for some reason evil wants the five pieces back. Its up to you to reunite the five pieces before the evil demons do.

Gameplay is of the top-down variety, movement is done with WASD and aiming is done with the mouse. Your weapon selection is pretty generic and grows as you find new weapons. Monsters are also pretty generic, running the gambit of skeletons, spiders, bats and zombies. The graphics are decent and the story is told via static images, done in a comic book style. The game is terribly average and doesn't try anything new, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however that isn't the part that makes the game boring to play. Its how the developer setup advancing the story that bores me to tears.

The game starts off by showing a mission that will start the story, but you cannot start the mission without leveling up first. You level up by selecting other non-story missions that will appear randomly after every level you beat. Each non-story mission can have a different flavor: save X amount of people (which you dont even have to save technically, you just get a higher score if you do save all of them), clear all rooms of monsters, defeat X boss monsters, or remove X ritual circles from the area.

Here is the crux of the problem. The game requires you to be X level before continuing the story, you level up by repeatedly playing randomly generated dungeons with a very limited amount of goals for each dungeon, with a very limited variety of enemies, on levels that use a very limited number of tile sets. After the first few playthroughs of the levels just to start the storyline line I saw every level and enemy type. I played through the story mission only to find out the next story mission was yet again locked, and I had to be a certain level to play it. Which meant more grinding through randomly generated dungeons with little variety to advance the story again.

Who made this piece of crap?

This game had something, I don't know if the name or the cover, that made me want to have it so bad, but please, I encourage you to watch a gameplay before buying this. It looks like a website's amateur made flash game. And well, there were lots of great amateur made flash games out there, but this one definitely isn't one of them.

I'd rather be playing Backgammon, even though nobody understands that .

Larva Mortus
I honestly dont know why the press kinda liked this game: There are several free flashgames that are way better than Larva Mortus" and it could not motivate me to play at all. If you are addicted to games like this for any reason and explored the whole internet then go for it in sale when it is around a buck

Larva Mortus
Larva Mortus is dumb as hell. Larva Mortus has a name that is dumb as hell. Larva Mortus is a twin stick" shooter. Larva Mortus is filled with zombies.

However. HOWEVER. Larva Mortus is better than Destiny."

Larva Mortus
Its well worth the price (especially if you can get a coupon for it) Challenging, numerous levels, multiple weapons, badass music. This game sure surprised me :D

Larva Mortus
I would say this game is a hidden gold nugget, not a gem, but a nugget. Its a fun top down twin stick shooter that often makes me think that SAS Zombie assult and Rouge Legacy (vaguely) had a secret affair and this was their offspring the that they hid well. As weird as that last sentence was this is a really good game. Although there is short commings that are budget and story realted it doesn't take too much away from the overall game. It keeps me coming back and I can quickly load it up for a quick five minute game or spend a chunk of time just having  a ton of fun. I'm not sure if it gets repetative yet but if you can get this game for a good price it is very fun and worth it. I bought the action Indie pack for $1.49 not expecting much but was joyfully suprised to find this hidden, unapperciatied game. Also I thought I might as well bring this up but it can be occationally be scary, not enough to send the weak hearted away but enough to be creepy. The creepy music, the horrific groans and screeches given off by some monsters, the glowing red eyes in the darkness every now and then, there is also disturbing faces that show up on the screen every now and then. Not fast enough to qualify as a jump scare but they get me (or at least gives me an usettling feeling) every time.

Larva Mortus
Old school room-clearing top down shooter--ghost hunter style. Mixes in a short story with a mild assortment of weaponry, power-ups, and character attributes. It's a pretty tough game if you play it on the harder settings. Nice little gem from the action indie pack.

Larva Mortus
Unless you're one of those players who always plays with the default controls, do not get this game.

There is no support for key bindings.  Not reccomended because of lazy development.

Larva Mortus
The game is utterly broken, the controls are stiff, the enemies are boring and the levels are completly repetitive.

Larva Mortus
Good Top-Down Shooter in the vein of Binding of Isaac and Smash TV. RPG mechanics bring leveling to the table, and collectibles give some equipment boosts as you find them. Short game, with artifical length due to the collectible problem. Generic Enemies with generic attacks, spooky images that pop up on you screen to give you the shivahs. Mostly fun. The only problem with this game is the acheivements. Trying to get all the items is very difficult due to the random nature of the drops and the ability to gain multiple versions of the same items. Infuriated me to no end, and changed a 3 hour game into something that I played" for 25 hours. Buy on Sale."

Larva Mortus
Just a pretty good indie adventure: the difficulty and pacing are absolutely spot-on, even if the visuals lack the ostentatious fireworks we're used to these days. Overall the game is fun and is lacking in several areas, but in the end not enough to say this game is not worth buying for action gaming fans.

yes. 7/10

Larva Mortus
This game is so bad. The gameplay is horrid let alone the textures. They have easily outsmarted AI and can be killed usually in 2 shots or they kill you in one. This isn't a hard game. Now the textures are horrid. You can tell some kid got these images from google or something and then fitted them on the screen. They have such bad resolution. The theme is horrid( Demons, Death , Skellingtons , Zombies Giant puking ghosts, Dying red people. The story line is impossible to follow because all it does is give poorley textured images as a result and a horrid voice over (Very much static) along with 10 things to do first and all of them are filled with the stuff I'm explaning. And random pop ups of poor res images of something that should be scary is Funny. It plays sounds when they pop up as well which is on a 1-10 optimized sound is a -3. it sounds like static and its pretty annoying because the option menu gives you Bugger all. GG No Re Larva Mortus. 2/78 rating.

Larva Mortus
This game can entertain you for hours and hours (unfortunately I don't have that time to spend on this game). Leveling system is a great thing to have in this game. The graphics may not be the best, but it's actually the gameplay that counts, right? I know I'm right. (I know that graphics count a bit, but I don't want to make it complex! They're good enough in this case!)

Larva Mortus
a fun that works kind of the same way as binding of isaac.
just fighting monster in dugeon
you should buy it now for 44 cent.

Larva Mortus
To tell the truth, I was surprised by this game.

It doesn't look like much as a top down horror hack'n'slay, but exactly this spartan design is what is captivating about this, kill hordes of monsters with whatever weapon you got. Later in the game you will get better and more powerful weapons. You have to destroy monsters, hordes of them, zombies, animated skeletons, bats, spiders ... demons.

I bought it as it was very cheap during last years winter holiday sales - and it lay in the backlist of my library, just recently I started to play it.

Given, it isn't the best game around, but this type of game never gets old, or can bother you to be a bore. The gameplay is similiar to Binding of Issac and Our Darker Purpose. Some goals are hard to reach, but if you try to prepare you'll get more and more items that help to end your mission.

For the price I bought it the game is a gem, even at the original price of 4,99 it is worth your time. The game is no hype, but it is rock solid.

Larva Mortus
Nice arcade shooter. Creepy enviorment, great graphics, good leveling system, and awesome weapons! There are some minor glitches here and there but its overall a good game and worth spending money on. 9/10

Larva Mortus
Overall, I enjoyed Larva Mortus.  I got the game very cheaply using a 90% off coupon and had low expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It is a solid top down shooter game.  The graphics are decent and it is the kind of game you can just play 10 or 20 minutes before bed to relax.  The music is solid for the setting. It's easy to learn and get into.  There's 9 different weapons, 6 stats you can raise, and the plot isn't bad.  Without grinding, you could probably beat the game in a few hours.  I leveled up more than necessary to get more of the achievements, ended up beating the game at level 26 but you can beat it much earlier than that.  There's 24 achievements that are pretty easy to get and random drops.  I was able to 100% the game in 10.5 hours.  The last few drops can be tedious but otherwise it's pretty fun overall.  Grab this game on sale if you enjoy top down shooters!

Larva Mortus
I really like this Monster hunter RPG.  Tons of action and fun for a top-down shooter.  Only regret is I wish I had the soundtrack!  Both game and music is highly gothic and dramatic.  Worked best for me in lower resolution window, which I like games like this as well, then I can play them while waiting for rare spawns late at night on Everquest.

Larva Mortus
First thing first.

Larva Mortus isn't a high quality game, it does not even try to be one. Larva Mortus is a top down shooter with flaws which offers you couple hours of entertainmentish.

You play as a monster hunter doing various monster hunting tasks. Across your journeys through abandoned warehouses to cemeteries you deal with undead monstrosities, werewolves and such. All are classic horror monsters, even main character is very classical monster hunter manly man. Weapons of slay include revolvers, two handed sword, machine gun etc. etc. Nothing new, you've seen 'em and know em. Oh, you'll gain levels too.

Controls work the way they should, you'll run around using wasd and with the power of mouse you'll aim and deal lead to monstrosities.

First hour of this game is pretty much fun. Also first hour of this game is pretty much all this game has to offer. You run around rooms, killing monsters with guns. Then you run around killing some more. It's really repetitive, but sometimes that is just what we need.

Larva Mortus has serious balancing issues. Instant death dealing monsters, unbalanced weaponry, easily predicted enemies. Difficulty level is a rollercoaster ride in this game. Too easy from pain in the behind hard, no gradual progress in there. Character development is simple as it should be. Problematically you can level up your character to be almost useless.  (Free tip, first 5 points goes to walking speed)  Still the game has few good horrorish moments and pretty good ambience. Music is nice for the first hour and then it you'll start wishing this game had few more songs. I had no techical issues with game and it ran smoothly.

Main campaing is playable only by leveling up via random quests. These put you around the globe for uh, monster killing, saving people or, you know, killing monsters. Also you can get quest for eradicating monster sings, which is basically the same thing as monster killing.

I recommend this game for horror and top down shooter fans who can deal with B-quality stuff.

The Jackbox Party Pack
The mechanics of this party game are great. I love being able to whip this game out and everyone can play as long as they have a smart phone... but it gets old rather quickly, especially if you can't find new people to play with. I'm seeing a lot of up-votes and the down-votes are not being taken seriously. I'm going to have to be that guy here and advise you not to buy this game in its current state - at least for said price of $25. The positive reviews are warranted, but would I buy this game for $25 if I knew what I know now? Absolutely not. This is for two simple reasons.

1. There really are only two games worth playing in this pack: Fibbage and Drawful. You could argue You Don't Know Jack, but if you'd played it once, it's nothing knew. Besides, if you have more than 4 people in your party, you can't play this game, so it is almost always excluded at most parties. Word Spud isn't even a game. End of story. I wouldn't pay a dollar to play it. Lie Swatter is ok, basically a guessing game between two questions and the luckiest person wins. I never played it enough to see how many questions it contains.

2. Fibbage and Drawful are the bread and butter of this pack. These together would be worth the $25, IF they actually had a reasonable amount of stock questions. From what I've heard Fibbage has around 200, and Drawful has ~600. Drawful obviously has the most replay value, but Fibbage seems to always be the favorite at parties. Unfortunately, after a few short hours, you see more repeats than you'd like to admit. Now if you like being the host of a party and don't mind the repeats, this isn't so bad, as long as your guests are different people every time.

However, I really don't understand why new questions have not been implemented. Or why there isn't a way to have the community submit their own, or at least create your own for your own game. I'm sure the framework was never built to do those things, but why they thought 200 questions would surely be enough is beyond me. Even with Drawful, you begin to see repeats fairly quickly.

What's worse is the developers state it is impossible to get repeat questions until you've gone through them all if you host on a single system. This has been contested by several gamers and I too challenge this statement. I've only hosted on one computer and seen repeats within a few hours.

I might as well also note there are a lot of bugs: throwing people out of games, randomly not being able to select answers, etc. They are a nuisance, but don't really seem to deter me or the people I play with as the games themselves are so lighthearted in terms of competitiveness. If that is something that is going to bother you, then I would add that to the list of reasons why not to pick this up at its current price tag.

The developers themselves said they won't add new content unless the demand is there. Well consider this my demand.  I want to support these guys, but I feel a little cheated. I expected more out of this game than 5 hours. They've opened up an interesting platform, but I think they or someone else could do this genre better justice and increase replayability. They state youre gonna need more than one party for this, and that's absolutely true. Because otherwise you'll burn out your audience real quick!

UPDATE (1/5/2016): This review received more attention than I expected, so with the successor out on steam now, I feel compelled to give an update on the state of the game. It appears the developers due indeed believe there is demand for more content. Unfortunately that content is in the form of a sequal and a price tag of another $25. I can't speak for the this game's successor, but I can give an update on this games current condition. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to say... This game resurfaced for me on New Years Eve with a (reasonably) fresh audience. The game was still littered with bugs (i.e. no one being able to enter in answers, freezing, booting players, no input recognition, etc.), and the newcomers seemed to agree that only Fibbage and Drawful (though primarily Fibbage) was worth playing. Overall an enjoyable experience for the newbies, but a little lackluster for those who had played with me before. Simply put, the game still lacks polish and solid content.

It is a shame the developers have decided to neglect this game and move on to other titles. The platform they've created has a lot of potential, which I feel has gone mostly untapped. I think this platform yearns for a DLC format. Similar to the Heads Up mobile party game, you could buy
themed DLC packs for Fibbage or Drawful for just a few bucks. Hell, have a Star Wars themed pack, that would sell like hotcakes right now. Another idea is to sell additional games as DLC to add to your party pack. Giving users the abilityto hand-pick and personalize their party pack for when they host! This would increase the replayability of the game, especially with the same crowd. But at the very least, if they continue down this business strategy of separate releases, it would be helpful
to connect the games, so you can access all the jackbox party games you've bought through one interface... Though, I don't see myself buying another one of these any time soon at a 25 markup.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Hardest no I've ever written.  I love the games in the party pack.  They're a lot of fun.  My family and I have managed to get a few hours of entertainment out of them and I have immensely enjoyed the content.  You Don't Know Jack 2015 and Fibbage both feature Cookie Masterson, which is really the most important thing to know, with Drawful being the surprise hit of the pack.

You Don't Know Jack is a classic trivia game show environment where each question is posed, then each player is able to give their answers. Cookie is condescending and evil towards the folks who get it wrong, something that often provides a great spot of humor.

Fibbage XL is a fill-in-the-blank trivia game where each player gets to enter an answer, right or wrong, and then those answers are shuffled in with the real answer, at which point each player gets a chance to guess.  Points are awarded to players who get the question right, and to the players who are able to trick" the others into guessing.  There are a few problems with Fibbage

The Jackbox Party Pack
This is hands-down the best party game I've ever played. For the price of You Don't Know Jack alone, you get multiple great games, including an amazing Pictionary-style game that manages to not only have its own identity, but exceeds Pictionary in some ways, mostly in terms of quality of the prompts. I can't say Pictionary has ever asked me to draw words" or "#throwbackthurs."

Meanwhile

The Jackbox Party Pack
IT IS POSSIBLE TO PLAY OVER THE INTERNET WITH ONLY ONE COPY OF THE GAME:

1) Have the game owner load the game and stream it, PREFERABLY to a service with low delay like Steam or Hitbox
2) Give out the room code (players open up jackbox.tv in their browser or phone) and stream links
3) Enjoy either Fibbage or Drawful. The other three games are too fast paces.

From the few games I played over the internet, I had a lot of fun! I heard some complaints about questions repeating questions, but it's hard for me to say without playing many, many games.

The Jackbox Party Pack
One of the best party games I've ever played. My friends wake me up in the middle of the night to play this. This game has made me more friends than my personality could ever do.

The Jackbox Party Pack
All the games are wildly different in their enjoyment, but they are all positive in my book!

You Don't Know Jack, the classic of the bunch. A cheesy gameshow with traditional trivia interspersed with a few more unusual rounds, like a quickfire true or false and a round which singles out the current loser to get themselves back into the leaderboard. It's decent, but the time based answering means that it's unsuitable for streaming and the 4 player max player count makes it less appealing when there are many friends or family over. Still, it's solid fun.

Fibbage and Drawful are the gems in the pack. Both support 8 players and both have a greater focus on player driven interaaction. Meaning your terrible drawings, guesses and lies become part of the whole game leading to some of the best fun you will ever have with party games.

Fibbage however lacks content, after playing for half an hour or so, questions started repeating. Drawful, on the other hand, took a very very long time until something even resembled a possible repetition. (Drawful is much harder to get a feeling of repetition since the answers and phrases are all so esoteric and outright nuts (which only adds to the fun).

I explored the gamefiles, and saw an explaination. Fibbage only has 200 or so questions, while Drawful is closer to around 600. A rediculous disparity when both games are really great.

Flyswatter and Word Spud are special situation games. They are neat, but cannot really stand among their peers. Flyswatter is basically a game you play if you have A LOT of people who want to play a simple trivia game in the form of true or false questions.
Word Spud is the subjective game of the bunch, where how you win is directly related to what kind of people you play with it. Words are stringed together, one player at a time; whether you want to be smart, funny or write poop and pee jokes is entirely up to you and judged accordingly; as each input is judged by everyone else.

Being able to pretty much play all games (aside from You Don't know Jack) through streaming and also being able to play through mobile, tablet and web browsers makes this one of the most unexpectily well realised, accessible party games released in the last decade.

It is one of those technologies that wouldn't have worked 5 years ago, but now it is in the most fertile of environments, and it thrives.

Boy, I just hope they add some more Fibbage questions though, or workshop support.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Intensely funny party game pack that has the potential to get the whole family laughing. It is easy for players young and old to get involved in, and even fun to simply observe. Everyone in the room is always laughing when this party pack is pulled out. The best part is  if one person purchases it and broadcasts it to a TV or even through Skype, anybody with a tablet or cell phone can join in the fun and play along.  The only downside is that you do see a lot of repeated questions/prompts in fibbage and drawful. That means that once you've played it enough, you'll know all of the answers. It'll make you look like a big shot when you introduce the game to a new group of friends, but inside you'll just feel ashamed.

Fibbage  Trivia based game where you try to fool other players with your lies.

Drawful  Always brings out the most laughs in my experience. Drawings arent too precise, but that only makes things funnier.

You Dont Know Jack  Another trivia based game, more head-to-head action and ability for another player to interfere with your game.

Word Spud  Word associations and a lot of laughs. Can be nonsensical, so it isnt always a family favorite.  Try making a rule to use quotes or song lyrics to make the end result flow in a hilarious fashion, or try telling a story . I find that this makes the game more exciting and interesting.

Lie Swatter  A true or false style game that is good for playing with larger groups of people. It moves pretty quickly and can get boring, but you can learn a lot from playing it while showing off your trivia knowledge.

The Jackbox Party Pack
So I loaded this up and began screensharing on skype with about 6 people in the call. so we didn't all have to be in the same room together but were all playing due to the controllers being your mobiles. 3 hours later we were all in so much pain from laughing too much.

Drawful is a brilliant way to combine the trickery of fibbage and ultimate rediculousness of peoples interpretation of an image. It's easily one of the funnest party games I've played in a long time. Fibbage and Drawful obviously being the two gems in this pack, but the You Don't Know Jack additions to this easily make it worth the money.

I guess the only issue is you kind of need friends to play most of these games with, or a family that doesn't hate you and your gaming habbit. The game definitely works / is funnier with more people.

Either way, I'd definitely reccommend it. Asuming you have a sense of humor and some people to play this with, you'll be fine.

The Jackbox Party Pack
This game is amazing.  It's the easiest-to-setup multiplayer game I've played.  Anyone can use a desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, or any other device that can pull up a website as their gamepad.

Furthermore, no body has to spend time tediously setting up accounts or any of that garbage.  Everyone just goes to the website on screen and you're all playing in seconds.  The multiplayer functionality is amazing.

Furthermore, since everyone has their own screen, that only they can see, games like fibbage are possible.

This is definitely the best family videogame package out there.  I played with my family over thanksgiving.  Setting up a 6 person game of fibbage was easy as pie.  It was incredibly fun.  I really hope this company releases more games like this.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Great game for friends and family. My family including those who are not big gamers/tech people loved this game. They even loved just watching! I recieved this game during one of Jackbox's live streams, and it has been exceptional. I do think that a dedicated app would make this simpler to play for repeat players. It could reduce input lag, and most likely possible to play without changing your automatic lock/display settings. The games inside rate from best to worst as follows:
1. Drawful (phones and such are not the most precise without stylus's but it just makes the game funnier)
2. Fibbage (a fun of deception and trivia)
3. You Don't Know Jack (a game show with high production values that guarantees at least one funny scripted segment per game)
4. Lie Swatter (occasionally funny, but it requires to much involvement/uninterupted screen time without allowing players to interact with eachother)
5. Word Spud (makes no sense, not funny, no payoff)

The Jackbox Party Pack
im the hit of the party now, mom.

The Jackbox Party Pack
The perfect party game. I've played this with drunk friends and I've played this with my grandparents, either way it manages to be entertaining just because of how much it relies on the other players actions. It's fun for all ages, but doesn't necessarily have to be family friendly if you're playing with the right people.

The Jackbox Party Pack
I've been a You Don't Know Jack" fan for many years

The Jackbox Party Pack
Call 911, i can't feel my sides.

What a perfect game for a floor of college students. A plus that they don't even have to look up from their phones either :)

The Jackbox Party Pack
It's a bit of an investment for something you can only really play with friends, but soon you'll find yourself trying to coax all your friends to play stupid word games with you ALL THE TIME.

The Jackbox Party Pack
A whole (insert unit) of fun. Get your friends together for some fun. I guess I'll be like everybody else and break the 5 games down one at a time.

Word Spud:
The general consensus is that this game is bad. There's a reason for that, it's because it is bad. You'll play it once and then it'll turn into a Bad Rats-style joke. The game I played devolved into my friends and I typing gay Alexis is gay" over and over. 2/10 standard rating 10/10 from IGN.

Lie Swatter:
A mediocre game that you won't play much. True or false gets boring after a few rounds

The Jackbox Party Pack
Great games but where do I get friends to play it with

The Jackbox Party Pack
FRIENDS REQUIRED FOR MAXIMUM ENJOYMENTFriends (& mobile devices) sold separately

The Jackbox Party Pack is a great collection of games you can play with your friends & family without having to fight over the keyboard & mouse.  Just fire it up on your computer & have everybody join the game room from their tablet, phone or computer (by visiting the Jackbox.tv website).  You Don't Know Jack 2015 for the hardcore trivia players & Lie Swatter for more causal play, but you have Wordspud, Drawful & Fibbage for more fun!

As the Game's trailer video notes, you could pay ~$20 - $30 on You Don't Know Jack ALONE (& people, like myself, have done so)!  This is a great deal for anybody who loves to play with friends instead of themselves (although a few games do permit it... not that we're judging).  Spice things up at your next get-together with the Jackbox Party Pack today!

NOTE: While this game pack is optimally designed for Local (LAN) play, it does work online as well...  HOWEVER, your milage will vary (due to video transmission lag) with those NOT nearby.  Some games (like YDKJ 2015) are not recommended for online play due to quick timing requirements as a result.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Good, for the first 2-3 times. Quickly loses its glamour and entertainment when you start to realize half the questions and prompts are repeated ones.

Please, for the love of god, Let us make our own questions and drawing prompts. I can't use this more than 2-3 times with the same people without everyone getting bored.

The Jackbox Party Pack
A set of hits and misses.

Drawful and Fibbage are both solid gold, keeping my friends laughing and question each other's sanity through the whole game.

YDKJ is still as silly as always and has 50 episodes, but I know they won't last forever with the same crowd.

Lie Swatter just got groans and moans of being ping forked for first answers.

WordSpud didn't win anybody over and nobody won with a positive score either. Maybe it was just them but it didn't pull any laughs.

Three are gold, two need some else to be fun.

The Jackbox Party Pack
I just purchased this game after playing it at a friend's house for a solid 3 hours last night.  I can't speak for all of the games, since the ones we played were Fibbage XL and Drawful.  After playing only those two games, and knowing how good You Don't Know Jack is by itself, I knew this would be worth it for myself.

Drawful plays like a more ridiculous version of Pictionary where you also want to try and trick others into believing that the answer you provide is the correct one.  Have you ever tried drawing the phrase Baseball glove is setting my hand on fire"?  Those are the kinds of things you get to try and draw

The Jackbox Party Pack
Single-handedly saved Thanksgiving, even when grandpa had to draw nude descending staircase""

The Jackbox Party Pack
The Jack games are back and better than ever.
Don't you just hate it when you bought the new Smash Bros or Mario Party but only have 2 controllers? Or when the game only supports up to 4 players but you got 6 friends over?
Then worry no more! You can turn your smartphone into a controller by just typing in the room code in jackbox.tv. No login required, quick and simple.  Be warned though, only one game Fly Swatter" supports up to 100 players. All other games are from 4-8 players.
The game itself is filled with the old Jack games humor and styalized a bit to make it more visually entertaining.
If you only own a PC and have people over frequently then this is a MUST HAVE game on your libary.
Even better if your setup connects to a TV with Big Picture

The Jackbox Party Pack
This game is absolutely amazing. 5 great titles in one. Be warned though, you must use your cell phone or tablet as controllers for all modes except for single player YDKJ. You have to go to Jackbox.tv from your cell phone, punch in the Room Code for your particular session, create your name, and you are off!

The Jackbox.tv remote playing works great. I experience absolutely NO lag while playing on wifi or 4G.

Overall this is the best value for your dollar on Steam right now! Buy it!

The Jackbox Party Pack
The most fun you can have with a group of people without covering your balls with salt

The Jackbox Party Pack
Worth it for just fibbage, but make sure you have friends to play it with you.

The Jackbox Party Pack
I've been to several parties during the holiday break and I brought my laptop to play this. We all had a complete blast with these games! My favorite is Fibbage but they're all very unique and enjoyable. It's also fun to play with Steam Broadcasting, but it's much better to play it in the same room as everyone else. Highly recommended!

The Jackbox Party Pack
Here's the deal with this game:
If you're here for You Don't Know Jack, get this. You know what want out of this, and this game will provide enough of it for you.
If you're here for Drawful... consider getting this, but keep in mind you need to get some mileage out of the other games to make it really worth the price.
If you're here for a well-rounded collection of other party games, get the second party pack instead. Fibbage and Drawful are really the only games carrying this, and even then Fibbage has been replaced in the sequel. The second party pack is a SIGNIFICANTLY better collection across the board.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Awesome| Always wanted something easy like this. Can download easily on another computer If I don't have a laptop with me or something. Just login, tell everyone to load up the site on their phone and hangout for a bit while it downloads. Great fun.

Haven't tried this on a slow internet, can't imagine you would want to do this on something less than 3 megs down, 1 meg up.

This review if from playing this game with friends, Had so much fun had to get this pack for my own gatherings.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Very fun to play.
What you should know:
Drawful and Fibbage are what you're paying for, they are by far the best and most fun games to play, Lie swatter is also fun if you have way too many for the other games but usually it's more fun to play one of the first two and take turns.
You Don't Know JACK is ok, it gets tedious with all the line reading that Cookie Masterson" reads out between questions. I recommend playing at least once but sticking to the first two.
Word Spud is terrible

The Jackbox Party Pack
The game is hilarious and fun but inherently flawed, and DEFINITELY not worth the asking price of $25. I bought it on sale for $12 and it is maybe not worth that, within the first three hours we were getting repeat questions in fibbage". Even one ruins the game

The Jackbox Party Pack
A great party game and all you need is your phones:

- You Don't Know Jack is great as always, same game, new humor and questions. The only problem is in multiplayer you CANNOT use Xbox controllers & you must use a smartphone/tablet/etc. Because of this there may be a delay on answers which definitely impacts the game. Hopefully they will update YDKJ so that users can choose their preferred control.
- Fibbage is fantastic, helps that its also hosted by Cookie
- Drawful may be the best game in here
- Word Spud is okay, not awful, not as good as the others
- Lie Swatter is the only one none of us liked, kinda that neat trivia that no one cares about

So ultimately you are getting three amazing party games, one mediocre one, and an awful one. It's worth it.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Great for parties or having friends over.  A really fun local multiplayer game.

The Jackbox Party Pack
A couple of the games are good, a couple are terrible and you will never play them again. We are having a huge issue with you don't know jack" freezing when someone tries to screw. Game freezes just about every time making it unplayable. Booo"

The Jackbox Party Pack
The perfect party game for large groups of people. No need for controllers here; use your phone, tablet, laptop, or whatever internet connected device you have on hand and simply login to the Jackbox website to start playing! Using a two-screen interface allows for the games to let you secretly create answers and drawings without anyone looking, making for a collection that isn't even possible with the Wii U's gamepad.

The Jackbox Party Pack
So much fun with friends! Perfect for parties!

The Jackbox Party Pack
Great package for anyone that likes jackbox games. All games use a browser for input which works well but it does require you and your friends to have smartphones or tablets.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Played a ton over Thanksgiving.  Used my Surface (Pro 2) and Miracast to broadcast to the big TV.  Had no issues with the game itself running on the HD4000 in the Surface.  Miracast has a delay, but wasn't enough to be problematic in a game like this.

Fibbage was definitely the biggest hit. Most people complained that Drawful was a little too slow (and nobody's drawings made any sense). Lie Swatter was mostly a filler while everyone was waiting for others to congregate for Fibbage. YDKJ was enjoyable for me, but most others weren't into it (and the 4 player limit hurt this one too). Didn't even bother with Word Spud, nobody thought the concept was worth the time.

Fibbage alone though is great (and I'd buy this even if it was just Fibbage and YDKJ).

There were a couple occasional issues with people's browsers getting disconnected from the game.  Sometimes they would be able to put the same username and same room code in and immediately get reconnected, and sometimes they would try that and it would tell them to wait until the next game.  And worse, when someone gets disconnected, that means you have to wait for the timer to run out completely before moving on to the next question.  I think it should be a little more lenient in allowing a reconnect when it's the same username as someone who is already in the game.

Still, the game is highly recommended for large gatherings (and keep in mind that it's designed for local multiplayer only).

The Jackbox Party Pack
Fibbage is a terrific party game. This one comes with extra questions for extended play. It's great for parties and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to entertain. There's other games too, the drawing one is fun. I haven't gotten any real time with them though. A+!

The Jackbox Party Pack
My house mates and I absoltely love this party pack. We often have a house game night and we nearly always end up playing these games. We end up laughing, having a great time and best of all you don't take any of them too seriously. I hook my laptop up to the TV and we all play on out tablets. There is a room code, so if you stream from your laptop, you can give out the code and anyone can join in!

I saw some reviews saying that playing with the same people gets boring, but I have to disagree. We sometimes have extra people but usually it's the same 4 people playing and we haven't got bored yet.

The Jackbox Party Pack
YDKJ2015: Hilarious party game. Honestly the best game in the pack 5/5
Drawful: Fun. Gets boring unless you spread it out by a week or switch people. 4/5
Wordspud: I personally didn't like it. But it should depend on who you play with. 3/5
LieSwatter: I hate it. Some people might like it though. 2/5
FibbageXL: Fun at first, didn't last. Although the fun faded around the 20th round. 4/5
OVERALL: 4/5 This game is fun. I recommend it as long as you're into this stuff. And I also recommend it just for YDKJ2015.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Never before have video games let me be the life of the party.
Whether you're playing online through a Skype call, or, heaven forbid, stuck in the same room with your friends, this game is loads of fun. Jackbox has a nice collection of party games that will make you judge and regret befriending the people you did. All you have to do is launch the game, find a way to have your friends see it (whether in person or through a Twitch/Steam broadcast, but I've found that a Skype screen share has the lowest delay without the added benefit of audio), have them join on their devices (or just on the website on their computer), and let the stupid fun that is Jackbox begin.

With Drawful and Fibbage making up the bulk of the hilarity of this party pack of games, as well as You Don't Know Jack as long as you're playing in person. Other games like Lie Swatter and Word Spud fall short (in my opinion) but are still enjoyable in a sense.

This game keeps bringing me back. After playing each round of games with different people each time, I still haven't grown tired of this game (after nearly 20 hours at this point) and I'm still going strong, inviting new people to experience the stupid, funny gameplay that is Jackbox.

11/10 would buy (friends sold seperately)

The Jackbox Party Pack
A friend bought me this for the holidays and it was a hit.  Fibbage and Drawful were awesome - quick to set up at a party and easy for people to figure out how to play.   Word Spud and Lie Swatter were duds for us, and the traditional You Don't Know Jack did get some play but Fibbage/Drawfuls are the stars of this bundle.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Drawful alone makes the price of this 5-game pack worth it.

Great games with a bunch of friends!

The Jackbox Party Pack
Everyone who has a social life and has friends/guests round should have this by default. It's awesome

The Jackbox Party Pack
This is a fabulous party game -- I brought it to family Thanksgiving and multiple generations had an absolute blast, particularly with Fibbage. Multiplayer can run through a computer in addition to phones and tablets, since it's all just in a browser window, so no installations are necessary and new players can jump in in seconds. An excellent, fun and highly-polished experience!

The Jackbox Party Pack
The most annoying thing about party games is having enough controllers. The Jackbox Party pack solves that problem by turning your phone/tablet into a controller!

You Don't Know Jack is still a funny! Perfect for smart people and still witty enough to keep pop-culture nerds entertained! But what makes this worth the price is Fibbage XL (which is a trivia game plus adding your own lies in it) as well as Drawful (which is Draw Something or Pictionary).

As mentioned in other reviews- you can totally play with people across the globe with the use of screen-sharing. Giant Bomb streamed the game and played with 100 people during their Unprofessional Fridays. This is why I bought the game!

Joining is incredibly simple! In order to join any game, you visit their website and enter the room code, letting you jump in. But if that website shuts down, then what? That's the only fear I have for this game.

The Jackbox Party Pack
Okay i sorry it only no temporary work

The Jackbox Party Pack
Great games... great fun...

but you NEED an internet connection. And it NEEDS to be stable... and everyone NEEDS a smartphone. For a game that used to be so accessible, they made it annoyingly inaccessible.

I would like to play this game at the moment but the wireless where we are keeps dropping. I bought this game and I can't play it. If they change this... feature"... I would highly recommend it. As it is... nope. Just look for the original YDKJ games."

The Jackbox Party Pack
Looks like a great game however unable to get a refund due to false advertisement.
