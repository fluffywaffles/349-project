It doesn't compare to classics of the genre such as Full Throttle or The Longest Journey, but I still found it entertaining.\n\nPros: Beautiful artwork. Plenty of challenging and rewarding puzzles. One play-through took me about 11 hours. Fairly stable product (only locked up once).\n\nCons: The story is so-so, and I found a couple of the jokes offensive. A few early puzzles were far too easy, and a couple puzzles later in the game made no sense at all; I beat them only by trying things totally at random. Also, the main character is kind of a jerk and not particularly likeable.\n\nOverall, though, a fine game at full price ($10) and a steal if it's on sale for less.","November 30, 2013","true","12.0"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

If you feel like "at last! my suffering is over", or "and that's it?!", or "wtf was that?!", it means the game probably did not deserve to be finished at all. If you forgot where you are or who you are and it was you who was that guy who kissed the girl in the end - that is the sign of a great game. But when it comes to _good_ games, one can always be recognised when you feel sad that it's over. And that's exactly how I felt when I finished Lost Horizon.\n\nThe game is safe from anything edgy or grandious to be an outstanding title, and that's probably why I have completely missed it when it came out. But with its beautiful art, solid feel, enjoyable puzzles, super easy mechanics and pretty good voice acting, it's far from being a waste of time. I'm sad it's over not because I'm disappointed, but because I enjoyed the process of playing it. It was not an epic rollercoaster ride, but a journey equally pleasant all way through. With this game you get the kick in playing it, not in getting it finished.\n\nInfluenced heavily by adventure films and games of the past, but not making a direct adaptation of the Lost Horizon novel, developers played safe to avoid a disappointment. It feels as if they are saying: "We are not making revolutions here, we are just following the great tradition". Lost Horizon will not shock you, will not turn your world upside down, will not break the grounds, but if you like the classic feel of adventure titles, you will enjoy it. It will not insult your intellect, or upset your ear with speech impedimented voice actors. It will please your eye with the striking beauty of its backgrounds and sometimes will give you a chuckle or two with a clever joke. The idea of hand-drawn backgrounds and 3D-animated characters seems to be the perfect approach. The only thing that stops this game from being great is that developers did not have a megalomaniac urge to make the best game in the world. They just did a good game, and that's what it is. And I think, it is better to make a good game and succeed at that, than try making a great game and fail to deliver.\n\nSo, if you like old Indiana Jones games, or the Broken Sword series, you will most likely enjoy this one. Just don't expect much - and you'll be pleasantly surprised on every corner. I was!","November 3, 2014","true","18.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Yes, it's a recycled Indiana Jones knock off--but frankly, I wish there were a few more games like it.  Lost Horizon is not complicated or complex gameplay, and the puzzles are kinda crazy at times, but it's just so much fun.   The voice acting for Fenton Paddock was perfect--he had a lot of personality and was consistent through the game.  One of my favorite lines toward the end of the game when you try to get him  to fight someone is, "When have you ever seen me fight anyone??"\n\nIt's a classic point and click adventure, so if you're used to that kind of gameplay there will be few surprises.  It's all about how engaged you are by the story and the voice acting.  My advice would be to try the demo, and if you find it fun, this will be worth the buy.","April 3, 2014","true","24.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

It's on par with old Indiana Jones quests by Lucas Arts and Broken Sword series, well-known classics.\n\nThe setting includes 1930s, Nazis, ancient knowledge, romance and so on. The entire game feels like a good Indiana Jones movie, even the main menu is a movie theater front.\n\nGame mechanics are well done, for example, to save you time and frustration you can tell if an item can be combined with anoother or applied to something else just by hovering it on a target, no need to try and click everything and listen to same and same responses from main character that this 'doesn't work'. In addition, you can highlight all active areas in a location, so no more 'pixel hunting' like in classic quests. Puzzles are mostly logical, no idiotic ones like infamous 'make a fake mustache by applying a scotch reel to cat' in Gabriel Knight 3.\n\nStory and gameplay possibilities it offers are also great, for example there is unique experience in one part of the game (spoiler!): you can switch berween two characters, one in present and another 10000 years ago, and actions one makes in the past make changes in present, you can leave items in the past so they could be found in present in aged form, etc. Terrific!\n\nA nice bonus unlocks when you complete the game (prototype version) and there is one nice in-game achievement :)\n\nAll in all, its a great adventure to be played without haste, enjoy it. It would be even better to play together with your kids or wife/husband.","April 1, 2015","true","10.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Pure and simple.\n\nThis is my first review, so i'll keep it short(ish).\nI struggle to find anything wrong with this game, but if I were to point at one thing it would be that some of the cinema-scenes were a bit long. Sometimes it felt as if you were watching the game rather than playing it.\nThat said I really enjoyed this. The puzzles were good (and I have played alot of point and click) and they did not feel to repetitive. They were also challenging but not over hard. Every time I got stuck I just had to rethink the situation, and usually the solution would present itself. I'm not proud to say this but I have a tendensy to use walkthroughs whenever I get stuck for too long. I only did that once here and that turned out to be a puzzle that used color. I'm colorblind so that does'nt really count....\n\nI thought it was a good story to, and unlike some of the other reviewers I rather liked Fenton as the hero. He's a bit cheeky and a bit of an anti hero, but after playing many of these games I find that usually is the case. I did not find it laugh out loud funny, but I found his coments rather amusing.\nI also liked all the different places one got to travel to. It made it feel like you really were on a quest, unraveling an ancient secret, unlike many games that just puts you right near the goal at the start.\nThe graphics were also very well done. They made the atmosphere complete and added to the story in a great way.\n\nAll in all this game really sucked me in from the get-go. It had a movie quality about it that really made me feel like I was there. It never felt boring and I was rather sad when it ended. (Thats a good thing.) I spent 17 hours on this game and thats not half-bad considering it cost me only about £8.\nI never replay games, but I'm really considering doing it with Lost Horizon.\nI give it a solid  9/10.\nIf you like adventure and ancient mysteries this is a no brainer.","June 2, 2014","true","30.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The game isn't ground breaking and there is nothing in it that anyone who grew up playing Sierra and Lucasarts adventures games won't have seen before, but the charm of the game makes it something worth playing.\n\nMany adventure games fall flat on their puzzles, but Lost Horizon manages to make them both logical and easy to understand. More seasoned adventure game players might find them a little bit too easy, but they always make sense and leaving the player wondering how they hell they were ever supposed to think of that.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who has ever wanted to be a globe trotting 1930s adventurer.\n\nAlso you get to shoot down a Nazi plane using a bag of flour.","June 22, 2014","true","2.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Almost by the book with everything. So don't expect anything new.\n\nBut I'd still say it's most definitly worth your time and money.\nThe story is amazing and the puzzles aren't too hard or too easy.

In any case, it wasn't too difficult to reach the end.\nMaybe some of the dialogues have been too long, but necessary to explain the story in detail, so I was happy to follow them.\n\nI will have a look at the ending extras with interest, maybe adding something to this feedback.\n\nOne negative point is coming from grapichs issues. Environment is always really colorful and enjoyable, BUT characters sometimes look too "cartoony" and their motion is unreal. This should have required more attention by the developers, even if luckily this is not affecting the gameplay at all, but just video scenes.\n\nAnyhow, highly recommended to everyone who is passionate about this kind of games! :)","June 5, 2015","true","15.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This removes some tediousness. Can also skip dialog (its both text and speech)\nTo make the combining of items smoother you dont need to try every combination and listen to the hero say "thats not quite right"  a million times. Pick up item, and if the "work mouse button" is green you can combine. This works in the scene with points of interest too. (This can make the puzzles seem easier, but I dont care)\n\nTL:DR\nOverall its a fun game, and all though I could wish for a bit more complicated puzzles I found the experience a positive one.","March 15, 2015","true","9.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/40350/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","The story of this game is... well... It starts out somewhat interesting and then just kinda go downhill from there. Like the Secret Files games, you get to travel to a lot of different locations around the world. In this game, it feels a bit farfetched at times and it seems the enemy always has you on their radar, no matter where you are.\n\nThere were way too many scenarios where characters are involved in lethal accidents which they survived unscratched. If you see someone in a lethal accident, your normal reaction is probably if the person survived at all. These characters don't react that way. So they don't even act mildly concerned even when they watch such things happen. I actually anticipated a character would die in an accident, but it's like nothing really happened. The people watching the accident doesn't even rejoice in seeing them again, as if just expecting them to survive such a thing.\n\nAs for the main characters, I honestly didn't like that Fenton was the main character and not Kim. He is quite a jerk and especially towards Kim. Kim was in my oppinion the one who should have had the focus. She has a good sense of morale, she is caring, brave and really kicks some ♥♥♥. Without her, Fenton wouldn't really manage. It really sucks that the characters are so obviously forced together and she is deliberately put in situation to make her the damsel in distress, to allow him to save her and make him a hero. It's a common thing you see in a lot of games and movies, the main character is so unlikeable, the only way you can force the love interest to like him is by ending up in some accident he saves her from.\n\nThe game is unfortunately a bit short. It ends quite abruptly and in a bit of silly way. It kinda feels like when they've finally put all the pieces together, even the game gets bored of itself. You get a really over-the-top ending and then the rest of the story feels very forced.\n\nI do like that the game tried some new things involving the puzzle solving, where one character is driving a car and you have to respond to things with the other, while the car is in motion. It's done in a way where you don't get your character constantly leaving the scene/room in a short time limit, you get apply amount of time to figure out how to solve this incident. (Thankfully the streets of China are endless and there's no traffic when you need to escape from bad guys.)\nThere's also some creative ways to solve puzzles, a bit over-the-top, bit it was still funny to watch. The way Fenton deals with an enemy pilot is so silly it's awesome.\nThey also have the”control two characters at once” which is one of my favorite concepts. At one point, you get a rather tricky problem solving where you control two characters in two different times, affecting the other person depending on what time they are in. I thought this was brilliant. It's unfortunately a bit short though.\n\nI am a bit so-so as if I wish to recommend this game or not. It's not a fantastic game, but it's not dreadful either. The controls are responsive, the graphics are nice and the voice work is acceptable. (compared to A new Beginning - Final Cut) There's some good humor and the game will last about 6 hours. I did like it much more than "Secret Files 3". I'd recommend buying it when it is on sale.","December 22, 2013","true","8.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This game has it all, nazi's, evil scientists, Tibetan monks, henchmen with weapons, and beautiful women. The main protagonist is Fenton Paddock, a down and out pilot who finds himself trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is quick witted and often hilarious. One of the main drawbacks of my recent adventure game purchases has been the quality of the voice acting has been very low. This was not the case with Lost Horizon. The accents of the different characters are convincing and the delivery is very smooth. Nothing can kill my immersion faster than a character speaking who sounds like an actor reading a line. As far as the puzzles go, I did not come across any that required a guide, as they all seemed very rational.

After Grim Fandango in 1998 their golden age came to a close and all was quiet for adventure fans for a good long while. Germans eventually decided to save the world and have held the cursor torch for years. Lost Horizon is an almost forgotten title from 2010 that strengthens the Teutonic monopoly on adventuring.\n\nThe games lead, Fanton Peddock, is the best possible company: smart yet goofy and serious about things that matter. He is voiced to perfection by Adam Howden (Anders from Dragon Age) and rest of the cast shines as well. Peddocks commitment to nonviolence prevents him from harming man or beast: even a troublesome alley cat is distracted in a way that any feline certainly appreciates.\n\nThe same attitude is spread throughout the entire game, which is filled by harmless old world charm. A hulking Nazi trooper tortures a poor helpless prisoner with German march music, Peddock gets to rig the 1936 Olympic decathlon and outwit Hong Kong triads. There is refreshing innocence in all this, which is not pandering in any way.\n\nThe puzzles are logical, meaning adventure-game logics and not the real-world kind. Writing is supremely clear and economical with only the periodical exposition marring the classicist perfection. All the scenes fit together and the plot twists are both surprising and logical. The game has a feature that highlights all the things you can interact with but the puzzles themselves are very clever indeed and beating them felt like victory every single time. Peddocks story is split into seven chapters and took me nine hours to finish which I felt to be completely satisfying.\n\nIt is rare to finish a game feeling rejuvenated like this. I would not want to change a single thing in this little gem and recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in adventures.","October 4, 2013","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On seeing the title screen it becomes obvious how much care has gone into every aspect of this game.\n\nThe plot and cinematic style of Lost Horizon  are a homage to adventure films of an 'Indiana Jones' type. It's all about a reluctant hero saving the world from Nazis who are after powerful mystical secrets and has everything you'd expect: biplane fights, secret mystical locations all over the world, ridiculous car chases and cutscenes of implausible fights on Nazi trucks.  Oh, of course, the spunky irritating sidekick/love interest - I suppose nothing's perfect.\n\nIf you have played the LucasArts classic  'Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis,' you'd probably find this is really similar in writing, plot depth and gameplay style and there are other things that will make you think the writers were trying to bring back the old Lucas Arts classics. For those who haven't...\n\nThe best bits\n-The plot is daft but fun and interesting with lots of mystery, pseudoscience and silly cutscene action.\n- This is a properly long game. Really good value for money.  12-15 hours gameplay I'd say.\n-The puzzles are mostly combining inventory items together or with objects in the environment. These are (with a few glaring exceptions) very logical.\n- The visuals are gorgeous.\n-The voice acting is excellent.\n-The music was good though not hugely memorable.\n-The interface was easy to use with one exception (see below)\n\nBad points\n-Some of the puzzles cannot be solved until you've examined an object to death because your player character is a fool that needs everything spleed out to him.\n-There seems to be a minor bug where when you try to solve a puzzle correctly  with an object, the game doesn't recognise which object you're trying to use. It always works by the third attempt.\n- The two cursor interface can make some puzzles a bit easy.\n\nHighly recommended, particularly if you like inventory based point and clicks with engaging plots.\n","January 21, 2015","true","39.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Puzzles never frustratingly difficult, usually somewhat logical; solving usually is satisfying. Some areas (especially the last chapter, think Day of the Tentacle) have really nice ones too. No dead ends, no click to loose. The major story arc is interesting and, at least in parts, even gripping. Voice acting is decent.\n\nThe bad: Some puzzles are just too easy or instead require pixel hunting for the item you didn't even know you need. Story often feels like an Indiana Jones rip-off and bounces between serious and goofy. Main character is a self-absorbed show-off, but instead of poking fun at him, the game actually wants you to like him for this. The female side kick would have been a much better choice, but gets hardly any play time at all. Dialogue and remarks are full of one-liners that are so unfunny, it's sad.\n\nThe ugly:  The 3D rendered characters don''t live up to the backgrounds, are often terribly animated (one scene had flailing arms worthy of a gmod skit, and the main antagonists face looks like that of a puppets, except her lidless eyes  never  move) and a lot of animations just are a generic arm movement. The last 30 seconds of the ending. Do yourself a favor, and just pull the plug when you hear Fenton say "Naaah, overrated".\n\nConclusion: I enjoyed most of it, but really hated some of it.","October 10, 2014","false","16.7"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","0"

I think too much of the story is driven through watching cutscenes instead of actually playing the game.","December 21, 2013","false","3.4"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","4","19","0","0"

Of all the games this is the best one and it's also the first one I played. I graphics are much better than any of the other Secret Files games and the backgrounds are in a different style which look so much nicer.\n\nI've played this game many times and always enjoy it. The puzzle solving is on true form here, especially the puzzle at the very end of the game.\n\nHighly recommended is you're a fan of point-and-click adventures and/or the Secret Files series!","November 2, 2014","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A little harder than The Book of Unwritten Tales but with a greater story,much greater.\n\nReally fascinating game with modern graphics and design.

I should let you know that I got this dirt cheap.\n\n+ Atmosphere: yes it does rip off a lot but at least the source material it stole from is great.\n+ Voice acting\n\n- Gameplay: easy puzzles to just guesswork. Aolt of repetive back and forth visting places I have been just for one item.\n\nFor the most part this is family friendly game.","October 25, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/a_melchers/recommended/40350/","a_melchers","a.melchers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/a_melchers/","34 products in account","Although the game takes some getting used to in terms of animation, lack of lip synchronization (at least for the English version), slow progress of actions (though primarily in the first few chapters), and mediocre voice acting, the plot is very involving and develops with some nice twists leading up to the end of the storyline. Heavily inspired by Indiana Jones - seen in the main character, fonts, music, locations, the opposing Nazi force (the bad guys of the game), and numerous verbal references - the game also exhibits elements of the mysticism, legends, and historical/"archaeological" backgrounds as typically flesh out the Broken Sword series. For me, those were some of the best moments, providing the game with a sense of discovery, mystery, and conspiracy that I so enjoyed with the aforementioned series. The ending shows many similarities with Lucas Arts' Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis, which in a way was a bit disappointing, yet didn't reduce the overall experience of the game, as it takes a novel approach to the concept.\n\nGameplay itself is excellent, with very few truly complicated puzzles yet, simultaneously, is challenging enough to remain fun. What really helps towards this is that your inventory is cleared for each new chapter, reducing the amount of combinations of objects you need to try when stuck. As there are also no ridiculous combinations between objects as in some other adventure games, all that is typically needed to progress is some time to logically think something out, or search for a possibly overlooked item. Hence, advances in the challenge of the game don't come from an inventory that grows full or becomes increasingly filled with more and more illogical items, but rather is based on an increase in the challenges of tasks you need to perform in order to progress. This culminates at the ending of the game where you need to control two different player characters separated through time, yet working together to achieve a single goal, and actions taken by the player in the oldest time have varying effects on the game environment of the player in the youngest time. Mini-games can also be played at two levels of difficulty, making the game easy to progress in, yet at your own level of difficulty.\n\nThe game includes bonus features comprising a puzzle, an option to replay the final battle, an award for honesty, and a short prototype of the game.\n\nOverall, though I completed the game quite rapidly (in about 13 hours), I very much enjoyed playing it. If you like the Lucas Arts adventure game series - including the likes of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango and Full Throttle - love the Broken Sword series, and are a fan of Indiana Jones, this is definitely a game to add to your collection!","July 28, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
