The controls are horrendous with no option to change them. (I hit every button looking for the gun). The NPC's don't care about winning, they only care about blowing you up or running you off the mountain. You could still be at the start line and the NPC will turn around, drive back and annoy you lol. Driving straight consists of 360's, it's quite funny. The graphics in the screenshots don't look bad, but when you play, it's like a cardboard box. The annoying ambulance sound at the start of the game will explode your head. It was a free game, but I still wouldn't recommend it.","August 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","27","31","8","0"

It's nothing too special, but it did a fantastic job keeping me entertained during my first play session.\n\nNothing much can be said about what makes Glacier 3 special from other, similar games. Like I said, it is pretty typical. The game features eight vehicles to choose from and a variety of tracks that can be driven on. There are several power-ups spread throughout each of the tracks, each granting you some kind of advantage. I stuck with missiles the entire time. They act like the red shells in Mario Kart, homing in on enemies (most of the time).\n\nThe game's physics, however, were very amusing. The vehicles each made very sharp turns, very easily, at high speeds. I also bounced off a rock at one point, like a basketball, landing back on the track. That was quite fun. The AI beat me everytime, aside from one track, where I went all-out with missiles, so the game can be a bit challenging at times, but nothing that a good missile or two can't solve.\n\nThere's not much else to say about Glacier 3. If I were to attempt to justify its price, I would pin that on how ridiculous the racing is (physics, weapons, etc.). It is fun, but has some technical issues that I wish had been addressed, such as the resolution, which is locked at some low resolution.","January 30, 2014","false","0.2"," 47 of 71 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","47","71","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/recommended/267940/","roadrunner1","Road Runner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/","551 products in account","Originally developed for the Wii and ported to PC in the worst possible way. There are no options to configure other than sliders for music and SFX volume, that's it. No control and graphics options. The game doesn't explain anything. You have to figure the controls out for yourself by pressing keys on your keyboard and see if something happens. In case you are wondering... arrow keys for movement, A and D for strafe/ram, ctrl for nitro, space to fire rockets, shift to lay mines and R to reset the car (I had to reset my car a lot) Those are the most important ones.\nThe cars handle horribly by the way. Even for a pure arcade game like this. It's way too twitchy. There's a story mode (without a story) single race and challenges but those last two are locked. You have to unlock them in "Story" mode. It's a shame. It could have been a decent game with at least a proper control scheme, controller and resolution support. With the best will in the world I find it hard to say anything positive about this game. OK, I think the soundtrack is half decent. Luckily I got it for free, thanks to an Indiegala promotion a while back. There are much better alternatives, like Post Apocalyptic Mayhem or Fireburst, wich only cost a buck more but have much more to offer. Best to stay away from this meltdown of a game.","February 21","false","1.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/267940/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionGlacier 3: The Meltdown is a third person, combat racing game whose developers may have had big dreams for the game, but resulted in an overwhelmingly poor production. Released in 2010 on Steam, when games such as F1 2010, Blur, and heck even Need for Speed: World were their competitors (among others), this is not even a possible contestant among those other titles. Let us dive straight into it shall we?\n\nVisualsI normally leave this section for last, but I think it's a pretty significant part of this review so here it is.\nImages were pretty low resolution, car models were quite bad, even if this wasn't supposed to be a racing simulator like other titles. Animations were just barely acceptable and each level had at least a few different roads to drive on which didn't make a race completely linear. But honestly, after seeing the loading screen 3 times, I couldn't deal with it any more. It was visually cancer.\n\nInterface\nIt is worth noting that this game has an options menu, but only has TWO settings in the ENTIRE menu. FX Volume and Music Volume (or something like that). This is absolutely unnaceptable considering resolution, controls, graphic quality settings, you name it! I plugged in my xbox one controller, and it would not detect it, nor did it give me the option to even change the controls. Even if a workaround exists, the fact that it lacks the basic courtesy to give me the choice in-game, feels pretty lazy to be honest.\n\nGameplayOh boy...you see, I'm sort of a racing game fan, a huge one. I love games that give me a certain thrill, a sense of speed, a decent bit of competition at the very least. I especially love simulators, ones that give me a huge sense of immersion so I can enjoy the game even more. This game...has none of that. It has the absolute worst handling of vehicles I've ever had the misfortune of playing, I mean can you imagine a car sliding across the ground going at 1 or 2 MPH? These cars will break every law of physics you can imagine. The view is fixed to 3rd person. No decent controller support means you'll probably be using a keyboard (an absolute no no for racing fans) and no multiplayer? What exactly would motivate someone to playing this then?\n\nLet's see......well......hmmmm.....\n\nAudioCar sounds are quite bad, painfully so, and the rock music in the background half the time just grates on my nerves.\n\nSummary and ConclusionSo let's see,\nBroken driving physics\nHorrible looking cars and environments\nEssentially zero in-game settings\nBoring/Repetitive Sounds and Music\nWhatever you do, don't spend full price, half price or even quarter price on this. You're much better off playing some flash racing game or F2P racing game than this. There's just nothing worth coming back to.\n\n1/10 - Please, save your money.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/267940/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","For a $2.50 Car Game... I wouldn't waste your money, there are soo many better games or bundles you could buy for that. I wouldn't spend more than 50cents on this rubbish. Don't get me wrong they have the base model for a really good car game... but they make no use of it and it seems rushed.\n\nFirstly, there are hardly any positives and the ones I did find... don't really give the game justice.\n\nPositives:\n♦ Kind of challenging if you can get past all the glitchy driving\n♦ The levels are designed well\n♦ You have to play campaign to unlock challenges and single player maps (Gives you an incentive to play Campaign and do well)\n\nNow onto the long list of negatives which ruin this car game and would deter anyone from wanting to buy or even play it.\n\nNegatives:\n♦ No Settings (Graphics, Controls, Help etc) Only two audio bars\n♦ Can't unlock new vehicles or even customize the three you are given\n♦ No Storyline just racing for the hell of it\n♦ No Achievements or Steam Trading Cards\n♦ Controls suck (Arrow keys to drive, comma, space-bar and left alt to shoot) Who doesn't use or have an option for WASD these days!\n♦ Way too many weapon crates, meaning if you see another car, you can almost always shoot it allowing you to go infront\n♦ If you crash, get hit or lose control of your vehicle for any reason, it's almost impossible to recover from it\n♦ Far too many weapons\n♦ Physics is dodgy as it seems ragdoll like when you turn or get hit\n♦ No highscores for you to better level times in camapaign (Only a track score for coming 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th in the race)\n♦ No Multiplayer whatsoever (Who makes a racing game and doesn't offer any sort of multiplayer is beyond me)\n♦ If the format of the race start is cars infront and cars behind as you go to take off, you'll most likely get hit from behind by the AI cars even before you've had a chance to accelerate enough to take off\n♦ The machine gun seemed like it wasn't doing anything\n\nOverall, in my opinion, the game has the basis of a really fun Mario Kart, Crash Tag Team Racing etc styled game except the creators don't utilize what they have and have rushed it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and if you do end up getting it, I can assume you'll have no fun playing it.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 0.3/5!\n\nPS: If you must buy this game, get it in a bundle or when it's on special. But, if you ask me... I would stear clear from it and possibly any game made by Team 6 Studios as almost all their games are negatively rated on Steam.","January 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The game is ok-ish but lacks a lot. What specifically? Options. There are absolutely no options in the game. No resolution control, key binding etc.. only volume control. The camera is extremely zoomed in, to the point where it feels like you have no idea where you're actually going. I have to constantly use the speed boost in order to see the game I want to see it. Given the game's name it leads to believe that it's the 3rd game in a series however they still couldn't implement some basic options to tweak the game so it fits the player's needs or actually learn from other games of the genre how to make a good game? Combat isn't fun, through and through. Driving isn't fun, at all. Your car flies around randomly when it hits things, levels aren't fun and are extremely short. And best of all, don't you just love violent car battle games like this with no human model inside the car? Yea, the veichle is driven by an invisible ghost... The game just screams incomplete. I honestly have more fun and find more visually appealing to play Carmageddon 1, a game from 1997.

I am not even kidding.. this game is a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port that doesnt even have controler support(without using something like joy to key, or controller companion, which will feel honestly pretty jerky..,) and it leaves you too figure out the controlls from someone else.. or on your own.. however, once I found out the controls I binded them up useing analog emulatiion. then it started to feel like a decent little arcade game.. for the life of me I can not get the motion controls to work... but all on all this game felt fine with the joystick.. for anyone wanting to just hop on and play, ill be uploading my controll scheme once i have played the eloted amount of time to allow for upload.\n\nEdit: this is also probably a great game(once you et it set up lol) for kids too, not to challenging and very arcady.\n\nControls (posted from another review, I cant find who it was):\n\narrow keys= move (obviously)\n\n"A" key = slide left\n\n"S" key = slide right\n\nctrl key = boost or nitroux however you wanna call it\n\nspace key = rockets\n\n"B" key = look behind you\n\n"R" key = respawn\n\n"comma/less than sign" key = is mines or bombs\n\n"ALT" = machine guns or rockets (depending on the car)\n\n\nHopefully this has helped you for anyone who owns the game or plans to buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikame/recommended/267940/","rikame","rikame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikame/","818 products in account","What you can expect to come in Glacier 3 is best forewarned when you boot the game. When you are greeted by a shrill, obnoxious siren that caps off the title music, you have to wonder if the rest of the game and all that it entails will be so unpleasant. The answer, sadly, is an unequivocal "yes".\n\nGlacier 3 is a series of races undertaken around - you guessed it - glaciers. It has a "story mode", although there is no story. It is merely a sequence of races. Each race contains you and three other AI controlled drivers, as there is no multiplayer. On the map you may find powerups, two that charge your turbo and three that provide ammo for your weapons, with which you may take other competitors out of the race.\n\nIn the one hour I spent in this game, I completed all six campaigns or four tracks each. Really, it is my opinion that there were only three campaigns and twelve maps, as each map and campaign has a counterpart reversal, with nothing more than the direction of the track changed and the start and endpoints swapped.\n\nThe map design isn't entirely bad. There is some variety, and the environments are as varied as you could ask for in a game called "glacier". There are ice sheets, cliffs, mountains and caves. However, while some heart was clearly put into their design, the game also feels very rushed and incomplete. This may be most obvious in your first race, when you drive into a massive jump and realize that you can change direction in mid-air, the worst sin committable in a "realistic" driving game. Perhaps you can forgive it as you race along the minute-long track, but you suddenly find yourself crashing into a wall of rocks placed at the middle of an overhang. You think you've crashed - and you technically have - but it's okay, as that rock wall is also the end-point of the race. There is no finish line, there is no obvious landmark, just a pile of rocks in which you and your three competitors burn until the game decides that it is time to show the results of the race.\n\nThe physics are wonky all around, even beyond the ability to change direction mid-air. You will find yourself moving in a direction other than that in which your wheels are pointing. You will hit objects or other cars, only to be vaulted back 30 feet, do a ragdoll flip or clip through a barrier. You will fire your weapons on flat ground, only for them to literally blow up in your face. While you hopelessly bounce along the track, you may despair, as you can only unlock new content by winning a campaign. However, the AI is just as helpless as you are, and with a few turbo powerups you will find yourself abusing the game mechanics, deliberately turboing off a cliff about a sharp turn, resetting, and turboing again in your newfound direction.\n\nBad music, barebones graphics, lack of customizability and content, lack of multiplayer support and so on are all forgivable. However, everything about this game is mediocre, and I do really mean everything, including aspects that you wouldn't even think about in most other racing games because Glacier 3 does wrong what most games do not. That this game was published on the Wii is astonishing, although that perhaps explains what is possibly the least comprehensive menu - consisting of two audio sliders - ever accomplished in a video game. To summarize, the game plays poorly, does not look nearly as good as the store page's screenshots suggest and is outdone even by racing games produced in the 90s.","June 19, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game is bad, pretty bad. The story mode has no story. You have to figure out the controls by yourself, there is no way to configure the keys and the mouse does absolutely nothing at all. It can't even be used to adjust the view while you're driving. The physics is non existent and it makes you press the enter key on screens that have no real purpose except to slow you down. If this game was made in 2000 I could understand it's UI but for a 2010 game...\n\nOn the positive side, the music isn't too bad and the graphics look alright, like a gamecube era game with sharp graphics. The gameplay is like super mario kart where you race along picking up mystery boxes and try to shoot/bomb/ram the other competitors out of the way. The game also runs at 144fps and has zero lag and loading times.\n\nIt's a pity - this game could have been a great game if they had used common sense 101 in the UI and put in a physics engine. But as a game that came out in 2010, don't expect any updates coming out anytime soon. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this game.","September 29, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cons: game constantly puts you in pretty much offroad maps the only way you know if your going the right way is if you respawn.2 is slippery controls ok i now its "Meltdown" With nice to mention UNLESS ITS THE CONTROLS. Basicly even oon places with 0% ice you do a 360 which most maps have turning so because of turning the camera pans the opposite direction of your moving car this is one of the main issues i got.Now last but not least Pros. Pros:Game has some pretty good music not the best but good for racing.2 respawns are fast making it easy if you screw up (Which you most likely will).3 is the idea.The idea is creative but poorly executed some fun bonus challenges and i do not consider this bad racing.I know you all are like "BUT YOU SAID HORRIBLE 360 TURNS PANNING THE CAMERA THE WRONG WAY AND WHY IS THERE MORE PROS THEN CONS???????.).Once again i do not consider this a bad thing i just think it could had been executed way better they were not being rushed and the game would be way better if it had controller support.why? you may be asking yourself why? it would make it feel  alot more control able. ok without making this too long most wont read this but gwt it if you want a cheap not great but cheap racing game that will keep you occupied for a month or 2.

But it has very few features. You cannot change the resolution or graphical settings from in game. Luckily I did find an option to modify these settings from notepad C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown and then opening the Autoexec.cfg with notepad.\n\nAnd for graphics options I had to go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown\Misc VideoPreset0.cfg and modify the graphics quality to 3 for all of the settings.\n\nThe same thing I had to do for the control keyboard settings by modifying the DefaultInput0.cfg.\nIt is ridiculous that all these basic settings aren't included in the in game settings. There's no gamepad support either which I believe is essential for this particular game.\n\nNot to mention there are no Steam Achievements or a Multiplayer component. I understand if there were more Single Player Chapters. The animations, sound quality and graphics are poor! This game was released in 2010 but it is worse than SEGA's best selling Out Run game of 1986! You may as well as download the DOS version of Out Run and play that with DOSBox emulator, you'll have a more enjoyable experience than this.\n\nYou'll also find better flash racing games on Miniclip.com that offer you a similar or even better gameplay and graphical experience compared to this game!\n\nHowever, if you are still interested in playing an arcade racing game on PC have a look at Split/Second or Ridge Racer Unbounded they're available here on Steam.

Actually, that would be my favourite type of racing game, but everything that could go wrong, does.\nThe controls and physics, the most important things in a racing game, are just horrible. It's not about them being unrealistic, they didn't have to, nor did I wanted them to be realistic; I just wanted to actually being able to control my car.\nThe car just flies across the screen, spinning uncontrollably, hitting every obstacle in the way and literally flying in all directions. There's no weight in it, and also, the game isn't really punishing you for hitting walls or even mines set by the other racers, so all you have to, and can do, is just float forward at full speed, and hope for the best.\nThe tracks, other very important thing in racing game, are boring and unimaginative, to the point that you can't really distinguish one part of the level from another (besides one part of the caves... too bad, the rest of it is just one long corridor with nothing in it.)\nNot to mention they even reusing the tracks in the campaign (to prolong it I assume,) which you have to complete, in order to unlock anything else. Normally I wouldn't mind unlocking stuff by playing the game, but when the game is that tedious, it's just bothersome.\nEven if it would be for free, I wouldn't recommend playing this game.\nTo think that after creating this, they somehow acquired right to make FlatOut sequel...

Had to go pressing keys on keyboard till I could work out what key did what. ie weapons, restart checkpoint etc.\nCan't change user name.

Oh cmon, dont be such a wuss, real gamers dont need tutorials. This should also be renamed to "Ultimate gaming reflex tester" - drive car on drugs with some guns on it while pressing the hell out of your keyboard. Something we never had, 10/10 for gameplay and controls.\n+No mouse needed, cuz why you need to use both hands for racing like in new games when you can race with one and do whatevah you like with the other? Saves your time! 10/10 time saver\n+Very cheap, only 9 euros for all this amazing stuff you recieve...who needs šome awesome gamepacks on sale right now for 9 euros who really are worth around 40 euros if you can have this amazing racing game that will test your ultimate gaming skills and creativity? Who knows maybe you will become a writer of next Fast and Furious franchise after traning on this?\n+ Came out in 2010 ohhhh this is great, because it means there wont be any updates and noone will spoil your own storyline and you can make bunch of new ones, thats awesome! Add some princess Romea and prince Juliet there.\n\nCons:\n\n- Thank the cat god I got it for free...\n- I feel sorry for whoever actually bought this...accept my sorrows, please.\n- Still better than Twilight.\n\n\n","September 29, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Even for an arcade style racer. Perhaps I would recommend it if it was free!\n\nHowever, for a game that costs £7 it is a complete rip-off!!!\n\nI completed all 6 Chapters of the Story Mode and Challenges in less than 2 hours!\nThere is nothing really unique about this game compared to any other racing game.\n\nIt is relatively enjoyably, yes. But it has very few features. You cannot change the resolution or graphical settings from in game. Luckily I did find an option to modify these settings from notepad C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown and then opening the Autoexec.cfg with notepad.\n\nAnd for graphics options I had to go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Glacier 3 The Meltdown\Misc VideoPreset0.cfg and modify the graphics quality to 3 for all of the settings.\n\nThe same thing I had to do for the control keyboard settings by modifying the DefaultInput0.cfg.\nIt is ridiculous that all these basic settings aren't included in the in game settings. There's no gamepad support either which I believe is essential for this particular game.\n\nNot to mention there are no Steam Achievements or a Multiplayer component. I understand if there were more Single Player Chapters. The animations, sound quality and graphics are poor! This game was released in 2010 but it is worse than SEGA's best selling Out Run game of 1986! You may as well as download the DOS version of Out Run and play that with DOSBox emulator, you'll have a more enjoyable experience than this.\n\nYou'll also find better flash racing games on Miniclip.com that offer you a similar or even better gameplay and graphical experience compared to this game!\n\nHowever, if you are still interested in playing an arcade racing game on PC have a look at Split/Second or Ridge Racer Unbounded they're available here on Steam. These offer a far more enjoyable gameplay experience!","November 21, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
