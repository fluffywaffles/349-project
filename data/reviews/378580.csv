After a few adventures I stalked through a piece of heavy vegetation and found myself two metres away from a hunters big bad rifle, I swiftly pounced mauled the hunter senseless then threw him off a cliff. I scampered down after him to have nice tasty breakfast of Cletus but unfortunately it seems human meat is off the menu...I was then killed by his hunting dogs in brutal revenge attack! 10/10 would maul human hunter and be ripped apart by hunting dogs again!!\nThis game jumped out at me when it went on sale today due to my love of sandbox games and big cats. Very unusual and brave concept for a game and so far it really pulls it off. The developer obviously done their research on mountain lions as its very true to a BBC documentary I watched about them recently, mating, hunting, marking territory etc. The terrain is also authethetic and the map is quite large. Can't wait to see what the developer has in store for the future, playing as a male mountain lion might be interesting for example. Keep up the good work.","August 27, 2015","true","22.5"," 59 of 82 people (72%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","72","59","82","21","3"

It's nothing like those crappy Ipad games you find that claim to be an animal simulation but is clearly not. untamed life a cougar is quite a realistic Cougar simulation. The graphics are good, and have improved alot since when it first came out. You play the role of a female cougar, which you get to pick out of quite a few colors. You start out in search of a mate. This is the only time that the males are Friendly to the female. Infact on my first try I sat and watched several males fight eachother over the right to mate with the female cougar. Once the strongest male won, I allowed him to do the 'Deed'. After falling pregnant, i started searching for a den to give birth in, catching prey and avoiding hunters along the way. When i found a place i liked, I give birth to 3 cubs. They were small and slow, but adorable. I left them at the den to search for food and to mark my territory to keep rival females at bay. We stayed there, until a male had learnt of our whereabouts. And so i had to lead my cubs to safety, otherwise that male would kill them. My cubs are now on the second stage of life. They are still spotted but are able to keep up with mum. The female you begin with isn't that strong or able to run for a longer period of time. That's where the stats come in. You can gain stats and use those stats to unlock abilities. Like Longer health, Stamina and even Quicker acceleration. I've also recently found out that the cubs have genetics from both of the parent's. So the parent's colors affect the cubs colors. Each animal reacts differently to your approach. A deer will flee, a Male deer, will also flee, but if attacked he will kick. A bison,Moose and Horse will warn you by either shaking their heads or scraping their hoof along the ground. If you get too close they attack, instead of other games where npc's automatically attack the second your in range. Predators though will attack you when in range. Specially wolves. Bears and foxes, i've caught them stalking my cubs. Eagles attack both mum and cubs. I've caught them swooping down on my cubs, i just manage to get there in time and the eagle hobbles along on the ground trying to take off. Not all of the human NPC's are alone.. That's right, some of them have backup.\n\nPro's\nRealistic Animal behaviour. (For both Cougar's and npc's.)\nRealistic Cougar and animal Sounds.\nQuite Realistic Animations.\nDifferent Life stages for cubs. I've only witnessed 2 so far. Barely walking stage (Maybe a week or 2. Has Spots), And Cub stage(Has Spots, and can keep up with mum.) But from the website, i've seen a slightly older cub with no spots.\nUpgradable Cougar. (Stats)\nPlenty of prey to hunt and dangers to face to keep you on your toes.\nGame not easy, (Even on easy.) Prey is sometimes hard to Stalk and catch in normal mode. That's what Target mode is for (T)\nCubs play with eachother.\nDay and Night cycle.\nThe Game World is beautifully detailed.\n\nCon's\nFoggy. It's too foggy so you can't always see where your going.\nYou can get swarmed by a lot of predators. I was attacking humans as i ended up bumping into them, since the fog made it hard to see a few feet in front of you. When i had Told my cubs to stay, and focused on the humans, a bear came out of nowhere, and attacked 1 of my cubs, then the dogs decided it would be fun to join in to. I had 1 cub left. So i had no choice to maul everyone who provoked my wrath and then reloaded my save.\nNo weather. (Though that's probably coming in later.)\nSeasons. There's no seasons. It's always spring. I wonder what it'll be like in winter. How hard it would be to survive if prey numbers dropped.\nHaving to shift constantly between target mode to normal mode after each fight. As when attacking in normal mode it's hard to keep sight of your prey. If in Target mode it automatically locks on for you which makes it easier. But because i'm the type of person that likes there character to be fully zoomed in, i have to keep constantly scrolling after exiting out of target mode. Though it's not a big deal as i'm getting used to it.\nKilled prey despawns too quickly. At the newborn stage, i left the cubs at the den since they are far too slow to keep up with mum at that age. Well there was no food near home so i travelled for awhile. When i caught a deer, i dragged it back home only to get a few feet away from my den and have it poof. My poor cubs were starving by this time. Maybe have it where prey that have been killed have a longer time to despawn.\n\nThings i'd hope the developer will consider is random litter numbers. Each time you always have 3 cubs. I think it would add alittle suspense to the whole "oh i wonder how many cubs i'll have this time" kind of thing.\n\nOther than those the game is fun to play. This game is to show you all the things a cougar must face to raise offspring and survive. And it pulls it off.","August 28, 2015","true","12.4"," 36 of 52 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","36","52","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidiannihon/recommended/378580/","obsidiannihon","LadyJess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidiannihon/","11 products in account","I think this game is very interesting and engaging, I've had a lot of fun playing it. That being said, there is room for improvment. The menu screen looks like it was made by someone in Paint, the music to go with it is ridiculous as well as all the text. There are typos - such as the word Territory, and the menu style overall makes the game look very unprofessional.  Character upgrades are located in the strangest sub-menu, the soundtrack is jarring, there's too much noise too often. One of my largest issues is if a female cougar enters your area and begins to attack you cannot kill it, if you're trying to move cubs to a safer location it will attack again and again. It would  be less annoying  if marking your tree prevented this, but it doesn't. It would still be annoying because the trees that line your territory are nowhere near your territoy. I think it would improve the game if the map was a little more logical, and for such an expansive map there are very few dens. I don't know the mechanics of the game, but I think it would feel much more open world if there were more den opportunities, even if they weren't marked on the map. There are hint interfaces that pop up while you're playing at inconvenient times, like when you're tracking prey, they're also blurry and full of huge yellow text which really takes you out of it.\n\n\nI think the animations are fine, and I like the fighting style. Shelter 2 is another game I play that is similar but it was taken in a more artistic direction, and has a little more development. I still enjoy this game, I just wish that it wasn't quite so sloppy. A few simple changes would make the game a lot more enjoyable.","August 30, 2015","true","10.0"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","1"

I really liked both Shelters, and Wolf Quest. Until today I didn't even know Untamed : LOAC existed. Because it was cheaper than usual I decided to buy it.\n\nSo, what are my views?\n\nThe graphics are quite nice, my laptop is not very good, so I couldn't completely enjoy it for I had to turn it to fastest. It kinda reminds me of lif graphics, lif has better water though xD\n\nThe gameplay....I'd say it's Shelter and WQ brought together, which is a good thing. You have to find a mate, find a den, give birth to your cubs, name them, protect them from predators and other mountain lions, feed them. Hunting is pretty fun, though on easy mode it seems a little too easy.\n\nProtecting our cubs isn't neccessarily the easiest thing in the world, for sometimes they like to wander off, away from the den. I also don't like that when you get attacked by a wolf, your character drops the cub, which makes it impossible to run away. In that moment you're forced to stay and fight the wolf/wolf pack. To me, dropping the cub/pup against our will is one of the most annoying things in such games. I also don't like that if you have a den on that big mountain, and you fall, it takes forever to come back to the top. I went hunting once, I killed a prey that I can't run with, most of my cubs starved.\n\nIf you like sand-box and survival games, and you're a big cat lover, then i highly recommend it.\n\nWhat else can I say? Give you some tips perhaps?\n\n1. Look out for wolves, hunters, and the crazy male that attacks you to eliminate your offspring,\n2. You don't need to look out for the cubs, as long as you're absolutely sure that no predator is near enough to smell them. The oly problem then is that you might have to carry them one by one a long way.\n3. If the vultures, gathering and eating your prey, are a big problem to you, then I recommend putting your kills underneath your den "roof". They can't reach it there.\n4. Attack while carrying a big prey and rushing to get it to your cubs. It will make it faster.","April 8","true","5.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The animal behavios is very accurate (ran into a Bison once and it did NOT end well also the eagles and vultures add a nice touch to it) and it has a nice atmosphere.\nIt also keeps a very realistic picture of how damn hard it really is to be an animal, be it predator or prey.\n\nThere are so far only two things that irritate me:\n1. That you cannot kill the other female cougars. You can beat them up and they'll run away but always come back. Now, I am aware that the game tells you to mark as much territory as possible but I should still be able to wipe them out at least for a while. They return too frequently after a while and make it close to impossible to do anything besides defend your cubs.\n\n2. The controls are still a little klunky. Combat and chasing after prey is still up to button mashing - at least for me. I understand there is realism to it that it's hard to catch prey but you tire (in my opinion) too soon and also get hungry too quickly. Now I am not a cougar expert I but I am just talking in referenance to game enjoyment.\n\nAll in all, it does take some patience but I have big hopes for this game and hope it will reach its full potential because it's on a really good way.","August 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","1"

I always wanted to put myself in a big cat story, but i am no game dev. Seems my time is arrived though, Untamed - LOAC is the most interesting game lately, a true, raw, life-smelling story, with many difficulties, even harder with cubs, you know nothing until you try that out, National Geographic Wild or Animal Planet cannot make you feel the hardcoreness. When a hunter shooting at you while you are carry your own cub in your mouth, exhausted by a previous wolf pack fight. It evoked the elemental hate towards mankind, luckily, the protagonist cougar girl is an extremely tough one, one bullet cannot stop her on mid difficulty level, thanks to the RPG elements, it can get even faster and stronger, and able to pile up multiple hunters and hounds. Sadly we can't serve them to the cubs! I also don't agree with the censored mating, which was blurred out, and it made me smile, however later on i've found an option to turn it off. I think this act of nature won't raise the age restrictions. Defending the territory is also a big task, This small game is not AAA category, graphics and animations are low budget, but i love the music tracks, also random game events making funny, unexpected situations. I missing some cougar skills, i just don't know why can't we climb on trees, for example. I must admit, i would be a bad cougar parent, i died many times during the story, i think nothing even this game cannot represent how hard the cougar life is, because emotions can be displayed on screen, but cannot be transfered. I put my eyes on this team, despite of the bugs, i say good job, perhaps i can be a lion one day practicing social life of big cats, or a jaguar, cheetah perhaps.

Why even have resolution options higher than 1080p when all the textures are just absolutely horrible. The sounds of this game would have just been so much better if it was just ambient noise or something instead someone thought it would be a good idea to have the same cougar sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥ your ears the whole game. The gameplay isn't very fun at all, the combat in this game is a complete and utter failure because why even strafe at all when the enemies just regenerate their health if you aren't constantly standing still and just attacking. The animation department is all just a mess, if you love seeing baby cougars just breaking every bone in their body while you're carrying them then maybe youll enjoy this games animations. There are little to none redeeming factors about this game. Cougars are my favorite animal but this game really didn't make a unique experience about cougars, if you literally just replaced the models with any other animal it would not change a thing. You could probably make make Untamed:Life of a wolf,buffalo,horse,johncena, by just changing nothing but the model. You're better off just donating $15 to Big Cat rescue or some ♥♥♥♥.

Mistakes in typing & expression may occur]\nI've always liked Cats and this is a good Game to hunt my fav. prey and perhaps some filthy humans. The little Kittens are adorable, as long as they live. I've encoutered a few really evil Problems in Gameplay while trying to raise the Cubs.\n\nPro:\n-Nice Landscape. I like roaming a good Enviroment.\n-Nice Setting. I just like being a Cat.\n-Graphics are ok for me, even if they may not be the top#1\n-Controls do react fine on my Pc. I've not had any issues with the Controls\n\nCon:\n-'Killer Male' comes back WAY, WAY to fast after his defeat, leaving you not really time left to hunt for food\n-Cubs in early Stage are extremely slow. Moving them through the Landscape is impossible in order to do the main quest.\n-Cubs in early Stage have a (in my opinion) to fast depleting food-bar. Time to react on Dangers AND to hunt for Food is very short.\n\n\n\nImportant things to know:\n\n-Horses are sometimes Killerhorses as it seems. I've  met 2-3 in a Herd with 2 chasing me when i just wanted to walk away. - WTF???\n\n-The Minimap in the bottom right corner is turned in an angle of 90° to the right/east/starboard. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY ANNOYING BUG! NAVIGTION IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN TRYING TO RELY ON THE MINIMAP. PLEASE FIX THAT SOON!!!!\n\n-I've not yet played with the higher difficulties and skipped the entire breeding-story so far, since i felt the urge to train my Cat first.

I finally decided to do so and I got surprised in a really good way. At the beginning it's hard to get into the game and the first hour you'll probably keep dying :D But after some time you will learn and you will adapt to your enviroment, you just need the ambition to do so. And then I got really hooked on it. It was just fun to roam around and explore and feel stronger every day you did not die. Then I got some baby kittens and failed horrible the first time. Not even one day after birth all three were dead and again I felt the ambition to try again. Next time it went way better :) I guess the thing with this game is just this ambition that you need to get into it and have fun with it, then it will work out. So I can recommend this game to everyone who loves animal simulations, cuz thus one is actually better than you would expect when you keep trying. Surviving is hard in rl and it is in this game if you don't adapt. I hope you can have as much fun with this game as I have.\n\nEdit: With the last update this game became much easier, so now it's not that hard at the beginning as I said in my first review. You can now level your cougar up way faster than before.","February 9","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
