Then check this out. It is superb (and cheap!)\nThere are a couple nitpicky things, like a lack of a savegame feature and the way your guy stays facing the same way as long as you're shooting, but nothing terrible. There are reasons for both being there and you get used to them.\nPersonally I loved it. Over in about 2 hours and a blast the entire way!","December 6, 2013","true","2.5"," 203 of 220 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","203","220","0","6"

It looks, sounds and feels right from the start. It even lets you play in those jerky 16 frames per second  that the old games used to have (optionally allowing you to smooth that out to 32 frames though). Seems like the developers sticked to the proper 16 colors palette most of the time too (to be 100% sure of that I had to look up color-tables, but... no, I am too lazy). It's really beautiful for the most part, in that 1991 kind of way of course. Kudos to whoever made the sprites and tiles, that person sure knew how it's done right. Some parts of the game are actually really atmospheric, like the dark and abandoned laboratory - very effective visual design, and quite impressive how little is actually needed to get the point across.\n\nWhat's most important though, this isn't "fake" retro like most indiegames - where pixelated crap is branded "retro" to get away with it - this is truly well done and could sneak right in between Duke Nukem (the very first one, not 3D) and BioMenace.\n\nThe attention to detail doesn't stop with the nice visuals, the sound - being pretty much PC speaker beeps and bops - is spot on too. It's ridiculously cool hearing these "noises" in 2013 - not catchy chiptunes but genuine low modulation frequencies. The guys behind this made some smart choices too, like not having sound-effects on every step your character makes or an annoying bleep! when our hero jumps as it was in the original Duke Nukem.\nAgain, this feels like the real thing - and thus goes along nicely with the visuals. Sadly there is only one real piece of music in the game, but considering it reminds me of the first part of the Zak McKracken-theme when played via PC speaker, I am okay with that.\n\nWhat really makes MURI great is the excellent gameplay. It's really simple - explore mazes, find goodies, find "cells" (which act as keycards) and use various weapon-upgrades to dispose of enemies. The mazes aren't overly complex, they feel shorter than most of the original Duke Nukem stages and aren't as complicated either, since you don't really have to get any special items like the boots or hook. Instead of making it too metroid-ish, the developers went for a more action-oriented approach -  reminiscent of Turrican. Maybe even Thexder. There are tons of secret areas too - that you usually "unlock" by shooting certain walls or simply going through a wallsection that looks solid but really isn't. It's primitive, but actually quite motivating thanks to the straightforward nature of the various levels. Combat feels just as satisfying, just don't expect Metal Slug or Contra and you will be good. Particularly the higher tier weapons have a nice powerful feeling to them and are a blast (!) to use. What's nice are little modern touches like holding the attack-button making your weapon "lock" in position, so you can basically "strafe". Oh, and when I am writing "modern" I am talking about features that would have been implemented in games from say, 1992 to 1993 and weren't really common in a early nineties title like the ones this is based on. Mainly due to the fact that having pretty smooth scrolling was unbelievable tech-wizardry at the time and unless your game was REALLY rubbish the fact that it did scroll in all directions was enough reason to keep us motivated.\n\nEnemy-variety is good as well, most scifi/retro-tropes you would expect are present here (wall-turrets, nasty bioweapons, humanoid robots). Attack-patterns have been suitably modernized to being more exciting (and challenging on higher difficulties) than actual games had back then, yet these more modern ones still feel simple enough to fit the games overall style (again, think slightly less early 90ies). Same goes for the bosses.\n\nGoing back and forth between exploration and combat helps in keeping the game fresh, relatively short levels are a boon too. You won't really get stuck and there is nearly no need for backtracking. Again, there are little modern touches that help you get along - like visible cables that lead from blown up reactors right to the now open door. MURI may look dated, but they really made sure it as playable as possible.\n\nFinally, there is an entertaining sci-fi story happening while you keep playing, complementing the action nicely with a rather epic (in scale, at least) anime-esque tale of experiments on Mars gone wrong (where have I heard that before?) mobile-armour (Bubblegum Crisis much?), and a mother trying to save her family. Even here the game manages to mix the oldschool with some very modern flavours (especially the characterdesign of the heroine was an interesting touch).\n\nTo sum it up, MURI really surprised me in a very positive way and exceeded expectations when playing it. It's an extremely well crafted bit of oldschool fun that you shouldn't miss out on if you are familiar with the titles this game seems based on. But it doesn't need nostalgia to carry it - I do admit however it's authenticity regarding proper retro-styles did sell me on it right away. I do believe MURI stands well on it's own as an excellent example of simple but motivating gameplay done right and might be a good history lesson for the aspiring gamedesigner of tomorrow. When it comes to Retro, it is one of the finest on Steam right now.","December 7, 2013","true","5.6"," 63 of 74 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","63","74","0","4"

Unfortunately, once that's over there's no reason to go back - no achievements, no custom levels, no community features such as leaderboards.\nIf you can get it during a sale or in a bundle, by all means go for it - buying it at full price, though, is something you might want to think twice about.\n\nEDITED: All right, so it turns out I've missed two things: there is one additional secret area with a hint regarding a bonus boss, and the boss itself - not so much difficult to beat as difficult to get to.

There just weren't that many options in the 16-color EGA era; Apogee and id Games, primarily. Still, the four-directional (if a bit clunky) scrolling and rich diorama-like scenery provided an experience unlike the console platformers of the time.\n\nMURI captures the feeling of that era without its missteps; Daniel Remar puts all his skill at well-designed levels full of secrets and gigantic boss battles here. The player character's slowness and limited set of movements doesn't feel unfair, and the enemies are challenging despite their own constraints.\n\nThe game is definitely short, about an hour from start to finish.

It's a fun platformer, but it's so short. I like how a game wouldn't want to over stay it's welcome or anything, but it can be beaten in under an hour. The game feels like Duke Nukem 1 (A 2D platformer) with less flaws. The problem is, is that it sticks too close to the same type of gameplay the whole game. You are never really surprised the whole game. It always plays it safe and never really deviates from the base structure. The game has some level design, but it's all a bit generic. If you are a fan of 90's PC games like Duke Nukem 1 or even Commander Keen and Duke Nukem 2, you should buy this. The games biggest flaw is that it feels too much like a 90's game, you could tell someone it's "The lost Apogee game" and they would believe it, there isn't much replay value (aside from tougher difficulties), and there isn't much variety. There aren't many modern features, I mean, there isn't any coop or anything. The graphics are alright, it looks like I could be running an old DOS game, and is pretty nice by those standards.\nWell, overall, I may of sounded a bit disparaging on this, and I may of spent a lot of text talking about MURI's flaws, but it is a fun game which I really enjoyed while it lasted. I'm sure I'll buy the next game the dev makes, the dev has some talent. MURI is not the perfect game, but if you are a platformer fan who has three bucks to spare... Why not give it a shot? You know what, 7.5 out of 10 stars. I'd recommend it.\n\nEDIT: Changed score from 6.5 since it didn't seem too fair. I'm playing it again and it's definately a 7.5.

It's short, simple, and to the point. 2D platforming and shooting. This game replicates old DOS games. I never really played anything on DOS when I was younger, but I've played NES games and retroactively played a few select DOS titles. So as long as you're into retro style games, you'll probably enjoy this.\n\nThis game controls pretty well. You only have a few functions, but it's pretty easy and smooth... and I even played on the choppy authentic settings. You jump, duck, and shoot your way through the levels collecting items for points. The game is even nice enough to tell you once you've got all the items in an area, so you'll know for sure if you found all the secret spots or not. Also, it's worh mentioning that your jump is actually responsive to how long you hold the jump button and the rate of ascent and descent is the same. It might not sound like much, but it makes the game very easy to control compared to some stiffer titles of the past. Also, you can get a small variet of cool weapons, each one stronger than the last. There are four episodes and five levels per episode, making the game 20 levels long. It took me about two hours to beat the whole thing 100% the first time I played.\n\nThe retro style is done very well in this game. Where some games blend different retro references for nostalgia, MURI really sticks to a fully classic experience. Gameplay, music, sounds, visuals... the works. It's all done in a way that makes you believe it really could be an old DOS game. I love it. The classic feel AND mentality are in tact.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the game, there are a few issues, as with every game. One of them is that... well... it's short. The content that's there is good so I can't complain too much, but a lot of people will be offput by the brevity. The next two things I'm lumping together and you'll see why. No saving and no switching weapons. Both of these things would be very easy to put in. The thing is... they are a choice. Obviouly a game that came out in 2013 COULD have a button for saving and a button to change weapons, but it doesn't. These choices were made to give meaning to the extra lives and weapons you find. Sure, saving after every level would be convenient, but it would defeat the purpose of getting extra lives by reloading every level if you mess up. Plus, the episodes are pretty short, only took me roughly 30 minutes each and it was my first time playing... got 100% score on them all... you'll have plenty of time to beat an episode and each episode starts you with nothing anyway so it's the same as having a save between episodes really. Switching weapons would make you stock up on ammo to beat tough bosses and enemies rather than conserve your ammo and take careful shots with the guns you acquire. These choices are not only for a retro feel, but they also make sense for the game's difficulty. They're design choices... so I can't be too upset about them.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty fun little game akin to the first two Duke Nukem games. If you like retro style games of the 2D platformer shooter genre, check it out. Is it worth the $6 asking price? $4 isn't too bad. It could be a little cheaper, and you can always wait for a sale, but if you're up for trying out the difficulties and replaying it a few times after you've bought it rather than making it just a one time deal, then it's a fair price. I got it on sale for 40 cents so it was well worth it for me. Maybe wait for it to go on sale if you're skeptical, but just don't forget about it.

All i can say this is a must play for any DOS game fans. This feels a lot more polished than the classic DOS games like Duke Nukem. The game is a platformer in which you start at point A and you need to get to point B.  MURI has outstanding level design and it's overall a really well made game. The game is also quite short only around an hour long. Overall there's not a lot to say about this game. It's a really fun and a well made game.

It could almost be running via DOSBox, such is the atmosphere of the game. A platform action game at heart with a lot of shooting, this is a fun albeit short-lived experience.  The graphics are suitably EGA like; there is no in-game music and the sound effects are pleasingly simplistic.\n\nSome of the deliberate constraints may annoy those not used to playing old-style games: weapon selection is automatic - the most powerful weapon is always chosen.  The frame rate is choppy, but you can make it smoother in the menu.  There is no map or indicator of where to go next; fortunately the stages are not a sprawling affair - you can get through most levels quickly if you decide to.\n\nThere are some concessions which help make it less frustrating for some folk.  There are several small rooms hidden from view, usually with a power-up or scoring items.  You are briefly invincible when hit, enemies' bullets are large and easy to see and you can repeatedly bounce on most enemies to damage them.  There are several difficulty levels and the cut scenes can be skipped.  You have all this fun with no need to add commands like DEVICEHIGH=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.\n","January 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Specifically, it looks and plays a lot like the original Duke Nukem from 1991, but it has a lot of cool features of its own.If you haven't played the original Duke, you're given about 16 decently sized levels you're free to wander around and explore in, grabbing stuff for points, getting better firepower, and looking around for secrets.\n\nThe game's pretty short, but each episode comes with a boss fight that gets tougher and more interesting the harder the difficulty you play it on. There's also always the drive to improve your score by looking for more of the secrets and getting better times, too, which is cool if you're into score attacking.\n\nPersonally, I like this game just for how authentic it is. Nothing in the game uses 16 colors, and even the sound effects come right out of the PC speaker. For some people, it might be a little tough to look at, but for somebody who grew up with DOS, it's a lot of extra effort that I feel makes the game really special. Not many games at all have ever used this kind of style, compared to how many NES-style games are out there, so I really, really appreciate it.

So many times when you see "retro" style games they are usually either throwbacks to old NES/SNES/Megadrive(Genesis) era games or a lazy excuse for weak graphics since they may look like a old game graphiclly but they don't often play like them. This game on the other hand looks and plays like a old dos era EGA platformer, most notably Duke Nukem 1 so much so I half expected to see the Apogee logo and a shareware registration page which sadly it doesn't have but it does have a quit to DOS option(no seriously, but sadly no Simulated DOS prompt pops up when exiting) and it even uses old PC speaker style sound and music(title screen), so when I say looks and feels like I do mean it, the scrolling is a bit chunky since back in the day smooth scrolling effects were done on the PC through moving 8x8 blocks to simulated smooth movement like arcade and NES games had.\n\nOnly downside it's a bit short since each episode is only 5 levels long and they could tweak the controlls a bit since if your shooting and then push back you don't turn but rather just move back unlike other games from the era it's emulating where you will always face the direction you press shooting or not. Prehapes this is intentional but it's still feels weird at least to me also there are no saves but since each episoded(4 in total) are only 5 levels long it's not a big deal.\n\nSo if you have fond memories of old shareware EGA side-scrollers from the 90's like Duke Nukem, Commander Keen, Bio Menece, Dangerous Dave and the haunted mansion and others then by all means give this a go.\n","December 8, 2013","true","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Man, was I wrong. Remar has created something special here and I was nothing to short of being blown away. MURI is a side scrolling run and gun in the guise of an MS DOS aesthetic (seriously, as soon as I saw that DOS style HUD, I knew I was in for a treat) with plenty of things to shoot, plenty of power ups, plenty of levels, a ton of secrets and a phenomenal storyline. MURI is divided into four chapters and does a brilliant job of combining Sci-Fi elements into it's own unique telling, it's simply not enough to explain it here, I alone can do this game no justice. MURI is a special game, that does everything right, the MS DOS feel and aesthetic is beyond perfect, the story is original, the sound effects and what little music there is, is spot on. The game starts off easy, but it really does start getting brutal as it goes on... And theres a hard mode option, if you're feeling brave enough.\n\nMURI gets zero complaints from me, it's an outstanding game that caught me completely off guard, and it's an experience I would happily share with anyone who is interested. To anyone who  is into the DOS scene, to anyone who misses the unique feel of these types of games, you have to try this. Great game, if all my fingers were thumbs, they would be up, but they're not.

Minimalist and spartan it creates atmosphere with empty space, both visually and aurally, and succeeds in crafting a smooth dificulty curve through deliberate level design and the sequential introduction of new challenges and power-ups. The cherry on top is the surprisingly touching story told through tight dialogue scenes that don't overstay their welcome and explore themes of motherhood and sacrifice.\n\nIt's a short game, approximately an hour and a half long, but once you start it, it's hard to put it down, and if you have fond memories of shareware and floppy disks its presentation will absolutely satisfy. Game design has matured over the decades and it avoids the pitfalls that its forebears often succumbed to, and I would argue that it succeeds as an engrossing experience even without being viewed through the lens of nostalgia.","December 20, 2013","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It duplicates the appearance and structure of an EGA-era DOS platformer, and feels very authentic to that. It even has an option to scroll tile-by-tile as those games often did to compensate for the underpowered PC graphics hardware of the day.\n\nThe game consists of twenty levels divided into four episodes. Much like the games it follows, you do lose all your weapons and powerups after each, but the game is designed for this; boss fights give you massive arsenal upgrades and the first level always gives you a few extra guns if you're careful with your special ammunition.\n\nThe game's challenge level is fairly even, with a gentle upward slope as you progress. Though the game's final chapters do ramp up the enemy and bullet density, there aren't any egregious 'gotcha' spots, at least on Normal difficulty that I played.\n\nOverall it's an average game, but one worth playing if you enjoy the EGA aesthetic.

However, this game is almost painfully easy, rarely a challenge in it at all.  Nothing to overcome.  Lots of invisible exploration passages, some over-powered weapons, the final chapter even lets you have an unlimited version of the most powerful weapon if you spent some time in the previous levels exploring.  The story is... insane.  Not well thought through.  I'm giving it a 'no', because the game just felt too hollow.  Here, after one and a quarter hours, I have completed the whole thing.  The story wasn't engaging, the gameplay was light, there just isn't enough meat on this bone to make me able to recommend it.\n\nHOWEVER, if you're alright with a platformer on the easy side, with a half-baked story, and just want to kill a few hours, this game is perfect for it.  If they make a sequel, I probably will look into it.  I just hope there's more to it than this one.\n\nEdit: There is also no way to rebind the keyboard controls.

So far I've finished the first four episodes and they've all been a blast to play. The game not only pays homage to Apogee-style DOS platformers but develops them a bit further. The result is a more rounded game with a lot of secrets and some exciting boss encounters.\n\nSound\nInstead of the PC speaker beepiness (which, admittedly, is faithful to the source material) I'd have preferred an AdLib-type soundtrack.\n\nGraphics\nThe EGA graphics are fine, even though some of the enemy robots look a bit stiff. Because I played the DOS games I am quite used to the choppy scrolling, thus I haven't tried the smooth mode yet. Maybe I'll try it for the second playthrough.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is quite easy on Normal, though on later stages I died several times, in most cases out of carelessness. I imagine the harder difficulty levels are proper challenges. Finding all bonus items in a level provides some motivation to explore the entire level before moving on and later on there are some cleverly placed secrets. The first few stages felt a bit short, but they get more expansive in the later episodes. None of the ones I've played so far have reached the complexity of many Duke Nukem levels, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nSummary\nIf you liked Duke Nukem and similar DOS platformer, chances are high you'll love this game as well. It's a short but fun nostalgia trip for a fair price.","December 7, 2013","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the best retro games I've played in a long time based on old DOS games. Weaponry is diverse, tons of secrets to discover, amazing stroyline, variety of enemies, this game has alot to offer. The best part about it is that it is incredibly cheap and goes on sale pretty decently often.\n\nOnly things I see what could be improved on is that there should be a global leaderboard, seeing as it is an arcade game. Also, I wish there were achievements in the game, because believe it or not that's one of the reasons I even buy games on Steam.

I didn't even know the protagonist was the mother until the end of the 3rd episode, but the gameplay is really tight and has that old 90s mix of a simple skillset that's easy to learn with a gradual difficulty curve of more and more types of enemies in greater numbers and platforming that becomes less and less forgiving. At times it reaches SHMUP levels of chaos on the screen (or will if you dive into new areas head-first). I wish there was a way to change ammo types so I don't waste the heavier rounds on weak enemies, but it's a quirk to plan for, I guess. There is no save function, but each episode can be chosen from the menu and each is only five levels long, so saving would be overkill.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/267360/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","MURI is a side-scrolling action platformer, and a clear throwback to the 8-bit era! Instead of NES, though, this one tributes the DOS-side, citing  Duke Nukum as the biggest influence.\n\nWhile the game does very little to innovate, it's a very accessible game, especially for people unfamiliar with the difficulty of older games. If you are looking for that challenge, however, there are modes to make that happen!\n\nIt's a very by the book game, in my opinion, but I think it's well done.\n\n\nPresentation\nI'm not sure if it's worth this, but the game looks like it's from the 80s, as intended! Low-res, limited color-scheme, 16fps -- it's all there! (Although there's a 32fps version, which feels much better to play)\nWhat you see in the screenshots is what you get. It seems very faithful to the era it's celebrating.\nIt also features color-coded enemies, each color representing a difficulty-tier.\nEverything is well delineated, and there's never any confusion between what's an enemy, background and foreground.\n\nThe sound-effects follow the same route. If you like playing your own music while playing game, those can certainly be very annoying, but you should know what you're getting into.\nThere's one big issue, though, in the fact that there's no music! I'm not familiar with the DOS era, so I'm not sure if it was common practice for games not to have music. In NES games, though, music was one of its strong points! And it's very unfortunate that MURI does not have any. There's a very short and looping track in the menu, but on its own, it does nothing to standout.\n\nYou could always listen to a podcast or something while playing it, though, without hurting the experience.\n\nStruture\nThere are 4 episodes in MURI. Each episode is self-contained, and has 5 stages, one of which is a boss fight.\nThere are no saves, as expected. However, every difficulty mode and episode is unlocked from the start. Your only worry is to play one episode at once.\nYou can probably be done with the episodes in 20 minutes, even less if you don't bother with exploration.\n\nThere are 4 (acceptable) difficulties available - Easy, Normal, Hard and MURI. I can't say for sure if the enemies actually change between these modes, but what I can say, is that they change the Health and Lives Pick-ups in the levels, depending on the chosen difficulty. Each of them has a Score Multiplier associated with it.\n\nI've played it on Normal, and then gave it a spin on MURI, just to see how it was. Normal mode should cause major problems to anyone. If you take the time to explore, you'll have more than enough lives and health pick-ups to carry you through. I didn't get any game-over in this mode. Hard will most likely be the most suitable for any more or less experienced player.\nMURI, on the other hand, is more of a real challenge! There are not health pick ups nor lives anywhere. You'll have 3 lives for each episode, and that's it. This was certainly not the kind of experience I was looking for when I started playing MURI, but it's good to know it's there! (I have yet to play Volgarr the Viking)\nYour health is restored between each stage, in all modes, which is very handy! It's also a small reward on the harder modes, to be able to take damage in moderation without it being an issue.\n\n\nOn every stage there are tons of secrets, in the form of fake and destroyable walls, hidden platforms, etc. for you to uncover, getting score pick-ups and lives as well as ammunition for the more powerful weapons. Your score is increased by picking things up and killing enemies -- a very welcome aspect is how the game tells you when you reach 100% Score for that specific stage! I think it's very fair. It doesn't tell you too much, but you can be sure to leave the stage without leaving anything behind, if you so want.\n\nThere are also hidden Cells. These will unlock the more powerful weapons for the Boss stage, but are also more challenging to get.\n\nIf you lose all of your lives, you'll get a game over screen, and "back to the menu with you"! Again, it should not be a problem in Normal Mode, at least.\n\n\nMechanics & Level Design\nI've covered part of this on the previous section. No worries, there's still a bit to talk about.\n\nI've mentioned several weapons. These include your basic, infinite, slow shot. Then, there's Rapid Shot, MKV (Scatter gun), Laser gun, Explosive-shot gun, and a Crazy Barrage of Large Bouncy Shots gun. You'll be able to get ammo hidden through the stages. You always keep what you collect when you finish a stage -- except, of course, between episodes -- so exploration is highly encouraged.\nYour active weapon is always the most powerful one for which you have ammo. I dislike this quite a lot. I don't see a reason for not allowing the player to switch between weapons, but I couldn't find one. This leads to you wasting very valuable ammo on the weakest enemies, and then having an hard time with the tougher ones -- note that this only made a difference in MURI mode, but still.\n\n\nHow the level-design encourages exploration\nFirst off, the game constantly teases you by showing you pick-ups inside the walls. You know you can get there; all that's left is figuring out how!\nThe game doesn't try to hide many things. It's mostly very fair in that regard, as it gives you glimpses of possible secrets and fake walls every time.\nAnother way that I highly respect is that they never close a door behind you -- figuratively speaking.\nThere are no pits from which you can't get back, doors that close or anything of the sort. If you've left something behind, as long as you don't leave the stage, you can always go back to find it. This also goes hand in hand with the fact that they tell you when you reach 100% score. If they didn't tell you when you're near the exit, you've missed something -- Feel free to go back and explore some more!\n\nEnemy Variety and Difficulty\nThere are lots of different enemies, each with their movement pattern, health, directional shots, etc. For its low length and amount of episodes, Muri compensates with the very varied enemies and levels in general. It'll never feel repetitive during the first playthrough! And if you're actively looking for this kind of game, I'm sure you can play through it at least twice without it feeling boring at all.\nFor each type of enemy, there are also different tiers, identified by their color. Green are the easiest, then Blue, Red and Grey, with these being the harder.\n\nThe enemies are well placed, and the game is never unfair. You can always see shots coming before getting hit. Enemies outside the screen still shoot at you and take damage, so you'll have to be careful.\n\nOne of the aspects characteristic of these old games is how methodical they are to play, and MURI is no different. If you rush, you'll probably get hit often, and end up losing a bunch of lives. If you play it slow, and be aware of the enemies' patterns, though, you'll be able to succeed with conviction.\nIf you've played NES or DOS games, you'll know whether this is for you.\n\n\nThe Boss Fights were also pretty fun, with multiple phases, as is classic. They also change depending on the difficulty you're playing on, which is always good to see!\n\nNo saves\nI've seen some people unhappy with the lack of lives. I'd generally agree, especially in the easier difficulties, as it's very frustrating to lose a whole level of progress.\nHowever, I don't think you have anything to worry about, in this game. MURI mode is there for the more hardcore players. If you're not one of them, exploration will reward you with plenty of lives. It's old-school design, but made more accessible. I do not think it poses an issue.\n\n\nThis one comes from Ludosity, who are yet to disappoint me. Give it a go!","January 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyetheczar/recommended/267360/","tyetheczar","Tye The Czar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyetheczar/","384 products in account","MURI is as close as you can get to having a Shovel Knight or Cave Story for DOS platformers. Like the latter two, MURI takes old school aesthetics and mechanics and gives them a modern level of polish and accessibility while still being challenging. It's an excellently executed game from the creator of games like Garden Gnome Carnage and Iji.\n\nPros:\n+ Authentically emulates the sights and sounds of DOS-era platformers.\n\n+ Simple, but slick controls. I always felt like I had my character flawlessly jumping and shooting enemies. Shooting while moonwalking is a welcome addition.\n\n+ Great level design. Each level feels distinct, has multiple pathways and is filled with clever secrets.\n\n+ Tons upon tons of secrets for each level. MURI encourages exploration and completion for each level, showing when you have achieved 100% for each one. The secrets are well-hidden but gives enough of a hint to uncover them.\n\n+ Fantastic pacing. MURI always knows when and where to throw enemies at you while giving you just the right amount of firepower and health to do so.\n\n+ An interesting attempt at a complex story that juxtaposes well with the era it tries to emulate.\n\n+ A female protagonist who's also a mother. You can never have enough good female leads.\n\n+ Great boss battles. Each one tests the limits of your skills and make excellent climaxes.\n\n+ Great value for about 2 to 3 dollars.\n\nMixed:\n\n/ Inability to switch between weapons removes some choice, but it also keeps you from hoarding them, forcing you to adapt to any new weapon you get.\n\n/ MURI makes an admirable attempt at a story that juxtaposes well with the DOS aesthetic, but unfortunately it ends up as difficult to follow.\n\n/ The game takes about 2 to 3 hours to finish, but those 2 to 3 hours are so fun that you won't regret enjoying it.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of 60 FPS. The max you can have is 32, but this doesn't detract from the gameplay at all.\n- Somewhat short. It can be finished in about a few hours, but those few hours are very well-spent.\n- Deserves a level editor.\n\nVerdict: If you loved DOS games like Duke Nukem, Halloween Harry or Commander Keen, or you just love action platformers, MURI is right up your alley.","January 1, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game that emulates the style almost perfectly, right down to score collectibles, stage layouts, and even an optional 16 frames per-second gameplay mode. It's a simple little run and gunner with 20 stages that you'll probably end up blasting through in a relatively short amount of time (since the stages are in no way as labyrinthine or exhausting as some of those older games could get), but you'll either appreciate the call back to those gems of the past or understand the earlier days of PC gaming just a bit more.\n\nIf the game does have one standout feature, it's that its story, simple as it is, has a bit more structure and presence than older games, and even has a fairly satisfying conclusion.\n\nIt's hard to really not recommend MURI. It's a great little one-sitting action platformer that hits all the right notes and doesn't really outstay its welcome, nor does it feel like a chore to play with its slavish emulation of games from a time when technology was a lot more limited.","November 27, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From this, we've gotten countless NES—er, "8-bit" style games, whether they were created to honestly bring back the feel of an "8-bit" game or just to have an "excuse" to give for horrible artwork. Yet, very few designers have ever done the same with other consoles—or old computers. Daniel Remar (the creator of Iji) adds to this niche with MURI, a side-scrolling platformer which takes after the first Duke Nukem from the DOS shareware era of 1991 but adds and fine-tunes many features to make it its own game. Everything here feels authentic, from the PC speaker sounds to the choppy scrolling (which can be changed to be smooth from the Options menu if you feel like it) to the EGA palette (nothing in the game uses any more than the EGA card's standard 16 colors).\n\nBut it's a fun game, too, with movement that feels more fluid than you'd think it'd be and a difficulty balance that feels about right. The levels are of the exploratory kind instead of a linear sort, and it feels great when you find the way to an item that seems just out of reach. It's a rather short game, though, with five levels for each of the four episodes (a touch of the shareware era), even if they get longer as you progress.\n\nOverall, it's a successful return to early 90s DOS and good way to spend ~2 hours of free time.

Even though I don't think that'll be an issue for this game, I feel compelled to point that out anyways. Besides, it's worked fine so far.\n\nGameplay: If you've never played a DOS-style shooter before, think something like the original Contra but with more maze-y levels. If you have played a DOS-style shooter, this is pretty much par for the course. The stages are labyrinthean with plenty of secrets; some of which are pretty easy to spot while others require you to dig deeper into the level for something like a switch that activates something at the beginning of the level. I got an average of 95% of the points for each of the levels, with the exception of the boss levels, but that's just because of how the game scores points. There's four episodes which consist of five levels a piece; four stages and a boss stage. Hidden somewhere in the first four stages of each episode are items called cells which allow you to get some extra powerups before the boss of that stage. They're not essential, but they certainly do help.\n\nBosses in this game are actually really good; certainly a lot better than some of the bosses you'd see in the Commander Keen series. I only played through the game on Normal, but even on that difficulty they were a bit of a handful. The final boss was just plain excellent and a great way to end the game. As for the weapons, you have your standard pea shooter, a rapid shot, a five-way spread, a laser that splits and bounces off of walls, a homing explosive shot, and Chaos which just does things and kills enemies sometimes.\n\nApart from that, that's pretty much your lot for this game. It took me just over an hour and a half to beat the game on normal with a fair bit of exploration of the stages, but that's a pretty good length for a DOS-style game. It definitely has replay value, especially with higher difficulties and 100% playthroughs, so if you're into that kind of thing, this game will certainly be worth the $4. It's simple and compact, and there really isn't a thing Id change about it. 10/10.\n\nStory: Unlike a lot of DOS-shooters, this game actually has a pretty good story. It's a bit hard to follow, but it's a fairly high-level Sci-FI storyline about the creation of life. Surprisingly interesting and a not half bad delivery of what could be perceived as a dramatic ending. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: Fortunately, the game doesn't launch in CGA resolution; that would be annoying. Rather, it fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hassle, so that's all good. As for the art direction, it's quite good, even if the MURI suits look a bit like Robo-Bunnies. Apart from that, the world designs are good, the enemy designs can be absolutely fantastic, with the boss of Stage 3 being the big standout. I can't quite speak for whether or not it rigidly conforms to the EGA palette or not, but it looks DOS-y and it looks good. 5/5.\n\nSound: This is something that I don't think I've done in the year or so since I started reviewing games (three months since I started publishing Steam reviews): I'm not gonna rate sound. I really can't, since the game itself goes for yet another factor of the DOS design in that there is no music - save for the title track - and all of the sounds are blips. So yeah, it feels a bit weird to do that, but that's what's happening.\n\nOverall scores are: 10/8/5/0; 9.2/10. A very solid little shooter that's well worth the money. I'll definitely play it again in the future.","July 19, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sound also simulates what early games sounded on the built-in PC speaker (there was no sound card in the early days).\n\nThe levels are also very well designed and have some secrets, although they are not too difficult to find if you spend some time exploring all areas. The secrets usually have some hints indicating there is a hidden passage or there is some puzzle-ish element (such as destroying some blocks). That way, they never feel "cheap" nor frustrating. In fact, they are quite straightforward.\n\nJoystick is supported, but I had trouble configuring the D-pad in-game. Instead, I just used Xpadder (or Joy2Key) to emulate keypresses.\n\nThe gameplay itself has a brilliant touch: you can either play in 16fps, which really simulates the movement of early PC games such as "Duke Nukum" (the first Duke Nukem game). Alternatively, you can also play the game with smooth movement in 32fps, which feels more responsive and more modern. Either way, the game plays very well, the controls are very responsive, and the game feels balanced.","March 22, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enter MURI, a retro parody game made in the style of classic DOS games around the EGA era (roughly mid 80s to early 90s) complete with 16 colors, 16 frames per second (with an option for 32) and PC-speaker sounds. In other words, a real gem.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the original Duke Nukem which is similarly episodic with multiple weapons and even has collectibles in the form of floppy disks and joysticks. It's a very fun and refreshing kind of game you don't see anymore, even among indie developers. I found it to be a very enjoyable, albeit brief experience even with four episodes. And lest not forget MURI has a score system which is not found in games of this type anymore, so even if you beat the game there is some replayability if you like getting high scores, especially as there is a multiplier based on chosen difficulty.\n\nOverall a pretty fun game, especially if you're old enough to remember when games came on floppy disks. And it's very low in price too.","April 1, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's challenging, fun, and well designed with loads of secrets to uncover and hidden areas to explore. MURI also features a dark and surprisingly engaging story told through cutscenes and dialogue. It'll give you some Metroid vibes, but it's not a "Metroidvania" in the usual sense. Shooting, jumping, dodging, and discovering are the name of the game here. It's short, sweet, and begs to be replayed on higher difficulties.

Yes.\n\nMURI is a delightfully DOS-era inspired action platformer. The games play much like the original Duke Nukems. While I've never played them, I've seen footage of them and I have played many DOS games in my childhood, and MURI takes me back.\n\nContrary to popular belief, not all old games where hard, and MURI is actually quite easy on normal difficulty, almost childishly so due to energy pick up and lives. I recommend a minimum of Hard difficulty to any reasonably seasoned player, though Normal is fine if you're just clearing your backlog...you may not loose any of you live.\n\nMURI gets the old school feel perfectl right down the the graphical style, sound effects, lack of in game music (only the menu....and maybe cutscenes have music, and if you so desire, you can play the game in a reduced frame rate much like the games of the time.\n\nYou start with an unlimted ammo single shot blaster, and you can gradually get better weapons with limited ammo like rapid fire, spread shot (MRV), laser, or heat-seeking flares. Occasionally, you can pick up infinite versions of weapons which last the rest of the episode, or at least the level. The goal of the game is to get to the end of the level and you can attempt to get all the point pick-ups and secrets if you desire (and you can actually turn around and get them if you missed them! Take that modern game design!). Each episode ends with a boss.\n\nAt the end of the day, MURI doesn't necessarily do anything remarkable - tons of old games have done something like this and games have advanced well beyond the DOS era. But MURI is a newly made game that gets the retro-style gameplay and appearance perfectly and is a no brainer for anybody who enjoyed PC gaming from the late-80s and early 90s.","August 4, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like the latter two, MURI takes old school aesthetics and mechanics and gives them a modern level of polish and accessibility while still being challenging. It's an excellently executed game from the creator of games like Garden Gnome Carnage and Iji.\n\nPros:\n+ Authentically emulates the sights and sounds of DOS-era platformers.\n\n+ Simple, but slick controls. I always felt like I had my character flawlessly jumping and shooting enemies. Shooting while moonwalking is a welcome addition.\n\n+ Great level design. Each level feels distinct, has multiple pathways and is filled with clever secrets.\n\n+ Tons upon tons of secrets for each level. MURI encourages exploration and completion for each level, showing when you have achieved 100% for each one. The secrets are well-hidden but gives enough of a hint to uncover them.\n\n+ Fantastic pacing. MURI always knows when and where to throw enemies at you while giving you just the right amount of firepower and health to do so.\n\n+ An interesting attempt at a complex story that juxtaposes well with the era it tries to emulate.\n\n+ A female protagonist who's also a mother. You can never have enough good female leads.\n\n+ Great boss battles. Each one tests the limits of your skills and make excellent climaxes.\n\n+ Great value for about 2 to 3 dollars.\n\nMixed:\n\n/ Inability to switch between weapons removes some choice, but it also keeps you from hoarding them, forcing you to adapt to any new weapon you get.\n\n/ MURI makes an admirable attempt at a story that juxtaposes well with the DOS aesthetic, but unfortunately it ends up as difficult to follow.\n\n/ The game takes about 2 to 3 hours to finish, but those 2 to 3 hours are so fun that you won't regret enjoying it.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of 60 FPS. The max you can have is 32, but this doesn't detract from the gameplay at all.\n- Somewhat short. It can be finished in about a few hours, but those few hours are very well-spent.\n- Deserves a level editor.\n\nVerdict: If you loved DOS games like Duke Nukem, Halloween Harry or Commander Keen, or you just love action platformers, MURI is right up your alley.","January 1, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I expect replay value to be somewhat low overall.\n\nThere's a decent variety of enemies you encounter and slay along the way and the boss fights, while not particularly challenging or extraordinary, are still frantic and fun to blast through. There is also a variety of weapon upgrades and power-ups you may encounter, ranging from rapid-fire to lazer blasts that ricochet off the walls.\n\nThe levels are not linear however they are still easy to navigate through and they're designed quite well, though they all kind of feel the same.

Four episodes, with four levels (plus a boss level) in each, and I did it in around 2 hours. For the price, though, I'm not going to complain, because it plays very well.\n\nIt's EXTREMELY reminiscent of the first Duke Nukem game. Fortunately, I like that game, so I like this too. The main difference with Duke Nukem is the addition of weapons, but other than that, the engine is almost identical (it could almost be a sequel to Duke Nukem, although that already exists). If you take Duke Nukem, mix in some Metroid style, and lowered your character's gravity so you can jump really high, that's this game.\n\nThe design is excellent: the weapons are varied, and you can't select them freely so you never feel like relying on any one weapon. On Normal mode, I felt that just as my health was getting low, a health pack would appear, so the levels have been designed well there. I also like the secret rooms to find, and a challenge to get 100% on the level. The addition of cells that open doors to power-ups on the boss level is a nice touch: you can ignore them, but the final battle will be harder, so it keeps you searching.\n\nThere are only a couple of negatives I can think of: there is no save function, which is odd for a game like this, but since each episode is done in around 20 minutes, it doesn't really bother me much. Second, I know the graphics and sound are supposed to be like an EGA game with PC speaker, but the music is just a rather dull theme song, then nothing. And the final negative? Not enough levels! It's not entirely a bad thing though, because if they released some more episode packs, I'd definitely buy them too.

This is a game that emulates the style almost perfectly, right down to score collectibles, stage layouts, and even an optional 16 frames per-second gameplay mode. It's a simple little run and gunner with 20 stages that you'll probably end up blasting through in a relatively short amount of time (since the stages are in no way as labyrinthine or exhausting as some of those older games could get), but you'll either appreciate the call back to those gems of the past or understand the earlier days of PC gaming just a bit more.\n\nIf the game does have one standout feature, it's that its story, simple as it is, has a bit more structure and presence than older games, and even has a fairly satisfying conclusion.\n\nIt's hard to really not recommend MURI. It's a great little one-sitting action platformer that hits all the right notes and doesn't really outstay its welcome, nor does it feel like a chore to play with its slavish emulation of games from a time when technology was a lot more limited.","November 27, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As such, the graphics and sound are intentionally limited to fit the restrictions of an old EGA video card with only a PC speaker for audio.  The controls are identical to those of the first few Commander Keen games, with Alt jumping and Ctrl firing, and the arrow keys for movement.\n\nIt claims to support gamepads, but wouldn't recognize my Xbox 360 controller.  It may be looking for older DirectInput controllers, but I didn't test that.  Any method you have for mapping controller buttons to keyboard signals should suffice if you want to use a controller but it doesn't recognize yours.\n\nGiven the restrictions it's placed on itself, the graphics and sound are very good.  It has a fairly unique visual style, and a font quite reminiscent of classic DOS platformers.\n\nI wholly recommend MURI on two levels.  First, to anyone who enjoys 2D platformers, it's a solid experience.  Second, to anyone who liked classic DOS platformers, it's very similar in graphics, sound, and controls.  Also, if you like this game and want more of the same style, look up the Commander Keen Complete Pack to find the first five games in that series.","January 15, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though I don't think that'll be an issue for this game, I feel compelled to point that out anyways. Besides, it's worked fine so far.\n\nGameplay: If you've never played a DOS-style shooter before, think something like the original Contra but with more maze-y levels. If you have played a DOS-style shooter, this is pretty much par for the course. The stages are labyrinthean with plenty of secrets; some of which are pretty easy to spot while others require you to dig deeper into the level for something like a switch that activates something at the beginning of the level. I got an average of 95% of the points for each of the levels, with the exception of the boss levels, but that's just because of how the game scores points. There's four episodes which consist of five levels a piece; four stages and a boss stage. Hidden somewhere in the first four stages of each episode are items called cells which allow you to get some extra powerups before the boss of that stage. They're not essential, but they certainly do help.\n\nBosses in this game are actually really good; certainly a lot better than some of the bosses you'd see in the Commander Keen series. I only played through the game on Normal, but even on that difficulty they were a bit of a handful. The final boss was just plain excellent and a great way to end the game. As for the weapons, you have your standard pea shooter, a rapid shot, a five-way spread, a laser that splits and bounces off of walls, a homing explosive shot, and Chaos which just does things and kills enemies sometimes.\n\nApart from that, that's pretty much your lot for this game. It took me just over an hour and a half to beat the game on normal with a fair bit of exploration of the stages, but that's a pretty good length for a DOS-style game. It definitely has replay value, especially with higher difficulties and 100% playthroughs, so if you're into that kind of thing, this game will certainly be worth the $4. It's simple and compact, and there really isn't a thing Id change about it. 10/10.\n\nStory: Unlike a lot of DOS-shooters, this game actually has a pretty good story. It's a bit hard to follow, but it's a fairly high-level Sci-FI storyline about the creation of life. Surprisingly interesting and a not half bad delivery of what could be perceived as a dramatic ending. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: Fortunately, the game doesn't launch in CGA resolution; that would be annoying. Rather, it fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hassle, so that's all good. As for the art direction, it's quite good, even if the MURI suits look a bit like Robo-Bunnies. Apart from that, the world designs are good, the enemy designs can be absolutely fantastic, with the boss of Stage 3 being the big standout. I can't quite speak for whether or not it rigidly conforms to the EGA palette or not, but it looks DOS-y and it looks good. 5/5.\n\nSound: This is something that I don't think I've done in the year or so since I started reviewing games (three months since I started publishing Steam reviews): I'm not gonna rate sound. I really can't, since the game itself goes for yet another factor of the DOS design in that there is no music - save for the title track - and all of the sounds are blips. So yeah, it feels a bit weird to do that, but that's what's happening.\n\nOverall scores are: 10/8/5/0; 9.2/10. A very solid little shooter that's well worth the money. I'll definitely play it again in the future.","July 19, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

She has to get out of the ship she is in, but there is more to the story than just that in each of the 5 episodes.\n\nIf you enjoy Commander Keen series I highly recommend this one! Also if you love space and Metroid bit of gameplay (mechs and shooting) mixed with it makes it even more enjoyable. Very easy to pick up cause not many buttons to push. It doesn't have much of a soundtrack like what alot of the older dos games had (just sound FX from jumping/shooting), but it doesn't take away from the fun.

Four episodes, with four levels (plus a boss level) in each, and I did it in around 2 hours. For the price, though, I'm not going to complain, because it plays very well.\n\nIt's EXTREMELY reminiscent of the first Duke Nukem game. Fortunately, I like that game, so I like this too. The main difference with Duke Nukem is the addition of weapons, but other than that, the engine is almost identical (it could almost be a sequel to Duke Nukem, although that already exists). If you take Duke Nukem, mix in some Metroid style, and lowered your character's gravity so you can jump really high, that's this game.\n\nThe design is excellent: the weapons are varied, and you can't select them freely so you never feel like relying on any one weapon. On Normal mode, I felt that just as my health was getting low, a health pack would appear, so the levels have been designed well there. I also like the secret rooms to find, and a challenge to get 100% on the level. The addition of cells that open doors to power-ups on the boss level is a nice touch: you can ignore them, but the final battle will be harder, so it keeps you searching.\n\nThere are only a couple of negatives I can think of: there is no save function, which is odd for a game like this, but since each episode is done in around 20 minutes, it doesn't really bother me much. Second, I know the graphics and sound are supposed to be like an EGA game with PC speaker, but the music is just a rather dull theme song, then nothing. And the final negative? Not enough levels! It's not entirely a bad thing though, because if they released some more episode packs, I'd definitely buy them too.

There is also a variety of weapon upgrades and power-ups you may encounter, ranging from rapid-fire to lazer blasts that ricochet off the walls.\n\nThe levels are not linear however they are still easy to navigate through and they're designed quite well, though they all kind of feel the same.

Controls are very smooth, and the weapons are suprisingly viceral for a 16-color, very early IBM PC-style game. Love the moonwalk, too. Very useful.\n\nIt's a short game, but for even 4$, it's still worth it, honestly.\n\nAlso, the boss in ep.4 isn't as difficult as the others, but somehow, I feel that's not the last boss. Remar loves his special endings See: that grey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: ♥♥♥♥ YOU FOR THAT ROOM.","December 29, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have a nice nostalgia feel, plays well with a 360 controller and have nice graphics. The only problem for me is the poor enemies variety, they're about 5 or 6 and they didn't change much until the last episode. However, the power ups are nice, I like how each kind of bullets can make you change the way you're playing the game. I loved the boss fights, they're quite challenging.\n\nGood little game, everyone who grew up playing DOS classic platformers should check this out.","May 22, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes the good of that time and the bad, complete with the option of block scrolling and emulated PC speaker sounds. Story is present and interesting, but ultimately has no impact on the game. Just the right kind of difficult for those of us who has grown up on this genre. Separate into chapters, it's just long enough to not outstay its welcome.

Every part of this game's aesthetic feels extremely consistent with the style they're trying to emulate, but the story is a bit complex and convoluted. Perhaps credit is deserved for trying to explore dramatic themes far beyond the scope of the gameplay, but it just felt a bit out of place - simpler character motivations would have felt more authentic to early DOS experiences.\n\nI'm not really the sort of person who can ignore story elements, even in a game as purposefully simple as this, but Muri makes me wish I was. It has a wonderful sense of feedback for every control input, and feels like an incredibly honest love letter to a fascinating era of gaming history. Still strongly recommended.","July 26, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had a lot of fun playing it. It feels more accessible than a lot of the games it mimics as the enemy placement is fair and you are given a decent amount of health and lives. The game can be completed in about 2 hours but there are plenty of well hidden secrets so going back to find them adds some replay value. I love the stage design in this game and some stages actually manage to be quite tense and action-y even for a game that looks and sounds like this one does. I also love that you can either shoot enemies with your gun or jump on them à la Mario style.","November 18, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You could list out dozens of classic DOS games that Muri is like but it bares the strongest resembalence to the original Duke Nukum even to the point of having nearly identical assets at times.\n\nWhere Muri fails at its emulaiton of Duke is its lack of puzzles to progress, most levels can just be run through without fighting enemies (if you dodge their attacks) and rarely do you ever encounter anything more than a few tricky platforming sections. The Challenge of Muri comes from its unforgiving combat and sheer number of enemies. I don't particularly care for that aspect of the game so I played on an easier difficulty and just enjoyed the nostalgic gameplay.\n\nWhere Muri wins majorly is its secrets, it has TONS of hidden areas and secret items throughout the levels which  allow you access to special weapons at the boss fights. If you enjoy finding secrets and racking up a  high score this  is the game for you.","January 24","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of platforming action games, then you should have quite a bit of fun with this.\n\nAside from its short length, my only other complaints would be that it doesn't do much of anything new for this style of game. If you've played the "Commander Keen" series, or the first two "Duke Nukem" games, then you know exactly what to expect from MURI.\n\nThe lack of music in any of the levels is also a problem for me. I love chiptunes, and with the science fiction setting, MURI could have greatly benefited from at least having a couple of tracks per episode, if not per level. Without any music whatsoever, levels can sometimes feel rather dull, even if the platforming and act of shooting baddies is still fun.\n\nDespite all of that, it's none the less an enjoyable experience, and if you've a few dollars to spare, definitely give it a shot.","August 25, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I grew up on Commander Keen and Duke Nukem 1&2, but I often don't like hardcore retro throwbacks (I Wanna Be The Guy). Muri manages to combine an interesting and concisely told story with the simple and challenging gameplay of yore.\n\nThe multiple difficulty levels allow you to waltz through the game or punish yourself. I played on Normal and had several harrowing moments and deaths I looked forward to avenging. Generally, I stopped playing for the day when I died, but kept coming back. It's easy to get into a play session, but it only saves when you unlock a new chapter. This unlock system and the fun-but-challenging difficulty combined with plentify pickups in the levels made it always seem like success was only just out of reach and I wasn't cursing the game in frustration.\n\nThe bosses are fun. The sessions are short. The jumping is high. The secrets are everywhere.\n\nOn the downside, Muri doesn't work at all with my wired Xbox 360 controller. I've setup Joy2Key to play it and that worked well, but shouldn't be necessary for a "Partial Controller Support" game.","May 1","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
