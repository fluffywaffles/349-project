"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/recommended/468490/","dragoonsz","± Roger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/","4396 products in account","Product received for free\n\nNeon Space\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing.\n\nNeon Space is a game about guiding your orb through a series of obstacles to get to your goal. After you reach the goal you move onto the next stage. There are quite a bit of games in this genre. When I first played Neon Space it reminded me a lot of Night Sky as well as Space Warp, because as stated earlier, you take control of a little sphere and move it through obstacles to reach the check point, though it adds the space motif and gives you a few different abilities to play with.\n\n--------\n\nGraphics: 6 / 10\n\nAlthough it may seem I'm being a bit generous here, I'm taking into account the type of game it is. It's a small indie game never really intended for something extravagant. Being about to see the obstacles in a game like this is important, and the assets get the job done. It tries to use a bit of a minimalist theme but at the same time making room for the space motif. Most, if not all graphics cards should no problem running this game.\n\n--------\n\nSound: 8 / 10\n\nEveryone has different tastes in music, though Neon Space has a really nice soundtrack, a lot of chill vibes and trancey-ambient music. I enjoy this genre of music and I do think the tracks in the game are nice, and worthy of it's own OST. The game also gives you controls to switch through tracks as you play the game.\n\n--------\n\nMechanics: 6 / 10\n\nThe mechanics flow nicely, and are very straight forward. You start off by just moving your sphere to the goal, but as levels progress you find your self with new challenges as well as new abilities the game introduces you too. You will eventually find yourself in situations where you have to hit switches to open new paths to the goal. Some of these switches are timed and therefore you'll have race against the clock. The controls are strange at first but I believe unnaturalness of the controls are actually part of the game. The best way to describe it is that; in order to move you must first aim your orb in the direction you want to move, and then go forward.\n\n--------\n\nFinal Personal Remarks\n\nThis game is fairly simple and straight forward, especially if you take your time with the levels. Though a lot of challenge comes when racing against the clock in certain parts, as well as speed running. I believe speed running changes the game completely as you can use various abilities to improve your times, however in doing so you open yourself up to the risk of dying and losing the level. Neon Space is not a game that caters to my tastes, but I do know there are people that would enjoy games such as this. This is a game you can dive into for a bit and continue to keep playing for the satisfaction of completing the previous level, and I can see how some people can find themselves playing it longer than anticipated.\n\n\nThanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.","May 17","true","3.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The powers add to a layer of gameplay and the surprise boss battles make for a new experience when it comes to classic avoider games. This game has elements of avoider and bullet hell rolled into one fun package. For the price this is a great buy for the amount of fun you are going to have.\n\n\nYou'll probably like this game if you enjoy:\nMouse avoider titles\nDon't touch the wall style games\nBasic bullet hell\n\nSee more "Plus Side" reviews at my curator page:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/theplussside#curation","May 16","true","0.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game can go through for 1 hour, and as for me, this is not enough. The game is easy enough to pass. Beautiful backgrounds, relaxing music. Only downside is that I am having problems with control, but maybe it's just me. I also did not like was the fact that after passing a level, they do not write about that, on what medal you have passed this level, but it can be found in the levels menu. Price here really justified. For lovers of casual indie games advise.","May 21","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Thing and you have to reach the white Orb goal. In higher levels you will have to pick the Blue orbs first before you are able to finish the level. You are able to unlock some Power-ups by playing the game.  You have to avoid the red Laser lines or else you will get killed. If you have died you will have to restart the level. You are able to slowdown the enemy laser or make a small "hop".\n\n\nYou can't change keyboard controls or Xbox controller Controls.\nLevel selection.\nYou can't see how many stars you have earned after completing a level. You can only see this at Level Selection.\nGame could be a little bit Repetitive.\nMusic is alright? You can add your own music.\n\n\nOther things.\nGame is Too casual and doesn't have alot of variation.\n\nMy Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tySuXOwIVAc\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 5/10","May 23","false","4.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
