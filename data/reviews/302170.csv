They are old games, but I think they look surprisingly good. There is no real 3D. Instead of a 3D environment like an FPS game you actually move from one point to another. And at each location you have a different 360 degree panoramic view. So it's basically like Google earth street view. The game is low-res and the images are pixellated but I think it look's good. You basically explore environment looking for items and clues etc. So far I've played for almost 1 hour. It's one of those sort of detective games where sometimes you get stuck looking for the next thing because you can't see it anywhere. But that is typical of this sort of game. Those parts are a bit tedious but I really like this game. I can see myself coming back to it.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/vCkbjAI6ql4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7PR8_WspuA\nIf you like this game check my Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness steam review and let's play here. It is basically the same thing but H.P Lovecraft themed. Watch to the end of that video to see me get punched in the face lol\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","37","44","0","4"

I love point & click adventures games and I only got stuck once.

A few months ago, I decided to give it a shot.  I wasn't disappointed.  The game is a bit fantastical with a touch of a Sherlock Holmes-esque feel to it.  If  you enjoy Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, you may very well enjoy this.  It is a touch confusing at times, and I did occasionally need to consult a walkthrough for some of the timed portions.  The mystery is enough to keep you engaged and interested to the end, and there's a good amount of action as well.  The protagonist is whitty and the puzzles are fun.  I'm genuinely curious about the first game in the Cameron Files series because of this installment.  Those who enjoy Adventure/P&CA games will want this in their collection.\n\nOverall, if you can get it in a bundle, or on sale, I recommend.","April 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I still have my copy on disk, but wanted to try Steams version. I am pleased to say the grapics have improved. The game plays without any hiccups are stalls.

Still regret to hvae it.\nGraphics are horrible. Voice acting (in FR) is horrible. Movement is horrible. If you love point 'n click (even good oldies) but never played this one, run. Only thing that can justify playing this game is probably some's people nostalgia.","May 21","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

By the end of it I was screaming at the screen in anger and frustration. I then resorted to online walkthroughs so that such a poor excuse for a game did not defeat me.\n\nMy main objections are below (warning there are some spoilers):\n\n1. There is no tutorial.\nI was just flung into the game and had to guess how to access the inventory and hint system. Perhaps this wasn't a problem when it was originally purchased in a box with a manual, but it's a drag now.\n\n2. Movement/backgrounds/stupid, pointless mazes.\nThe movement is your standard grid system point and click which wouldn't be so much of a problem if the backgrounds weren't so poorly rendered. This really comes into its teeth-grindingly-frustrating own when the game decides it would be fun to have a largely featureless underwater maze. They then decide to compound this misery in the final section with circular corridors.\n\n3. The hint system is more of an 'I told you so' system.\nThis includes notes in a diary which sometimes bear some relation to your predicament, sometimes don't. The latter is more often true. It leaves you completely hanging in places for no reason whatsoever.\n\n4. Progression/puzzles are too often stupid.\nWe're not talking comedy stupid, or one-off perhaps they were having a bad day stupid. We're talking criminally poorly stupid. Why when I want to access the Loch do I have to magically realise I want a garden hose? Why when I want 120ml of a substance do I have to click on a bottle clearly marked as 30ml four times? It just doesn't make sense! Once or twice you can put up with, by the end of the game I felt it was almost constant.\n\nIf you're prepared to put up with all of this then please go ahead. All I can say is that it's a good job I'm blessed with a luxuriant mane as by the end of this a more folically challenged person might have had no more hair to pull out!\n\n","July 28, 2015","false","4.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","3"

Nolstalgia is pretty much the only reason i bought it, because objectively it's a bad game. Back then and now the only real driving factor is an odd compulsion to keep playing. I seriously don't know why this game has such a strong hold over me, my best guess is that like Myst, advancing after hours of brain numming searching is spiritually rewarding. That said i can only recomend this game to people who liked Myst and wouldn't mind a more cohesive story and unfairly hidden items.\n4/10","May 13, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

This is true in this game even moreso than the majority of this genre.\n\nMovement is in the style of "The 7th Guest"\n\nPROS:\n-Fully voice acted\n\nCONS:\n-VERY dated graphics (low res is being kind)\n-Annoying movement system\n-Just randomly clicking everywhere. "Gameplay" consists of moving your mouse all over each view to see what you can interact with and clicking on it...very dull as it is not obvious what you can interact with and what you can't. (For Example: You can "look at" some of the books laying around the house, but not many others although they look identical...)\n\nThere are many better point and click games out there for fans of the genre.\nIf you aren't a fan of the genre, then skip this one for sure.","January 11, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","4","16","0","0"
