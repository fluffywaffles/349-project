The Rift is an aptly named place where everything stops in favor of a more molten theme. Many have tried to cross it, but any who have, have yet to come back. Your family has been trying for generations, with varying degrees of success, and Daniel has caught this wanderlust. Will you?\n\nGameplay\nWelcome to FRONTIERS. a game about exploring new frontiers! I can definitely see the comparisons to Morrowind and Daggerfall here, and I'll add my own, this universe is strangely reminiscent of one of my favorite series as a kid: Deltora Quest. Everything has an ethereal sense of urgency and wonder and magic.\n\nFRONTIERS sets a slow-paced lore-filled task of mainly exploring before you. You will wander from location to location, reading books, talking to inhabitants, burning firewood, ocassionaly fighting beast and man alike, and occasionaly partaking of food and drink. Skills may level through usage or by studying books, but skills take a backseat to your sightseeing, of which there is much to do. Every area feels unique, from the lay of the land, to the construction of the homes, to the color of the ground or sky or plants.\n\nOne thing this game doesn't do is hold your hand. I'm surprised the map even marks locations, or where you are currently, for that matter. You will be told to go places  without specific instructions on how to get there, or where specifically to go. You will be thrust into a world with little idea of how to interact with it. You will be tasked with surviving with no instruction on how to kill, what to kill with, or what all you can or can not eat. And for some people that's where all the fun comes from. You will be given basic instructions, though, such as that you need food, water, and to avoid the ocean. At one point I successfully asked for directions to a family friend. It's not all bad, just hit and miss. Depth is how I would sum up my experience.\n\nAll things said, it seems there's a lot beneath the surface here, with plenty of things to see.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics in FRONTIER are beautiful, for a price. You will take quite a hit to performance for maxing them out, but they will look quite nice. There's a good sense of light and dark, and things look relatively realistic. Nights are nice and dark, and light sources aren't fountains of bloom. A lot of the models look fairly realistic, but the animations could use just a little work. I can't say too much about the graphics, because they need to be experienced through playing, and also, in order to play, I had to turn them down to late 90s level quality.\n\nAudio\nThe audio in FRONTIERS is amazing. Everything and everywhere will have an exhuberant ambient sound to go with it that gives the game some real life. Some of it can be a little loud depending on the location, though, seeming a bit unrealistic. Each region has unique music, offering a nice thematic touch. The audio cues are nice, but the lack of any voice for the NPCs makes things feel slightly lonely after a while. Either way, what's there has heart and soul.\n\nConclusion\nI heavily recommend experiencing this game for yourself, even if it can be quite buggy, and is definitely still a bit early in development. It's beautiful, vast, varied and feels like it has been imbued with the heart and soul of its creator.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 5, 2015","true","8.6"," 86 of 98 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","86","98","3","2"

This game captures that wonderful essence of games from days gone by - it has that sense of wonder and really makes you want to explore the world and see what is out there. The graphics fall somewhere between Morrowind and Skyrim - certainly serviceable. I read another review that said the game is unplayable on mid-level machines. My PC is the embodiment of mid-level and it ran fine, although the frame rates need to be improved a bit - other wise I had no problems.\n\nNow for the downside. I know that this is a survival game but if I eat a loaf of bread, a sausage and a banana, should I really be  starting to get hungry less than five minutes later? Honestly, I don't mind foraging for food but in all these types of games, your character must be an insatiable, gluttonous hog-demon for all the food and water that they need. Also, by all appearances it seemed to be mild weather outside with people milling about, yet I am freezing to death in a matter of minutes and need to run to the fireplace to get warm again. There isn't a backpack or wheelbarrow big enough to get you a mile down the road for all of your "needs".  I hope that this gets tweaked - I'd like to see a survival game that actually let you explore for five minutes without your dashboard flashing red for some trivial thing that you took care of three minutes previously.\n\nThat said, I am enjoying exploring the initial town and hope to be able to get outfitted to explore further. I'd recommend this game highly to anyone who misses that good old fashioned game that doesn't hold you by the hand and doesn't feel the need to knock you over the head with contant tutorial style gameplay. I really hope this game succeeds and wish there were more like it.","December 17, 2014","true","2.3"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","68","73","0","2"

Updates every day, the developer is serious, hard working and honest.  Do not jump in right now if you expect a smooth ride since some of the mechanics are not reliable yet.  One thing is bug-free: the peculiar mood, the intriguing and well-written story, the surprising landscapes, the feeling of exploration and discovery.\n\nAs this is an early access review, I want to stress the fact that the game is not finished.  Not all the features have been implemented, and some implemented features do now work quite well.  I'm writing this on December 24th 2014, the game has been available in Early Access for about two weeks and open for beta testing for about a month.  The game has been thoroughly tested since day one.  A hundred of issues have been raised; some very minor (weird pixel on button texture), some critical (crashes); and all are being addressed by the one developer, Railboy, who's been working full time and releasing patches almost every day, often several times a day.\n\nThe result is a game that is working better and better every day.  From my point of view, it is already good.  I keep jumping into the game with the goal of breaking it and reporting a new bug, but I end up each time walking down new paths for hours, exploring new lost villages and discovering strange events.  What you can see in the trailer videos is all here already, and much more.  I have put fifty hours into the game and still haven't explored half of the continent.  I haven't finished the main quest either, and haven't tried 10 % of all these crafting recipes.  I still haven't even cast a spell (even though I did find the dark luminite to do so)!  The world is Big, in the sense that it will take you a lot of time to get to know it, and believe me, you will be lost.  Even with the maps, there are places I saw once and have never found again.\n\nFrontiers has this sandbox feel to it: you set your goal yourself and just roll with it, or you follow the story.  There is no pressure to finish the main quest.  Actually, pretty much everything is optional in this game; there is even an option for disabling survival if you do not want to bother killing bears for their meat (a very hazardous activity, believe me).  I like the main quest very much, though, because it isn't just about big epic things, it's about people, trust, friendship, vengeance, broken hopes, and what one is ready to sacrifice in order to be the first to accomplish the impossible.\n\nIn addition to the main quest, there is something about the world itself that feels...  weird.  Abnormal.  Out of place.  It is subtle but you can tell something is wrong.  I do not know yet whether it connects to the main quest, but I will definitely walk the paths of Frontiers until I find out.\n","December 24, 2014","true","67.7"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","43","46","0","0"

Unfortunately Early Access is riddled with so many games whose developers do not honor the implied code of the privelage they have been granted with infrequent updates, total lack of communication, and their own closed vision of a game that is not open to input from the community who paid to develop it.  Frontiers is not one of those games.\n\nThis is an outstanding example of how an early access game should be.  The game, although buggy, is still enjoyable and playable.  This alone does not make this a great Early Access game; what does is that the developer is in CONSTANT contact with the community regarding what he is doing and asking for input with what he should do and he is fixing problems as fast as they are being discovered all-the-while continuing the development of the game.  This does not give due credit to a scripted story of great quality uncommon to not only independant developers, but the "big-guys" alike.  What also makes this a great game is a currently small active community of players who were excited about this game since it's Greenlight on Steam.  The majority recognize that this is a work in progress with a great foundation and a committed developer and are regularly submitting their bug reports in a helpful and professional manner--not ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning about how this game is nothing like Call of Duty.\n\nThough the balancing isn't quite there yet but I'm sure will be very soon (as the Developer has stated so and let nobody down yet), this is a unique game and the first of its very specific type to the genre--a successful hybrid adventure-survival game.  As this game develops into what it's potential dictates, it will wake the sleeping point-and-click adventure enthusiasts and reel in the survivalists.  Whatsmore, if the player is only interested in one of those aspects or even if they simply want to explore without the dangers of a true survival game, they are invited and able to do so.\n\nWhatever your interests are, Frontiers has something for you.  Well, actually, it's not like Candy Crush... F!@# that game.","January 29, 2015","true","12.3"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","37","41","4","0"

It captures the feeling of exploration in a kind of Jules-Verne Journey to the Centre of the Earth (or Atlantis' frankenstein amalgomation of the above and 20'000 leagues) kind of way and is very relaxing to wander the world and see what mysteries contront you.\n\nIt's like the perfect blend of Morrowind meets Myst without the tedium of either.\n\nIt is also refreshing to show off that games don't always have to be about maiming and slaughter. That is not to say there is no element of conflict or danger in the game, but it takes a very much backseat to emphesise the scope of the world and the people around you. It is a very vast project and I do have some reservations when it comes to early-access titles, that some devs bite off more than they can chew and end up releasing the game unfinished because of time, money or sheer boredom and begin working on a 4x Strategy instead.\n\nI can see there is a passion for the genre they are trying to encapsulate here and I am feeling enthusiastic about the project. As Darth Vader would say... it's a feeling I've not felt since....\n\n\nKeep up the phenominal work guys and I cannot wait for as many people to play this that it becomes a household name to go down along with games like The Elder Scrolls, Myst, Baulder's Gate and Minecraft.","April 26, 2015","true","2.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

I was not the one responsible for most of what you'll find in the game, though [I mostly worked on sidequests and some of the books/letters you might come across]- the lead writer is Ryan A. Span, and he deserves the credit for the main storyline and most of the dialogue!)\n\nFrontiers is not just a game, but a vision.  The world of Kantvarld has many secrets tucked away for those willing to find them, but keep in mind that Frontiers is a specific type of game for a specific type of person.\n\nYou won't cut down hordes of enemies in this game- that isn't what this world has to offer. Instead, if you want *exploration* and to a degree survival (with occasional combat) then Frontiers may be for you.\n\nFrontiers is about the curiosity in each of us, and what we do with it.  If you find yourself wanting to take in your surroundings- not fighting in them, just *enjoying* them, then know that this game was made by people like you, for people like you.  If you find yourself in videogame worlds, staring far into the distance, basking in the light of the morning sun, then Frontiers is for you.  If you enjoy the challenge of mapping out the known world, including every nook, cranny and orifice, then Frontiers is, without a doubt... for you.\n\nIn Frontiers, curiosity is king.  The desire to make sense of the world (and to find your Zen in the process) is the drive that this game specifically caters to above all other things.  The game world is plenty big (around the size of Oblivion's landmass) and the brilliant soundtrack (made by the talented Steve Barnes) will carry you as far as you wish to go.\n\nIt will be a while before most of the bugs are behind us, but the framework is already here.  So if Frontiers sounds like your cup of tea- come join our community, and you might like what you find!\n\nP.S. Lars/Railboy (the lead developer) is known for his honesty and straightforward nature for a reason.  If you are worried at all about the Early Access nature of the game, just take a peek into the Community Hub and you'll find plenty of reasons to root for the guy.  And you don't have to take my word for it- see for yourself!\n\n-Matt.3","December 18, 2014","true","2.3"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","2"

It has a vast map, full of varying landscapes, and Villages with NPC's. Collect resources and live off the land, Interact with NPC's, Explore and Discover ancient ruins, FRONTIERS is a complete open-world RPG.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world RPG's, but I will stress again that it is an Early-Access Beta, so it does have bugs, and the graphics are something you would expect of a game from 2002 - 2004, not 2015. This doesn't make it a bad game, but for some who are used to the hyper-realism of todays games, the point needs to be stressed. Given the game is being created by one person, I can only imagine what it could be if it had a full team of developers and the budget of an Elder Scrolls game.

I bought Frontiers hoping that it finally might be that game.\n\nI crashed shortly after finishing the Prologue.\n\nWell, that was mightily disappointing!\n\nBut I'm still plugging away at the game, optimizing and prodding game settings until I can finally manage struggle past the post-prologue. Until then, I'll leave off by saying that this is one of the few games I've purchased since last year that has given me hope for another classic experience akin to the early Elder Scrolls games. cannot give the development team enough of my support and wish them the best in making this extremely ambitiously promising game!\n\nUPDATE!\n\nSo I made it out the area immediately after the prologue! Hooray!!!\n\nWithout spoiling the post-prologue region too much, I can tell you that already I am pleased with what I see. The environments of the game, even on lower graphics settings, still manage to inspire a tingle of excitement. You'll be treated to sweeping grasslands and sparkling seas, foreboding mountains and quaint, if slightly static, villages. Whenever I begin to wander, I am immediately reminded of when you first clambered out of that prison drainpipe in Oblivion. You are bluntly presented with the game world, which is both tantalizingly open and slightly intimidating. You are given a rough direction and a license to travel, but if you want to go off rails, you have complete freedom!\n\nMechanically, the game rides comfortably in the ruts of previous survival crafting sim trailblazers like Minecraft, but with some very pleasing additions. You can move and interact with most objects in the game with the right mouse button or by pressing the 'use' button. Some objects and even NPC's have descriptions attached to them that either give some insight into your objectives or are just a morsel of humorous fluff that fleshes out the game and gives its sometimes worlds some additional character. While that itself is probably not too amazing, I was impressed by the amount of objects with which you can interact right at the start (Note: picking up entire cabinets/tables/crates of baked bread is possible, though not advised).\n\nYou also have your basic survival meters of health, hunger, thirst, etc. Rather then plain bars that decrease over time, these needs are represent by icons that grow larger as your character's desire for them increases. Fulfilling these needs currently gives you a boost to certain stats and encourages you to make yourself as comfortable/prepared as possible before starting an arduous journey to parts unknown. I haven't investigated crafting very much, and will do so later on.\n\nStylistically, the game actually reminds me a bit of the Thief series, albeit brighter, cheerier, and significantly less claustrophobic. Yes, that is a strange comparison, and I will do my best to elaborate. The NPCs, for one, remind me so strongly of the old character models from Thief that I have began mentally referring to anyone in the game wearing face paint as a 'woodsy one'. Mind you, this isn't a criticism! I loved the look of those angular puppet people back in the day, and the character models in Frontiers much more detailed than the taffers in Thief 2 ever were. The models in Arx Fatalis might also make for a good comparison. The game also toys around with the same pseudo-medieval/early modern vibe that Thief perfected. You carry around an oil lantern, but many rooms are also lit with torches or candles. Character wear sometimes robes and tunics. while they also don long-cuffed gloves and knee boots while no doubt searching around for their heavy, leather greatcoats. While there isn't yet quite as much world building as Thief yet, no doubt it isn't far in coming.\n\nTo end this next installment succinctly, I'll just say that I still have shaken my strong sense of excitement for this game. I can't wait to dive back in as the builds get more stable and I can explore further!","January 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","3"

The bad stuff currently outweighs the good. So am I saying that you should not buy this? No thats not my verdict at this time. I say if you are a patient person and dont mind waiting a while for a polished experience and want to support the games development then buy now. The game is packed full of content and lots of areas to explore and systems to learn. Only problem with that is that half the time you have no idea where you are going or even why you are going there. This is mainly because of the map being bugged, buildings and towns dissappearing, yes thats right! locations gone and nothing there but good ol terrain. If you are lucky and the buildings are there then the quest item or person is missing. I have been playing this game for what feels like forever. I backed the game and been with it since the very first build was released. The game has improved over time but honestly I really dont think a game of this magnitude with only one person working on it can be finished without dropping some things in the game that are really not needed or just boring. I will give it to the developer, he has stuck with it and never once have I felt this guy is going to burn us and abandon the game.","February 23","true","5.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

A game like Daggerfall, which I played on DOS box, but after playing 2 hours, there are just soo many bugs in this game: items disappearing in the inventory, Books that you steal or barter don't even end up in the inventory. The world doesn't load all places and you simply sink through into nothingness. That part is very much like minecraft when digging through the bottom of the world.\nOne of the houses has an elevator and 9 out of 10 times, it lifts right through the player and it doesn't take you up. NPC's don't fight back they simply die and when you want to take their stuff, you can somehow magically still barter with them. Be careful to follow the paths or you might end up in the part of the world that doesn't yet contain any trees or cities, which makes the game look empty.\n\nOk I've revised my review. I will recommend it, since the game as a lot of potential, but just be aware that at the moment there are lots and lots of bugs. It will take them at least half a year to fix those before they should add new functionality. Hopefully the new programmer will do a lot of good.","January 13, 2015","true","7.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","9"

(A minimum of 5 minutes is required to write a review) However, I am giving it a thumbs up simply on the basis of pure honesty. You may be thinking I am crazy to do such a thing, but try to hear me out. I have been following the progress of this game for awhile now, so I can assure you that I have been sincerely interested in it since it was announced on Greenlight. But when I read a recent article about it, I was sold right then and there. The developer of Frontiers has publicly announced:\n\n"A lot of folks have told me: I'm buying this game for my kid/friend/spouse for Christmas, they love exploration games! And I say the same thing every time: DON'T!"\n"The only people who will love it are players who seek it out for themselves, because it's NOT FINISHED. Your kid/friend/spouse will just be annoyed with you. I'm proud of this game, and with everyone's help I believe it's going to be great - but it's not great yet, so in the meantime get your kid/friend/spouse Dragon Age or The Binding of Isaac or something, trust me."\n\nI must say.... How REFRESHING. I am speaking from a position of having a very bitter taste of early access nightmares on my palate. Now you may be thinking that it's a genious marketing ploy using reverse psychology, but I find this to be doubtful considering this is major revenue the developer very well may be losing, especially during the Holiday Steam sale...a very opportune time to make some excellent dough. This takes guts. The game may have a long ways to go, but I believe this incredibly responsible attitude needs to be encouraged in a selfish new era of gaming where the end product is a often a deliberate farcry from an honest game players can enjoy. Here is the original article that sold me on this:\n\nhttp://kotaku.com/dev-on-steam-warns-do-not-buy-this-game-as-a-christmas-1671913955","December 18, 2014","true","1.0"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","14","20","2","5"

Always hide options that are unnecessary in a given situation (crafting menu is horrib...erm... difficult ;) )\n\n- mood: the great open-world titles are so good because their teams had the capability and resources to spend months of development on millions of tiny details that make the world alive.  i know speech, sounds and all cannot be finished at this point but theres much to consider: npc activity, pc-character animations, "unnecessary" social interactions, tiny animals, wind, ..., ...\n\n- balance rpg vs. crafting: i suspect many folks expect a skyrim with way more interaction possibilities. dont get lost in crafting only and keep an exciting  character development in mind. for some social, stealth or combat skills are equally important in an open world that feels real.\n\ni'll keep watching :)","March 29, 2015","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If you are looking for something to start playing right away, don't buy this yet, as it will take quite some time till it is finished.\n\nPro:\n-Solid, colourfull artstyle that fits the fantasy-like setting of the world\n-Interessting landscapes to explore\n-A lot of interaction with the enviroment (you can litteraly take every object that is standing around, rearrange furniture and gather ressources\n-Many nice features of sandbox and RPG games in one package (learning-by-doing skills, plants to experiment with and alchemy, crafting, bartering and stealing etc.)\n-a unique world setting\n-not only basic needs like hunger and thirst but also temperature, endurance and diffrent damage types\n-civilitation system: being in a town or near civilization gives you buffs and encourages you to build camps to have those boosts in the wilderness too, or you will suffer from cold/heat and danger in the wilds\n\nCons:\n-many features not or semi-implemented as expected of a beta\n-no real response of the NPC's to your actions (stealing, murder, reputation)\n-crafting only has a few recipes\n-a lot of bugs and glitches (clipping, camera, the second city has a road that ends in some kind of garden area, if you drop down from it you are trapped, as the road is a floating 2D platform above ground ad you can't get back up, etc)\n-the sandbox and RPG elements seem to hinder each other sometimes (more info below)\n-no tutorial yet to explain key bindings and mechanics\n-graphic details are very low, especially NPC's, faces, animations and enviroments need a lot of work\n-very clunky interface, inventory managment is a chore, and mouse movement seems buggy in menus, especially the menus for Quests/Logs and skills are unintuitive and hard to navigate through or find information in them\n-world and story are quite short to this date\n\nThe civilization aspect is a really good idea: It gives you this feeling of an explorer, that conquers the unknown and sets up an outpost to bring the comforts of home with him. This makes building a proper, fleshed out base a worthy goal, rather then just carrying a bed with you to sleep through the night in minecraft-style.\n\nI really could see me enjoy the story, if it would lead me directly into adventure, but the current quests are more a standart RPG approach from the book of roleplaying 1O1. They have quite a nice touch to them, but they are boring if you aren't into this kind of imerrsion right at the start of the game.\n\nThe game has definetly a lot of potential, but it also needs a lot of time, maybe a half year or more, untill it will be enjoyable. And it would be very nice, when there will be a more survival focused start to the game, that seems to be in the works. The mixture of the genres is quite new and interresting, but the devs will need to balance the elements out some more or give players the decision to play either a explorer in the wilds or roleplay as a hero, because right now those two parts kind of split the fun, as you have to quest a lot without any hints when the survival and adventuring will start. Of course you could just run of into the nearest forest to set up a tent, but this just makes me feel like a kid that imagines to be a pioneer instead of actually BEING a pioneer.\n\nBut I'm sure that the devs will find a way to combine the genres and as it seems now, there will also be a free sandbox mode to play your own way in the future. I just hope that progress and update will be coming in frequently, since news are the best way to keep this game alive.","January 19, 2015","true","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","6"

I knew that buying it, but didn't want to take a $15 hit for a game that did not live up to its bold vision.\n\n3 good\n2 average\n1 bad\n\ngenre: 2\n\nopen world sandbox. My actual game play time was almost 2 hours, so i did see some of the world. It is open. You can wander off in any direction you want. That is good.\n\n\n\ncharacter, customization: 1 and 1/2\n\nyou have very limited choice in what your character looks like, and it wouldn't matter anyways since it is in first person view. There really aren't classes. Not bad. Means you can play and develop your character as you want. Can play as male or female. i believe there are skills or a perk system you can choose from. This part was passable.\n\n\n\nstory, mission, relevance: ?\n\n\n\ngameworld: 1\n\nIt claimed to be a throwback to Morrowwind, but the game reminded me of Morrowwind in no way, shape, or form. didn't see much of it. There are towns with npcs you can interact with, in a very limited way. Doesn't seem to be any wildlife in the world. At least not in the first portion of it. Nothing spectacular stood out to me, other than how incredibly ugly and distorted the npcs looked, and how generic the village environment looked. Generic at best. The reviews said it was a big and wonderful world to explore. Didn't get much of a chance to do that. What i saw was not wonderful.\n\n\n\ninnovation: 2\n\nit has some good ideas that it has borrowed from other games. Nothing wrong with that. It wants to be a survival game and has stats for hunger, thirst, and rest. It wants to be a mining game. I never got to that part. It wants to be a crafting game. Didn't get to that either. And it wants to be an exploration game. It failed miserably in this respect. The game talks big and dreams big. I applaud that. It just isn't there yet.\n\n\n\n\nmechanics, combat, saves: 1/2\n\nfor me, the only thing that would have made this game worse in this category is if it did not load at all. It loads, but it takes longer to load than my Skyrim game on the PS3 console. Once it loads, you get to the character development screen, and this was pleasant and kind of inspiring. It gives you hope that maybe it was worth the wait. Not so. As i said, the game world looks generic.\n\nI am not one of those gamers that needs a game world to look pretty as long as plays pretty, but it plays ugly. The controls are upside down. To interact with the world, you have to have things positioned perfectly. The NPCs don't seem real. And when you go out to explore, you are moving at a mind-numbing 5 to 10 fps. And that lag is the reason i requested a refund. I can not play a laggy game. I have read full pages of books and turned them faster than my first person blob moved. As for combat, the game doesn't want to be a COD stepchild, so it isn't in the front end of the game. That means i do not know anything about the combat.\n\nNot all was negative, though. The game lets you save anywhere, just as long as you have the time to wait for it to finish. The user interface that stretches out at the bottom of the screen looks nice. And it seems to give a lot of useful survival information. I think it is useful. I don't think hovering the mouse over the interface tells you what the symbols represent.\n\n\n\nreplayability: ?\n\n\n\nuniqueness: 2\n\nit is true to its claims: it is an open world exploration game with survival elements add in. I wanted a game like this and knew this was what i was getting.\n\n\n\ngraphics: 1\n\nthe wilderness doesn't look bad. The village is mediocre. The npcs are horrible. Worse than unmodded Morrowwind. Meaning, this game would have looked bad even back when Morrowwind came out. But i have no issue with this. I played and loved Daggerfall, which had god-aweful graphics. I am currently playing Darklands, which makes Daggerfall look like Witcher 3. No one would have bought this game based on the graphics, including myself.\n\n\n\n10 out of 27 or 37%. If we rate the game minus the two sections i was unable to explore, it gets a little better rating: 10 out of 21 or 47%.\n\n\n\ni guess i lied. I did do a full review. Before doing this review, i went to the game's forum and looked at some of the posts. One of the gamers had a lag problem that he was able to fix by doing some sort of fix to some sort of file. Didn't understand how he did it. So there might be a fix for the lag. As for the developer, he seems to do regular updates and is very responsive to feedback. Which makes me kind of sad that i can't approve his game at this time. If he gets everything figured out, or gets an understandable fix to the lag problem, he will have a fun but ugly exploration, crafting, survival game. When it is fun, i will not care about the graphics. And maybe i will buy it again at that time. For now, i have to get my refund so i can try out another exploration game that i passed up to play this one.\n\nConclusion: has potential, has lag. If you try it, make sure to not mess up your refund.","October 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","2"

I will try and highlight what little the game has to offer if anything and the seemingly insurmountable amount of work that will need to go into this game before being a legitmate title worth money.\n\nPros:\n-Landscape is massive.\n-Fast traveling is useful to go back and forth.\n-As of now death is impossible.\n\n\nCons:\n-Death is impossible to achieve.\n-Npc's will not attack you no matter how hard you try or how many people you murder in front of them.\n-Bought every item in the game for under 20 gold. (I seemingly started with over 150 gold.)\n-Upon reaching one of the six wonders of the world I was delighted to see that absolutely nothing was there and that the whole are in general was not even complete as most of the enviroment was floating in mid air.\n-The game's formatting is among the worst in recent time. Your computer will not be able to run this game properly no matter what GPU you have. i.e. NVIDIA, AMD.\n-Aimless exploration that offers no satisfaction or reward.\n-You have the ability to equip over 15 items on your person however no items have any stats or weight or for that matter any characterisics what so ever.\n-No customization or ability to see your character from third person.\n-Almost every interaction is bugged.\n\nI'm going to cut myself short on this con list of mine because there is no limit to the problems this game has at this time.. All I can say is that I am very disappointed in what I thought would be a promising game, and I feel mislead by the advertisment around this game. All the features you see in the trailer are either yet to be put in game or just not realized. This game has a lot of potential I will give it that, but until you can run the game at 30 fps this game literally has nothing to offer. Slow choppy animation, horrible graphics, consistant game crashes and I would be hard pressed to honestly tell you any actual piece of content this game has to offer. STAY AWAY FOR AT LEAST A YEAR. The developers have a lot of work ahead of them if they actually want to complete this project, but in my opinion based off most early access games this will be another incomplete garbage cash grab.\n","January 12, 2015","false","3.8"," 20 of 44 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","20","44","0","6"

The game needs tons of work, and is absolutely horrible to experience on the Oculus Developer Kit 2. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE EXPECTING IT TO BE PLAYABLE AS PER BEING IN THE VR SUPPORT SECTION. 5 minutes for the rest of the level to load while you can walk through the walls that haven't pooped in yet, HORRIBLE frame rates in seemingly lackluster environments, etc etc etc. I wanted this to be what steam seems to think it is, but steam this time turned out to be full of ♥♥♥♥.
