However, I definitely by no means loved this game, I don't hate it either, it's just a bit bland at the moment.\n\n(I haven't played the most recent build, but I've included edits at the end to state improvements since the first build, so take the do not recommend with consideration.)\n\nMain factors as to why I currently discourage buying this vidyagame:\n-Both the character and most enemies are sluggish movers, but you can always effortlessly dodge them (EDIT: dev has since increased the speed of certain enemies and their projectiles)\n-Most enemies just run towards you and occasionally shoot a slow moving projectile at you when in a certain proximity (may not be the case any more, dev is also adding in new enemies)\n-Bosses easily killed by spamming dynamite, which is absurdly cheap from the store. Even without it you can safely kite them with almost no risk\n-Somewhat short and easy, I beat the game on my first attempt in about half an hour without coming close to death at any point (EDIT: dev has balanced the difficulty as well as added in a hard mode and a bonus area)\n-Traps are banal and pose no threat as you can just stand in a safe spot and kill anything before it gets to you anyway (EDIT: recent updates have introduced more challenging traps)\n-Level up system and spell unlocking seems pointless as there's no NG+ or difficulty increase and stats reset after the game ends\n\nIt's worth noting that the developer(s) appears quite dilligent with their updates and responds well to feedback, updating with tweaks, fixes, etc. within a few days of release, and has continued to provide constructive and well-executed updates.\n\nI do look forward to them being able to make this game far more enjoyable, as it definitely has potential once they add in a mode/feature that provides extra replay value.","July 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 99 of 118 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","99","118","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/K3W3L/recommended/314290/","K3W3L","K3W3L","http://steamcommunity.com/id/K3W3L/","2302 products in account","There are some games that I play to have fun, to really immerse myself into the game. Then there are some games which I play with the sole purpose of getting 100% in the game relatively quickly. This game falls squarely into the latter category.\n\nObludia is a game from Slovakian developers FobTi Interactive. Apparently it's a "one-man" studio. The game was programmed in Game Maker Studio[www.desura.com] - not an entirely bad effort, but nothing special either.\n\nA game inspired by Robotron and Smash-TV, you basically descend the levels of...whatever it is you're descending...killing enemies, gaining gold that can be used to buy items from shops that appear along the way, and doing it for 50 levels total.\n\nThe main problem with this game is the amount of comparisons it gets to The Binding of Isaac, when in reality the two games can't be more different. For instance: TBOI features randomly generated dungeons while Obludia uses the same level layouts over and over again. The only "rogue-like" aspect of Obludia is the permadeath, but even permadeath can be cheated with the possibility of save slots that can be bought from shopkeepers. With the game interface also looking similar (...okay, to be honest they look rather different, but the main elements are there in their spots!) it is hard not to be reminded of TBOI, especially if you, like me, are a veteran of the latter.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what I found that I didn't quite like about this game:\nToo boring. After a while, enemies became relatively easy to dodge. Using my well-honed skills from TBOI and not long after starting this game I felt like a master already. I will say though that hard mode was a slightly better challenge.\nGraphic style seems under-developed. I don't usually like to nitpick on graphics, but, put it this way, you have people like Edmund McMillen that puts quite a decent amount of care into TBOI artwork), and Dean Dodrill, the one-man creator of Dust: An Elysian Tail. Now I'm not saying it's bad, just that it could have been better.\nAchievement progress is...screwy. If you're working on any particular achievement, you have to do it WITHOUT CLOSING THE GAME MIDWAY. The game does not actually save your progress towards the achievement. Used 9 Holy Crosses and then quit the game to take a break? Too bad. You have to start from 0 all over again.\nOther minor nitpicks include cycling through weapons in only one direction, as pointed out by another reviewer - having to go all the way through again was quite annoying.\nLastly, I cringed at the shopkeeper levels from World 2 onwards. Every world after world 1 has their own theme song. The shopkeeper has his own theme song. Guess what? At the shopkeeper, both the shop song and the world theme song are played AT THE SAME TIME! The end result was an initially funny, but later terribly grating, cacophonous discord.\nThat being said, I did like the music overall. It helped to lighten the mood, considering what I was going through.\nBoredom.\n\nMaybe...maybe I had too much expectations coming from TBOI. I don't know. But whatever it is, Obludia will most likely not last you for long. Probably a good thing considering the tedium. It really pains me to rate this down, since I desperately wanted to like it as a BOI replacement, but...there you go.\n\nWhen to buy: 8 bucks? No thanks. Trade for a bundle key/link. If you want to throw 8 bucks at a game, make it TBOI. Or, better yet, bump that up to 15 bucks and make it TBOI: Rebirth.\n\n4.5/10\n\nLike indie games?

Normal mode took me about 35-40 minutes to beat and I finished it only on my second try, plus the hard mode isn't much more difficult and you'll finish it sooner or later.\n- There's an upgrade system with points and some stats e.g. power or health, but with the game being so small and the amount of available points to use being only 4, after beeting every boss, I don't think that where you spent them will make a significant difference.\n- The 5 different locations are few and get repetitive after some replays.\n- Some times the movement of the character and enemies can get glitchy, thus leading to unnecessary deaths.\n\nRecommended to anyone that has already spent a considerable amount of time playing BoI and Hero Siege who wants to try another game like these (but a lot shorter in duration),  only if they find it in a good discount or as part of a bundle.","November 24, 2015","false","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Much like arcade classics such as Zaxxon, Sinistar, and Galaga, it’s a striking one word title that also belongs to an eventual end boss named Lord Obludia who can only be conquered by players who spend hours mastering the game’s controls. It’s the kind of title that makes me glad we don’t live in an age of quarter munching cabinets, as practice really makes perfect in this fantasy themed Smash TV-esque twin stick action game. Of course, the more recent release also means that the game trades in a retro art style for more Flash based graphics and chiptune music for a downright hokey soundscape. Still, what it lacks in presentation it makes up for gameplay, and Obludia should be on your radar if you ever spent an hour in a dimly lit room waggling a joystick.\n\nNOTE: Playtime doesn't account for time with the game spent on alternative press account.\n\nWant to read more?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/recommended/314290/","fantadidi","Fantasy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/","3018 products in account","Obludia is an old-school arcade-arena-action game. If you look at some screenshots, it might look like a rogue-lite game like The Binding of Isaac, but it is not.\n\nYou have to defeat waves of monsters through 50 levels in 5 different worlds (one boss every ten levels) using both weapons and magic. You have access to only 3 spells (you will need to buy them first, then use mana to cast them) and to a lot of weapons. Sadly, only a few of them are effective, I recommend the classic crossbow plus the machine-gun, and maybe the dynamite. The melee weapons are too dangerous because you would have to be very close to the ennemies to damage them.\n\nThere are some RPG elements, like shops (you can buy a dog that is going to fetch gold, potions are available as well as ammos, ...) and a kind of level-up : after defeating a boss, you can increase your attack, your life, your mana or your speed. You can also get some boosts or special items that will help you killing the ennemies.\n\nBoth graphics and music are nice. Regarding the difficulty of the game, I would say that it is easy on "normal" and challenging on the other one (tips : upgrade speed after the first boss because ennemies are too fast for you + use machine-gun as soon as you can, buying ammos at shops).\n\nOnce you have completed the game on both difficulties, there is almost nothing to do. You can try to get a better score to appear in the leader board, or you can try the mutli-player mode. Nevertheless, developers are listening to people and updating the game according to feedbacks, which is a good thing, and we might get more content in the future. Fun and enjoyable game, especially with a pad :)","December 27, 2014","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Obludia, however, is a Robotron-type arcade game where enemies appear from the edges of the screen and you need to keep killing them. Unfortunately, it starts out super slow on the normal difficulty level, making the first world kind of long and dull and not all that exciting. The hard difficult level corrects this, but it's *really* fast from the start. Still, it's quite a bit more enjoyable. I wasn't able to tell why I didn't like playing this game until I tried it on hard. Then I realized it's the pacing that's more glaringly wrong for my tastes on the normal difficulty.\n\nThere is a lure to this game, but it should start out faster and introduce more variety. It's an OK little thing, but it has a lot of problems.\n\nHere's a list of bugs and design derps that I came across:\n\n- The gamepad controls allow for no thumbstick dead zone, meaning that the thumbstick has a hair trigger and every thumbstick fires a little different. Mine always shoots towards east on the first shot. :(\n\n- When playing on my gamepad, the main character quickly slides south if he walks towards the east and west walls.\n\n- The audio design is not that well thought out - the game consists of hearing your arrow/gunshot sound sample, loud and never changing, over and over again until the game ends.\n\n- The weapon balancing is kind of a mess: The melee weapons aren't strong enough to warrant exposure to enemies, the pistol isn't better than the crossbow, the shotgun is way too good for all situations except once you get the Predator death disc, that is so powerful there's no reason to switch out of it!\n\n- The level name texts appear on wrong levels after a few game overs and when you die and restart, you reincarnate with the last weapon you were holding.","October 31, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You probably won't.\n\nThe aesthetics are mediocre - the art style is very reminiscent of the old-school Robotron. After playing over 45 hours of Binding of Isaac, it is a bit difficult not to think of this as a very cheap, very bland clone attempt. The music and sounds are decent, but get annoying fairly quickly. The level design doesn't really change, and the only random element seems to be the item drops from containers - which are very basic, like score multipliers, temporary attack power-ups, etc. Initially, I decided to keep this game instead of trading for it (got it in a bundle) because it looked like Binding of Isaac, however, be warned that the doorways on each side are merely spawn points for enemies. The game is linear, which is why I refer to it as a rogue-lite. You can also buy a save point when you reach the store (occurs every few levels).\n\nThe controls are basic, keyboard to move and mouse to aim/fire. You can use the number keys or mouse wheel to cycle through your weapons, however, one thing that irritated me is the one-way direction of item cycling when you use the mouse wheel - if you happen to overshoot the weapon you want, you'll have to cycle all the way back to it. The E, R, and T keys are used to activate spells (so long as you have one unlocked and enough mana), but they feel awkward when you try to press them. I recommend using a controller if you have the option. There is no tutorial, and the learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with rogue-likes and bullet/enemy dodging in particular.\n\nOverall, the gameplay falls short and feels very bland - you start off with a sword and crossbow, and certain levels have more weapons like a pistol, shotgun, minigun, etc. These are miss-able, and a few appear in the bonus levels where you must kill chickens for a higher score and some gold drops. After a set number of cleared stages, you will be brought to the store, which has the same items for sale, including: a save point, ammo for the different weapons, 3 spells, mana/health refills, and even a dog that automatically picks up gold for you. After defeating a boss, you will be given the option to upgrade your mana, health, damage, or speed by one point. I strongly suggest starting with speed, as it will allow you to move and dodge more effectively. The bosses rush you, so maxing out only strength will cause them to hug you to death.\n\nFor the achievement hunters, note that a few of the achievements seem to be broken, so obtaining 100% completion may be tricky - the discussion board has a few topics concerning this.\n\nAgain, if you have other alternatives, avoid this game in favor of those. The game is a weak time-filler at best, and I sincerely believe you have better uses of your time.\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","October 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So, you’re thinking of purchasing Obludia and you are looking for advice. Well you've come to the right place. I know my twin stick shooters, I love my twin stick shooters, and possibly could be considered the foremost authority on the genre and Obludia, being of the twin stick genre was a must buy purchase for me.\n\nLet me ask you the reader of my review one question, what part of the trailer looked "old school"? You don't have to give me your answer, I bring this up only to provoke thought, because in my opinion about .01% of it was. Everything about this game is poorly emulated "old school" all the way down to the sound! It feels and plays more like an Andriod "app" and well "apps" are far from old school.\n\nThis is more of a question for the developers because I've been wondering if they have to pay royalties to Edmund? Before going into this game I did expect some knockoffs but not to this degree! Seriously this has may have 1% of original content and most like the only reason it has seen sales. Though *DO NOT* expect rogue-like in any sense of the word. There is very little variety and they are generic.\n\nThe game feels like it lacks any forethought, balancing, or polishing, the A.I. is bland, power ups are not exciting, and the fights are not epic but on the other hand it does have some pluses too.\n\nFirst, it’s a twin stick and it almost does it well but in no way does it feel complete. Seriously this should be in early access still looking to add more content it but maybe that’s where the developers are trying to pull off the tag "old school".\n\nThe only other thing this game has going for it are the controls but there is nothing here to justify charging $10. Oh yeah, I was able to recuperate $.80 selling the Steam trading cards and I’m digging for positives now.\n\nBottom line, there is *MAYBE* $.79 to $.99 worth of content here and if this were still in early access and new content was being added, and this was really being made into an "Arcade Style Shooter" we wouldn't be having this discussion.","September 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Also a Dev that keeps in touch with the players. If you like arcade arena shooters then you have to get this game , its a no brainer and quite challenging too ! The only negative I have is with having to quit the entire game after every session , but the Dev has already indicated that he is aware of these issues .. so kudos for that :)","July 19, 2014","true","4.7"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

This was released a day earlier on the 18th. I came home on July 19th at about 11pm, only a few hours after I had been holding his hand after he died in his hospital bed at the age of 38. I remember sitting here looking at my screen and not even knowing where the ♥♥♥♥ I was and barely able to even function because it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I saw this in the store and thought wow this looks like the Binding of Isaac but way better, because I hate that game. The $9 and screenshots, unknown dev, and everything else was a red flag but I was out of my mind and said fk it and bought it. Any other time I would have waited to see user reviews. Buying this is one of the biggest mistakes and was almost as traumatizing as watching my brother-in-law take his last breath. This piece of crap should be removed from steam or have its price dropped to $2.99 at most. $9 is criminal. The controls are fine, and the gameplay is not bad, but it can be beat in under two hours, is extremely easy, and the fact that it was made by one person really shows in its dog crap indie genericness. It is about one-tenth of a game in terms of length and quality. It is not even close to being considered a releasable game and never will be.\n\n0/10, this is a direct result of steam having no quality control whatsoever.","October 11, 2014","false","4.0"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","16","0","0"
