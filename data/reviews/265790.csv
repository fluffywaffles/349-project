(The backgrounds are usually ok, however)\nYou'll likely get stuck figuring out where to go next a few times.\nPossibly not the most intuitive swiming system ever.\nAll in all, it's well worth its value and deserving of a play or two. I did manage to finish it twice (as far as I have found out, there are at least two endings and i wanted to see them both), and I can honestly say I wouldn't consider the time as wasted.\n\nIt certaintly is a peculiar game, and will feel frustrating at times (damn grappling hook...), but I have no double thoughts on reccomending it.","October 5, 2014","true","3.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

If you like story driven games with a genuine human element you should pick this up.\nIn Residue you mostly play as three different characters with different abilities: an athletic young boy, an old man with a flashlight and a middle-aged man with a grappling hook. All these characters interact and interweave with each other in very interesting ways, in both gameplay and story. I'm being intentionally vague about the story because I think it's good to approach this game with a clean slate - but it all revolves around a real horribly polluted lake in Asia.  The story is confusing at times but everything comes together beautifully at the end. The story is what will keep you playing because the gameplay is nothing special, and when you're stuck as the old man it can become boring - the other characters offer some nice platforming. The graphics aren't breathtaking or unique but they fit the atmosphere of the game perfectly. The voice acting is pretty solid throughout and the music is spot on. The game is short but I don't hold that against it, it tells its story concisely and effectively, without any padding or fluff.","April 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The game doesn't have one of those boring tutorials, but instead relies on simple, intuitive puzzles to get you started. It will also pique your curiosity until you absolutely have to find out what's going on.\n\nDon't be fooled by the apparently slow pace of the game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WidescreenRules/recommended/265790/","WidescreenRules","WidescreenRules","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WidescreenRules/","512 products in account","I'm struggling with how to rate this one. This game has a lot of bad things within, but untapped potential is definitely there.\n\nThe art direction is fine. In fact, the backgrounds are much more detailed than they initially let on. Rust, age, damage, the wear of passing time and weather -- the backgrounds show all of these factors and are quite impressive. The story and location are very intriguing. In fact, the story was the only thing that really kept me going.\n\nThe gameplay has potential, but its execution is not good at all. Each character has a special ability - flashlight, grapling hook, or acrobatics - but the ways they're used are odd and feel forced. Physics for the grapling hook are horrible. And some areas give you no clue as to where you need to go. One area in particular forced me to look up a YouTube playthrough.\n\nThe story, as intriguing as it was, has a very confusing ending. I can't say why without spoiling it; but the inconsistency between the ending, how the ending happens, and how the characters behave all come together to result in a jumbled, confused mess. The voice acting ranges from well done for some characters to abysmal for others. I was thrilled when one doomed character had nothing else to say because the voice acting was so wooden and monotone. Some of the dialog was horrible as well.\n\nEven with those negatives, I don't reget buying this game; so I'm giving this a thumbs up but with a lot of caveats. "Residue" has a ton of potential but it never follows through. I didn't find myself wishing for the game to end as soon as possible like I did with "They Breathe", (I know, I'm in the minority on that one.) The story, minus the incredibly confusing ending, had me hooked throughout the game. If The Working Parts can make another game with a similarly intriguing story and location while cleaning up the gameplay and finding better voice actors, I think that game could do very well. "Residue" let enough potential sneak through that I want to see what The Working Parts gives us next.","August 20, 2015","true","3.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

It's very atmospheric, having a nice sound track and a unique art style.\n\nI've read briefly about the environmental disaster at Aral Sea before, and it serves as a lesson that human actions can have catastrophic consequences. It's very admirable that the developer is raising awareness about it. For that reason alone, I would recommend playing this game.\n\nNow just for some nitpicking. While the game has a unique aesthetic, the animation is plain horrible. The art also blends everything together, which makes it sometimes hard to tell where solid walls and ledges are. One of the character you control is an old man, which makes sense that he can only walk slowly, but it's not very fun gameplay-wise. Not to spoil the ending, but I don't think that's how physics and biology work.","December 26, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Developer seems cool, but this game just isn't good. You play 3 single characters that only do 1 thing all game, 2 of which don't work well. The old guy moves super slow, and the grappling hook guy doesn't work half the time or you have to grapple something you can't see. The art is ok, but the voice acting is terrible, and the character development and dialogue make no sense at all for how humans actually act. Lips don't mimic speaking. The story is about some sunken shipyard and saving your mom who's stuck at the bottom of the river, at a pressure that would kill someone anyways. (spoiler:but not really) Even though she is under there for the entire game, and like 2 hours, she somehow survives without mouth to mouth or anything, even though humans can hold their breath for like 2-3 min. The story is furthered by notes and there is some jib-jab about a crash or poisoning or something, but is convoluted and just not interesting enough. The game has a terrible case of not letting you know where to go, as many people have pointed out, and you get stuck often. Usually its like "oh I didn't know I could do that/that looked like it was in the background/there are 20 ways to go, do I go backward or forward?". Also I found numerous bugs where something that was supposed to happen didn't for no apparent reason, or because I didn't do some innocuous thing that doesn't make sense and I shouldn't know I had to do. Also, sometimes someone just got stuck or someone bugged backward to a part they weren't supposed to be. All the bugs needed a restart to fix.

The quest to bring back the lost water that comes to consume the efforts of several people who are driven to try and return what is gone.\n\nAnd in the sense of storyline and lore, and the immersive quality of its soundtrack and the distinctive voices of the characters, Residue is fantastic. In terms of actual gameplay though, it can be a bit rough... as a platformer some of the areas leave a bit to be desired, and the swimming is odd, but it's well checkpointed and doesn't really punish you for failure unless you miss the chance to torment some seagulls for achievements. Each of the characters moves quite uniquely (don't expect the old man to go bounding around the landscape for example) which makes for varied play. And the game isn't really long enough for any of its faults to get really grating, and it's regularly switching characters and throwing bits of lore at you which keeps things moving.\n\nDon't expect a tight platforming experience.

I really wanted to like the story, as it's told in a very low-key and off-kilter sort of way, but the platforming is pretty awful (it's generally linear, but it's not always clear which way you can actually go, thus leading to a lot of random jumping and action-button spamming in the hopes you get lucky). Of the three "main" characters you control, one of them is basically the Out of This World guy without a gun, one of them has a grappling hook that's responsible for most of the "welp, time to start guessing randomly" moments, and one is quite likely the single most irritating-to-play-as character in the history of platformers - an old fart who has no run, no jump, and lurches about the screen at a snail's pace, leaving me thoroughly disinclined to explore the maps because the thought of having to backtrack at 5 miles an hour was just THAT off-putting.\n\nMoreover, the voice-acting is simply AWFUL - the actress who plays Ostrovska sounds like the most bored person in the history of ennui, and to actually submit these lines as a "finished product" is utterly contemptuous to the devs (who, in turn, are utterly contemptuous of their paying customers for either not immediately demanding a re-take or finding a new actress who actually knows what she's doing). I've heard some bad, bad voice acting, but at least the vast majority of bad voice actors are TRYING.\n\nIt's a neat idea, and I think it'd work well as a non-interactive movie.

Litteraly none, no sound sliders, fullscreen, resolution,nothing.\nThen, there is the fact that inside buildings, the game just becomes a tanker and drops to less than 5 fps, even though the rest runs at 30+. No idea why.\nYou use controls for moving, but the feel you get from it is not good.\nAnd the voice acting, while it is decent, the voice of the child makes my ears bleed.\n\nOverall, the game does nothing to make you want to play it, hell, i have to play it more for a video and I don't want to!\nIt pains me to write this, but no. I would not recommend this. Even for this price.","August 2, 2014","false","0.6"," 12 of 45 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","12","45","0","0"

It's too bad because watching the video the game seemed really promising.    I would definately play another game from this developer, unfortunately I just can't recommend this one.","June 7, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Still, I found it enjoyable.","September 6, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are not too bad, but it is sometimes unclear where to go next. Overall, a great experience.","March 11","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
