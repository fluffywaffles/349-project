Taking control of a selection of captive zoo creatures, you are let loose in a map of helpless humans and buildings, free to wreak as much havoc as possible until the bell rings. The idea is outrageous, and for a few minutes actually entertaining, but after a single level Zoo Rampage has already demonstrated to you the entirety of what it is: a shallow, admittedly amusing up to a (very brief) point, game with a serious shortage of content and objectives. Even had it been loaded with levels and modes, the core of its gameplay is so simple that it would ultimately be for naught to try and extend an experience that has already grown stale.\n\nThere's really nothing more I can say about Zoo Rampage, so extreme is its curtness that you can see absolutely everything it has to offer in a matter of minutes. It would be a hard sell at a dollar, its only real draw being a silly thing to turn on for a few moments when you have some friends around, but at ten times that it's a sad joke that I desperately hope people do not buy into. Zoo Rampage couldn't fill the average demo, let alone sustain itself as a full retail product.","July 11, 2014","false","1.7"," 63 of 88 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","63","88","0","2"

And giraffes!? I love giraffes, and trampling over the poor souls of those I imagined looking at me with wide eyes was amusing to say the least.\n\nWhat more, Zoo Rampage has 45 achievements, all seemingly possible to attain, however, moving through each level is neccesary for those achievement hunters.\n\nI've put nearly two hours into Zoo Rampage and have only been able to play two of the seven levels. A set amount of points is neccesary to pass each level, and each time I played, it seemed I would be just under the requirement. Granted, the game does have the option for local co-op, which would probably make things easier, however, I have no real life friends.\n\nThe developers recently updated the game, making it more difficult, as players were reporting that it was too easy upon its release. It's no longer easy. It's damn hard. A difficulty setting would surely cure this ailment and keep more people playing beyond an hour or so.\n\nIt pains me to give Zoo Rampage the big fat thumbs down because it had it's moments. It was fun while it lasted, but Zoo Rampage became to frustrating, and I just gave up.","January 5, 2015","false","1.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

After playing countless hours of both Zoo Tycoons and Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, the best part of the entire experience was when I set my animals free in my 100%-ishly built park and let them demolish it to dust (also eat the visitors in JPOG and get a Game Over mere minutes after completing the very same park, lol).\nThis game is incredibly epic, but it could use some (MUCH) more content and if you look at the price tag, you'll understand what I mean. There's just so much potential in it I don't even know where to begin (tons of more maps, animals, game mods, leaderboards, online functions, Freakin' Dinosaurs like in good old Zoo Tycoon (2) and the list goes on).\nI really hope that it'll eventually get more content, otherwise it won't entertain you for too long as the entire game can be completed in less than an hour and with a single playthrough you can get almost every achievements.\nThat aside I really like the concept and it's arcade-ish feel, but I played flash games longer than this one.\n\nI recommend to everyone who are reading this to wait for a discount and Dear Developers, be sure to expand the experience! :)","July 16, 2014","true","2.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You pick an animal and cause as much damage as possible.  Score enough points and you can move on to the next map (there are about 7 if memory serves).  While there are different animals to play as on each map, the overall gameplay felt empty and just wasn't fun.  I'm sorry to say it, but my Android phone has games on it that are both cheaper and more in-depth than this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmcMCvRJo_w","October 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can basically destroy everything in the scene in that minute, or at least most of the destructables, but you have to play the levels over and over again until you get a high enough score.  The satisfaction of destroying a few buildings is removed when you have to repeat yourself like that.  There's even a thread in the discussion area of people trying to build strategies on how to pass the first level, it took me quite a few tries to get past it.  The novelty of smashing wears off quick.\n\nWhat would be more enjoyable, is if the levels were huge.  Maybe like an entire Zoo, or small town?  The destruction and chaos would be a bit more of a thrill if there was more exploration to it, but I understand you only have so big of a viewing window to work with and with 4 players on screen this is pretty much all you can expect.  You will have just as much fun looking at screenshots than actually playing.\n\nSo I don't know what the game needs exactly, but it's not game of the year.  For the price, it's a high quality piece of work and if you plan on playing it with friends you guys are going to have a blast 60 seconds at a time.  Have fun.","December 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Maybe with some changes it will make you invest more time in it, but now it is good only if you play it twice a year.\nThe good part is that it have trading cards if you go for badges or booster packs\nl.e:Since my review they have made 2 patches(fixing various bugs and improving controller support) and lowered the price for it.They are working on it and if they will add new content to the game I would change my review to positive one.","July 15, 2014","false","5.5"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

There are only 5 levels and 3 or 4 bonus ones and that's it, and while playing them I unlocked 70% of the achievements. It is extremely repetitive, you get to play with around a dozen different animals, but every animal plays exactly the same: move with the directional pad and press A to attack. You storm around wrecking everything on your path to get a high score. No challenges, no powerups, no unlockables, nothing. Animations are wonky and human AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they keep getting stuck everywere. Physics are nuts, having a snake sending a car flying by headbutting it and the such. Multiplayer is only local.\n\nAs probably most of the other reviewers here did, I got my key for free from Who's Gaming Now, so I am not complaining about the price in my particular case... but those paying 10€ for this will be extremely annoyed and surely feel scammed after finishing everything this game has to offer in barely 30 minutes. It's ok if you get it in a bundle or for like 2€, but it is not worth its price tag. I have played better and way more fun phone apps for less than one buck. Obviosly this is a game to enjoy with friends having some silly time along with Singstar, but never for this price.","July 11, 2014","false","0.4"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

At the start there was a nice satisfaction of letting an animal run loose and causing mayhem, that novelty soon wears off though.\n","July 18, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

It doesn't even have the depth of a $0.99 phone app, let alone a $10 game. The game round is only 2 minutes, yet within 30 seconds the appeal wears off. There is a lot that could be done to improve it, but whether the developer does or not remains to be seen. I would definitely pass.
