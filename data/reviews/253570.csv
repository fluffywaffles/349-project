"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/253570/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Right out of the gate Gentlemen boxes itself in a corner. A local multiplayer only brawler, it requires a group (preferably of four) to crowd around the computer to even be able to play the game, which obviously alienates a good chunk of potential players. Assuming you can round up some friends however it's hard to imagine spending much time with these dapper little maniacs, as the amount of content is nowhere near enough to sustain more than a handful of minutes of play, and with the work some will likely have to do to get enough players I couldn't recommend it over any one of the many more compelling options available.\n\nGameplay falls somewhere between Super Smash Bros. and VVVVV, as you flip your way around the arenas collection weapons and trying to rack up the requisite number of kills first. That's really all there is to the game, as options are barebones and the different modes do little to switch up the experience (most do nothing but change which weapons are available to use). All of the gentlemen and ladies play the same and are just cosmetically different to be distinguishable from one another amid the chaos of everyone jumping and shooting at once.\n\nTruth be told I did actually have some fun do to the inherent insanity that breeds a certain level of comedy when no one understands what happened, but it was very short lived and considering both the price and prerequisite of gathering and keeping entertained several other people to play, I cannot advise others pick it up. Were the price significantly lower it would be a harder call, but at $10 with only about a dozen arenas, simply drawn and repetitive artwork (one character is barely more than a color swap), and gameplay that looses its charm after you learn how to play, I can't see anyone getting their moneys worth out of Gentlemen!\n\nNine out of ten suave tea drinking gents agree it's not worth it.","December 30, 2013","false","1.4"," 73 of 102 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","73","102","3","4"

And you know what?\n\nWe had a lot of fun.\n\nNo online multiplayer and no bots- these are two very common complaints. Having played the game, though, I realize that neither is a good fit for the game. It's too quick and frantic for bots, and being killed by bots would be infuriating. It would be like playing Mario Party with bots- not really fun, just annoying no matter what level they're on. Online multiplayer could work, but it's more of that "party game" feel, where yelling at your friends and swearing is a huge part of the fun.\n\nThe only other complaints I've heard are these:\n\nNot a lot of variety- True. It doesn't have the variety of gameplay that Super Smash Brothers might, but it's also much less expensive. You won't clock in as many hours here, but you'll get a couple.\n\nNo Quit Button- legitimate complaint, but is fixed now.\n\nConclusion- I got this in a bundle, and it easily was the best game of the bunch. If you like local multiplayer and frantic gameplay, this one's worth buying on a sale or in a bundle, and even full price, I doubt you'll be disappointed. Get some USB controllers and a couple friends that you don't mind swearing like a sailor with.","October 12, 2014","true","2.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omnias/recommended/253570/","Omnias","Omniportance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omnias/","845 products in account","I bought this game because I had it on iOS. I have not seen any explanation for negative reviews, so I will put in my own input:\n\nPROS:\n\nController Support\nLocal Multiplayer\nUnique Fighting Style\n\nCons:\n\nBlack Border around Map\nAmbiguous Quit Option\n\nOverall, just like the iOS one, I think this is a great game. It is witty, fast paced, and allows for up to 4 players for an all out brawl. Unfortunately, it is distracting how levels are surrounded by a large black border, but I am testing this on a 3:2 ratio screen so it may vary on a 16:9 screen, in whcih case I will update the review if it turns out to be different. I do think that automatic scaling of levels would be in order though, and level editors would be nice too.\n\nAs there are very few games with local coop, and even fewer with controller support, this stands out as a great option for those Steam-Machine Users, but it also supports 4 players on a single keyboard, albeit it is a little strange.\n\nThis gives you a Smash Bros feel but in a rather different manner, You may find that the pigeon is useful for beginners with its homing ability, whereas other weapons like the knife are a very potent and accurate weapon. I am writing this reveiw based off of past experience with the game, and it does run at native 2160x1440 resolution at max graphics at 48-60fps on an i3-4010Y, which is very impressive optimization. Of course, the graphics are simple but clean.\n\nI highly recommend this game, but if you have hesitations about this game due to other reviews that are not written, check out the iOS reviews and other game website reviews for this. I grabbed this at a 75% off sale making it a great value, the value at full price is gonna be more dependent on whether you have freinds to play with, as this is a solely multiplayer game.","April 14, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leftbrainrightbrain/recommended/253570/","leftbrainrightbrain","Simple Reflexes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leftbrainrightbrain/","68 products in account","'Gentlemen!' has a lot of potential, I presonally love brawler games. But there are multiple problems plaguing gentlemen's gameplay:\nFirstly, many brawler games are enjoyed on consoles, but this one is solely designed for keyboard, now 4 people cramming there faces onto one screen ain't fun, and if you are lucky enough to own 4 individual keyboards and a USB Hub, you may enjoy this, but for me, 4 pairs of hands on one keyboard ain't fun.\nAnother problem is the lack of a Singleplayer ability, or atleast AI or the Computer to fill in the spot of missing players. I'm alone at home alot and I wanted to play this game, but my only choice is to play against myself, which isn't really fun.\nIf you're lucky enough to have 2-4 friends who like brawler games and atleast 2 keyboards, there's the problem with the gameplay.\nUnlike other brawlers, this one has no health bars, it's one hit KO. There's no 'hit him alot and he'll rocketship into the void', infact there's no void at all, an enclosed area. Then without the health bars, the game gets really easy to gain the number of kills needed. Then there's the over-powered weapons, the Pigeon, once you get it, that's it, the opponents are done for. The Pigeon is a weapon that follows it's opponent around until it finally reaches it's target, at which time it explodes and kills the opponent. Think of that, but an infinite supply. Yeah.\nI do aknowledge there are a variety of gamemodes, so that's a good thing.\nAnother thing is that this game is about gentlemen with facial hair, but the theme has no effect on the gameplay. It's just there. Hell, it could be butt-people and poo-men in crapland brawler and it would be the exact same game. The game should be unique, with special mustache abilities, or special attacks for each character and unlockables, but instead is a lousily finished brawler.\n\nUnless you insist, try to stay away from that buy button, or buy it when there's a sale. Definitely not worth the money.\n\nI will update this review as the game gets updated, but it seems the developers have thrown this aside as a side project.\n","June 16, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The mostly negative reviews are entirely undeserved.\n\nThe negative reviews seems to be based solely on having no single player or online multiplayer gameplay. Tough - this is a local multiplayer game - don't buy it if you don't play local multiplayer games. Idiots. Get gamepads as well. All of this whining about sitting around a keyboard. Don't review a game poorly because you were too stupid to figure out what it was before you bought it.\n\nThat being said this game is not without issues. It can get repetitive and some of the weapons have balancing issues.\n\nNon-the-less this game can be fun.\n\nIt is worth a buy if you can get it 50% off, otherwise the price tag is a tad steep.\n\nPay no heed to the "mostly negative reviews" rating, watch the trailer and read some reviews. Unless you don't want a local multiplayer game. I mean really people, that is like me posting a negative review for an RPG because it isn't an FPS.

What am I, some kind of human being?  There are a number of reviews that point out some of the issues with this game - Lack of AI nonwithstanding, the  UI is pretty bare-bones, there's not too many maps or options, and there's missed oppertunities for more character.  I really dig the old-timey fisticuffs sort of vibe the devs are going for, so go whole-hog on it.  Give me some character backstory blurbs, or some inventive prose on the win screens, or something.  I want handlebar-moustache boomerangs or monocles that shoot lasers or some other equally over-the-top stuff.  The weapon selection could be beefed up a tiny bit.\n\nI am giving this game the ol' thumbs-up because: this game because:  Local multiplayer should be encouraged in general, and if I had had this exact game when I was 9 years old it would have been the ♥♥♥♥.
