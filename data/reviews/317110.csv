It's a shame to, since beneath the bloody, bruised, scarred surface, there's a gaming masterpiece hidden away!\n\nConfused yet? Let me explain.\n\nThis game dates back to 2005 (ish) and was released in Asia at that time. It was successful enough there to warrant a NA/EU release several years later around 2010. This is still the same game engine, so short of some localization work, if the graphics look dated, there's a reason for it.\n\nThat part isn't the tragic tale though. This game was able to pride itself on it's behind the scenes mechanics; player economy, crafting, PvP, skills, trading and sailing are all well thought out in depth.\n\nWhen this game was released, nations mattered. Each playable nation was as powerful and influential as the sum of its players. Ports would only open up after a nation had enough influence in the area... and the game world is HUGE. And this actually mattered to the player. Want to craft cannons? Hopefully your nation is in good relations with the port that sells iron!\n\nThen, a couple years later, dungeons were introduced for those claiming there was nothing to do in terms of the "Adventure" skill set. Of course dungeons have rewards, and those came in the form of rare exotic goods that can be sold for huge profits and a lot of experience.\n\nIf you're wondering what dungeons and their loot (and money/exp bonuses) are doing in a game that's supposed to be about sailing, exploration and piracy, you're not alone.\n\nNetmarble was the publisher at the time and when people started to complain about side-lining all other skills and activities for dungeon-running, the most profitable and least risky, their answer was to increase the number of gold for sale in the cash shop!?\n\nRight about that same time, the CEO of Netmarble was arrested for some in-game currency selling scheme he and another employee were suspected of. At worst, it means the game's publisher had a CEO that was readily willing to find ways to profit off of the in-game currency, which was now reaching the ridiculous billion ducat (in-game-dollar) amount, surpassing anything the banks in the game were designed to handle. At best, it meant Netmarble was too preoccupied with the legal hassle to care about the game one way or another. So Uncharted Waters Online suffered either from active abuse or pure neglect.\n\nOGPlanet then took it over a couple years down the road. I think the term, "Too little, too late" readily applies to the current state of the game and anything OGPlanet has done/intends to do.\n\nThis game was about the individual player finding ways to help their nation beat other nations in economic struggles, much like history shows occurred in the period the game portrays. THIS was the draw of this game; the active involvement of players in a part of global history. Due to abuses, exploits and neglect that went unchecked for years, this major feature of the game has gotten lost under the muck that's become the game's current state.\n\nThe final nail in this game's coffin comes at the ease of the solution to all of this, that OGPlanet will not budge on; starting a new server. Given the high-end money-sinks they plan to implement and the in-game profits they plan on managing better, a new server would be the breath of fresh air this game needs. They've made it very clear, however, that they don't plan on doing this.\n\nRight now, if you're a new player, that 15,000 Ducat profit you made on a successful trade run will never amount to anything approachable to the 750,000 you can gain by spamming the starter level dungeon in half the time it took to make the one trade run.\n\nThis game is broken, period. After 4 years of it's NA lifespan, nothing worthwhile has ever been done to fix that. New players will come and go, few will actually stay; my friend's list is proof of that as it's filled with nothing but inactive players from years past.\n\nUnless you hear of a new server starting, or a reset coming, avoid the heartache of playing this game. The drama this game has seen in its life will cause most dedicated gamers nightmares!\n\nUpdate:\n\nThe problem, this game has in its current state (and I'll add this so people know this is still an updated review) is that the numbers don't add up.\n\nYou can enjoy this game for the first 30 or so levels of a skill, before you get an advanced skill such as shipbuilding or spice trading. The game's fun and everything seems well balanced. Advance past the "school" tutorial though and the game takes a drastic turn for the worst.\n\nThe more advanced, in-game methods for earning money still don't add up to the prices players sell their crafted items for. When you do a real time, 2 hour trade run to earn about 2-3 million ducats and find a simple accessory for your ship, that only adds 1 or 2 points above what the $50,000 ducat NPC equivalent costs, will run about 10 million ducats... the game is broken.\n\nWhen player made items are STILL selling for the billion ducat range and the above-mentioned methods of in-game earning only net a couple million at a time, providing you don't get attacked by NPC and player pirates, catch fire, infested by rats, etc... the game is broken.\n\nThere's no out-flow of player money. There are plenty of ways to make it, but few ways to spend it that allow it to actually leave the game. The same money that flooded and crashed the game's economy is still floating around the game. There are no... or not nearly enough... in-game expenses to remove this. Ammo, crew, food, repairs, all cost a certain amount, but they don't cost millions to replace, only a few thousand.\n\nThis game literally had BILLIONAIRES coming out of the woodwork when they screwed the pooch with dungeons and EA goods. Since then, neither Netmarble nor OGPlanet have done anything to actively remove this extra money form the game. They've "nerfed" the source of the income, but the money still exists. With that money being in game, prices will still be FUBAR... as demonstrated in the player bazaars.\n\nAlthough it's an open-world game, it's still an MMO. MMOs need goals and right now, this game destroyed those. A new player starting out will never, ever, in any realms of Hell, have any chance of ever being on the same playing field as the 5+ year vets who abused the system in the past. That right there, spells the death on an MMO. As I mentioned and others have confirmd, the early levels sees a large group of active players, but those numbers slow down as the levels get higher... once people realize the cards are stacked against them.\n\nI'm saying this as a warning for anyone willing to try this game for the first time: you will not last. Don't let the first few days in-game fool you. You will never be able to compete with the players who took advantage of the broken system years ago.\n\nOther than that, yes, the game has some incredible details. That's what drew me in and had me playing for 2 years initially. The days, ocean swells, storms, random events, skills, etc. all suck you in while you're doing something that would be boring in most other games. Catching a rare fish while sailing to South America, for instance. Being right outside of port and getting caught in a major storm. Having your ship suffer from plague, get infested with rats and cacth fire twice as you pass the Straits of Magellan is an experience you NEED to experience in this game. Other games just don't even comapre with this level of realism and authenticity.\n\nThe game had everything going for it, but its management ruined it all. It causes actual pain for me to think about this potentially great game... and it's tragic downfall. It's the game all MMOs should strive to be, but greed got in the way.","October 7, 2014","false","0.6"," 973 of 1,113 people (87%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","87","973","1","44","52"

The large open world with countless ports to explore and trade at, the many types of ship to sail, and the deep storyline blending historical accuracy with fantasy is very well done. This is no surprise coming from KOEI who are well known for their deep simulations and stories.\n\nThe graphics, while dated, serve the game well and each port has a recognizable flavor to it. With many job titles across three archetypes (adventure, trade, and combat) and skill trees for all three, players have great flexibility in how to customize their characters to suit their own playstyle. Many games make this claim, UWO is one of the few to actually back it up with ample content for all career paths, and the game experience does not culminate in endless repetetive pvp. I would give four stars, not five, witholding one for some unclear writing and a cumbersome system for helping others with quests.\n\nThe playerbase in my experience has been mature, polite and helpful, and the premium content shop is not game breaking. This is not a pay to win game.\n\nHowever, the inclusion of Nprotect GameGuard singlehandedly trumps any and all good points of the actual game (and there are many!) Gameguard advertises itself as an anti-cheat software, but installs itself as a rootkit. You are required to disable any antivirus software, because  gameguard behaves exactly as a virus. This leaves you with no protection while playing an online game, and is unacceptable from a security and common sense view. Even if it worked as intended, this would be unacceptable, but looking over the complaints on the forum make it clear this software does far too much harm, and any claims of it doing any good ar eimpossible to prove. Is the game free of cheaters because of gameguard? Or is it free of cheaters because it is an old game with dated graphics and requires  a reasonable intelligence and attention span to play? Finally, uninstalling the game will NOT remove gameguard, this requires manual removal, instructions can be found via google.\n\nPros:\nDecent graphics, music and atmosphere.\nRich world, dialogue and flavor text, quests have actual storylines to them.\nActual content for all play styles, not merely a pvp funnel.\nLong voyages actually feel like long voyages (This can be good or bad)\nA freemium game that is NOT pay to win!\n\nCons:\nUnable to walk around your ship\nInstalls rootkit on your computer.\nCustomer support has been all but abandoned.\n\nBottom line: If it ever removes the rootkit, its absolutely worth playing. Until then, avoid like the plague.","January 25, 2015","false","374.5"," 192 of 219 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","192","219","4","6"

Doing anything takes awhile since sailing is serious business. That said, I love it! The graphics are terrible, the music is repetitive, the on-the-ground combat is probably the worst I've ever seen, and yet I keep double clicking that UWO icon on my desktop.\n\nThe community, for the most part, is better than any mmo I can remember. They're a mature bunch, most seem to be adults, because uwo really isnt a game for children. It takes patience and planning to get ahead.\n\nship to ship combat is simple but satisfying. The trading system is, again, simple but satisfying as well.\n\nI rate the game 7/10, but in my heart it gets a 10 because I think I've found a new home ^^","July 9, 2015","true","80.5"," 85 of 93 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","85","93","10","4"

I'll get right down to what I like and don't like.\n\nPros:\n\n- The three classes (adventurer, soldier, trader) are distinct, with their own unique abilities. Further, the subclasses (jobs) that you can choose from promote skills, which encourages finding your niche and working on it. This makes for a good sense of progression, character uniqueness and a broad selection of playstyles. For combat there is naval and land, ranged and melee; and adventurers have a range of playstyles, from collecting data around the world, to hunting down shipwrecks, and going on long voyages to make discoveries. Apart from freeform gameplay, there are also semi-randomised quests.\n\n-  The world is vast and there's a lot to see. You won't see all the content for hundreds of hours of gameplay. It's not derivative, either - it's awesome when you unlock a new part of the world to explore.\n\n- So many different ways to play. There's something for everyone. Adventuring is about long voyages, discoveries and treasure-hunting; maritime and land battles have some options and depth to them; trading is for more patient money-hoarding players with good knowledge of the trade lanes and goods, as well as inventory management.\n\n- Plenty of depth in the gameplay, you're always learning more tricks of the trade such as which consumables you're going to need to combat events at sea, or you can pick up skills to do that, or even set an aide to do it for you if they have the appropriate skills. You have many options in character-building and higher levels open up more possibilities.\n\nCons:\n\n- The grind. Yeah, getting to the ''endgame'' (top-of-the-line ship and most advanced class) will take many, many hours. Although in this case, it's more about the journey than the destination. This isn't the type of game where you have to be endgame to get access to the worthwhile content.\n\n- The tutorials take hours. Seriously, you're looking at 10+ hours to get through all the schools. You don't have to, and you can go your own way at any time and come back later. Still, they are worth doing for the rewards despite the backtracking and awkward dialogue.\n\n- Documentation is poor. A lot of things in the game are not self-explanatory, and you won't find written help ingame. I've played for dozens of hours and I still couldn't tell you all the differences between Recog, Search and Observe skills. The good news is, it's not necessary to know every game mechanic. You pick whatever playstyle you want and you learn as you go. Also, the ingame community is very friendly and helpful.\n\n- Pay2Win elements. I'm not all that qualified to explain this since I don't play competitively, but there is at least one item that gives you an advantage over other players in the open seas (which are pvp zones): 30% speed boosters. That's huge, and I suspect it can be used to allow even the most sluggish pirate to hunt down even the speedist newb player. Sounds like a doozy. Thankfully, you can chart a course that takes you far from the major sealanes and the coast, for a good chance of avoing player pirates. Still, items like that are disconcerting. Also, buying a monthly subscription (about 15 dollars. Or Euros... hm...) gives you a fat paycheck in ingame currency. I don't know whether to put this under pay2win or not, but I guess if you're seeking pvp, yeah it would allow the subscribed player to get expensive gear sooner.\n\nSo in my experience, UWO is great if you're after a PVE experience with a Renaissance maritime flavor. I know you don't get many options for that rubric, but it's good. I can't vouch for the pvp however, and you should be prepared for a long (if not steep) learning curve.","September 24, 2015","true","463.1"," 69 of 71 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","69","71","0","0"

Happily, new masters, OGPlanet have fixed this, and have presided over the renaissence of this game, including it's launch on Steam, which has seen a resurgence in player numbers, with many new folk (such as myself) joining the game of late. Problems relating to dungeons are gone and everything is a lot more balanced and fair.\n\nRight, on to the actual gameplay: one word - DEEP. This is an extremely detailed, almost dense game. Think EVE on the sea if you want an analogy. It's slower-paced and more thoughtful than your average "kill 10 boars, then kill 20 bats" type of MMORPG. There are 3 main skill tree branches under classes for Adventuring, Trading and Maritime (soldier) You can have skills from each. You are not restricted to only trading if you choose merchant at character creation, for example.\n\nThe Trading aspect is deep and complex, incorporating an excellent crafting system where you can make products from raw materials; make sausages, ham and leather from pigs, tailor your own clothes, design and build your own ship etc.\n\nThe Adventuring aspect is all about exploration and discovery, incorporating a complete world map where undiscovered cities are added as you discover them. Hunt for treasure in dungeons and ruins, dig up artifacts, indentify new species of animal. There's too many things to list here.\n\nThe Maritime aspect is where it falls down a bit in my opinion. It's basically the same as other naval or pirate MMOs such as Voyage Century Online and Pirates of the Burning Sea. It's fun, sure, but it's not really my bag. That being said there's a large amount of options and customization as far as cannon, type of shot, melee battle tactics and items and land battle combat to get to grips with.\n\nThe biggest downsides are the games somewhat dated visuals, serviceable, but nothing too fancy. (on the plus side, this means the game runs on potato-power PCs with no problem) and the tutorial system, which is very long compared to most run-of-the-mill MMORPGs these days. However, I reccommend doing the tutorial quests instead of skipping them, as you will get free ships and gear from completing them, as well as a good amount of money and skills by the time you graduate from the advanced level course in each of the 3 class courses.\n\nLast thing to mention is the community. This is easily the friendliest online community I have experienced in a long time. The School chat channel is full of helpful and friendly people ready to answer your questions. This is a blessing, as the game is extremely complex.\n\nOverall this is a fun and original game which offers a breath of fresh air from all those "cookie cutter" MMORPGs. It's deep and complicated, but rewarding for those who stick with it past the over-long tutorial.","October 26, 2014","true","63.5"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","68","82","0","0"

I personally played it intensively for a year (when it was under Netmarble and when it was exclusively available on the OGP launcher) before I had to quit due to real life commitments. It is a great game that has a lot of depth due to complex mechanics and the reliance on knowing a lot of things if you want to do it the best way. However, the complexity and the gruelling tutorial system (that feels like real-like work) keep potential players away. Please, I urge you to try to get past it and see the game from an intermediate player's point of view. I know that I initially thought the game was boring during school but grew on me once I kept on playing.\n\nIf you are looking for a great trading experience online while interacting with others, you are right at home! Even from the beginning, you are introduced to a commodity system similar to stocks (like in Port Royale) with lots of numbers. You can start fresh, trading between Dover and London and etc then eventually work your way to a long-distance Nanban trading routes such as Nagasaki (Japan) <-> London (England). Watching your character grow and your coffers fill up with money is the most satisfying thing in this game. I could say a thousand things about this but you will have to see for yourself. Be warned though, this does take a lot of real-life time so be wary of real life commitments.\n\nThe combat is great but I have to admit that it is getting aged. The most amount of satisfaction you will get from the combat is beating other players rather than the combat system being great in of itself. It is a basic system of control your ship, choose ammo, and sink/board the enemy ship. I always found the system to be secondary to trade and more important towards the late-game for Epic Sea Feuds (massive player naval combat battle events), pirate hunting, etc. The bottom line is, it is great but don't have too high expectations. It is great FOR ITS TIME.\n\nIt has a ton of neat features you wouldn’t see in many modern MMOs. Want a customizable apartment with a steward? Done. Want to have cool ships that you saw in those pirate books or movies that you dreamed of? You’re right at home. Want a companion character that helps you perform your job (trading, crafting, pirating, or whatever it may be) and can be dressed up/renamed for your every little fetishes? Done deal. Where have you seen a game with literally over a hundred cities and the world size that takes you half of real-life to go around? It is truly a gem that needs to be appreciated more.\n\nThe community for the most part is very dedicated and friendly. If you can meet their expectations and be dedicated yourself, they will love you and you will love them. If you are looking for a great experience playing a slow-paced MMO you can sink your time into and make a lot of long-term friends, you will like UWO. However, if you are looking for a more faster paced MMO with emphasis on action-packed PvP and PvE raiding combat, you may want to look at a more modern MMO. This is an old-school MMO that does not hold your hand and it is up to you to stand up on your feet and reach up to it.\n\ntl;dr\n\nThis game is good, give it a try.\nBe warned that it is a time vampire.\n\nSay goodbye to the outside.\n","October 3, 2014","true","0.2"," 228 of 334 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","228","334","3","7"

Comparing it to other mmorpgs, I'd say the difficulty level is a little more challenging than most. KOEI is known for making historically accurate games and this one is no exception. While it was released to asian markets only for the first several years, it has been available for the rest of the world for the past several. It's as old as Word of Warcraft, but is free-to-play. Also something to note, it is *not* pay-to-win, like some f2p games are. Some of the best items/ships are potentially/statistically superior, it isn't such a noticable difference, unless in the hands of an unskilled/inexperienced player. And there are a LOT of ships to suit your playstyle.\n\nConcerning playstyles, there are 3 major ways to play the game, and you can change it up as you see fit without too much hassle. Adventuring, Trading, and Battling. Adventurers have probably the closest to a single-player experience as you can get on an mmo, and won't be disappointed with the historical discoveries, locations and treasures that come from diligence. Trading is probably one of the easiest tasks, and is practiced by every player-type. Many different trade goods from various regions of the world and a very deep economic structure that changes prices of goods depending on supply/demand and trading tendencies of other players. Maritime (sea battles) is one of the more appealing features to newcomers and seasoned players alike, and UWO has probably the best sea-battle gameplay around.\n\nPVP exists in the majority of sea zones throughout the world but only the truly skilled maritimers can benefit from a life of piracy on the high seas. I've been pirated only a handful of times in the years I've played and it should be noted that it isn't something to deter you from going where you want to go. There is a healthy balance to all things.\n\nAs for the community of players, some of the nicest and most helpful players abound here! There are so many intricacies to the gameplay, I still learn something new daily, and nearly everyone has an answer or an idea to help you along. We're really all in it together! Instead of "guilds" like other mmorpgs of a historical era, there are Companies. Each is a maximum of 50 players. This is a great way to keep the members tight with each other, and promotes a feeling of having an 'extended family' instead of just other gamers.\n\nIf you are a fan of ridiculous amounts of loot and items, then you will be disappointed. There are a ton of items in the game, but space is always your enemy.. or friend? You gotta know what to keep and what to sell/discard. It's good to keep that greed in check.\n\nPros: Great community of players. Deep and challenging gameplay. Developers did their homework when it comes to history and facts. Educational and relaxing, solid variety in all things, in-game achievements (memorial album/challenge missions). Prioritization is an optional skill you involuntarily acquire that is helpful in life. :D. Locations, player models/outfits, ships, sailing, and even the music(which I mute to listen to radio) still has a unique charm.\n\nCons: Grinds (it's a game created by Asians!). Somewhat frustrating interfaces that seems to have a higher learning curve. Only 1 message window for all information in game, be it chat, announcements, crafting, battle...everything. I still gripe about wanting another window to keep conversations separate from everything else. Graphics are a bit dated, if that is important to you.\n\nI could go into much more detail about specifics, but this is already longer than I intended. So, as far as free-to-play mmorpgs go, and even comparing it to subscription mmorpgs and the multitude of games I've played throughout my existence on this planet, I'm going to rate it a solid 7/10.\n\nI hope to see some of you there.","October 6, 2014","true","288.0"," 72 of 92 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","72","92","2","3"

I'm gonna try and keep this brief, at the time of writing I have a mere 2 hours into this, so I'm no grand commadore of the Uncharted Waters. I can tell you a few things though, This game is no "Diamond in the rough" it's more like a "Black Opal in the rough" (Black opal being much more rare and precious comparatively speaking.)\n\nIt is a beautiful smathering of wonderful gameplay dynamics, this game combines a bunch of elements that normally one would find overly annoying, difficult to learn and painstakingly problematic in implementation. The reality is at first glance it only appears overwhelming. Once your boat hits the water and you sail away from Port everything falls into place with wonderful simplicity.\n\nThe game play seems to be really well thought out and there are still a bunch of really great active players, that are not only helpfull but mature, funny and provide a "living world dynamic" to the game that I don't think I've seen quite anywhere else other then maybe Rift (with out the bots.) This game has all the componets that I wish many other pirate (naval) games I've played could have incorporated in such smooth form.\n\nThat being said... It's not perfect. While I'm understanding of what the limits of technology can provide; ten, twently years ago, I also like to take into consideration that for a new player to download it today, your time could be just as easily spent playing any of the new games that are out now. Additonally, you need to understand the game is dated. Its customer support exists, but is otherwise dead.  The game has been launched to different countries over the course of, at the time of writing, 10 years. Its first realease in Korea/Japan 2005, NA/ Europe 2010 and SEA 2011.  While the opening is valuable, it is REALLY slow. The graphics are dated and its controls are awkward and clumsy. Generally, a game that just seams unpolished/unfinished, at least by today's standards. On the plus side it is free! and it's not pay to win!\n\nWhat to take away:\n\nIf your looking for a great game to sink some time into that has a decent story, great mechanics, involved community, and a pirate theme that won't bite deep into your pocket book, this is for you. Just be prepared for an unenthusiastic entrance, a lackluster finish and an interface that is just simply to me, moronic.\n\n\n*Short Version*\n\nPros'\n-Excellent dynamic and game play elements.\n-Large expansive world that requires exploration.\n-A community that is just plain unwilling to die.\n-Did I mention an ecredibly well designed game play concept and theme\n-Free play game that isn't pay to win\n-Pirate (naval) themed!\n-Solid Storyline- I don't want to quote the wiki here but they do a great job at explaining, I'll simply say (STNG meets pirates>? maybe that's fair?\n\nCons'\n-Dated Graphics\n-Awkward controls\n-???? explained later under warning\n-Glitchy command interface*\n\n(*glitchy may not be the right term, but just not feng shui... Clashy maybe?)\n\n*WARNING*\n\nI've read a lot of complaints saying this game disables your virus protection in favor of it's own security measures. According to them, it is to prevent the possibility of cheating. I don't believe this to be the case, any longer. I've never had any prompts that suggest my AVG is being disabled, or anything of the sort. That being said, I run a dual boot system with seperate hard drives; I use one HD for gaming so if anything happens to it I don't worry, maybe cry about lost progress, but most games I play back up character data and progress on their server. So, it's really just my personal customization to worry about, should anything be lost at that point. It should be noted, I've never taken the time to see if my virus protection is being disabled on the back side.\n\nHappy Gaming, I hope this helps!","July 30, 2015","true","7.5"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","48","58","2","3"

When you begin the game you have to make the choice between becoming a fighter, a trader, or an adventurer.\n*KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS DECISION DOES NOT DETERMINE YOUR ENTIRE GAME, YOU CAN CHANGE BETWEEN CLASSES AT ANY TIME, AND THERE ARE BENEFITS TO DOING PRECISELY THAT.*\n\n-A fighter, as you might imagine will battle AI ships for the majority of their time playing, and will eventually enter PvP where they can have a lot of fun if you enjoy PvP. There are MASSIVE rewards to playing in PvP events.\n\n-A trader does not JUST trade, they also craft non-purchaseable master level items that players can use. For example: extremely powerful hulls, extremely powerful cannons, and extremely good sails. The majority of the in-game economy revolves around these items.\n\n-Finally, the adventurer. The adventurer does not have any actual purpose in PvP or money making, as it is out done by the fighter and trader respectively. *HOWEVER* The adventurer has the *FASTEST* ships, and discovering and doing adventure quests can be extremely fun if you have the patience, Albeit as tedious as the other 2 classes with less rewards.\n\n\nNow, most players who complain about the game being too tedious have never actually completed the tutorial (key word MOST) I understand that many will find the length of the "tutorial" extremely absurd. However, keep in mind this game is absolutely massive and extremely complex, so knowing all the information, at the very least the basics, will benefit you massively if you intend to keep playing. The game also rewards you MASSIVELY if you complete the tutorial, with good mid-level ships and nearly a million of the ingame currency being given to you, practically just for reading text.\n\nContrary to what some believe, the tutorial is COMPLETELY SKIPPABLE, it is NOT MANDATORY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, but if you don't do it, it is likely you will be even more upset with not knowing what you're doing than you would have been if you had simply completed the tutorial. However if you feel your odds are better by trying your luck by yourself, by all means, please do that.\n\n\nThe majority of the community is extremely helpful. I recommend attempting to join a Company as soon as possible, but School Chat is extremely helpful as well. If you have a problem, let people in school chat know.","April 3","true","231.7"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","1"

Though I haven't played this one through steam, I have logged over 1k hours on and off over the last few years.\n\nThis game at it's core really is a good adaptation of the Uncharted Waters series into an MMO. The original version, launched in Japan in 2005 as a subscription based game,  looks like it's close to what I would consider an ideal MMO for a simulation junkie.  And that is what makes the version published here in the west such a bitter disapointment.  The after market cash shop they tacked on cheapens every aspect of the game.  It turns what was designed to be a repetitive but rewarding experience into an all out slog, a slog that spending 50 USD per month barely mitigates.  Many systems have been nerfed or slowed down from the original design in order to coerce players into whipping out a credit card to speed them back up.  The game is set up to have an incredibly robust player economy where all the best ships and items are crafted by players.  Top tier items in this version come only from the cash shop. Powerful ships better than anything a player can make come only from their lottery box. Certain recipes are cut from the crafting proffesions entirely so the items they make can be sold for cash.  Most of these items are tradable in game, but the fact that players can not make them on their own ruins most of the charm and intent of the design.\n\nIt is possible to get somewhere that resembles "end game" without forking over a fortune, but to do so would involve putting yourself through thousands of hours of doing nothing in game but grinding resources.  During this time you'll be repeatedly zoomed passed at sea and destroyed in combat by newer players that shelled out a couple hundred bucks for their ships. Ships were supposed to be a part of character progression, they have level requirements to sail.  Even the highest end cash shop ships have level requirements so low that they can be reached in a couple weeks of play.\n\nI can't reccomend this game but there is a lot here to like. Insanely complex systems, trading, dungeon running, exploration, naval combat, a combination of skill based and level based advancement, layers and layers of systems you'll still be discovering and figuring out hundreds of hours after you start.    If you've got a high tolerance for repetition you can get to "competitive" levels of gear and ships and money without taking out a second mortgage on yoru house, but you'll likely never make it to a true end game on completely equal terms with those that spend thousands. The in game markets are all dominated by players juggling in game money and cash. The high end naval battles are dominated by players who spend hundreds of dollars on their character development and ships.  If you started from scratch and only ran one account it would take years to begin approaching established players like that, and that's assuming you know the game and can play efficiently.  Still, if you really need a hobby and have a big chunk of disposable income and / or a few thousand hours to spare this game might be worth checking out.  If you're like me the more you learn about it the more disappointed you'll be, but there is some fun to be had.  Particularly if you don't mind multiboxing 3+ accounts and have a core group of friends that did the same, you could accomplish a lot in this game and have a blast.\n\nIf Koei stopped liscensing this thing out to 3rd rate lottery box companies and gave us the option to play the subscription model I'd be there in a heartbeat.  I'd also start from scratch if Koei ever puts out a first - party international free server with a more balanced approach to the cash shop and what they sell in it\n\nI've got a real love / hate relationship with this thing.  I'm not sure if there's any real solutions for all the problems caused by the tweaking of the game around the cash shop, and making the game require a subscription would totally annihilate the already tiny player base.\n\nWhile the review paints a picture of the game being completely "pay 2 win"  free players and small time spenders can get a decent game out of it, especially power gamers that run multiple accounts and exploit every mechanic and design flaw that they can.  It's frustrating because 1/3rd of the game or more is designed as an economics / trading simulation and that gameplay is mostly circumvented by players generating their money from selling things out of the cash shop.  The upshot is that most of the stuff in the cash shop is available for in game currency if you can find a seller at least.  I think the whole "lottery box" model is a terrible pyschologically manipulative business as well, hooks gambling addicts like no other.\n\nAnyway just ranting now, I'm leaving the review as thumbs down but as I mentioned there is still a decent game here and if you love the age of sail, pirates, plunder, exploration, discovery, and in game economies it's worth taking for a spin, assuming you're ready for an epic grind.  I'd suggest that if you spend money at all you wait until you really understand the game, I watched power hungry new players getting ripped off every day in the trade channels.  The learning curve is too high to get any value out of early game cash purchases, and when you do start to understand the game you'll realize the value of most of the digital junk they sell is very low.","February 6, 2015","false","0.9"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","0"

Its Eve Online meets the high seas without the spreadsheet BS.\n\n[GRAPHICS] -The game graphics are itself dated but considering it was released a long time a go and only became available to Americans/Europeans somewhat more recently ( a few years ago). The character and city graphics are gawdy but are acceptable as you will be on the high seas and the ship details/water is where its at.\n\n[SOUND/MUSIC] - The music isn't half bad and can be quite refreshing at first. It will change as you enter different territories/cities. It will become annoying after awhile if your constantly in one city or nation due to it being your home/ doing school quests. The ship sounds, (disaster, bell, etc) on the sea are a real nice touch as you travel.\n\n[ENGINE] - This game is reaaaally easy to run as its an older engine. So anything can pretty much run it.\n\n[GAMEPLAY] - This is where this game shines!, You can choose to either be a  trader, Adventurer, or Maritime ( <-- pirate basically ). You can trade goods for profit from one region to another, invest in towns to get your hands on unique goods, Find shipwrecks and bring them to the surface for a chance at getting very good loot to keep or sell. You can choose to be maritime, to either support your nation in wars, or ambush other players across the high seas to steal there cargo. While doing all this, you have to deal with giving your crew food/water, dealing with fatigue levels, etc. The dynamics of those 3 classes really flourish once you have joined an active company  or bought yourself a home to store goods. The game becomes soo much better after you push through the schools ( which do provide some useful info for beginners)\n\n4/5 - The game itself can be quite addicting once your past all of the school quests. Some of the school quests are crap, others provide some basic/useful information to keeping you or your crew alive while on the seas. Each school provides money/ships/port permits once completing everything.  The gameplay becomes the core reason players who have endured the tutorial keep playing, so I suggest giving it a thorough try. I give it a 4/5 simply for the graphics being a bit dated ( which cant be helped), and some of the tutorial quests being bland and a bit pointless.","November 27, 2014","true","70.3"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","1"

As you can choose to play as an Adventurer, Trader or Battle Pirate (or all three together if you play it long enough) and each one's Style is completely different to the others.\nIt can take up some time, so be prepared to sit at your screen for hours on end, but it's by no means boring.

I have been told there are easily over 500 ships in this game and each one can be designed by you! With over 1000 decoration pieces it seems rare to spot a twin of you're ship :'). I allways spot people wearing different clothing and different weapons. Its rare to spot someone looking the same as someone else. Unless of coure you are a noob liek me and are still wearing you're student uniform :p.\n\nThe world map is our world map.

I have not been in a kinder comunity ever! as soon as i hopped on world chat I was warned about certain people camping at certain spots waiting to kill other people.

Links to 5 & 1\n\nOverall it's a very nice unique little game if you're into middle-ages sailing/exploration/trading games, however, unless you have a lot of time on your hands or if you're very very patient - don't push yourself to enjoy it, as you either do straight away or don't.\n\nThanks for reading :)","January 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","20","29","2","9"

Yet at its core is a game that will not be mastered with a couple months of play even. This game is a long term investment, one that will not reward the players looking for something fast. Yet it is fun, if a slow paced deep game is what interests you. Their is a rich skill system, that rewards a well planned out character,  and plenty of things to keep you entertained.\n\nI have two things to critise for this game.  1. If you want to make money, you need to level trading and your not going to survive without making money. Parts and Equipment break, and need to be replaced, and without cash. Adventuring can be awesome, once you get going, being able to locate some impressive places. Sea Battles, have a level of strategy, but will end up costing alot in replacement parts. There are methods of making money without trading directly due to player run economy, but having the trade levels still helps out significantly.\n\n2. While the game is Free to play, it would be exceptionally challenging to go without spending money to get things. There is alot of useful tools that make life significantly easier, and definitely some parts of the game are made significantly easier by spending actually cash. Just be careful or this game can very quickly become not all that free if you get carried away.\n\nOverall the game is fun, and their is alot to it. The comunity in the game is fairly helpful as well. I definitely recommend, finding a good "Company" as their are alot of helpful high level players, who are willing to help out a lowbie.","October 4, 2014","true","3.0"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","30","48","0","0"

No doubt. It is also not for the people who quit when things get hard, because in UWO, things are never easy. In a good way!\n\nPros:\nShips - There is a humongous supply of ships, not to mention all the possibilities of custom made ships\nNaval Battles - No game quite captures the thrill of a battle on the high seas like this, as you need to think strategically and use skills wisely\nOutfits - There are a ton of outfits, for whatever kind of seaman you want to be\nCommunity - The community is mature (for the most part), and everybody is willing to help new players, so long as they take it seriously\nSailing - Sailing is actually difficult *gasp* and takes practice to become better at *guy faints in back row*. Sailing does take practice, and it takes time to get from point A to point B. There's no fast travel\n\nCons:\nGraphics - Sorry, but they're undefendable\nLand Battles - Possibly the worst ground based combat I have ever seen\nMusic - Music is good, but is very repetitive\nStoryline - Just ignore it. Complete school, and then just stay away from story missions. Make sure to complete school though, you'll be sorry if you don't\nSchool - Boring, and very repetitive, but you NEED to complete it to stand a chance in this game\nDungeons - Wondering why there are dungeons in a seafaring game set in the 17th century? Yeah, me too\n\nThis game gets a 92/100, for even with all these cons, they are part of the nonessential experience. All the pros have to do with the core of the game, and it is absolutely a must-have in any players library.","December 15, 2015","true","175.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

It's so unique. If you are at all interested in ships or playing a different kind of game that isn't a Diablo or WOW clone this is for you. A lot of the game isn't fast paced but i enjoy that aspect. It feels like the world is big when sailing about. You get the feeling of being out on the sea and aventuring. The school at the beginning is excruciating so be aware of that and know that when you make it through the game gets 1000x better. The high points of the game are; lots of things to do, very unique sailing experience, being a pirate, fighting pirates, escaping from pirates, well done economy, runs great on low end systems, you can play and enjoy the full game without spending real money, freedom, PVP (consenting and otherwise), rum, discovering intriguing things in history, many ships types to sail, regularly updated, the company that runs the server is engaged in the game, many dedicated and helpful players. Low points are; quite a bit to get orientated to on the start, little in game info (use uwodbmirror.ivyro.net and the uwo wiki to find things), graphics are decent but not modern (doesn't bother me), there are some fantasy and blatantly historically innaccurate aspects, npc characters are not inspiring.\n\nExplanation of the three job types. Also you can mix and match skills from any and switch about all you like so don't feel like you have to commit to one solely.\n\nMaritime: battle orientated. This can be from fighting to take over cities and ports in epic sea feud to fighting pirates to being a pirate. You can fight on ships, on land, in arenas, duel, use guns, cannons, swords, bows, knives, explosives and many other assorted goodies.\n\nTrade: Fairly like you'd expect. Buy low sell high or craft things. Best way to make money in the game. There are "local specialty goods" in the game. You get more money and experience by taking these goods to ports farther and farther away from where they are produced. Some of these can be crafted from raw materials increasing profit even more\n\nAdventure: seeking out new discoveries. This encompasses a lot. Discoveries can be anything from hidden treasure, to anient cities, to geography, to sunken ships, to art or religious artifacts, to exotic animals and new locations. You find what is interesting to you and there is a lot to find. Most of the things you find are actually historic items or places ect which is fun for me being a history buff but you don't have to be one to get satisfaction from finding the stuff.","October 3, 2014","true","0.5"," 79 of 140 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","79","140","0","0"

Turn your ship and Fire them up by the side Cannon or Just Ram in to the enemy ship and crush them with Sailor Melee Attack. Sailing town to town. Pick up some goods from town and go to sale them in another town. Remember the good price on the specific town and do repeat it until the price drop (LOL). But Careful in combat, Navy is not that hard but land combat is (IMO) S_CK.\n\nBut this game is not that easy as the [Easy Going Atmosphere] they give you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanakotka/recommended/317110/","Kanakotka","Kana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kanakotka/","587 products in account","Quick summary before a point-by-point review of the good and bad.\nUWO is a by now 10+ year old (so expected dated graphics, design conventions et.c.) game of the age of sail. Think Sid Meier's Pirates if you're not familiar with the superior Uncharted Waters series before, but on a worldwide scale with absolutely no ballroom dancing, guaranteed.\n\nKnowledge of real world geography will help you here. It's an open-ended game, but without the common pitfalls of "what do i do now?" of sandbox games. It's very much "pick your playstyle" sort of ordeal. An explorer who wants to profit of far-away trade? A trader who carries less but knows which way to hold a sword? A bounty hunter? Mix and match freely.\n\n\nThe largest problems in this game are;\n- The absurd monetization. If i understood it correctly, a few of them are normal features on the Japanese release of the game, although their version last i checked required one-time payment. The monetized items include your bank (timed 30 days), speed buffs, questionably powerful items and more.\n\n- The "anti-hacking tool" malware that you'll bump into if you dare to play eastern games on your PC. In earlier versions, it was possible to remove it, but it frequently causes severe issues with input device drivers, particularly Logitech seems to be the target of the people who make this. This is what caused me to quit, and it took them more than a month to fix. I'm looking to play it again soonish, however.\n\n- Selectively poor design. In a nutshell, everything that you do on foot is poorly designed. Your mileage varies, but generally if you do go explorer, i'd advise against explorers who specialize in land missions (Biology, largely Archaelogy, et.c.) and instead choose Cartography and the likes.\n\n- Massive overinflation causing overtly screwed up economy due to money-gouging translation company (the previous one, though this current one isn't less gougey). Seriously, if you play normally with minimal player interaction, a million is a lot of money. If you trade with players for bog-standard dime a dozen items, 200-400k per item of a certain type is extremely cheap. It really needs a total reboot, or better yet, a remake.\n\n- If your goal is "max level now", forget it. That obsession will give you nothing but grind here.\n\n- Exposition-heavy tutorial with extremely janky sections. Blah blah blah, get on with it!\n\n- Questionable sensation of queasiness over the inclusion of child-like characters. If you can get over the sight in games like FFXIV-2 or TERA, you're fine here too. Personally, i cringe at the sight. Thankfully, the game does provide a button (escape, amusingly enough) to simply fade away all player characters. Blissful.\n\n\nNow, i firmly believe the good outweigh the bad.\n\n- Open class choices. Despite the game handing you out a starting class, you're more than free to change your job (trader,  warrior, explorer) at any time to any of the class-subtypes you have learned(i'm trying to keep the review brief-ish, so not explaining those here). The painful, drawn out tutorial does offer you more "class slips", and some players are fine with doing the tutorial (school) for them, and admittedly, the rewards are nice, but i prefer other ways of obtaining them.\n\n- Open progression. Each class comes with a tree. You're free to- and encouraged to mix and match the trees. Traders learn body language, for instance, which most all people probably get. Adventurers are more likely to learn the actual languages instead, especially languages which they need to read up libraries for discovery information.\n\n- Highly varied playstyles. Explorers, traders and warriors each play highly differently. Explorers don't largely care about mobs/mooks and more often than not outrun them if ambushed, traders fear the pirates deeply, and soldiers/warriors go in all cannons blazing. Explorers, well, spend their time exploring. Traders spend their time trading and applying their craft and trade, and soldiers do what you'd expect them to.\n\n- Non-AFK style sailing. Finally, instead of boring "oh, i guess i'll get a cup of coffee and entertain myself with an entertaining game while pretending to enjoy this other game i'm waiting on" that you see in so many games ranging from EvE(Low- and nullsec nonwithstanding, of course) to Elite, you need to respond to waves and changing winds in different manners depending on your sails, the ship, your abilities and so on. Of course, there's a skill to help you with this, but you still need to keep an eye on the game, steer your ship and so forth.\n\n- Considerable differences between water areas. You'll face different winds, different challenges and generally are encouraged to use different styles of ships for the different areas of the game. Mediterranian is an inland sea embraced by land, so you don't really have strong waves or strong winds, and even when you do, the winds are often blowing from the atlantic or northward, so moving westward would be commonly painful... Yet here, you're given the option of rowable ships, which you'll also see in the arabian sea later in the game. There are other flavors, like the huge waves and powerful winds in the atlantic, or wildly twisting winds of the pacific, but i'm struggling to keep this brief.\n\n- Generally really well done and thought out progression. While being the ultimate goal, reaching the maximum level or potential isn't your immediate desire or need. There's fun and (relatively, see hyperinflation) profitable activities to do from the moment you hop onto your ship. I never felt like i was in a rush of reaching the top level, and... despite clocking in 340 hours, i'm still not there, and i can certainly say i enjoyed most of those hours.\n\n- Magnificient soundtrack that cannot be praised too much.\nMy ears have never been so pleased by consistent beauty.\nEach music piece in this oozes the thematics of the area or the nation you're in. Go check them out in google. Marseilles' theme brings to mind france, food, culture, snobbish, hro hro hro. While Oxford's theme is venerable, if slightly bombastic. Amsterdam is more easygoing, and London is very royal and quite reserved. The moment you hit africa's ocean the first time and that tune hits you, it's just chills all the way. There is no music here that stands out in good, or bad.\n\nHave a sample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6weZo_J8ls & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSlvTwsP-IU","January 6","true","340.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It has a very slow calming atmosphere which is really diffrent from a lot of other mmo's. The tutorial litterally takes forever (me and my friends clocked about an hour each) which can be a huge turn off for some people, however ocne you get out of the tutorial your free to do pretty much whatever you want. you have a huge selection of skills which are "expert", "favoured" and "unfavoured". expert and favoured can go to rank 16 which means if your job has them, you can be the very best at them. However you can make any combination of skills to create your own custom class withen the professions. trader with guns :D! explorers who can buy lots of animals :D! Battle ships that can cure the plague and fend of rats :D! anything that you can think of, the game will let you do.

It's an interesting game definitely, with many people to befriend, and many quests to go on. My only advice, as one who has played this game for a bit, is don't try to start off as a Pirate or as anything Maritime for that matter. Get a nice trader up and running, get Asia opened, make profit. You'll often find a shipbuilder that's training and making more ships than he can sell, who may give you a deal on one of his lower-than-average ships. You'll also find ships for nothing in shops, as well as be given very powerful ships through the tutorials and schools. It takes a while to get into, and the land combat is a bit boring, but once you can take to the sea and start the real conflict, it gets interesting. My only regret is that I started out on Steam and spent so many hours, then tried to make free money using surveys. Damed be them, they weren't prepared for this. You can only take surveys if you have an OGPlanet account, and signing up on Steam dun't give you one.\n","December 21, 2014","true","180.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Naval combat is awesome and the world map is our own world map, albeit a few hundred years back in terms of country and town names. Its free to play but if you grind and acquire gold you can buy almost all the items people buy with cash. The best ships in the game are able to be bought by players who have not spent a cent in game but have grinded cash with time spent. Discover NANBAN trade and you are on your way to being a rich powerful player in game. Even if you are not it is thoroughly enjoyable. You can be banned for the standard transgressions and  I have seen a few people get butthurt over bans that they say were for 'nothing' that were in fact for flagrant breeches of the Terms of Use. Try it its an excellent game. Older player base than many games I have played and I even played with a 90+ year old who as a young man was a crewman on a Tall Ship and so loved this game for the experience and reminescence(if that is a word - if not it ought to be) that it gave him. Seriously - try it - the school system though a little boring supplies you with free ships (and each next section an upgrade) that are OP for starters so do not bypass this unless you own an alt who can sugardaddy you to the same sort of powerful shipping. Piracy has been nerfed (my only gripe), but for a new player youre immune to player pirates till you have one level to 30 and only then once you have a total of 50 or more levels .

Regardless if you advneture merchandise or maritime mostly, you always need to do your homework on the online databases.\n\nResearching what to do is part of the game, by that i mean reading others opinions online on what ship skill to inherit, or how to pull off an adveture quest chain, or how to produce a given part, or where to gather the materials for that part and what skills it requires, are just a few things you may need to look up.\n\nAnother aspect is that you can do many different things during the same day of gameplay.\nYou can start your day with a nanban merchant run to rake in a few hundred millions of ducats,\nthat you later spend on producing cannons and armour some of which you sell in a bazaar while keeping the great success ones.\n\nAfterwards you decide to change to an adventure job and thus you pull a few shipwrecks and pick up some quests along with the research thesis to compliment them.\n\nJust as you had about enough of your daily dose of adventure you head to the daily feature pvp.\nSince it's not the start of the month and there is no Epic Sea Feud, you argue with your friends about what to do next: mock battle, join the Battle Campaign, Bounty Hunt, or even pirate some unsuspecting merchant.\n\nAt the end of the day you enjoy a little of Seville or London and chat with friends while playing poker or dueling. The majority of the playerbase is somewhat mature. This intelligent yet fun playerbase, adds to the depth and variety of the things to do in the game and that way you don't get bored of a repetitive and tedious gamplay.","October 13, 2015","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

yet I still have a lot of things to be discovered - indicates that how many things (being repetitive) they have put in.\n\nIn the beginning, it was an almost perfect game in its genre -\n\nAdventurer skills gathering items (for production purposes, and discovers equipment that helps other 2 classes) and improves efficiency of their ships.\n\nMerchants skills enable them to purchase bulk amount of rare goods from places 2 hours (real time) apart from their motherland and sell them back for vast amounts of wealth so they can support their countries financially (mainly investing other ports for new selling products and fame) - despite the fact that they can be attacked by pirates (PKers) and have their good confiscated - hence it is essential to plan your trading route to avoid them.\n\nMillitary skills characterise battleships player should be using, and it is the 1 of the 3  PvP events where most people participated in - either a officer class that is expert on using their ship cannons, or a pirate class that is expert on deck combat and robbing other people.\n\nThere are many jobs available in this game, even though it will not stops you from what you want to do (i.e. a merchant with a proper customize merchant ship can still do some NPC warfare) - but of course you will have a lower experience point gained, certain skill level limited, and requirements doubled.\n\nIt is the end game job classes that will differentiate distinctively to each other, but until then you are free to change your job at your needs (and it is always in an advantage to start your character as an adventure learner - my personal tip.)\n\nIn the past, ships were played differently due to their sizes (small gunboat battle plays different than the large 1st class Vaisseau due to its different maneuverbility) and galleys classes navel battle can beat frigates and galleons with their superior deck combat ability.\n\nThe ingame economy was reasonable so that a new player back then can have less pressure on chasing up veterans, and this perfect harmony works until they implemented the east asia patch (El Oriente)\n\nEl Oriente literally f**ked up the whole game by trying to - address issue that had haunted the game for years, and to put unnecessary crap that does not really need address with.\n\nThe remarkable thing that had haunted the game while I was playing - was the RMT issue where full time, multiple account holders selling their vast amount of ingame currency with real money - I believed were attempted to be resolved by exchanging goods instead of bulk purchasing them, and those Asian product were sold 20 times more than a normal spice trade, depsite of the hardship of getting there in the first place, new players are now facing a huge gap against veteran players and yet have to deal with a f**ked up, highly inflated ingame economy.\n\n2nd thing they have f**ked up is the ship balances by implementing extra fire power to small and midsize ships -  so since then their naval battle are bunch of boring cannon fest, and because of their introduction of customisation of the ships, now all ship class plays indifferently, the only 3 ship you really need is gunboat, Caravelle and Vaisseau, where otherships are a joke and played by masochists.\n\n3rd thing is to introduce p2w items to resolve piracy issues ingame because dumb, but rich ingame merchant players were campaigning pk issues in official forums that concerns the development team to do something about it, so that merchant player can p*sses those pirate players off and make them quit - so they can enjoy alt-tabbing in game.\n\nAnd the last con in this game is you need 2-3 partner for pretty much everything, from making items, building ship, and mass bomb investment to your archrival's port, so this either bring more friends to dedicate their lives with you, or find a way to play 5 clients at the same time.\n\nWhen I arrived in its overseas server 4 years ago (due to that great tsunami + earthquake that literally closes down the server temporary) I found that only event winning prizes itemss are in the cash shop, which literally stops me from playing it further on - despite their level requirement for certain ships is much lower than its orginal counterpart.\n\nHowever, even including the greatest ♥♥♥♥ ups from Koei Tecmo, this game is STILL THE BEST GAME in terms of simulating the age of discovery, and it is quite an educational software for studying World history via actually discovering them (which Koei were proposed to do for this game) ingame.\n\nAnd the ingame community are still yet needed to be growing via getting more new players in.\n\nTherefore in conclusion, if you love and intrested in age of discovery life and history, while perhaps you just lost your job and yet to look for one (or student that have vast amount of holiday to spend), and finally if you don't mind graphics that aged 10+ years old, this is the perfect game that the industry can offer to you.","December 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BUt as you progress you unlock more of the world. It is fantastic how better ships make world smaller and smaller eventough world is getting larger.\nI personally like you can play as adventurer then after some time switch to being merchant or just go and battle. Grinding your skills really feels rewarding. At least it did for me. As lvl 10 sewer you make yourself some killer sails, or as cook you make food for your company or fleet. Social interaction was really what got me immersed for 2 years(2009 &2010).\nI strongly recommend this game. It has great setting and real world map. People are cool and helpful. If you like using wiki it will help alot. Skills are interconnected and knowledge how to get something or where to find is crucial.\nEveryone has a different taste but this little gem has everything I could ask from MMO's.\n","January 9","true","79.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I start this game at 7 AM and then its 2 PM when I look at the clock again. Its pretty much sailing managing your ship, some low intensive combat. Decent graphics. The game is sort of slow but it is quite fun. It will take lots of time. I really enjoyed playing this. There are lots of friendly people in this game as well. The fun part is getting more money. Watching your cash go up is satisfying and profiting.\n\nThe music is really really nice. I fell in love with the BGM in this game.\n\nThe sunsets and sunrises in this game is spot on. Its like a beautiful water color painting.\n\nThe main feature of this game is sailing. When you first start it may be a little difficult to control your ship but you get the hold of it pretty quickly. And you are suppose to adjust your ship sail to gain wind to move faster. BUT you do not need to do this anymore when you get the sail handling skill.\n\nThe skills you have are important for this game. Knowing a language is a skill. Like knowing portugese, spanish, italian, etc. Knowing your languages is extremely important until you learn the body language skill which lets you talk with anyone in any language BUT it requires a lot of vigour(pretty much energy to use skills or mana?). It is cheap to restore vigour. Each skill is extremely useful in its own way, and there is a limit so you have to choose which ones to keep or throw away.\n\nThe tutorial in this game is what they call the school. There are three level Beginner intermediate and advanced. They teach you about the game. And they are different depending on what job you have: merchant, adventurer, soldier. The beginner course shows you the ropes and the basics. The intermediate shows a little more in depth of the game. And advanced course gives you the more complex portion of the game. Each time you finish a course you get rewards that are really good so it is a must to do.\n\nThere is adventuring: treasure hunting and stuff like that do not really know since I started out as a merchant. And battle which is pretty much combat and everything that is combat related.You basically rely on using items to fight people on land. And for sea warfare you adjust your ship direction and shoot your cannon balls at them.\n\nI am on chapter 6 of the storyline which is pretty much the 6th quest in the main quest series at the beginning. I am emjoying it so far. There are mission requests which are pretty much quests are at the guild where your job is based at. These are good to do helps build up fame and exp for the skill.\n\nTHIS GAME IS SORTA REALLY AMAZING AND YOU SHOULD TRY IT OUT. It may not be something thrilling and heart pumping but it a game really worth your time to try out.","April 30","true","44.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is not for the time constrained for faint of heart.  As a fan of the Koei NES versions of the game: UW and UW2, this is an excellent successor to the series.\n\nGamer population: very helpful, with several differtent chats to choose from to seek guidance and help.  Several wiki's are available to support new gamers, or gamers that have fallen off the wagon.\n\nPersonalization: one of the best aspects of this game is the ability to personalize your toon and your ship.  Want to look like certain captain from a movie/cartoon, you can!  Want to make your ship resemble historical pirate ships? Find the paint and sail and it's yours!\n\nCommunity content and indie adventures: Another plus.  The Game provides historical events the community and PC can participate in, which influence the game world, as well in-game non-aligned quests from quest hubs at the ports.  Random events and pirate attacks keep you on your toes as you negotiate the game mechanics.\n\nNot so good: The tutorial is PAINFUL. Long and cumbersome, but necessary, if you want to know how to do the basics.  With the availability of the wikis and the willingness of the online community to share, the burden on the player is somewhat removed.\n\nGraphics: dated and cheesy, but it's Koei and I'm a bit sentimental, so I forgive it.  Others may not be so forgiving.\n\nCombat: the one-on-one duels can be frustrating if you don't have the right weapon/armor/tool mix to counter your enemy during boarding actions.  The land quests are fun, but can be just as frustrating.\n\nThe gradual degeneration of your ships hit points: this is the most tedious aspect of the game for me.  I get a new ship,  and over the couse of voyages, encounter pirates, rival factions, storms and other randome phenomenon.  I can either fix myself or take to a pro in port.  Either way, the max HP level for my ship deteriorates.  I understand the historical truisms the game tries to maintain, but this one gets under my finger nails!\n\nBy and large, this is a fun game, with lots to explore and do.  I'd say give it a spin and be willing to invest at least 20 hours to truely get a feel for it.","July 24, 2015","true","26.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Upon starting, you're asked to pick a starting job from 3 choices: Adventurer (exploration), Trader (mercantile) and Battle (soldier). Each job has it's own skill set, and you're able to change jobs as you progress, so you're not just tied down to the one you pick at the beginning.\nSailing itself is rather easy once you get the hang of it, which shouldn't take very long. The main threat when at sea is other players. Around the starting areas of Europe, you're relatively safe as long as you can deal with or avoid NPC pirates. But in other regions of the world, the titular uncharted waters, other vessles are free to attack you. Thankfully the world is a big place so encounters shouldn't be too often, plus you can group up with friends and have them help you out in a fight. Operating a merchant vessle and concerned about hostile ships? Bring along a soldier buddy to watch your back as you make trade runs.\n\nOverall the game is very fun to play. Points lost for the use of GameGuard, but hopefully that shouldn't be too much of a problem for many players.","January 28, 2015","true","58.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Overall, I find the game enjoyable and even somewhat addictive. There's a great deal to do and many different paths to take to do it. While I can tell there is a consensus "best" way to get lots of money and the best equipment as soon as possible, I haven't felt forced into that play style to enjoy the game. I also haven't felt that the P2W element is very prevalent though that may come into play more as you progress. Actually for me the best part so far is that it's an MMO that you can easily play almost like a single player game if you wish. There's also plenty of opportunity for interaction with other players if you wish.\nAnd that's where the major fault in the game lies as far as I'm concerned. The community is pretty much divided into new players mostly from the recent addition of UWO on Steam and people who have been playing for years. I'm sure this isn't a unique problem in MMOs. The experienced p[layers almost always are willing to answer game related questions but certainly have their established cliques and often dominate chat with personal feuds and erudite conversations that are more confusing to new players than anything else. Unfortunately the game's moderation at the moment seems to consist solely of fellow players who rarely intervene(and sometimes even participate) in the drama unless it involves chasing gold scammers. My advice would be to use the school chat while you are getting familiar with the basics and then turn off WC unless you need the entertainment. There are at least two helpful wikis available that can help with most questions you are likely to have and they don't engage in two plus hour name calling contests.","November 11, 2014","true","693.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You start out in school learning the basics of sailing, trading and combat and can choose any career path you want Adventuring, Trading, Combat (PVE or PVP) or a combination of all.\n\nSounds good and for a while you'll enjoy it but then you find you've done everything you wanted to in a skill or field and have to move on to another skill or job or go insane with boredom, there is no point staying as an expert at something.\n\nAdventuring has huge scope with many different things to do, but unfortunately you will end up doing the same quests, hunting the same relics and raising the same shipwrecks over and over and over again.\n\nTrading is again fine at the start, if you choose to stay F2P you'll grind your way up the skills buying and selling everything you can for profit until you make it to East Asia to trade. Buy dirt cheap get back to eurpoe and sell items for a huge profit to NPC's or to other players for an even huger profit, but once you've done it a few dozen times its pales quickly.\n\nCombat in the game comes in two types, land or sea. Land combat is possibly the worst you will see in any modern MMO or possibly any game ever made, it is unbelieveable bad. The sea combat is better with fully buildable and modable ships it can be fun but again the missions are extremely limited and just attacking random NPC's hour after hour is amazingly boring.\n\nPVP Combat is the way most people go before quitting. You use the fortune you've amassed to buy a NC (cash shop real money) ship that has been modded with NC items go to a busy trading area (most areas in the game outside europe are PVP) and attack people in trading ships. They know you are coming so leave all ther money and good items in the bank leaving you just thier cargo to steal (you can't take thier ships or even items equipped on thier ships atm). The only problem is that thier cargo is bought in the area you are patrolling so is basically worthless unless you transport it yourself and your crew heavy combat ship uses all its cargo space for food to feed your sailors. So you sit there attacking people who don't fight back, mabye you like that kind of thing, I don't.\n\nCrafting is around par with the average MMO, grind you way up different skills (cooking for instance) until you get to rank 10, you then need to take a specialised job in that skill to get your rank higher. If you change your job you keep any xp you have gained in the skill but it can only be used at rank 10 until you take a specialised job again. Irritating as hell.\n\nThe UI is abysmal. Every time the Devs add something to the game it is added to a drop down menu with no help or explanation as to what it is. The initial training in school is OK as long as you rmember it has been transated from Japanese by someone with poor english and there are huge errors, one instructor has his title translated three different ways, one above his head, one from his own mouth and one in the quest log. you haven't a clue whats going on. The mainline quests are even worse, you can be stuck in the middle of nowhere with no idea what to do next.\n\nI'm making it sound bad, I know. I played UWO for a few years as something different to my normal kind of game (DDO, LOTRO, SWTOR) before getting bored. I went back and lasted a month before dropping it again. I'm 2 weeks back into it and again bored, it seems to have reached its limit for me.\n\nIf you are looking for a way to kill a couple of years without focus then try this. Almost everything in the game takes a LOOONG time so it can eat up empty days you have easily. The guides are all dreadful or translated from the games original Japanese release badly so you can spend hours trying to find even the simplest of information.\n\nThere are a few good things about the game but they aren't game based. Most of the people in the game are friendly, it seems to be an entry level MMO and many haven't honed thier trolling skills yet. As the game has no real direction setting yourself personal goals and hitting them is also good.\n\nThis is definately a pay-to-win game. OGP the people running it are money mad, you can buy anything and everything in the cash shop except accounts, look hard enough on the web and you can find them up for sale everywhere though. The account-email verification link is broken.\n\nI'm sitting here writing this as the game is down, again, OGP have been getting DDOS attacks lately. Everything they have is currently offline, a few days after they took everything down to 'fix the problem'. Nothing written on the facebook page and in fact nothing anywhere.\n\nOGP is definately a company where cash comes first, then thats it, no second or third. Players/customers have no input or say in anything.\n\nSo my verdict on the game is simple, if you have never played an MMO of this type before give it a go. You will like its MMO freedom and the other players. Then when you are stuck (about 15 minutes in) go to a grown up game of this type like EVE. No rules, no direction and even though its P2P (a monthly pack in UWO is around 4 times the cost of a month in EVE), have a good first month and you can legally use in game money to pay for the game.\n\nIf you have played MMO's of this type before then stay away, far away. It can suck you in as all games can and as you're a good player you can get over all the bad points but in two years time you'll find you've just wasted two years.\n\nGo to EVE, it costs but a lot less than this will, believe me I remember my bills.\n\nrant over.....\n\n","January 26","false","1.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

I ended up deleting the Steam files and reinstalling it from the web site.\n\nThen, I got to sit through what seemed like ages of meaningless dialogue that was supposed to teach me how to play.

But this online 2nd age version was really hard to get into.  I was in the beginning stages of the game taking tutorials when they sent me out to sea.  And i just boated around for a half an hour looking for somewhere to dock and found nothing.  Super boring water to look at, even at the highest graphics settings.  I wanted this game to be good.  But I have Zero desire to go back and find out how to properly dock.  Also, there is a text area in the lower left hand corner of the screen where you can talk to other people in the game.  BUT, anytime I tried to type something into it, it told me that my comments were not allowed.  WELL, game designers, if I could have talked to someone and asked for help then I probably wouldn't be uninstalling the game right now.  Thanks for ruining a great game title","October 5, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

This is a game you gotta give it a shot if you love the very essence of MMO (even though it dose not have many players compare to other known ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes)\n\nIt involves you with patience, consistency and hardship because in order to bring out maximum potential of the game, you do need to invest lots of time in this game as I have been but those feelings that somewhat numb all the hardship you go through after you get your hands on one of those top class ships, or your own benchmarks etc.\n\nPlayers are mature and helping. One of the finest thing I've found about this game is a very helpful player community (school chats n world chats) You will be having lots of questions in the beginning because it is a bit lot for a newbie to take in at the beginning, but you will learn as you go which is perfectly normal with UWO\n\nGraphics may not be the nowadays class, but it works in its own way, authentic and vantage style of 16th century of world. I don't find anything about graphics being outdated as it fits well with its theme.\n\nNow, those were my nice words about the game, but I am gonna give it a bit of critique as I have found.\nFirst of all, you do encounter trolls. Of course you would there are other people that are playing this game whom may not be as normal as you think they are, this is a minor case.\n\nSecondly, pirates. Pirates are pretty much veteran players whom you do not want to mess with, They've got connections  and wealth (which i will be talking in about after this) after certain levels and higher you get you are now exposed to those pirates outside safe seas, and no matter what your status are, whether poor or rich, they will rip you off. Some pirates would just linger outside of big ports and watch players come and go and hunt em down in order to gain money you've earned or notoriety. Once you get engaged in a battle against a pirate, you have 2 options get sunk or pay tolls. So called bounty hunters are usually alts for pirates, so I personally don't see them as good ones.\n\nThirdly, the economy. Now this is a serious one. You will earn more as you player longer in this game but you will never, ever be able to as rich as those veteran players because, simply, economy system is so broken, rich gets richer, poor gets poorer. You will often find yourself in midst of big money trades between those veteran players with mention of 10+ billion gold you possibly will never be able to earn. Its a whole different story between newer players and veteran players. It's like two different economies circulate within their own boundaries. There was a reason behind this broken economy but I can not remember what it was, you can look em up.\n\nIt is very biased review of mine but you might feel the same way as I do. I still play this game from time to time, i was lucky enough to join a good, friendly company to have a good time with. As I said above, if you love MMO and willing to try a new one, this is the one you should. Its either you love it or hate it :)","May 28, 2015","true","504.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is simply Amazing in so many ways, even with its faults. I just started playing a month ago, and i am totally hooked.\n\nAs far as free to play games, this is simply the best. if you dont put a penny into it, its still great fun. I personally like to support the games i play, and this one is worth the cash shop it provides. The % to give you a great items from the store items  are its only down side, as the % is so terribly low.\n\nOverall i am gonna rate this game a 6.5 out of 10. This is the game i am gonna play and stay with for a long time to come, but it does have some very bad mechanics in it. Which i can live with. But ive found a nice community of people and once you learn to play, it becomes rather enjoyable.","May 31","true","155.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
