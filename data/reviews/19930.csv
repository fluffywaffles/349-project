"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prwnd/recommended/19930/","prwnd","prwnd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prwnd/","439 products in account","The Settlers - Rise of an Empire is one of my favorite RTS games and it is a prominent part of the game series.\nI am the "builder type", and this game lets me play my style: mine all the resources, upgrade everything, create the biggest army possible and crush the enemy. After the overcomplicated The Settlers - Heritage of Kings this may look too simple, because you only need to care a few basic things to run the economy well. The game also took away the control of the settlers, you only can move your army and your hero. I like the idea to place a building, and the people will do their work automatically. It's logic: if I place a mine, I would create miners anyway. You still can explore the map with the hero of your choice, they both have passive and active capabilities. The game is well balanced, looks beautiful IMO and I also purchased the OST because it is a masterpiece. The multiplayer is completely dead, but it still worth buying because of the campaign, it has a great story. I could play hours on each map and with the Gold Edition you also get the expansion. 10/10 would buy again.","February 28","true","55.3"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

They get caught very easily and the enemy thieves always manage to avoid my guards somehow. On the plus side, I really love building up my little towns to bustling cities and going out to claim land for my kingdom. I don't see the point of the citizens getting married, as it doesn't seem to affect population in any way, but if it keeps them happy, I'm willing to throw a festival every now and then. I think this game has a great blend of strategy and warfare coupled with governing a town.

This is all the zoom out I get?  Be prepared to spend your entire game scrolling around trying to figure out what's going on.   UbiSoft's recommendation is to play on the lowest resolution so you get more zoom.  really?  Even then, it's still barely enough zoom out to see your marketplace and part of the castle.
