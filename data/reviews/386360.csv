"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iriachan/recommended/386360/","iriachan","ChuuuIria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iriachan/","40 products in account","SMITE is a fantastic game. It puts the MOBA genre into a 3rd-person perspective; that allows me to implement the aiming, timing and skills I've gained playing other games. The combat’s fast and highly addictive.\n\nCompared with League of Legends and Dota 2, it relies less on builds and the minions/creeps, but doesn't remove those elements of strategy either. Rather than losing an integral part of what makes other MOBA games enjoyable and meaty, it replaces them with what gives games like FPS/3PS shooters depth. It panders to, and compliments a different style; thus gives a very different experience.\n\nMinions aren't as strong or relevant late game as in Dota, but it feels right. You're playing the role of a god, and by the time you're at end-game, you'll have bigger threats to worry about-- the other gods. It's satisfying to build a tank that 5 enemy gods and a tower, all at once, can't easily kill. It's feels great to have your team expect you to clutch, but succumb to the pressure and miss all your shots. I love saving a teammate at the last moment by landing a perfectly aimed and timed kiss from Aphrodite.\n\nIt's about timing your attacks, weaving in and out of battle, aim and speed. Team fights are intense and replicate the rush you'd expect from a competitive shooter, all while respecting the governing outline of a MOBA game. That makes SMITE, a truly unique experience.\n\nMost people who claim SMITE "sucks", play LoL or Dota. They see other games within the same genre as direct competition to the game they love. They don't care about enjoying games for what they offer; they compare and contrast simply to feel like they’re part of a team—for the sake of ego. It’s as though they themselves had a hand in development, because they're very, very proud.\n\nMost of them like to say SMITE’s not as deep. I argue the opposite. I feel where it lets go in micromanaging; it substitutes with a skill-oriented, high speed combat experience; that has depth and develops a skillset absent from other MOBAs. So it really comes down to misunderstanding the skills necessary in SMITE.\n\nI've been playing SMITE for probably a year now. I should have at least 300 hours, perhaps more. I wish my friends would play with me, but most of them have 'standards' and strongly draw the line after LoL. They’re better than Smite,, and If I want to play with them, I’m going to have to play their favorite MOBA.\n\nIt would enhance my experience to play with them on SMITE, but even without a single friend, this game has kept my attention and I'll continue to play it.\n\nMoreover, Smite is constantly evolving. New skins, new gods, new maps, redesigns, new items, nerfs, buffs, new UI, etc. In the short amount of time I've played the game, I've seen many drastic changes. If you tried Smite years ago, it’s a promise that this SMITE, is a completely different game today-- by this time next year, it'll have drastically changed again. All these changes are enhancements; real refinements to the game. It continues to get better and better, and HiRez listens to the players.\n\nFree to play; pay to look cool. Smite's become one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nNote: I play LoL, Dota and Heroes of The Storm as well.\n\n読んでくれてせんきゅう～","September 30, 2015","true","245.0"," 214 of 234 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","214","234","18","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/386360/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","I think it's about time I finally review this game.\n\nI've had a history with this game. I've played this game since Isis was released, which was over 2 years ago. I remember that I was a HUGE fan of the old Sun Wukong (Hun Batz nowadays) and enjoyed the game, although I never got hooked into it. I eventually just stopped playing and went to get addicted to other games, namely Team Fortress 2. Fast foward to 2015, where SMITE is finally released on Steam. I was very curious to give this another try, so I did. Now, before I continue, I have something to say. All of my good friends know this fact well, and I HEAVILY emphasize this:\n\nI hate MOBA games.\n\nLong story with that, but I just never liked them, besides Awesomenauts. I downloaded SMITE and gave it a second chance, figuring it might be pretty cool now. Okay, this is the part where you look at the number of hours I have in the game. Just take a nice, solid look at it. To the review!\n\nGraphics\nMOBAs aren't known to have god-tier graphics (heh) and SMITE is no exception. The game is just... eh. It's sort of bland, but at the same time it actually looks really nice in some places, like Siege and Conquest. Not much to say here, but this is not a game for the photographers out there like myself.\n\nGameplay\nThe big question to this is, "Is SMITE a good enough MOBA to compare with LoL and DOTA?" The answer to that question is, well, yes! I find it much better to BE the character your playing as, rather than telling them what to do. It's what makes SMITE stand out from the rest of the crowd, and it shines brightly in this way. I don't want to start a flame war, but although it is very simple to understand, the game is much more difficult to master because of the fact you have to actually LAND your shots. No more "clicky-clicky here's the part where 3 champions die" or whatever. Your abilities matter, and missing one could change the course of a game. Plus, of course, teamwork is important in Conquest, and I haven't actually encountered many "OP" gods, if any at all. Some items are clearly better than others *cough* bluestone pendant *cough* *cough* but most aren't too severe. Overall, SMITE delivers with the gameplay by miles.\n\nStory\nJust like whether or not Set will be added to the game, there is no known story. This will not be counted towards the final score.\n\nAudio\nThe audio isn't all that special, but the some of the voice packs you can purchase for gods are actually really funny. Some of the writing is extremely clever and gives the game a LOT of personality.\n\nReplayability\nCompared to DOTA and LoL, this game is much easier to pick up and play, although still being a very competitive game. The community, although not sunshine and rainbows, is much easier to deal with and far friendlier than those other toxic wastes of "communities." The gameplay, as said earlier, is simple and it doesn't require too much experience to understand, however I would recommend staying away from Conquest in that case. There are also daily rewards, but I don't like the fact that the prizes don't get increasingly better after 7 days, because it doesn't feel right getting 75 Favor for playing 8 days of SMITE. Invest the time, however, and it'll greatly pay off. Trust me on that.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, SMITE gives me a much better point of view on MOBAs, my least favorite genre of gaming. I can easily recommend this game if you don't want to go through a brutal experience like DOTA and LoL, and the fact that it brings out its differences with pride makes it one of the most enjoyable and addictive games I've played since Team Fortress 2.\n\nGraphics - 6.5/10\nGameplay - 9.5/10\nStory - NONE\nAudio - 8.5/10\nReplayability - 9.0/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n\n.:8.5/10:.\n\n+Unique third person view\n+Friendly community (mostly)\n+Skins & voice packs give the gods charm\n+Simple to learn, truly hard to master\n+References galore!\n\n-Bland graphics\n-Daily rewards needs small improvement\n-Audio (aside from voice packs) isn't very memorable","October 26, 2015","true","327.5"," 179 of 198 people (90%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","90","179","198","30","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ilovecrt/recommended/386360/","ilovecrt","Crt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ilovecrt/","292 products in account","PSA: Don't use an older overclocked cpu with Windows 8-10, it'll cause bugs in SMITE that'll trigger a permanent ban that will not be lifted.\n\nThis is my recent experience with the game. It's not meant to jab at the game itself, but the problems I've dealt with the product and its company. My hours are not accurate and I've played before it was on Steam.\n\nThis game has a bug with WIndows 8/8.1/10 where using an older generation CPU like the Lynnfield/Bloomfield processors overclocked (via the FSB, not multiplier) causes your system (Windows TIme) clock to run faster. This in turn also causes syncing issues with games of the Unreal Engine for some bizarre reason.\n\nGames like Rocket League will cause you to d/c from the match. Games like SMITE that also use the same engine? They will cause you to move faster in game, or just outright give you 300-400ms. I got the latter, thankfully not the former or at least that's what I think, rubberbanded a lot, too. I reported this on their feedback page, unaware of the Windows 8/8.1/10 problem because I've been on Windows 7 until three weeks ago.\n\nNonetheless, this problem flags their anticheat, permanently banning you. If you get banned by this system, there's no way out, they don't care, unless you take it to the subreddit and call them out. Unfortunately, /r/Smite now has rules against this type of behavior, so have fun trying to get things addressed with Hirez support. I was banned. My friend is friends with HirezTom and he told him to tell me to send in a support ticket and it'll be resolved, no problem. I was relieved, I thought to myself, hey if this guy is nice about it, I'm sure the support team will also care and try to help me figure out what went wrong.\n\nNo. That's not what happened at all. I left a ticket, sent in various screenshots, unaware of this cpu bug. I verified and proven my Windows 10 install and everything on my PC was fresh, brand new, basically. This leads to me my first problem, I was given a "eula copypasta" saying I used software to modify the game, indicating they didn't even bother to read my ticket.\n\nTheir support team will give you a copypasta "no" response, guaranteed. Look at their forums, there's a thread with over 5 pages about the Overclock ban and how they all got the same automated response.\n\nThey won't talk to you, they treat you as a robot. They will close your ticket if you re-open it, and if you're persistent about wanting to talk to an actual person, they'll ban your customer support account. It's a known problem with HiRez and I've supported them since the Global Agenda days because I never ran into these issues until I was forced to install Windows 10. I've played this game before playing through the launcher on Steam, hence my low hours.\n\nThe game has gone through subtle changes over the years and I'm sure it'll still be popular. But obviously I can't recommend the game due to their subpar customer support that makes even Steam Support look like a top-notch customer support service.\n\nIt's a slap in the face to not communicate with dissatisfied customers and players of their product.\n\nIf I ever do pick up this game again or any of their games, I probably won't be spending money on any of their microtransactions. I bought stuff like skins because they were nice and it supports the company. I can't support a company I wanted to work for in the past because of how poorly they treated their customers.\n\nIf you have fun in this game, that's great, It's a fun game, nice community compared to Dota and LoL. The product itself isn't bad, it's the people behind the product that makes me not recommend this game.\n\n________________\n\n\nEDIT 2/6/16-2/7/16: Thank you, everyone for liking and upvoting this review so it gets higher on the Community Hub in hopes that a developer or some Hi-Rez staff will see this.\n\nI also use f.lux and that is a program that tampers with my hue lighting to get dimmer as the day goes on, I have eye fatigue and I've used it along with Smite for years without problems.\n\nI wanted to clarify that I am aware that Hi-Rez treats their community very fondly in regards to balancing the game and suggestions to the game. But that's completely different from how they handle bans and how they handle customers who are afraid and anxious from false/questionable bans. They don't re-assure them at all and they make their fears of being permanently banned - a reality by sending them a nonsensical copy and paste "you broke the eula" when they want to talk to a representative about why or what happened and how they can resolve the issue.\n\nI shouldn't need to be a famous person, a streamer, or someone "relevant" to get unfair advantages in the system. I expect to be treated like a human being, who has been patient, and wants to talk to a representative of the company to resolve technical problems that I've been addressing through their feedback after matches and on the support page. I left that on my support ticket about me leaving constant feedback, screenshots, tons of things about my problems. I was given a "you used malicious software and broke our eula" when I've stated and proved that I have a relatively new computer with little to no software besides an antivirus, Smite, and other steam games.\n\nI do have friends that are in contact with Hi-Rez, some work with them and help test Paladins, some are family of workers. Nonetheless, I shouldn't be needing to ask them for favors like "Can you get someone to actually read my ticket before they send a copy and paste response that is totally irrelevant to my case? I have a fresh Windows 10 install, I can't have any type of malicious software." It was from one of my friends who contacted a Hi-Rez employee that I learned about the overclocking bug that can result in a glitched engine or higher ping, not from anyone on the Hi-Rez support page/email. That's saying something. That's saying there's a clear lack of communication between the dissatisfied, upset customer and the customer tech support, whose job is supposed to communicate with people. Still, at the end of the day, the company is there to make profit. Losing me won't equate to anything. But if I equate to nothing, shouldn't that mean that I should be unbanned instead of playing frogger so that my voice can be heard?\n\nI'm a head administrator of a fairly decent sized Garry's Mod server, I'm a Wikia administrator, I've been a forum customer support for Invisionfree. I know how Customer Support works, I've been in three or more positions and I know communication is key for fellow co-workers and clients. This lack of communication from Hi-Rez's customer support needs to be addressed.\n\nDozens of players have been banned by a similar issue like mine. We're not informed of it by customer support, we're left in the dark and we get our answers from google searches because they're apparently more reliable and gives us the answers we want to our questions. Copy and pasting is not helpful. You already have a FAQ, people send tickets because they want an actual person to respond and help them assess their situation.\n\nI stand by my story that my ban was a mistake. Banning because of overclocked cpus and their operating system not working intended on your engine is a fault on Microsoft's and the company. You already have a fix by "banning players", but you can always take the Rocket League approach and just disconnect the player or kick them. It'd solve a ton of headaches for the customer support who have to go through these tickets and it'd mean less banned players to be really frustrated that the customer support just wants their paycheck and will find the easiest possible method of "answering" people's tickets.\n\n_____________\n\nEdit 2-7-16:\n\nWe've hit 50/50 (100%) ratio, that's rare. Thanks so much for the support to those who took the time to read this. Shows a lot about the community and their support.","February 5","false","80.1"," 347 of 419 people (83%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","83","347","419","18","91"

I have never gotten anywhere with them simply because they dont respond back or if they do its an automated messege meaning they didnt even bother reading it. ive lost 1 account which had over 150 dollars worth of skins and gods and icons. they saw raptr desktop game library as a third party hacking system and banned my account forever. I did everything in my power to talk to them but they didnt want to read it I suppose. obviously I wouldnt cheat because why spend so much money on one thing then get it thrown away?

For those familiar with MOBAs the structure of the game will be familiar. But for those that don't know, two teams of 5 try to push across a field to each others base, breaking defensive towers on the way, trying to stay alive and make the enemy die. There are other game modes but they mostly sit as variations on this theme.\n\nWhat really sets SMITE apart is the way you control your hero. Rather than the awkward click to move and attack system of other MOBAs you move with WASD, and aim your attacks as you would in a shooter, with your mouse. In SMITE 99% of the attacks are skillshots. Dodging is a real tactic, and you do it by moving, not submitting a request to move via your mouse cursor. There are more than enough characters for you to find several you're excited about playing. The game comes to you in layers, as you become comfortable moving around, aiming, and dodging, you begin to see new opportunities to improve. Whether it's making a smart predictive shot through the wall, or suckering an opponent into attacking you when you have a hidden teamate nearby, you'll start to get hype on smart plays, and you'll feel the pressure of avoiding your opponent's in turn. Integration with curse voice is nice, and even if you don't feel like jumping on the mic, there are shortcut keys to make tons of useful communications. This takes some getting used to but you get fast on it.\n\nThe game is at it's best in Conquest(the primary mode), but sadly is plagued by the same problem every other MOBA has. There is one map, with one set of objectives. As far as I know Heroes of the Storm is the only game that has bothered offering some variety in the 5v5 queue. I'd like to see them slow down the release of new heroes a bit, and offer some interesting twists in the 5v5 matches.\n\nThere is absolutely no pay to win system, and while there's always a lingering balance issue here or there, it's usually not really gamebreaking, and rarely will be enough to stop the better player from winning. You can unlock all the gods through gameplay, and color swaps for thier default skins. That said, the ultimate god pack, unlocks all the gods, current and future, and I strongly recommend it. It's a good way to support the game and it gives you all the toys to play with in your matches. I paid $40 for it, and I ain't even mad. The rest of the cash shop is premium skins and other vanity items, my only gripe in the cash shop are the "chests". These are virtual lottery tickets, the kind so popular in eastern free to play models, and some skins and vanity items are exclusive to these tickets. For me personally paying for a digital item is enough, I don't need to pay for a random digital item.\n\nPros\n+Simple, responsive, movement\n+All skillshots, aim and win, miss and lose\n+~70 Gods to play, with a good range of abilities,\n+Good character balance\n+Mostly straightforward cash shop, that doesn't blackmail you with pay to win items, and makes it easy to get ALL the characters\n+Robust quick communications system built in.\n+Geb\n\nCons\n-One map(in conquest), OVER AND OVER AND OVER...\n-Digital lottery tickets\n-No truly original characters(though some interesting interpretations on the Gods)\n-Tusky","September 8, 2015","true","508.7"," 162 of 191 people (85%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","85","162","191","16","6"

Great selection of Gods to choose from from the Hindu, Chinese, Norse, Mayan, Egyptian‎, Roman and Greek pantheons, fair store prices (you can pay $30/£21 to unlock all current and future Gods(EDIT: Currently £14.06 on Steam!)) with plenty of ways to earn gems for premium skins and deep and rewarding gameplay that is quite unique to the genre. There's also more modes compared to your usual MOBA to keep the game fresh if you're tired of the usual 3 lane & jungle traditional MOBA style games, such as the Arena for pure fighting ability.\n\nOnly issues is that the launcher can be a pain, and the servers aren't always the most stable.

I will add a TL; DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nSmite is a MOBA that has been around for a couple years and has gained some nice popularity. The main thing that people like about smite, that it offers different than other MOBA games such as Dota or League of Legends is that it is in third person. This means you actually have to aim your basic attacks and abilities and you much more control utilized the WASD keys for movement.\n\nThe game itself offers a total of 7 different gamemodes, not including ranked, that you can play. The gamemodes include a 5v5 Arena, 3v3 Joust, 5v5 Conquest, 5v5 Clash, 4v4 Siege, 5v5 Assault and a gamemode of the day that always offers something different. The matchmaking is on a decent timer usually taking anywhere from 20 seconds to 3 or 4 minutes to find a match (usually, ranked can easily take longer).\n\nIn smite there are gods from a handful of pantheons actually to be exact 76 gods in the game as of now, each with varying usefulness depending on the situation. An amazing thing which personally all MOBA games *cough* League *cough* should do is have an ultimate pack like Smite. This ultimate packs includes every single god in Smite, present and future, for one purchase and it is honestly one of the greatest things available. Smite also offers its premium currency as a daily reward and has a good community. By a good community I mean that this game has a good community, not a perfect community, don't get me wrong you WILL run into toxic individuals. I personally play joust and the people I find are kind and helpful and usually understanding, but what people need to understand is the every single MOBA is toxic and smite, for me, seems to be toxic mostly within arena and conquest although you will run into horrible people in other gamemodes as well.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nThe environment in smite is highly detailed and the maps such as joust also have the perk of being quite colorful and interesting in their design. The game also contains music packs which you can gain along with announcer packs which change the default ones given and are able to make your experience quite better if you get the right pack.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Third Person MOBA\n+ Good tutorials\n+ 7 different normal gamemodes\n+ Ultimate god pack\n+ Game events\n+ Actual god lore (I mean I could read up on it, but it's a nice thing to look at when in que for a match)\n+ Fun to play\n+ Much better community than Dota or League (in my opinion)\n\nCons\n\n- Certain toxic gamemodes (gamemodes where you will almost definitely run into someone who worsens your experience)\n- Achievement Glitch (if you already had a smite account and got a major portion of achievements, those achievements will NOT unlock on steam)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI love smite, I won't hide the fact that this game has caught me perfectly. I have 420 hours on record of the time of this review being written and I don't regret a single second. I've met great people who I still regularly play with and I've also met people who simply stunned me (NOT in a good way). I usually play Joust and Assault like crazy because those are the two gamemodes I started with. Now I'm trying to get into conquest, but it's a completely different way of playing when you compare Joust and Conquest. I tried League and I hated it, simply hated it. I tried Dota for awhile, but once Russians and others started yelling at me in different languages because of their own mistakes I dropped Dota too. Then finally Smite was released on steam and I bought the god pack within the first 2-3 weeks of playing and I played with some of my close friends. I left smite for a while just before season 3, but now I've come back and nearly doubled my hours since I took my extended break.\n\nFor someone to be able to write an in-depth review for this game you need around 100 hours in my personal opinion before you've actually started to truly experience the game, but for a funny and quick review a lower time is perfectly alright. You can't go in-depth, truly in-depth with a review for this game with little hours. If you have under 30 then you simply don't know practically anything about this game! Anyway, I do love this game and am glad I found a MOBA which I actually like.\n\nTL; DR\nAs the funny review which made me try this game said "Smite is the MOBA for people who hate MOBA's". This is a MOBA in third person where you aim all of your abilities and basic attacks, not just click and wait. The game contains 76 gods and 7 different normal gamemodes (not including custom/bot/ranked) at this time so there is a lot of variety for players to try things out. You will run into toxic people, don't get me wrong, but you will also most likely be able to meet good people in different gamemodes as you continue to play who will help you out, be supportive, and compliment you.","May 12","true","443.7"," 111 of 127 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","111","127","7","7"

The main thing that I did not like is the isometric viewpoint, as well as the click to move aspect of the traditional MOBA. Smite Fixed all of the that, when you auto attack someone it's not you just clicking on them and the attack auto hitting them no matter what, In Smite it's a skill shot that they can dodge the same principle applies to most abilities.\n\nYou start off with 5 base gods for free + another 5 on rotation.\nYou can buy more gods via in game credits you earn buy playing and leveling up, purchase them with real money individually with gems, or get the ultimate god pack it's $30 and gives you every god in the game as well as every feature god if you plan on playing as lot of smite it's definitely worth it. The community is amazing for a MOBA.\n\nThe main con I can think of is the servers. I live 2 hours away from LA CA and always have over 100 ping normally 120 ish.\n\nSome tips for new players.\n\nBuy beads! You will hear this, a lot in arena it means you should buy Purification Beads from the store it's a cheap on use item that gives you CC immunity when used. As long as you have the auto buy on it should buy them for you.\n\nYes there is last hitting no there is no denying.\n\nLearn some basic VGS commands http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img513/9819/nww2.png\n\nDon't worry about item builds at first. The game will auto buy a basic build for you (you can turn this off at the lobby screen before you enter a match) I recommend to play arena until you get the hang of the base gods.\n\nThe traditional MOBA map is called Conquest there is no bottom or top but long/duo lane for ADC and Support you can tell what lane this is because the towers will be farther apart and it will be the side with the gold fury, Then mid normally played by a Mage and solo/short lane normally played by a Warrior (or any god with good clear and sustain) this will always be on the side of the Fire Giant and will be either top or bottom depending if your home is the chaos or order side. Jungler will start off farming lane with solo lane (aka short lane)\n\nIf you have any questions ask in the comments and I'll try and answer as soon as I am able.","September 8, 2015","true","694.2"," 154 of 190 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","154","190","6","8"

You play as the visage of a god from mythological lore and take part in different game modes against other opponents.\n\nThe major difference with Smite over other MOBAs is that you play from a third person perspective, and plays with the same sort of controls as other third person action games. The game is very arcade like in that the majority of your abilities are skillshot based rather than selecting a target and having your character auto aim for you. The game has over 70 different gods to play as, each having their own unique play style, abilities and characteristics.  There are at least seven different game modes to play in, Conquest, Arena, Joust, Assault, Siege, Clash, and Match of the Day. My favourite mode out of them all has to be arena. The matches take no longer than 20 minutes, and the players that take part in them are genuinely really nice to be around. Being a fairly novice player at Smite compared to a lot of people, I felt that Conquest, which is considered the main game mode, had a much more hostile community vibe to it with more abuse and flaming coming out of chat than any other mode I played in.  As with most MOBA type games, your characters equipment plays a key part in how well you perform, and Smite is no different. There is a wide variety of different gear to choose from, allowing you to play your character however you choose.\n\nSmite is built using the unreal engine 3.0 technology, which provides graphics full of detail and presenting a higher graphic level than most MOBA games. The character models are all high in detail and really well animated using rag doll effects. The game’s sound effects are OK, you have to pay extra for your characters voice pack, but you still get a little bit of flavour speech here and there.\n\nThe tutorial system at the start of the game does a very good job of explaining the games main mechanics and explaining the main game mode, and I felt it got me to a sufficient skill level in order to jump into the main online game. I have been playing for about ten hours so far, and I am at that point where I can quite often find myself at the top of the kills score board, and having the least amount of deaths too. I am not saying I am absolutely amazing all of the time, but I don’t feel as if I am being carried by my team anymore and doing more good than not. This is the sort of game where practice makes all the difference – the more you play the better you’ll get.\n\nI can honestly say I am completely hooked on Smite, and have been playing it for the past week every night after work. The matches are a perfect length before they start to drag on, and the accessibility of any of the game modes makes it really quick to find a match online. The game would be even more enjoyable if you play with friends on coms, but even from a solo perspective, I can see myself playing Smite for hours and hours.\n\nI did have a fairly annoying technical issue which I was unable to resolve, and that is really rapid frame rate drops and freezes. I started playing the game on 4k, with all of the settings maxed out; obviously I noticed the freezing – although it only happens when you open a menu, or a kill is announced on screen. So I dropped the resolution down to 1440p, although the same happened, reducing the resolution even more to 1080p only to find it still occurred. More so, even reducing the graphics settings did not cause the issue to disappear either, so it makes no odds whether I was playing on 4k max settings, or 1080p with low settings; the freezing happened regardless. Looking online the issue appears to be with the servers, so hopefully this can be resolved in a future patch.\n\nSmite is one of the first MOBA games I have played for a length of time longer than 2 hours. I tend to normally stay away from this genre of game because I know how much of a time hog they can be, and I am the sort of person who will just find myself going down a rabbit hole with it, with that said, I do intend to keep on playing Smite, at least a few times a week due to how easy and quick the games are to get into. MOBA fans and even third person action skill based game fans will want to be checking this game out. The free to play model is done really well, with buying extra heroes rather than using the weekly rotation selection, and cosmetic items being the only things you can purchase.  You can pay £20, 99 to unlock every single hero in the game presently as well as any future gods as well. Personally I wouldn’t purchase this as I was perfectly happy using the weekly selection of gods, but if you intend to get really stuck into the game; it may be worth picking up this pack to unlock all of the heroes.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\n\n\n----\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Eventually I gave in. And what I met was not pretty. I hated it it. It was complicated, unforgiving, and just not fun to play(especially when matches went on for an hour or more regularlly) Soon ater I tried to tell my friend why I quit. He just couldn't understand. Eventually I discovered a company called Hi-Rez and their game SMITE, which was being advertised as a MOBA. I watched the trailer and instantaniously fell in love. I adore the classics and mythology and having this put into a game was my dream. After playing the tutorial I hopped into my first match. The third person view makes the normal MOBA format feel fresh and fsat paced which is great for someone like me who has issues paying attention for a long amount of time. The graphics were beautiful, the character designs were true to their myths, and their abilities were equally so. Not only that, but the community was much more forgiving than that of DOTA or LOL. When I made mistakes people asked me if I was new before yelling at me. As time went on, I convinced my MOBA loving friend to join me, and after some "This is stupid what the ♥♥♥♥ is with the camera" he fell in love as well. SMITE is now my most played game on steam and I have some 6 or 7 friends that play the game now because of me. Hi-Rez is a superb company who has made an outstanding game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for some fresh and exciting gameplay along with a lovely community who all enjoy the same game. 200/10 Would play for ever\nIn conclusion, SMITE by Hi-Rez is better than drinking water, and that's pretty damn good","May 15","true","516.7"," 59 of 70 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","59","70","8","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/recommended/386360/","narukoopa","✯ Narukoopa™ ✯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/narukoopa/","178 products in account","All of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion, they're not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it.\n\nRelease: PC: March 25th 2014\nXbox One: August 19th 2015\nSteam: September 8th 2015\nGenre: MOBA\nDeveloper: Hi-Rez Studios\nPublisher: Hi-Rez Studios\nMode(s): Mutliplayer\n\nTL:DR\nI've never really liked MOBAs before. I always saw them as boring point & click games, but oh boy, Smite supprised me. A third person MOBA that doesn't force you to click to move? I was instantly hooked. As you might've noticed, in this game, you play as one of many different gods, all based off real mythology. This game uses similar elements to other MOBAs like League Of Legends and Dota, which are instantly recognisable to any MOBA player. Smite is one of those games where I shall continue to play it for a long time. I would also like to mention that the DLC is definitely worth it as it gives you all the gods in the game. Highly recommend this for MOBA players, and for people that don't like MOBAs.\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nAbout\nSmite is a rather unique MOBA taking the third person approach whilst giving you full WASD movement of your character. A game highly inspired by mythology, allows you to play as gods based off real mythology. When you first start the game, you're only given a five gods, plus with the added ones on rotation. You can either buy them with in-game currency, with real currency, buy the Ultimate God Pack dlc or just wait for them to go on rotation, making this game far from pay2win. Smite is split into different game modes like Arena, Joust and Conquest. The game gives tutorials for the basic gameplay and how to play each gamemode. I personally found these very helpful, and was never confused at any point, either because of my experience in MOBAs or the fact that how simple they are to understand. The match is split into two teams with five gods per team, (Unless it's Joust which is split into 3v3).\nIn most gamemodes, the main objective is to destroy the towers, then the phoenix that guards your final objective, the titan. Depending on the gamemode, the map will have different lanes, and a jungle where you can farm xp or get bonuses to help your team. This can be crucial in modes like Conquest. You are also able to view the shop menu at your spawn where you can buy items to assist you in battle. The game gives you a choice in whether or not the game automatically buys you items, or you buy them manually.\n\nGameplay\nWhen playing this game it heavily reminded me of  Super Monday Night Combat  with it's third person action style. Each character has their own skill set with four unique abilities, with the added passive ability. Each gamemode starts you off with a specific level, usually at level 3. Each time your character levels up, it gives you a skill point. The game can automatically apply the skill point to the recommended ability, but you do have the option to apply it manually. Sound like a classic LoL and Dota? It ain't. Like I mentioned earlier, the controls are set to a WASD movement. This game doesn't have as much as a learning curve compared to the other MOBA games I've played. I've actually found it quite easy to play, or at least get the jist of it.\nIn terms of balancing, thats up to some debate. Most I've found pretty balanced, with other gods being able to counter them easily, but there are some which are downright over-powered if you really know how to use them. Gods like Kali are a good example. This didn't always affect me. If you're in a good team, you're likely to be covered.\nI also had a feq problems with matchmaking. Sometimes it can take forever to find a game which you would think would be very popular. It wouldn't do it all the time, but when it would, it's highly infuriating.\nOverall I'm rather pleased that this is a MOBA with gameplay I can actually enjoy. Any other people like me who aren't fans of MOBAs are bound to be entertained by this.\n\nDesign & Graphics\nAnother key factor that I was very impressed with. I loved seeing the different gods and the amount of detail put into them. Same goes for the maps. Beautifully drawn and inspiring. The jungle areas, although small, have great detail too. I can say that this is helped by the cartoony style graphics.\nI can run this game perfectly fine on max settings, and have a pretty stable connection to the servers. I can see the game's performance vary for different people, especially if you have a bad connection.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nIf you're a MOBA player, it should be easy to find your way around things like the shop and understanding where things are and what they do. I can see this being a struggle for non MOBA players. Unless you easily understand the tutorial, (which you should do) it might take sometime getting used to the UI. It wasn't very hard for me since I've played games like Dota before, which uses a similar layout.\nOn the other hand, settings are easy to navigate, with nothing too difficult to find. Main menu is rather basic to navigate. Personally for me, I didn't really have a problem with the UI, but I can see how some people might.\n\nPros -Nice detail\n-Plenty of characters\n-Addicting gameplay\n-A MOBA that doesn't require you to click everywhere!\n-Easy to follow tutorials\n\nCons -A few balancing issues\n-Bad matchmaking\n-Relies on a good internet connection\n\nFinal Recommendation\nI've had Smite in my library for quite a while now. I never had the time to play it, and when I did I just couldn't be bothered because of my past experience with MOBAs. I almost uninstalled it when I decided to give it a try. After that I couldn't stop playing. One of my first games was on conquest going against bots. Whenever I played Dota, I would always do bot matches because I would be too afraid of playing with people in case I was reported for some stupid reason, but when I gave it a go on this game, I send a message in the chat saying that this was my first match, and their words were "No worries, just have fun" "It's only against bots, just relax and enjoy". One of my favourite communities I've ever seen. It may have a few issues, but no game is perfect. This is definitely my favourite MOBA and I highly recommend it to other people, whether they be MOBA players or non MOBA players!\n\nFinal Verdict - 9/10.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/386360/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IZTss4ud1k\n\nIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

And unique in so many ways. Uses a third person camera angle that give you immersion that you can't find in other Mobas. Usable Characters are all based on Mythology, with different Pantheons being present. As of right now, there are Egyptian, Greek, Chinese, Hindu, Mayan and Norse gods in the game. All the gods have lore-friendly abilities.\nAnother thing that I enjoy quite a lot about this game is the lack of purchaseables that give you a competitive advantage. Take League of legends as an example. You can buy Runes with the currency, which give you an advantage against an opponent that lacks Runes. In Smite, the only thing you can buy with the free currency are gods (characters) and some skins, that are mainly re-colors of the base skin of the god. This to say that if anyone dumps a lot of cash into the game, he/she gets no advantage over someone who doesn't spend a single penny.\nYou get daily login rewards, and the 6th and 7th day login rewards are 15 and 35 gems, respectively. This means you can buy a regular skin if you login for 8 weeks in a row, even if you don't play a game, you can just login and collect the reward. You also get Favor (free currency) with the daily rewards, that refresh after a week. Pretty cool too.\nYou can also buy a pack with all the gods in the game, be it available now and in the future, with one single purchase. When I bought it, it was something like 24€, for all the characters in the game, forever. It's a pretty awesome deal, if you ask me, since whenever a new god is released, you automatically get it without spending currency.\nDefinetely recommend","September 8, 2015","true","340.4"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","49","62","0","3"

SMITE solves the issue flawlessly, bringing real direct action into the MOBA genre.\n\nThe problem with SMITE for me is the matchmaking. I thought I felt, that they have a separate matching for the really low levels, but once I reached level 5 or so, which happened fast, I was matched against pre-mades of 5 with 5 solo queuers, or matched against players with hundreds of games played, as someone who plays his 20th round. This can't work. I also did have an amount of fairly balanced matches though.\n\nLooking at past matchmaking on smite.guru makes me think, that the only matchmaking criteria is ELO. It is a huge mistake not to consider, that someone with 1000 games played and an ELO-1800 is at an entirely different level of playing than a player with 20 games played and an ELO-1800.\nMaybe that would mean that the concept of ELO is flawed, or SMITEs determination process of ELO, but I just don't see it working that well. Obviously matching parties of 2 against parties of 5 can't work either.\n\nIf you can handle a hand full of frustration due to the slightly flawed matchmaking and a very beginner-unfriendly community, give SMITE a try. I would highly recommend reading up about the laning roles though, before you ever queue into "Conquest" mode.","October 4, 2015","true","264.8"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","38","45","8","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OGCannaWeed/recommended/386360/","OGCannaWeed","CannaWeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OGCannaWeed/","276 products in account","TL;DR You should try Smite but be wary of the saltstorm.\n\n(Salt/Being Salty: Being angry, agitated, upset.)\n\nSmite is a great game. I've played it since the Beta and have done the 1-30 grind as well as a few ranked games last season.\n\nNow that this has been made clear, i'll discuss what isn't so great about it. To be blunt, the community is ♥♥♥♥. We could all agree that online video game communities are generally bad but in Smite more often than not, your game will have someone being salty towards another player for stupid reasons(anything from a teammate feeding, to someone not being able to take a joke or play along). The game has come a long way with all the visual updates and the god balance but the state of the community has just been getting worse every year. But of course, since you can just mute anyone who is fedora-neckbearding in the chat the gameplay doesn't really suffer unless you listen to their crap and let them get at you. In the end though, it's a team game, so you will have to endure some salt one way or the other.\n\nThe gameplay side of Smite is well executed and unique in the MOBA genre. The third person view and the familliarity of the gods to the common person makes the game more accessible in my opinion because not every player is interested in Lore and the bird's view in traditionnal MOBAs can be a barrier for the new player who has yet to pick up a game from the genre.\n\nThe last point that makes this game for me is the cheap god pack, in which you receive every god released as well as all future gods for like 20$USD. This method is far better than that of LoL/HotS, even though it's not nearly as good as the free DOTA 2 way of going.\n\nSmite is at a great point in it's lifecycle for new players to join in, with the recent Steam addition and the game only being in it's second season of competitive/ranked play.\n\nOverall, I would recommend playing Smite or simply giving it a try to see if you'd like it because it's definitely worth a shot.","September 14, 2015","true","8.8"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","38","45","6","0"

You can go in to Smite with no prior knowledge of the genre, but as long as you know how to aim and shoot you're good to go. The game's third person view means that every skill is a skill shot, even your basic attacks. On the flip side, LoL or DoTA vets will find aspects of the game familiar yet challenging, and your past experience with MOBAs won't go to waste.\n\nThe competitive mode Conquest has the kind of rare depth that lets you pour thousands of hours into it without getting bored. If you're just looking to party up and fight, the 5v5 Arena (Deathmatch) mode is as simple and satisfying as it gets. There's also Assault (ARAM) if you can't choose which god to play.\n\nSmite also features arguably the best deal in gaming with the Ultimate God pack. For $30 you unlock all current and future gods, meaning as of this review you've currently got 68 characters to play, and you'll own and be able to play every new god from the day they're released.\n\nSmite is by no means P2W; all gods can be unlocked for free, and are a lot cheaper in comparison to LoL or HoTS. However, if you see yourself playing this game for any period of time, definitely consider making the small investment.\n\nIf you're into eSports, Smite has that too. With competitive leagues in NA, EU, OCE, China and Brazil/LatAm, featuring familiar names such as TSM, Fnatic, C9 and more, it's easy to get involved in the hype building up to the Smite World Championships.\n\nI can't recommened Smite enough, and if you're even the slightest bit interested I urge you to do yourself a favour and check it out.","September 8, 2015","true","342.0"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","42","56","0","0"

Yes, I loved it more than DotA 2! It runs along the same basic rules that other MOBAs use, but it uses different game modes and an entirely different viewpoint. You see, Smite is played entirely from the third person, instead of a top down RTS-type game. This camera and the ability to fully control and aim your character's attacks lends a lot of intense gameplay to an already intense genre. Also, the fact that the characters are all gods and immortals from various faiths and mythologies lends a lot of charm to the game. Even better than that, the community in this game isn't full of entitled ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I mean, they are definitely still there, but I've met many more nice, fair, friendly players than I have in any other MOBA.

It's unique 3rd person camera gives you a great sense of immersion, and the many game modes mean that the game can never really get stale.\n\nThere are currently 69 gods in the game, with the latest being Xing Tian. He has freaking eye nipples what's not to like!? They tend to add a new God every month, with more content patches coming in roughly every 2 weeks.\n\nSmite offers a unique pure 5 v 5 deathmatch mode called Arena, which is set in a roman coleiseum. This is great fun and unique amongst many other MOBA games out there.\n\nSmite is a game that is free to play but not pay to win. They give you 5 gods when you start, as well as there being a weekly rotation of 5 other gods you are free to try. If you like the gods, you can choose to purchase them with in game currency, known as favor. You earn this through simply playing matches.\n\nI also absolutely love the game's soundtrack, with each Pantheon getting its own remix of the main theme which is played in the main lobby when a god from that pantheon is released. There are also tracks that play when the match is nearly over that really get you pumped, which overall adds to the great feel of this game.\n\nI would reccomend this game to anyone :)","September 8, 2015","true","234.9"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","33","42","3","0"

Not to mention the game is free to play for christ sakes, so no reason at all to not say you tried one of the greatest online gaming sensations for PC and XBOX at least once. Everyone of my friends thats given Smite a fair chance, are hooked just like I was.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiebly/recommended/386360/","hiebly","Hiebly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiebly/","33 products in account","Smite takes a different approach to the MOBA genre than the other big names in the scene. Rather than a bird's eye view where you click to move, you have an over-the-shoulder perspective with WASD movement. Basic principles and strategies from other MOBAs will still carry over, so if you've played League or DOTA the learning curve on Smite should be a breeze. If you've played any action RPGs or MMOs (such as Wildstar Online or TERA), character movement and combat should feel familiar.\n\n\nYou play as gods (and demigods and monsters) from various ancient pantheons: Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Hindu, Japanese, Mayan, Norse, and Roman.The characters are very well balanced, and it isn't until very high levels of play (high-level ranked and in the tournaments and pro scene) where some gods have prominent advantages. There are five different classes / roles for characters:\n\nAssassin: Melee characters focused on setting up and confirming kills quickly\nGuardian: Melee characters focused on initiating fights and peeling for their team; high defence and CC\nHunter: Ranged characters focused on high sustained damage\nMage: Ranged characters focused on high burst damage, crowd control and clearing minions\nWarrior: Melee characters that have a good balance of damage and defence\nThere are a few outliers who perform differently (for example, Ao Kuang is classified as a Mage but plays like an Assassin).\n\n\nSmite fits a bit more of a casual audience than LOL and DOTA. There isn't as much strategic depth in the competitive game mode, Conquest (5v5, 3 lanes) as there are in these other games. Lane pushing, rotations, jungling and itemization aren't terribly complex in Smite. This isn't to say the game isn't strategic - there is still a lot of strategy especially when it comes to teamfights and how you play certain matchups. Just that the emphasis in Smite is shifted a little away from strategy and a little towards mechanical skill (ability to hit abilities/attacks) compared to other MOBAs.\n\nBeyond fundamental gameplay differences, Smite also has a wider range of game modes, many of which will appeal to players who just want to have some fun or focus almost entirely on the PvP aspect without the deeper strategy that comes from your typical 3-lane MOBA map. The game modes are:\n\nConquest: 3 lanes, 5v5, most strategy. Avg 35-50 minutes.\nArena: 5v5 Team Deathmatch. Avg 15 minutes.\nJoust: 1 lane, 3v3, basic strategies. Avg 20-30 minutes.\nAssault: 1 lane, 5v5, random gods, no returning to base. Avg 15-25 minutes.\nSiege: 2 lanes, 4v4, siege juggernauts earned from kills and neutral boss. Avg 20-30 minutes.\nClash: 2 lanes, 5v5. basically Conquest Lite, not nearly as much strateyg. Avg 20 minutes.\nMode of the Day: Game mode that changes every day. Often is fun stuff like 80% cooldown reduction, infinite mana, everybody plays as the same god, etc.\nConquest and Joust are available in both normal and ranked modes. Ranked is only available at account level 30 (which is about 120+ hours of played time).\n\n\nThe business model in Smite is extremely friendly. Players will always have at least 10 gods to play at any given time. All players have the same 5 starter gods permanently unlocked: Thor (Assassin), Neith (Hunter), Ymir (Guardian), Guan Yu (Warrior) and Ra (Mage). There is also a free god rotation that will give you 5 more gods, 1 of each role. This rotation changes every week or two. You can also acquire new gods with gems (paid currency), favour (currency earned from playing and logging in frequently) or with the ultimate god pack. If you don't pay any money, you can expect to earn enough Favour to unlock an average of 1-1.5 gods per week. If you play a few hours a day you should be able to unlock 2-3 gods per week. You can also try any god for free in the Jungle Practice game mode (basically where there are target dummies and whatnot) to get a feel for them before unlocking them.\n\nThe main thing that you can spend money on (since it's not generally advised to purchase gods individually with gems/money) are skins and voice packs, although there are some smaller cosmetic things like ward skins and player avatars. Many skins are goofy or are pop-culture references. Voice packs change the sound of your in-game audio communications (VGS[smite.gamepedia.com]) to be voiced by your god rather than the default voice. Many skins will have custom (sometimes hilarious) voice packs. Purchasing a god's voice pack will also allow you to use the custom voice packs for any skins that you might own for that god.\n\n\nBut with every game there are some downsides, which I'll talk about now.\n\n\nThe servers are generally considered pretty underwhelming. Generally the servers (at least in North America, the ones I play on) are pretty stable, but every so often (few times a month) a day will come where the servers are screwy beyond belief. Additionally the base latency in the game is pretty high, and the server location for NA is questionable (all of NA has to play on servers hosted in Virginia, which is in the south-east US). While on other games and speedtest servers I will have latency of around 90-100 for servers on the east coast of US, for Smite my ping is generally 120-130. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, but it is a little disappointing.\n\nThere are also some issues with disconnects. While it's a rare occurence, sometimes people will arbitrarily be disconneted during the god picking phase, during the loading screen or mid-match. Doesn't seem like a big deal - reconnect and get back to playing right? Well sometimes, for reasons unknown, the game won't let that player reconnect no matter how many times they relog.\n\n\nAnother downside is performance / optimization. This is sort of a mixed bag - on one hand, it's really easy to achieve playable performance on lower end systems. Any modern(ish) computer with a dedicated video card should be able to get 60 FPS pretty easily. The downside is this doesn't translate over so well to higher end systems.\n\nMany users (myself included) have noted reduced performance over the past 7-12 months. Even though I have a high-end system (i5-4690K + GTX 980 Ti) that can run games like GTA V at their highest settings at 90+ FPS, on Smite I have to play on medium settings to avoid dipping to 60-75 FPS in teamfights. You may not have these issues - it seems a minority of users have experienced decreased performance, and HiRez says their internal testing has yielded nothing but improvements. But it's something to take note of: if you want extremely high framerates (120-144), you're going to have to make the game look like poop to get it, most likely.\n\nSo basically, the game performs lower than it should given what it looks like. It's easy to run on lower end systems, but with the way the game looks it really seems like it should get twice the framerate that it does for the higher end systems. The game is very easily CPU limited - it only uses like 30% of my GTX 980 Ti at highest settings.\n\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Smite. Very fun game, you can experience that juicy MOBA strategy and competitive setting with much more enjoyable character control. Downsides are persistent (but occasional) server issues and underwhelming (but not terrible) optimization.","April 28","true","863.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

I have been playing smite since it was in early beta. I am very happy to see it on this store.\n\nIt is a 3rd person MOBA. With several different game modes.\n\nMOBA aspects: 1v1 3v3 4v4 and traditional 5v5 with different maps for each game mode. Plus you can create custom matches to play with 2 to 10 players on any map.\n\n3Rd Person: Since it is in 3rd person, it gives you a higher level of immersion than the top down MOBAs.\n\nBalance: the game is very well balanced. Sure there are always going to be some charcters or items that seem OP, but they're not. If a newly launched character does seem OP the DEVs are quick to make adjestments and make it balance.\n\nNO PAY TO WIN: All things that can be purchased with money are PURELY COSMETIC. The only difference is that you can buy all the characters right off the bat or unlock them over a period of time. I DID NOT BUY THE CHARCTER PACK and I was able to unlock all of them. Plus there's a RENTAL option for you to unlock them for a while for a small in game currency.\n\nNo strict character roles: Also any character can be built to almost any role. It has great flexibility.\n\nAwesome Community: The community overall is mature and civil. Like normal human beings are. Unlike the ravage 12 year olds raised by wolves outside of human civilizations on most other MOBAs.\n\nReconnection:  If you get disconnected, you can reconnect back into the same match, provided the match isn't over.\n\nRating: 10 / 10.","September 17, 2015","true","781.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","3"

I keep trying to leave but I inevitably come crawling back.\n\nHonestly, the game is great fun. But make sure you que with friends because the community is at a deadly level of toxic. Not surprising after it picked up a larger player base following its release from beta, but sometimes I have to sit back and wonder what happened to this game. Community used to be great, laid back, friendly and willing to ♥♥♥♥ around in casual matches; but now I can hardly get through one match without some guy telling me I'm playing wrong, or going off the rails because we're behind a bit. But of course this would happen, it’s a great free to play game, and with that will come the undesirables.\n\nGameplay is solid, the frequent patches (which can be somewhat hard to keep up with) keep the game fresh, and there's a new god release pretty often (at least once a month, give or take a week) so the Meta is changing constantly. The number of playable gods have almost doubled from when I started playing, so new content is always available. (Although in my opinion god releases are a little to frequent for my taste). Due to the consistently growing god pool, the ultimate god pack is undeniably worth it. The price hasn't changed from 3 years ago, and all current gods + all future gods for £20 is a steal.\n\nI love smite I really do, it was my game of the year last year, and it will almost always be at the top of my lists, despite all things I hate about it. It’s definitely worth playing, its F2P for Christ sake, just be careful you don't get hooked.

Previously having played both Dota (Warcraft 3 mod) and LoL, the concept was already familiar to me. As a big fan of World of Warcraft, where abilities feel like they have a much heavier impact due to the perspective, it felt like this game could combine those positive aspects.\n\nThe game actually managed to surpass my expectations. Smite is extremely immersive and especially when you get started, the feeling of certain abilities is just amazing. I'd like to name Thor's ultimate as an example, an ability that takes you flying above the battlefield, giving you an overview of the action and allowing you to drop down on your enemies with your hammer, letting you decide where to land - all of this in 3rd person, so expect a rollercoaster ride of fun.\n\nThe graphics are alright, the community is great, balancing isn't the best, but still better than is most other mobas I've played (original Dota, LoL, Hots), and you can spend plenty of time on this game without getting bored (around 600 hours pre-steam for me at this point).\nListed below are the points that I find especially important and how I would rate them.\n\nGameplay and controls 10/10\nFirst up: It's a moba. I'm not going to explain how mobas work in general, as most people are familiar with the concept. 2 Bases, 2 teams, various lanes, minions, towers, objectives. Done. That said, Smite also has a lot of other game modes. Arena for casual fun, Assault for ARAM randomness, 3v3 Joust and 4v4 Siege for smaller groups, mode of the day of a special surprise, 1v1 Joust for those who really want to prove their individual skill.\n\nControls take a while to get used to, as there are so many things to consider: 4 movement keys, 4 ability keys, 2 active keys, 2 consumable keys, mouse for attacking and cancelling, VGS keys (I'll get to that later), back to base key, jump key, autowalk key. Not all of them are equally important, but they to play a major role. While you can get used to the standard setting, I recommend looking up "smite superior key bindings" for some more ergonomical and intuitive key bindings I created a while ago.\n\nGraphics 8/10\nWhat can I say? Don't expect a modded Skyrim. Better than most other mobas, but that's kind of expected when we're talking about 3rd person. Smite runs on Unreal 3 and that should give you a good idea of what it'll look like. Lighting effects are nice and what really stands out are the ability and character animations (I made various slow motion videos on that just to show these more). Model quality differs between newer and older characters, but many gradually get updated.\n\nMusic and audio 9/10\nMusic is more than decent, though eventually everyone grows tired of ingame music. The sound effects are great for the most part. What really stands out are the god voice packs for the VGS (see below), there's some amazing talent in there, for example Kevin Sorbo voicing Hercules - and why yes, he does say "Disappointed!".\n\nCommunication System 9/10\nSmite has the so-called VGS - Voice Guided System - that allows you to give your teammates very specific commands about what is going on with as little as 3-4 keystrokes. The system is started by pressing V (or whatever key you bind it to) and from there, you can see the subcontext menus.\nAs an example, V - R would bring you to the "Retreat" menu. Pressing V - R - R would make your character yell out "Retreat" (plus write it in chat), whereas V - R - 3 would be more specific, standing for "Retreat right lane".\nIn combination with the voice packs, some of these can become quite gimmicky and fun, while also being useful, so it's a great system overall.\nThe only thing the game is missing are context-specific pings. You can ping with left or right mouse for different colored pings with a different noise, but it would be nice to ping for help in a specific place or similar.\n\nBalancing 7/10\n..is ok, but not leading by example. I'm no game designer, so my opinion on this should be taken with a grain of salt, but while the game is in a balanced state most of the time, HiRez sometimes makes snap decision on what they should change, completely throwing the meta overboard. This is especially true with new gods, though the most recent release has been adjusted a little better.\nAlso, everything is balanced around Conquest and especially 1v1 Joust is ignored a little too much (balancing the map itself that is).\n\nReplay/Spectate System 4/10\nAn unusual point to talk about, but probably the biggest downside to Smite. There is a spectate function and most of the time it works fine, But that's about it. Awkward glitches in the spectate (minions walking backwards, players being invisible) occur quite often, there is always a 3 minute spectate delay, which makes sense for ranked games, but is annoying for coaching in custom games, and not every game is re-watchable. The navigation in the spectator is also rough, there's not even a timeline to go to a specific point in the game (unless I haven't found it to this day). Game replays are only saved for diamond division and above or when somebody spectated your game (which hardly ever happens). As the games are saved server-sided, they also get deleted with every new patch. All in all, this is probably the most annoying part of Smite.\n\nMonetization 8/10\nAs usual with f2p games, there are certain gimmicks you can buy. Different from for example LoL, these don't give you any actual benefits for your character though, so there's nothing that could be considered pay 2 win. An account level 30 player who spent hundreds on this game won't have any extra power on his character over a level 1 player who didn't spend a cent.\nHowever, you don't start the game with all gods unlocked. There are multiple options to unlock gods:\nBuy gods with favor, the ingame currency you earn for playing games.\nBuy specific gods with gems, the ingame currency you have to buy with real money or earn for weekly logins\nUnlock all gods and all future gods with the god pack (between 20-25$, depending on where and when you buy it)The third option is probably the best for long-term players, as it's much cheaper than unlocking gods individually, you're effectively buying the game for around 20$. You don't have to do this right away though - if you unlock gods with favor first, you get all this favor back when you unlock the god packs.\nUnlocking all gods with favor isn't impossible, but will take quite a while.\n\nAdditionally, skins, voice packs, loading frames, ward skins, announcer packs and other gimmicks can be bought. Quality differs great depending on when the item was created - the quality difference for a recently created skin and one that is 2 years old can be huge and they can still have the same price. Prices are not as high as in Hots or LoL, but still fairly high. Gem events and sales take place quite often though, so if you're not among the people who need to have everything first, you can strike quite a few bargains. As an example, even before the steam release, there were summer sales at the same time as the steam sale.\n\nLong-term entertainment 10/10\nCan't stop, please help.\nIn all seriousness: If you take the time to get into this game, it will probably suck you in for a long time.\n\nWould write more, but ran out of space. 9/10 would rec...","September 8, 2015","true","139.6"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","2"

I've been playing off and on since beta, and according to Smite guru statistics I've clocked in over 220 hours so far which is far more than most games get from me.  The reasons I keep coming back for more?  Its third person camera, WASD controls, and the fact that you have to actually aim your skills, all of which make you feel right in the action.  With a current roster of 70 characters to play as, all of whom are modeled after gods from mythology such as Hades, Fenrir, Anubis and so on, you'll have a lot of awesome choices to play as.  Besides all of that, there are a number of pretty cool game modes from your typical 3 lane MOBA map to an arena and more.  Play and earn favor to unlock characters to play, or buy the Ultimate God Pack (includes all current and future released characters) for a reasonable price.  This game is definitely worth trying.  Try it out, this is one battleground you'll be glad you joined.\n\nVVGL  VVGF\n\nVVGB","September 12, 2015","true","55.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","19","24","6","0"

The skins are really unique and many of them are are inspired by current events or have historic, cultural or mythological significance.\n\nThe game design is pretty light hearted, and the community is not nearly as toxic as other MOBAs.

Its pure PVP at its best. Plenty of different modes but conquest is the main one, although the others ar pretty healthy, get games within a minute at peak and off peak no more than 3 minutes.\n\nFree 2 play done right as well, you get some gods free, and their is a weekly rotation so its the same as LoL. You buy gods with ingame currency or if you prefer you can use gems which are basically real money. I bought the god pack for £20 and it was money well spent. Skins are what many people dump the ingame currency for, but as I said you can actually unlock gods with the favor you earn in game.\n\nIf you like MOBAs this is a very good take on it, and who said it needed to be top down anyway! I cannot recommend a game any higher than I do this, truly an amazing game and a lot of fun.\n\n(also, dont worry if you are not into MOBAs either, Arena is basically a deathmatch, Joust is a 3v3 mini version of conquest, you can also do that joust as 1v1 which is nerve wracking. Siege is a sort of conquest type map but ganking is MUCH more part of the game, and your gold income is very high pushing for lots of end game.)","September 24, 2015","true","351.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

How there's the 5 major roles:\n\n-Bruiser / Warrior\n-Guardian / Tank\n-Hunter\n-Assassin (Generally the Jungler)\n-Mage\n\nWell, in SMITE, this is no different. However, SMITE adds a completely new perspective -- third person. This will throw off even the most seasoned MOBA veteran for the first few games. You will hear sounds behind you as you're running away, and you need to use those sounds to better dodge abilities. When you're getting ganked, you might hear a sound to your left or right and that's your que to bail out.\n\nAll in all, SMITE is a unique game and has it's own vibe to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpiritSails/recommended/386360/","SpiritSails","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpiritSails/","137 products in account","Two years later. Nearly seven hundred hours played. Still going strong.\nSmite is easily one of the most accessible MOBAs out there. The game's 3rd person perspective and skillshot-based gameplay make it easy to pick and and play. That's not to mention all the practice modes that can help you find your footing in this marvelous world of gods and goddesses. Yet Smite still has room for complexity. This is the kind of deep meta that makes it such a popular game to stream and that makes the Smite Pro League one of the most awe inspiring eSports shows out there today.\n\nYet if pro play isn't your thing, if you just want to have a good time, that's no problem at all. Smite has five regular game modes that people actually play. If you want to take a break from the big world of Conquest, Smite's classic 5v5 map, you can have plenty of choices.\n\nYou have Arena, 5v5 team fighting in a stadium surrounded by adoring spectators.\n\n3v3 Joust, all the action of Conquest in a bite sized chunk.\n\nAssault, pure 5v5 fighting with all random gods and no laning phase, camps, or heading back to base to heal up.\n\nFinally, there's Siege, a unique little 4v4 map of objective-based gameplay.\nBut even if you somehow get bored of those five modes, there's still the Match of the Day. That's a daily, random game mode that keeps things fun. If you think buying one item at a time has gotten boring, then maybe the MotD can help you with a big pile of starting gold and infinite mana.\n\nIf you're worried about microtransactions, worry no more. The game has all kinds of built-in ways to get you the favor (earned currency) and gems (paid-for shinies) you crave. The Daily Rewards system can earn you 1,250 favor and 50 gems just for logging in and hitting the Collect button seven days in a row. Even better are free gems weekends, which net you cash just for winning games!\n\nGods are easy to get too. All new accounts start with five permanent free gods and five more that rotate every few weeks. With all that favor, and with enough dedication, you can get yourself all of the game's gods in a few months. If you'd rather not wait, there's also the Ultimate God Pack, which gives you all current and future gods for a one-time fee. At $30, it's easily one of the best deals in any MOBA.\n\nSo even if you have a terrible fear of everything MOBAs stand for, it's still worth giving Smite a go. I've seen everyone from Call of Duty veterans, to LoL refugees, to people who didn't like any MOBA that came before it play Smite and love it with all their heart. With an audience that big, and with a game that updates and adds new content as often as two weeks apart, what do you have to lose?\n\nJust be a god already.

There has been multiple cases of false positive bans, and their usually permanent and bans by IP. When Hi-Rez is ever confronted about this, they either ignore it or unbans the player and gives them some gems if they've gotten alot of attention on social media.\n\nBasically, tons of players have been falsely banned by opening game editing programs without even touching the game, and the bans are permanent and Hi-Rez ignores all chances of appeal by email. Open whatever injector (such as wminjector or cheat engine or just whatever) and you'll most likely get a ban without even injecting ANYTHING into the game. It's a stupid and ignorant way of dealing with cheaters. Yes it's effective, but the amount of false positives are insane.\n\nIf you ever consider to play this game, just be sure to NEVER get up in any difficulties with the support team, they won't help you, if you break a rule, expect a permanent IP-ban and no chance of appeal. Try to send support tickets and get greeted with a canned message displaying their EULA for whatever rule you broke. None of the appeals for bans are ever reviewed by a human, unless they got alot of attention by other players.\n\nI'm fed up with this game and support team, both of my accounts that I've listed got permanently banned for opening an injector whilst having the game open (even though you can risk getting banned by not even having the game open). And I've seen multiple cases of this happening to other players.\n\nThe game itself is fairly fun, but the creators can from time to time can be absolutely horrible at what they are doing, they won't listen to anyone, unless you post it on social media and build up tons of attention ofcourse :).","February 12","false","76.5"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","22","35","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joshiek/recommended/386360/","Joshiek","Joshiek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joshiek/","118 products in account","I've been playing SMITE since closed beta and I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in MOBA's but just can't quite get into the isometric MOBA's like DOTA 2 or League. However, SMITE does have plenty of issues that are easily fixed or balanced, which Hirez does nothing about.\n\nHere's some pros and cons:\n\nPros:-Smite is good for new moba players\n-The community is GENERALLY less toxic than other moba games\n-The Gods (Heros, Champs) are generally very well done and-\n-3rd person makes you feel more connected to your God\n-I don't consider SMITE to be a FTP game. Unlike DOTA, you have to grind to unlock every God with favor you earn. However you can purchase the Ultimate God Pack (for about 30$ last I checked?), which gives you all current and future Gods forever. This is the best FTP deal you will probably ever see.\n\n\nCons:-The community gets more toxic the higher your level gets. Still not as bad as other moba's, but still toxic nontheless.\n-Poorly balanced Gods. And still poorly balanced after public testing.\n-Hirez nerfs and buffs Gods only because of the SPL (Pro League). Leaving ranked and casual less important and broken.\n-Hirez constantly ignores broken Gods and underperforming Gods (That aren't always played in the SPL). Even after multiple community threads, comments, and even surveys.\n-SMITE is free, however ... in the recent year they've been adding more and more cosmetic skins that you can ONLY get in a chest roll that will give you a 1 and ___ chance of getting the item you want to buy, regardless of the money you spend. I want to spend my money on what I WANT, not what Hirez wants.\n\n\nSMITE is an overall great MOBA, even though it is still the baby in the genre. I would recommend SMITE. but be warned about the cons of this game. Hirez, like most companies, started out great but is generally getting more and more greedy by the day. And they do tend to ignore their community even more nowadays.\n\n\nI would give SMITE an 8.5/10.\n","January 6","true","638.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

Gods are leveled up from 0-10 but playing with that particular god and doing well with them, earning you worshippers. These are just an indicator of which gods are your favourite and once you reach level 10, allow you to buy a diamond skin reserved only for masters of that god.\n\nThe game is free and supports itself like many others by allowing you to buy boosters for exp and favor and selling cool skins that will make your gods look even more awesome.\n\nI played way back in the beta before it was on steam, and the base game has not changed very much, but they added and refined many features like losing and winning animations after battles, the hub where you buy, play matches or do pretty much anything in Smite and several other small changes.\n\nItems are bought with money earned in matches, much the same like LoL and Dota.\n\nThey have the classic conquest map which is three lanes and a jungle that everyone familiar with MOBA's will recognize along with Assault which is Smites version of ARAM. Arena and their special match of the day are unique to Smite and are my favourites, as they are usually fun and quick compared to the 30 to 40 minute long conquests I find myself locked into.\n\nA very good feeling and somewhat balanced MOBA that is fun to hop on whenever your bored or feeling like killing gods.\n\n- plays arena\n- carried team 12 - 2\n- team goes 2- 8\n- rage about my tornado being too good\n- lose\n10/10 would smite again\n\nPersonal Rating: 3.5/5","October 7, 2015","true","318.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Look up my accounts "FrozenSorrow2" or "NDRawr" for ingame statitstics on my two most-played accounts\n\nWould definitely recommend to people. I've played the PC version for hundreds if not thousands of hours across multiple accounts. Own the godpack on one account and would recommend that too.\n\nI've been playing this game on and off since open beta, playing for the first time in early October 2013.\n\nA lot of people told me when Smite first came out that it coppied a lot of content from League of Legends and other MOBAs. Admittedly, there are a lot of item, god, skin, and map similarities that are too close to be coincidence.. (the 'kawaii bastet' skin being released immediately after 'popstar ahri' ?? like cmon..)\n\nAfter that note, I would like to mention that Smite also has a lot of content that keeps it unique from other MOBAs. The most drastic of which is it's unique camera angle, but there are definitely things besides that. Smite doesn't have nearly as many gods as League of Legends has champions, but I hope it gets there sometime in the future.","September 9, 2015","true","0.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

However, the Smite developers are LISTENING to the community. They have already decided to return the weekly login rewards after just two days of feedback.\n\nAlso, as a beta player who has played over 700 hours since, I think it is good we experience change in a game like this. Sure not everyone will like it, but within time you will get used to it and adapt to it, just like in other previous major patches. As shown, Hi-Rez are responsive developers, and in time they will fix the broken things that came with the new season.\n\nBe patient. Hi-Rez is trying new innovative things, finding some ideas that work and others that fail. However, the basic fundamentals are the same, and the game is still enjoyable (for me at least).","February 4","true","261.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xabzzx/recommended/386360/","xabzzx","Abz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xabzzx/","125 products in account","I give SMITE: 9/10\nThis is a F2P review so scores may vary | SMITE is my most favourite MOBA EVER!. I could never get into Dota 2 or League of Legends simply because they have an overhead view which I hate the MOST. Another reason why I could never get into those type of MOBAS was because they require no skill to play (No hate but this is my opinion) where as everything in SMITE is required by skillshots which makes the game more challenging, yet more fun. It seperates the noobs from the pros.\n\nI can proudly say, I own all the Voice packs, 2 Limited skins, 150+ skins (not recolours) and many more items. Why do I own so much of that stuff? Simply because this game is one of the most generous and fun F2P's out there. I'm so proud to see how far SMITE has come (I was a player before this came on steam).\n\nPros\nThis game is generous in every way possible. They provide gem events, which allows players to earn gems that you can buy with transactions. This method will allow players to buy cosmetics that they can't get which I think is the most helpful thing a F2P can do.\nThe gameplay is beyond amazing, I love everything that this game has to offer. It allows plays to time their skill shots, combine skills etc which makes the game so much fun. Yes this game is a team-based game therefore you have to work together, but there are also several other modes that you can enjoy yourself with.\nThe third person makes this MOBA the most unique MOBA out of all the others out there. I love the fact that having a 3rd-person MOBA makes the game full of action, and unlike LOL or Dota, you can actually see where you're god is in the team fights.\nThere are tons of maps and gamemodes which makes the game fun whereas in LOL there is only 1 map with 1 mode which makes it dull and boring in my opinion. I would always like to see a variety in games because then it shows that the company is innovative.\nThere are many gods to play aswell as god rotations which allows users to play gods for free, I mean can you get any more generous?\nThe prices are pretty cheap. The transaction in the game are so cheap, I mean there is a godpack that you can buy for a low price which unlocks ALL gods as well as ALL future gods. Need I say more?\nThe community is one of the most active gaming communities out there. The devs listen to people broadcasting their opinion on reddit and they actually change to what the community is requesting depending on the volume of posts relating to the issue. I think its good that the devs interact with the community because you feel closer to the game.\nSMITE is basically a history lesson because its based on gods from real mythologies so the kit will be related to that god or goddess.\nCons\nOne of the worst things about this game is the fact that it sometimes has server instability. It doesn't matter how fast your internet is, sometimes you will get the occasional high ping spike which can put you off the game and mess up a kill. This is something that could be developed.\nPerformance can be an issue (although it hasn't been with mine). I've heard by some community memebers that the performance sometimes lags and the FPS doesn't stay consistent so be careful when chosing your settings. Even at low it can lagg for some people with high rigs.\n'Forgotten Gods' don't recieve the same love as they use to when they were first released (Yes im talking about Hades, Arachne etc). It would be better if they also get the same love as other gods as their are many fans of the forgotten gods.\nHi-Rez in generall have some of the worst account security. My friend recently got hacked and she hasn't heard response from the Hi-Rez support team in over 2 weeks. Security is something that should be developed to an advanced stage by Hi-Rez studios.\nI hope you have enjoyed my review of SMITE. I recommend this game to ANYONE who is bored because trust me, this game will blow your mind with the amount of free content it has.\n\nGameplay        Graphics        Performance        Free-to-play aspect        Enjoyment        Overall                10        9        7        10        10        9.2","March 14","true","582.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","4"

It is played from a third person perspective rather than an overtop view, clearly adding a quicker style to the game. Instead of characters like champions from League, you get to play as a fairly large (and growing) cast of Gods and Goddesses from various cultures. If you are moving to Smite from another MOBA, you'll fit right in due to the original kits of the Gods to suit anyone's play style, and similar modes. The game also handles F2P really well, having a daily rewards system that gives the game's two main currency (favor and gems) over the course of a week. Things like skins, although a bit costy in favor and gems, are completely optional. New stuff including new Gods/Godesses and skins are steadily being added to the game aswell.\n\nThe community, although sometimes bearing the occasional tryhard, is good. Most of the time, you'll get someone who is really looking to communicate and play as a team. There's also a party system in which you can get friends together and play modes with each other.\n\nOverall, SMITE is a fun, action packed multiplayer MOBA and I suggest that you give it a go.","September 8, 2015","true","132.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

I find it is the best of its the best of its genre, and have had hours and hours of fun with this game and with friends. As the devs release new gods, it takes a while before they balance them, but eventually all the gods in the game get balanced, and ever single OP god can get countered in some way, whether its team composition, playstyle, or your character build. This is hands down the most fun I have had with teamwork based games. The community is good, but with this now on Steam I'm not sure how thats going to change. Its only every so often you get trolls on your team, but if you are a more advanced player, an easy fix is to play ranked matches for the most competative experience.\n\nMost Liked Feature: Gameplay/game style. The maps are beautiful and the mechanics of movement and ability use are what make the game so distinct and fun.\nMost Disliked Feature: Loki is ♥♥♥♥♥ OP You never see someone playing bakasura unless its random pick and they get him. This also goes for a few other underrated gods\n\nOverall, I find this game to be one of the best games for playability, integrity, and mutltiplayer. If you are a scrub with no friends, the game can still be enjoyed. 1/10 -IGN","September 8, 2015","true","389.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Sol is more broken than a broken vase. Other then that, Smite is amazing. I've never had any matchmaking issues.","October 25, 2015","true","990.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Players choose from a diverse cast of deities and use their unique powers to triumph over the opposition in 5v5 team matches. SMITE is a new take on the MOBA genre; rather than observing from above the action, the game’s third person perspective puts players into the thick of combat. Instead of clicking the mouse to move, players use the familiar WASD keys to move and fight their way through SMITE’s dynamic battlegrounds.\n\nI am playing smite over the last 2 years and I am proud to say if you are like real action MMO and Pure Skill Based game then SMITE is the game for you. I know many MOBA are there which are just point click atack and no fun but in smite you need to use every attack with skill so it will be real fun. you should atleast try it once.","September 11, 2015","true","142.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_Celador/recommended/386360/","aka_Celador","Celador","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_Celador/","205 products in account","I've been playing Smite for a couple of years and out of all mobas i've tried this one is the least annoying and aggravating... mostly due to the fact that there aren't as many kids playing or the fact that you can't talk to enemy team or voice chat in game.\n\nYes there can be quite a lot of rage from your own team and after the match but overall losing is not as punishing and enraging here as in the most moba's.\n\nYou could say that Smite is more "casual" than other moba's. This is due to the fact that there are different game modes on different maps, some of which are easier and faster than classic 3 lanes mode. Third person view and actual targeting make this game even easier on most characters. Ability to surrender at 10 minutes also hastens the process.\n\nThere are however some issues and oversights which unfortunately make this game inferior to Dota 2:\n\n1) Matchmaking. Its downright horrible here. The game apparently tries to put experienced played with less experienced players and often ends up grouping really new players against several good players. In fact you often get a 5 stack clan or team versus 5 solo que players which is quite bad for a competitive game. Quite a lot of times i've ended up with someone who apparently just started playing on my team and someone who's been playing for years on the other team and had a much higher rating than anyone on my team and vice-versa. Grouping up with lower level players also allows to get some easy wins.\n\nBasically - the matchmaking is nearly completely random in here.\n\n2) Bugs and reconnecting issues. Servers are prone to crashing in Smite and disconnects are quite common as well. The worst part is often being unable to reconnect or when it happens after you already won and it doesn't count as a win. You often get "deserter" status as well which will prevent you from queuing again for some time and lose your goodwill which adds a bonus amount of points each game. Its impossible to get a single day without at least several games where someone would crash or dc.\n\n3) Disconnecting players. They are VERY common. Unless you are playing with your clan - get ready for 1 or 2 people dc'ing and often not coming back. Especially in Arena and Assault modes. Either due to bugs or their pc's or whatever. The worst part is - there is no handicap. You can't get more gold, you can't control or swap to other gods. You will get slightly more XP but more often than not it won't help you much. Unfortunately the game will still count towards your won/lost count and you can't leave it early. In fact - you can't safely leave games at all here, unless you surrender after 10 minutes.\n\n4) Bots. Basically there is no point in playing versus them. You don't get any rewards (besides miserable amount of points, no xp, no gems) and they are almost completely passive and absolutely dumb. The bots in Dota 2 at least know how to gank up on someone and can pose some challenge while in Smite you can destroy them alone with your main attack. As a result there is no way to practice at all before playing versus people. The bots haven't been updated and no new bots were ever added.\n\n5) Complete imbalance of some gods. Unfortunately there appears to be only two way new characters are released - either they are so weak they require 3-4 patches or even an overhaul to become viable, or they are so overpowered you just roll your eyes and hold on until you can surrender. This appears to be a result of clashing between a couple of devs, one of which keeps pushing for OP characters and the other one keeps adding weird "special needs and situations" characters. Recently they've released Khepri which is the only one god that can resurrect people and counters quite a lot of other gods in most situations and they released Ravana which is mostly useless despite receiving 5 or 6 buffs already. Before that we had Nox which received an overhaul... but it took almost a year for devs to admit she was useless. Unfortunately it takes weeks before devs fix broken overpowered characters and even more to buff underpowered characters. To this day they haven't done anything to Bellona which quite often becomes indestructible or to Ah Puch which basically guarantees you can win in an assault mode.\n\n6) The store. There is no way to refund your purchases, no way to sell your skins, no way to get some skins if you just started playing and missed beta or special events. Personally i feel like they overprice their skins as well. While the top tier skins often look nice they come no where near the quality you get from Arcana or even simpler items in Dota 2. The different voice lines are nice though. 8000 gems (80 euros or 90$) would get you about 10-20 different tier skins and a few voice packs, provided you buy chests and during sales. In Dota 2 i've made some money just by playing and getting items or investing in some items and reselling them. In Smite it feels like im just throwing the money away and not getting enough in return. Not to mention that you don't get all gods for free and either have to buy a god pack for 20 bucks/euros or play free rotation gods.\n\n7) Graphics. No way around it - they are quite dated. On the other hand - game is not as demanding resource wise as Heroes of the Storm for example. You do get a feeling that you playing an older game though. Hopefully they'll update the graphics someday and add DirectX11 support.\n\nI would recommend not spending your money on it unless you played for at least half a year. I would also recommend waiting for special events (like upcoming Odyssey this winter) or tickets with multiple rewards or 50% sales on chests. I would also not recommend going into Conquest (classic) mode right away and trying Arena or Assault first as they are faster, easier and more enjoyable for new players. The perfect starting gods are Ares and Neith, which are available for free and probably two most versatile characters in the game, Ares being able to support (meaning tanking in Smite) and deal damage, and Neith being able to deal a lot of damage, disable and escape.\n\nOverall the game can be fun and can provide you with an easy, less challenging experience than most moba's. You can easily learn some of the gods and if you can master some of the harder ones you can become one of the Bellona's or Ao Kuang's that everyone hates.","September 8, 2015","true","16.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I recommend this game, but there are few "but"s.\n\n1) Balance. In MOBA you have to play current meta-based champions. I mean, the gods that are more powerful than others during the current patch. You won't be able to play every god you want and have fun if you can't deal with unfairness. You will probably rage-quit ( for newbie it won't be visible, but when you are good with this game, you'll know what i'm speaking about ). So, it depends on your "perception of the world".\n\n2) Donate, Don't get me wrong. It isn't concerned with the balance. The terms: some skins can't be bought that easily. You'll have to buy icons, frames, some unnecessary stuff you won't ever need to get the skin. It's kind of irritating and i don't support that kind of policy.\n\n3) Community. This community hasn't gone far away from the community of tha game, that begins with the letter "D". And there is all that can be said about it.\n\nIf you are ready to face this, this game can give you a lot of fun. If you are looking for MOBA, but you aren't a fan of the games begins with the letters "L" or "D", give it a try.","September 9, 2015","true","48.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","2"

BUT SMITE is set in the third person camera angle which means you are in the fight which for a person that likes FPS's and third person hack and slash games interested me.\n\nSmite still stays true to MOBA genres games modes while also including other games modes that are not seen in other games, you are able to play the classic mode which Conquest, league of legends players will know this as summoner's rift as well as pure 5v5 death match or a game mode also known as assault which leagues counterpart would be Aram.\n\nThere are currently 69 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) characters in the game and every month a new character is released to the public all these characters are all gods or god like characters and mythological beings, this ranges from the well known gods such as the Norse Thor and loki to the lesser known Mayan gods, each god belongs to a class of which there are five assassin's, warriors, hunters, Guardians and Mages the good part his most characters can perform outside of their roles in other areas as well so there is a degree of flexibility to the characters of smite.\n\nCurrently to own all 69 Gods it only costs £13.99 this is to celebrate smites arrival on steam the ultimate god pack includes all gods that are released up until this point and ALL FUTURE GODS THAT ARE MADE which is insanely good,\nSkins are also in this game so you can customise how you want your chosen god to look these do cost real money however there are skins that can be bought with in game currency that you earn when you finish a match.\n\nThis game is proabably one of my top favourite multiplayer games I fully recommend this game to people that are not that into Mobas as it is different in the way the game plays compared to the other MOBAs which in my case was good enough for me.","September 8, 2015","true","481.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

I've played hundreds of hours of Smite before Steam launch. Smite is a MOBA that is not only friendly to new players, but to Veteran players as well. Smite is the only MOBA I've seen that allows players to earn the Premium currency of the game (Gems in this case) and it makes it so simple and fun because cosmetics can be earned by just playing the game during events or just Logging Into the game. Smite is a MOBA that is as Action based as it is Strategy and all stategy pushed me away from most MOBAs at first. Back when I first started playing League of Legends I found it fun, but I got bored very quickly and couldn't play for very long at once. Smite however made me want to sit down and play for hours! It's third person aspect put me into the fights and I love the skill based Basic attacks and the Majority of the abilities. Smite is constantly being worked on and Gods are always being added which is  always a big plus!\n\nSo my final overall view on this game is if you want a MOBA that is very fun, action packed, and a little more relaxed than other MOBAs Smite is definitely the game for you!","September 9, 2015","true","212.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

BUT SMITE is set in the third person camera angle which means you are in the fight which for a person that likes FPS's and third person hack and slash games interested me.\n\nSmite still stays true to MOBA genres games modes while also including other games modes that are not seen in other games, you are able to play the classic mode which Conquest, league of legends players will know this as summoner's rift as well as pure 5v5 death match or a game mode also known as assault which leagues counterpart would be Aram.\n\nThere are currently 69 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) characters in the game and every month a new character is released to the public all these characters are all gods or god like characters and mythological beings, this ranges from the well known gods such as the Norse Thor and loki to the lesser known Mayan gods, each god belongs to a class of which there are five assassin's, warriors, hunters, Guardians and Mages the good part his most characters can perform outside of their roles in other areas as well so there is a degree of flexibility to the characters of smite.\n\nCurrently to own all 69 Gods it only costs £13.99 this is to celebrate smites arrival on steam the ultimate god pack includes all gods that are released up until this point and ALL FUTURE GODS THAT ARE MADE which is insanely good,\nSkins are also in this game so you can customise how you want your chosen god to look these do cost real money however there are skins that can be bought with in game currency that you earn when you finish a match.\n\nThis game is proabably one of my top favourite multiplayer games I fully recommend this game to people that are not that into Mobas as it is different in the way the game plays compared to the other MOBAs which in my case was good enough for me.","September 8, 2015","true","481.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

Oh yes, it's a pvp. What did you expect? Community FULL of nice people? Nope...sorry xD not in a moba.\n\nOkay now that I've pulled out literally everything wrong with this game that I can think of let's get to the pros:\n-It's a unique take on a moba and feels really good to play.\n-Optimized quite well for MOST operating systems.\n-73(and counting) playable gods.\n- Mostly balanced gameplay( as I mentioned before there are some really unfair gods in this game)\n-The general community( not all sadly) are quite nice actually, made some friends on this game.\n-The third person view is pretty nice in terms of making you feel slightly more part of the game(I'm weird, I know)\n-The maps are really nicely designed and layed out. Plus there is quite a variety to choose from(well for a typical moba)\n-Has some pretty fun gamemodes.\n-Super intense pvp.\n-It has voice emotes which are cool.\n-Funny noobs xD\n-Really cool art style and character design.\n-No p2w\n-Stuff that you should check out because I forgot the rest.\n\nSo my honest opinion of this game is altough it has some issues and has had me rage quit quite a few times, it's still really fun and worth a go if you like moba or just want to try something unique. I would recommend giving this game a go. So download it, start playing, get rekt, look up builds and then rek. Then come back and tell me I was awesome for recommeding this game to you. If you don't like it, I did not write this review. :D","February 17","true","267.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I get to write a review about one of the only two MOBA's I ever spent an absurd amount of time in. And I still do!\n\nSMITE Is a relatively average Third-person camera MOBA that is mostly rudimentary and has a name I CAPITALIZE on impulse. The game revolves around mythology, with all the gods/champions in the game being based around mythological tales from Greek to Hindu to chinese to Egypt to Mayan and So on. There might be more later, but for now that's all it currently is.\n\nIf you've played a MOBA you'll no doubt already recognize the layout of some of the maps and roles. We got Mage, Guardian, Warrior, Assassin, and...What was it, ranger? Basically DEEPS, Tank, Some mess of Tank & Damage, Glass cannon, and ranged crits. There are 6 gamemodes total, being Arena, Assault, Conquest, Siege, Joust, and Match of the Day.\n\nArena is basic circular arena all about 5v5 and landing your minions in enemy portal. Joust is single lane 2 jungle 3v3, Assault is single lane no jungle Random pick, Siege is Two lane, Conquest is traditional 3 lane, and Match of the day (MOTD) changes each day.\n\nMOTD can range from "ALL (X) 5V5" or "CONQUEST BUT WITH 100K STARTING GOLD" and other fun gamemodes. Some are stupid as all holy hell, others are amazing. Also in terms of Salt, Smite tends to not have very much unless you play Conquest, in which case you'll meet some of the saltiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s ever.\n\nThere are a lot of good points and a lot of flaws, so I'll break them down in a quick list.\n\nPROS\n+Amazing Roster, atleast 10 gods to each pantheon so far; with some designs looking downright amazing (Like Khepri!)\n+Usually fun community outside of ranked and the forums.\n+Matchmaking that searches relative to your level unless it for some reason takes nearly thirty minutes to find a match\n+MOTD"s always changing can offer fun gamemodes to goof off in.\n+Can buy pretty much every god in the game and in the future for $30 right now, and at time of this review it's on sale for $20!\n+They enjoy holding promotional stuff for free Gems, causing 'free gem weekends' that can net you atleast 400 or so gems each time. Not to mention the 50 gems you can get a week if you continually log in for weeks.\n\nCONS\n-Conquest, regardless of Ranked can drag out some of the most annoying and whiniest people you've ever seen.\n-There are numerous balance issues, arguably. It normally takes some E-sports person to abuse the OP before its fixed.\n-Servers can sometimes go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, crashing or lagging super hard. One even set off Malwarebytes IP defenses, but the admins were quick to take notice so it wasn't intentional.\n-Gem prices can be considered downright absurd.\n-Free Gem weekends can taint the Matchmaking pool, drawing out players who are hardly trying in hopes of being carried for easy gems. Also the saltiest folks ever.\n\nWhy do you play?: There are two MOBA's I actually bothered to play. Infinite crisis, and SMITE. Since IC was shut down due to stupid decisions that I won't go into here, I put all my time toward SMITE. And since i tried and ditched LoL and DoTA for various reasons, I ultimately stuck with this.\n\nWould I recommend it?: Yes! By all means, give it a shot. If it's not your thing, no big deal. I've had several friends try and just not enjoy it and that's totally fine.","September 9, 2015","true","198.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The reason SMITE is the only MOBA which works for some people is because of how unique it feels. The 3rd person camera allows you to control your character more like an MMO instead of clicking everywhere... This also gives you a more complete view of your battlefield and you need to watch your back too.\n\n>> In my opinion everyone should try this game <<\n\n>> 8/10 <<","January 9","true","12.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

There is a learning curve with it but once you get a hang of the mechanics it is a lot of fun! There are plenty of cool team comps you can do that are super fun to wreck people with. I also stream this game almost everyday and met some really cool people that make this game a lot more fun! If you are starting out, play the arena gamemode, learn the gods kits and what they offer to the table, follow the popular items that way the rec build doesnt screw you over sometimes ;). Its a love-hate relationship with this game but i just cant seem to put it down, so what can i say im addicted! There will be times where you will be frustrated with the game but dont let it bring you down, like everything else just live and learn. Watch replays of your games, see your mistakes and what you can do better for the next time you play! Also, LEARN the VGS system it is really helpful to communicate with your team since this is a team based game so its a group effort!

You will like it!", I'll instead tell you why I like playing it myself.\n\n1) Almost all abilities in the game are skill shots - even your basic attacks!\n\n2) The third person camera angle makes me feel like I'm actually a part of the game instead of just some random spectator from above.\n\n3) There are a lot of fun gamemodes to choose from!\n\n4) Instead of having to buy every single God in the game, you can buy the God Pack which will get you every god in the game AND any future Gods!\n\n5) You will get awarded with the in-game currency "Favor" by playing games and "Gems" by consecutive days of logins and through special events. In theory, you should be able to get every skin in the game without having to pay actual money if you are patient enough, though I suggest using some real money now and then to support the development.\n\n6) There are a lot of different achievements to get.\n\n7) You can customize your profile and gameplay in many ways with skins, player icons, announcer packs, ward skins, loading frames, voice packs and emotes.\n\n8) I saved the best for last! The in-game voice commands are the greatest I have yet seen in a game.\nYou will never have to type anything in the chat ever again. Using voice commands you will be able to say almost anything in the game with 3-4 button clicks.\nHere are some examples:\n\nVSBT: "Take this jungle buff!"\nVI3: "Enemies incoming right!"\nVBJJ: "Enemies in the jungle!"\nVC1: "Be careful left!"\nVBD: "Enemy ultimate down!"\nVVVR: "Ultimate is ready!"\n\nIf you'd like to check out all the different voice commands click here![smite.gamepedia.com]","September 8, 2015","true","925.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Smite is an real time action RPG 3rd person shooter, with MOBA elements. If you want to compare it to anything, look more at WoW PvP than DOTA. In fact, don't even go into smite looking to play the normal game mode. That's not important right now. Download, log in, do the tutorial, and go to the Arena and learn what Smite really is. The only God that Smite worships, is the almighty god of the Team Fight!\n\nDOTA/LOL/HotS would have you believe that the mechanics of a MOBA are more important than how you play. How can you have a MOBA without Creepscore? How can major objectives be taken 5 mins into the game? Why is ganking happening every 30 deconds! Why can almost every god play almost every role!?! Every DOTA fan that I have ever met says to me the same basic bullet points to justify playing one of the isometrics. We have heard it all, and when it comes right down to it, I always say the same thing. The one thing that no one can argue no matter how hard they try that Smite has over its competition.\n\nSMITE IS FUN.\n\nThat's it. I don't care how complex your game is. How much more skill you claim to have because you play an Isometric Moba. I don't care how complicated your item system is. None of that matters to me, unless you can have fun as well. Smite doesn't care about complexity. Its complexity is in its simplicity. Here's a god, here's his kit. Be better than your opponent. Oh your opponent is outfarming you. Outplay him. Gank in duo lane and you are on the other side of the map. 30 second walk to the other side or fly accross the sky on your chariot of fire, or crash down on them with the power of olympus. Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and ♥♥♥♥♥ dodge.\n\nI, along with all the Smite playerbase, can talk about this game for years, and I am not ashamed to say that my play time is 35 days, or 840 hours, and that's nothing compared to most players that I know. Hi-Rez studios is an amazing company that is very open with its fanbase, and the SPL (smite pro league) is amazing to watch. I can't wait for SWC 2, and to see what this game has for me next.\n\nTL;DR Download this game, Play Arena.

The MOBA takes a unique twist by bringing your camera to a horizontal view for a more immersive and action packed view of your god and the battle. The graphics are just as beautiful to boot, and each god feels super unique and fun. Getting into matches is relatively easy and fast, and for the most part the servers are stable year round. A perfect change of pace when other games seem to disappoint!\n\n"But Kayana!" You ask, "You give glowing reviews for this game but still refused to recommend!"\n\nGood eye, chap. Let me tell you why:\n\nHi-Rez.\n\nA year ago, out of the blue, my account was banned for fraudulent purchases, which I was able to confirm from my credit union that this wasn't the case. When sending an email asking why, I never got a response. I tried calling the charging company behind Hi-rez, but their method of dealing with customers is to pretend they can't hear you then hang up within 30 seconds. In the end I was forced to claim fraud on Hi-Rez just to get my money back.\n\nSo this is my official reason for saying no, if you love the game or just hate other MOBAs, then you might enjoy this game anyways despite my recommendation, but for the love of god: DO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY AT ALL. YOU WILL THROW YOUR ACCOUNT AT RISK.\n\nEdit: Something I forgot to add, if you think the community here is better then, let's say, League of Legends, well you'd be right, for your first 10 levels. Beyond that, good luck trying to find anyone nice. Chances are still higher then in League at least.\n\nEdit 2: If you're up for a game, I've been actively playing, add me if you wish, my ign is Kittyana.\n\nEdit 3: Had to contact Hi-Rez for support recently, as I expected, they gave some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t line as to why they couldn't help me then auto closed the ticket before I could reply back. Don't waste your time with their support, they won't help you with anything, ever.","February 18","false","391.8"," 43 of 80 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","43","80","5","9"

I am going to try and outline why you should try Smite, and why I am still playing it to this day.\n\nYou should try Smite because it is a great introduction into the MOBA genre, yet still has an amazingly high skill cap through skill shots and the WASD movement of gods. The controls are very similar to other 3rd person action games which makes it familiar to many gamers, rather than the RTS background of the majority of the other big MOBA's.\n\nSmite also has many different features to allow new players to get into the game without having to search up build orders and prefered skill leveling. Through the auto skill and auto buy functions, new players are given solid builds which will allow them to familiarize themselves with the gods kit without having to worry about the efficiency of the builds. Once new players are confortable with controls, they can turn off auto buy/level and move up to recomended builds, allowing them to counter build to their enemies as the game progresses.\n\nFinally why am I still playing Smite? The balance of the game is close to perfect, with only exeptions being that of new gods which usually take the limelight between balance changes to their kits meaning that there is always a fresh set of top picks for people to play, recent gods such as Ratatoskr was one of the strongest gods in the game until after weekly nerfs has found himself in a nice spot. Current weaker gods such as Zeus is going to have a rekit to bring him to the front of Smite again. This constant change of top gods make the game very replayable.","September 8, 2015","true","172.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Also the fact that you cant buy stuff that's not compatable with your character (No Swords or Hammers for Mages and no Magical Staffs for Physichal characters) makes it even better.\nYou can buy 6 items like in Dota or LoL, but you also have 4 additional slots for your active items and consumables (2 for each).\nSo far the biggest struggle for me are voice commands, but It's nice that they are there, along with Pings on mini-map, this can save your time if you know the right key-combo to say something to your teammates.\nThe game gets updates frequently, getting more Gods and balance changes along with some sick skins for Gods.\nOne thing I don't like about skins is that there are Golden and Diamond ones, they simply look stupid and unoriginal,\nI see how devs wanted to go for CoD-like(I'm very funny) experience, but they simply look aesthetically ugly.\nThere are also rewards for playing game every day and for reffering friend who told you about this game.\nSo yeah, try it, if you liked MOBAs but hated their strategyish look than you will love this game, for sure.","November 23, 2015","true","258.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've been playing since very early BETA, so I have some pretty good experience with this game.\nThis MOBA is nothing like DOTA or LoL, Similar concept with the lanes/jungle/tower but the gameplay is what makes this one stand way above the rest. 3RD person, full WASD control over your God so you actually feel like you're in the fight. I'd have WAY more overall playtime and more Diamond Gods if didn't get bored so easily, I can't play the same game over and over or I'll wear myself out, enough about me, more about SMITE.\n+PROS\n+BEAUTIFUL maps and enviroment, the battlegrounds have come a LONG way.\n\n+Not PTW, only things to be bought are skins, icons, voice packs, and a BOOSTER(Affects Favor, XP gain for your overall profile level, and worshippers for god mastery.)\n\n+The VGS system, great for communicating with PUGS. VEW=WooHoo! VVVR=enemy Ultimate Incoming! VSBN=I need the jungle buff. And so much more, this game also has CURSE voice intergration if you have it.\n\n+Matchmaking can be very good on some days, Get queued in seconds, and other days, I've waited as long as 4 minutes, so it can be hit or miss.\n\n+Different game modes, theres quite a bit of variety in this aspect, there'd also a match of the day, which can be tons of fun.\n\n+Skins, there are some pretty awesome and amazing skins in this game, some are exclusive, and as mentioned above, each God has their own Voice Packs that go with the VGS system I explained above, it's basically changing the way your VGS commands are heard, through your gods voice. BUT some skins will change the Voice Pack, and there are some pretty funny ones in there. If you're a sucker for little things like that, this might be for you.\n\n+Pantheons, as of right now, there are 7 different Pantheons that hold different gods from each one, Egyptian, Chinese, Norse, Greek, Mayan, Roman, and Hindu. The Japanese pantheon I've heard has plans on being introduced early 2016.\n\nThere's many more positives to be listed but I don't feel like getting too crazy with this.\n\n-CONS\n-God Balancing, this one is huge. When HiRez first releases a god, they are over powered to hell and beyond, it's been like this for a while, then within a few weeks, they -usually- get nerfed to the ground. As of the time I'm writing this review, one god, Sol, needs attention, she's been out for sometime now and is still, over powered.\n\n- The community, this is the same across all MOBAS i'm sure, but I feel the need to express it here, you WILL encounter some VERY salty kids, nobody ever wants to admit that someone was better than them in this game it seems. You just need to hang in there and ignore that hatred, there are some diamonds in the rough though, I actually met my best friend through SMITE 2 years ago.\n\n-As of right now, this game seems to have a memory leak issue. I haven't looked into it myself personally, but after playing for 3-4 hours, my fps drops and dips constantly, it's easily fixed by a simple restart of them game, I've seen others complain of this issue, but it's nothing too harmful.\n\nAll in all, this game is awesome, and let's just say it's good enough to constantly keep bringing me back to it, there's always some fun in this, and overall a very good game to get into if you're into the MOBA genre.\n\nKeep in mind, this is MY personal opinion and review, I know some may disagree with what I've said, but oh well.\n","December 23, 2015","true","121.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

One of its big features is the fact that it's third person rather than top-down which can make the game more accessible to other audiences. Another welcome feature of this game is the ability to use WASD rather than having to press the RMB all the time. These two simple features makes the game fun for MOBA newcomers and veterans alike.","October 11, 2015","true","314.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LycaNinja/recommended/386360/","LycaNinja","Lyca","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LycaNinja/","836 products in account","It's been out on Steam for less than a day and I've already managed to play it for 60+ hours. I wonder if it's fun... Kappa.\n\nSMITE, made by Hi-Rez Studios, the company behind Tribes: Ascend and upcoming Paladins, is a challenging MOBA to master - you don't click rapidly across the screen as you would playing DOTA 2 or League of Legends as it's more like a third person shooter with abilities instead of bullets (Unless you're playing Apollo; finger pewpew). The most popular game mode is called Arena which is very casual friendly and allows you to play without much game knowledge prior to jumping in (though I highly recommend doing so as not everyone will be nice to you).\n\nThe game's modes include:\nArena, 5v5 game mode where the goal is to get kills and lead minions into the opponent's portal located by their base. First to reduce the opponent's ticket total to 0 is the victor.\nJoust, 3v3 game mode where the goal is to kill the enemy Titan guarded by a phoenix and a tower. First to defeat the opponent's Titan is the victor.\nConquest, 5v5 game mode with three lanes, the iconic mode of the game and the one the pro scene is based upon - as well as the balancing (which is why some gods might seem overpowered in other game modes). You play one of five roles in a normal game - ADC, the late game sustained damage dealers, Support, the tanky ones that protect the ADCs and help lanes, Mid, the mages that do burst damage, Jungle, the assassin that sets up kills for the team or themselves to win you the game, and Solo, which is usually stopping the opponent from doing things they want to do. ADC and Support will go into the Duo Lane, which is the longest lane (tower distance) next to where the purple buff is, Mid obviously goes to the middle lane, and Solo goes to the shortest lane next to the blue buff, and Jungler roams around the map where needed. This game mode takes the most practice and game knowledge to play well in. The objective in this game mode is also to kill the opponent's Titan, but it has 3 phoenixes and 6 towers protecting it (which with each one still alive, he is tougher to kill).\nAssault, 5v5 game mode where everyone is in a single lane with a random god they could pick in a normal game and the objective is once again to kill the Titan protected by 1 phoenix and 2 towers. I recommend getting Salvation in this game mode (and basically never outside of it once you learn mana control) as you can heal your entire team and keep them fighting longer. You cannot return to your base after leaving it in this game mode, so you need to make sure you have everything you need from the store before leaving (or using Nu Wa ulti as that counts as leaving). Another advanced tactic in this mode is to "give your death to the tower" which means you let their tower get credit for your death when you need to go get something so they don't get gold for killing you.\nSiege, 4v4 game mode with two lanes where the objective is yet again to kill the Titan protected by 2 phoenixes and 4 towers. You usually have one physical and one magical god per lane. You may spawn siege minions that are giant beasts that do massive damage to towers, by getting 100 tickets gained by taking camps and doing well basically. You can also spawn a free one by killing the monster in the middle of the map. You can use a portal at the base to teleport instantly to a siege minion on your team. You cannot buy normal wards in the game mode however, so you have to use counterwards called sentry wards, which means you can only have one ward yourself and they are more expensive. Also since your opponent is also buying only counterwards, they will be able to destroy your ward after placing theirs and hitting your ward three times.\nMOTD, ?v? game mode that is highly regarded as the most fun out of all of the game modes and can range from any number of things. This is a fun game mode, but I cannot give any advice or help beyond that it could be any number of people on any map and use gods you dont even own.\nLeagues: Conquest, This is the exact same thing as Conquest, but it's ranked and requires you to be level 30 and have 16 gods mastered, though you should have more and atleast 3-4 of the top gods in every role. This is so you may pick gods for your teammates to trade with you when needed. Both teams can pick two gods at the start of picking gods to ban so nobody can play them. This includes any and all new gods instantly being banned away. After each team has three gods each, they both get another ban to use. Nobody can have the same god in this game mode and I recommend not doing this alone (you can team up with another person if you are close enough in the ranked scoring) or if you do, make sure you know the meta (the best way to play conquest as it's practiced and learned ideals) like the back of your hand.\nLeagues: Joust, This is on the same map as Joust, but instead of 3v3 it's 1v1 with bans like Leagues: Conquest has. This is a great way to learn what gods counter other gods and improving your mechanical gameplay experience. It's also much easier to get to Masters rank in this game mode as compared to Leagues: Conquest, which is much harder.\nI recommend trying the game out yourself before judging it as it’s Free-To-Play, and if you like it enough you should consider the Ultimate God Pack, as it’s the best deal I’ve made in a video game ever.\n\nI recommend the following Smite Twitch streams for different things depending on what your goal is:\nSmiteGame[www.twitch.tv] - This is the channel to follow for watching multiple streamers and pro games.\nWeak3n[www.twitch.tv] - This is the Jungler for AFK eSports and is the most helpful pro player of all time at this time. He has multiple helpful guides on his YouTube channel, multiple recommended and tested builds (items to buy on gods in Conquest), and will assist you if you ask him for help in a nice way on Twitch.\nLassiz[www.twitch.tv] - This is the Mid laner for Team Eager and while he is a great player and has a great personality, he is more of an entertainer type of streamer and therefore contrasts Weak3n. If your goal is to have fun, crack a beer, and just enjoy the game, this is likely going to be your main man.    MLC_St3alth[www.twitch.tv] - This is the Mid laner for Cloud Nine and is one of, if not the most humble and nicest guys I’ve ever communicated with ever. Not only is he an amazing guy, he can ♥♥♥♥ you up with Scylla’s dogs while playing with his dog Stella.\nJeffHindla[www.twitch.tv] - This is the Support for Cloud Nine and is literally the embodiment of Sex.    Incon[www.twitch.tv] - This is the Support for AFK eSports and is, in my opinion, a mix between MLC and Lassiz in the way he streams and does many charity events.\nBarraccudda[www.twitch.tv] - This is the ADC for Cloud Nine and is a chill and excited man that enjoys stating he is on drugs and is the best team in the world at SWC.\nThere are many other Twitch channels I love but I’m out of room; you should be able to find your preferred stream if you look around.\n\nIf you are new to the game and would like to get bonuses, use the name LycaNinja as your referred player while creating your account and I’ll play with you and try to help you out, which will also give you and I both benefits for playing the game together.","September 8, 2015","true","382.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am going to try and outline why you should try Smite, and why I am still playing it to this day.\n\nYou should try Smite because it is a great introduction into the MOBA genre, yet still has an amazingly high skill cap through skill shots and the WASD movement of gods. The controls are very similar to other 3rd person action games which makes it familiar to many gamers, rather than the RTS background of the majority of the other big MOBA's.\n\nSmite also has many different features to allow new players to get into the game without having to search up build orders and prefered skill leveling. Through the auto skill and auto buy functions, new players are given solid builds which will allow them to familiarize themselves with the gods kit without having to worry about the efficiency of the builds. Once new players are confortable with controls, they can turn off auto buy/level and move up to recomended builds, allowing them to counter build to their enemies as the game progresses.\n\nFinally why am I still playing Smite? The balance of the game is close to perfect, with only exeptions being that of new gods which usually take the limelight between balance changes to their kits meaning that there is always a fresh set of top picks for people to play, recent gods such as Ratatoskr was one of the strongest gods in the game until after weekly nerfs has found himself in a nice spot. Current weaker gods such as Zeus is going to have a rekit to bring him to the front of Smite again. This constant change of top gods make the game very replayable.","September 8, 2015","true","172.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I had heard many good things about it from friends, but I had also heard many negative comments from hardcore League or DOTA 2 players. “It’s not a real MOBA!”…“It’s so easy it’s boring!”…“Get gud nd play a real game, m8!”…etc ad nauseum. I wanted to form my own opinions. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised by the game.\n\nSmite is a MOBA at heart, but it plays more like a third-person RPG (i.e. Skyrim). It’s definitely a more casual game with an extremely short learning curve; players of more hardcore MOBA’s will be able to pick it up in one night. Gone is the “clicking simulator” movement scheme coupled with QWER ability controls that most MOBA players hold near and dear; in Smite, you control your player with WASD and aim with mouse, which is much more familiar and comfortable for non-MOBA players. However, with this change comes a downside: I found the ability keys cumbersome and hard to reach in a frantic team fight while still trying to move my character. The camera is shifted from the obilgatory overhead view to a third-person over-the-shoulder view, which I found gives the game a more involved, more personal feel. Most of the same mechanics and metagames found in other MOBA’s can be found in Smite, but with small twists to make them more accessible to casual players.\n\nSmite has three general gameplay modes that I discovered: The typical 5v5, three-lane map with jungles populating the remaining areas; a very fun, hectic 5v5 all-out brawl mode set in an open, circular arena, and “Joust,” a 3v3 mode similar to League’s ARAM maps, except with small “off-lanes” to either side with two jungle camps each.\n\nThe god characters are all extremely well researched, well designed, and well-voiced. There is an evident sense that someone put time and effort into researching a god’s lore to find the perfect design and ailities for him/her.\n\nI held off buying the Steam DLC that unlocks all current and future gods, but after playing the game for about three hours, I came to the conclusion that the game was definitely worth at least $20, and I would be happy to pay Hi-Rez Studios to continue what they’re doing.\n\nMy general impression of the game was simply “It’s fun!” The game is easy to pick up, the controls are fairly intuitive, and it looks fantastic. Smite doesn’t require the finesse and involved strategy of other MOBA’s, but that is by design. It was a refreshing take on the genre, and I’m definitely going to play more.\n\n[TLDR: If you’re looking for anther hardcore MOBA with a steep learning curve and high skill level, you’ll be disappointed. If you’re new to MOBA’s or just want a fun game to play, I think you’ll find yourself having a lot fo fun with Smite.]","September 14, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is a breath of fresh air from generic MOBA games, being a top-down perspective. But here, it's in 3rd person view.\n\nPros\n+ Easy to pick up and play. Gods can easily be mastered in about 2-3 matches. Also it's Free-to-play, NOT pay-to-win.\n+ For a game with an ancient mythology theme, the Gods are interesting to play as, and plenty more to come in later updates. EX: Hercules, Loki, Zeus, etc.\n+ Great graphics and sound. Nuff said.\n+ You are rewarded with points and gems(in-game currency) every time you log in daily. First win of the day is also rewarding.\n+ Variety of game modes and 1 random game mode each day. Arena is by far the most fun, being team deathmatch.\n+ Best boobs physics for Goddesses. EX: Neith.\n\nCons\n- No voice chat. You have to use Curse or Skype. Or stick to chat or use voice command system in-game.\n- Some Gods are INCREDIBLY overpowered if used skillfully. A skilled Loki player will definitely give you PTSD.\n- The jump button(yes there is, by pushing Space) is there for lols and has no function in combat, other than bunnyhopping for an achievement.\n\nOverall, it's free to play, it's fun, and is just enjoyable. And by fun, I mean it's so fun that you would stick to this game like glue and unistall League and Dota 2.","September 11, 2015","true","322.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","1"

Always has, and always improves. Most balanced game I've played (That doesn't mean it's 100% balanced, some Gods are broken at times). Developers really put the effort in to make it as enjoyable as possible - many in-game events such as the odyssey and Season ticket. Shop similar to ALL MOBAs, no changes to gameplay. Although they do offer many discounts and bundles, more than I've seen on other games. I enjoy supporting the developers, Hi Rez are one of the most loyal companies imo.\n\nYou are as good as your skill level. That's it.\n\nI've got every God mastered at least once.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/teutonicknight/recommended/386360/","teutonicknight","The Teutonic Knight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/teutonicknight/","89 products in account","This review is for those who are already familiar with MOBAs and have played Dota 2 or League of Legends. I will point out what makes Smite unique compared to those games.\n\n- Third person camera perspective. Unlike the classics, Smite does not feature a strategic top down perspective and puts you right in the action behind your character. This allows for much more precise movements and sneaking up to somebody doesn't necessarily require a cloaking ability.\n\n- (almost) Every ability in the game has to be aimed, including melee and ranged basic attacks! That's right, if you want to play the Ad Carry in Smite, prepare yourself to be completely useless if you can't land your basic attacks. Same goes for everything else: If you can't hit your abilities reliably, you will not succeed, there are precious few abilities in the game that do not need to be aimed. From the other perspective, this mechanic allows you to minimize your damage intake by being a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situations. Many times I was one hit away from death, but moving in circles and triangles and wavy lines and other sorts of unpredictable movements, I survived.\n\n- Playable Characters (Heroes, Champions) in Smite are real Gods from pantheons that were once (and some still are) worshipped. Norse, Roman, Mayan, Hindu, Chinese, Greek. Play as Zeus, Thor, Odin, Loki and many other gods and mythical creatures. HiRez Studios does a (mostly) great job at interpretating these well known deities into detailed playable Characters. And for those Deities you don't know, there is always a lore section for every god, so you even learn something about different cultures while you play. Yay, Knowledge!\n\n- 5 different game modes + one that changes every day. Unlike its competitors, Smite features many different game modes aside from the classical 5vs5 (Here called Conquest). Arena (5vs5, no lanes, Team Deathmatch), Siege (4vs4, Two lanes, small jungle), Joust (3vs3, 1 lane, small jungle), Assault (5vs5, All Random All Mid, 1 lane). The Mode of the Day changes every day and features fun setups (like 5vs5 on the Assault map and everyone get's the same god).\n\nAll of these game modes have their own, detailed and well crafted Map. In Conquest Mount Olympus opposes a vulcano, in Arena you fight in a grand Colloseum, in Assault you defend the Halls of Asgard from the forces of Chaos, in Siege you fight for supremecy in the lush Mayan rainforests and in Joust you're a knight for some reason (It will be changed to a Chinese themed map soon).\n\nIn addition to that, Smite features one of the best deals in a Free to Play game: The God Pack. The God Pack costs 30$ and contains every god currently in the game. Owners of the God Pack also receive the newest God as soon as they're released. FOREVER. That means, the more Gods join the battle of Smite, the more value you get for your 30$. You do the math.\n\nWhy should you play Smite over League or Dota? If you love mythology and you like the concept of MOBAs, but never liked the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional ones, Smite will be the game for you. It's highly skill-based with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenges and skills to master that traditional MOBAs do not have. I played League of Legends for 4 years, but after I got Athritis (This is a joke) from playing ADC and kiting for too long, I gave up. For me, Smite is so much more comfortable to play and the fact that I can escape my death and make great plays simply by evading and aiming my abilities carefully really drives me forward in a way traditional MOBAs never did.\n\nI will not end this review without pointing out things that bug me about Smite, I am not delusional:\n\nMany Skins in Smite are locked behind Chests, which you have to buy with real money currency and by opening them, you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want. It can be infuriating when a cool new Skin for your favourite God is announced, only to later find out it's in a Chest with 56 other items. HiRez abuses this a bit too much. Though we have the God Pack, so that balances it out.\n\nEU Servers can be very unreliable.\n\nQuality Control at HiRez is either non-existent or very bad. Some new Gods release in a pitiful state, either balance or design-wise. They have horrid animations, amateur-like voice acting and are either drastically underpowered or overpowered. Some God Designs are also very questionable. Sometimes they have ability kits that have nothing to do with their Lore, or in general are designed in such a way that they make no sense. Did you know the Spartans put the statues of Ares, the God of War, in chains to restrain him? Yeah, that's cool, but only a small footnote in his lore. Well, what HiRez did was base his whole ingame design on that little fact. He shoots chains and fire and runs around in plate armor with broadsword and shield. The shield has a demonic visage on it, where the fire comes out. Does that sound like the Greek God of War to you? Not to me.\n\nBut these things are minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience. I've been playing this game for more than a year, and only looking forward.\n\nIt's free in the end, so why not try it out and look for yourself?\n","September 8, 2015","true","217.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I've played countless hours, far more than steam knows. I am a huge fan of the game and like HiRez as a company - a one off payment gets all gods, present and future, pretty good deal. The game itself is great, as a previous fan of Lol and Dota, I have found Smite much more enjoyable and more intense. The community is varied, for a long time it was excellent but lately it has become more toxic, still less toxic than i remember Lol being - the reason i stopped playing Lol. Smite is very rewarding to land abilities and get kills through skill, my one dislike is the matchmaking. On more than one occasion I have been teamed up with famous names in smite. I'm not a good smite player, it's not fun getting stomped by players far better than yourself.

(No offense to LoL community.) I think this game is just a little more fun for me than LoL anyways. If you are new then I would say play Arena or Joust. My favorite game mode is mainly Joust and I love the game so much ever since I found out about it. I Mainly love playing as Anubis (Go figure) and Neith <3 Anubis is pretty broken with how much damage he can dish out and I love it lol. I wanted to write this just to tell people how much fun the game is and how much I recommend this game. I think the main reason why I love it more is because of the third person angle camera it has and that is a deal breaker for me!\n\nI mainly play this on XBOX ONE (Please don't hurt me :c ) PC is better yes but I love playing this more on Console, but I think this game is lovable no matter what!

Smite is an outstanding MOBA with so many unique features and mechanics that it's difficult to call it a MOBA. This isn't League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, or DoTA. This is SMITE. 3rd person, over-the-shoulder camera angles, Gods based off of various mythologies, various modes to suit any playstyle, and some of the best damn graphics a free-to-play game has to offer. Not to mention they have one of the best business models of any MOBA (next to DoTA with their sheer weight of money). $30 and you own EVERY god in the game. Present and Future Gods. Yep. Everything is simply fashion and cosmetic. Not a bad deal. Also, if you unlock gods before purchasing the Ultimate God Pack using the in-game currency, you get all of that back.

The art style of this game is absolutely great (well, depends if you have a potato, this goes for the graphics also) and brings an almost accurate depiction of the gods and goddesses. The game also hosts or has special weekends where you can earn bonus gems and favours (in-game currency), which can be one of the worst weeks of smite. To top it all off, the game itself isn't too bad and can be heaps of fun (have friends play with you). And beware of the odyssey and treasure chests, unless you want to take your chances (but both of them are a great addition to smite) because your wallets might disappear.\n\n","September 9, 2015","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only other MOBA I play is HoTs and I play a level 20 healer main there. There is no standalone healers in this game so I really have no choice but to play something I'm not comfortable with.\n\nPros and cons to me personally.\n\nPros:\n\n- Lots of gods\n\n- Active dev team\n\n- Various game modes (arena being my favourite)\n\n- Reasonably balanced for the amount of gods.\n\n- Some funny gods and voice lines.\n\nCons:\n\n- Not fun to learn when you keep getting 2 shot by other players. Puts you off the game as theres no way to learn what mistake you made you just leave spawn and boom, dead and yes I am following guides and builds.\n\n- Overpriced store. The micro transactions are just too expensive. 400 gems costs more than 2 TF2 keys and that is the price of 1 unbox. For somebody that has unboxed around 400 crates on TF2 I say its overpriced. Not to mention the fact skins you want are thrown in 1/100 crates so you never get what you want and there is no trading feature to trade for what you want, major let down for someone like me that is not afraid to spend for customization. TF2 is evident in my spending. (around $3000 spent)\n\n- No standalone healer support :(\n\nso I'm just gonna keep chipping away at this game with my friends and see if I ever can find that ideal god. I just wish with the new Japanese pantheon they would add the games first standalone healer, maybe Uzume. But the way the games meta is, it seems there will be no place for us healer mains to truely get into SMITE.\n\neither way I recommend.","February 5","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

I myself tried but never enjoyed the latter two mostly due to the control scheme and method by which the player interacts with the game.  I always felt as if I should've been playing an RTS, not a game that requires so much precision and reflex.  Some consider Smite's design to be the way MOBA's were meant to be played, and claim that the traditional DOTA style was a result of technical limitations; successors simply followed that format.  I can't say I disagree.  Smite is very intuitive to anyone who has played first or third-person shooters on the PC, or games like World of Warcraft.  I find it so much easier and more engaging to move with WASD and aim with a mouse.  It makes the game easier to pick up without lowering the skill ceiling, and gives players a sense of satisfaction when they have good aim or avoid the aim of their opponents.  After over three years of playing Smite, I can say with certainty that the game has only gotten better, and I enjoy it now more than I ever have.","September 8, 2015","true","439.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Smite also offer special MOTD (Match of the Day) with mild to intensive shenanigans and 5 other modes that brings something different to the table. The art style of this game is absolutely great (well, depends if you have a potato, this goes for the graphics also) and brings an almost accurate depiction of the gods and goddesses. The game also hosts or has special weekends where you can earn bonus gems and favours (in-game currency), which can be one of the worst weeks of smite. To top it all off, the game itself isn't too bad and can be heaps of fun (have friends play with you). And beware of the odyssey and treasure chests, unless you want to take your chances (but both of them are a great addition to smite) because your wallets might disappear.\n\n","September 9, 2015","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I myself tried but never enjoyed the latter two mostly due to the control scheme and method by which the player interacts with the game.  I always felt as if I should've been playing an RTS, not a game that requires so much precision and reflex.  Some consider Smite's design to be the way MOBA's were meant to be played, and claim that the traditional DOTA style was a result of technical limitations; successors simply followed that format.  I can't say I disagree.  Smite is very intuitive to anyone who has played first or third-person shooters on the PC, or games like World of Warcraft.  I find it so much easier and more engaging to move with WASD and aim with a mouse.  It makes the game easier to pick up without lowering the skill ceiling, and gives players a sense of satisfaction when they have good aim or avoid the aim of their opponents.  After over three years of playing Smite, I can say with certainty that the game has only gotten better, and I enjoy it now more than I ever have.","September 8, 2015","true","439.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you've most likely found out, it's played from a Third-Person angle instead of the usual Top-Down perspective most MOBA's have. But there's a lot more than that that sets this one apart from the others.\nAll playable characters in the game are based off of Gods from many different pantheons and cultures, and the list grows larger and larger about every 1-2 months. And in this game, I actually feel like the Gods have character and personality as oppose to other MOBA's or games in general. Hi-Rez studios keeps this game up-to-date with its usual weekly updates, and have in-depth notes and videos they post on social medias.\nBut enough about that, the maps and gamemodes I feel are well thought out, but at the same time very simple. Standard 3v3 Joust, 5v5 Deathmatch, etc. (You can also make custom matches with any rules you want and can invite friends to parties and clans.) The community I feel is fine, but sometimes you'll probably run into that hardcore pro guy that stops to type about every mistake you make but usually it's all good. Who knows you (You as in I,) may even need that constructive criticism.\nBut trust me here, I barely scratched the surface of what this game is like. You'd really have to play it for yourself.\nI definitely recommend you trying this out. New or experienced with MOBA's, you'll surely have a great time with this one, especially with friends.","September 9, 2015","true","153.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Only a few games have i felt like i was completely out of it and they do have the surrender option which is nice.\n\nI am not sure how the competetive scene is although i know there is a small one.

I would look for this to get allot of boost in popularity as well, and it will be interesting to see how the pro scene plays out from here and how valve and steam plan to make money off of it (lol).\n\nTry it its free and small! also they are merging all your accounts into one!!","September 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

That said i personally have better map awareness with map in the top right side VS the bottom of screen like all other MOBAs (ex LoL). The auto ability lvl feature is helpfull but not necessary. When learning a new champ/god it helps to put your abilities levels in order prior to a match & they stay there till you either uncheck the auto ability lvling just b4 a match, change them or get rid of them. Unlike other MOBAs Smite keeps ur pots seperate from your items so you can get that extra item or 2 if you were ever the type to keep them (dont know why but there are ppl like that out there). Also from what I've seen in other MOBAs Smite has more varity in match types (7 types atm). Just like any other MOBA its all about the "Objectives." If your not a team player or care more about your kill count then this is not the game for you. Only negative ive seen in playing this game are the few times when fellow team mates or the other team completely left their more squishy team mates alone an vunerable from the start.\n\nStill loving it & still cant beat the community.","December 6, 2015","true","26.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mastering this game requires mechanical skill, great awareness, patience, strategizing, team play ability, communicative abilities, accumulating a broad amount of game knowledge, memorizing timings on the spot, a competetive mindset...\n\nI am not going to lie. It is not the easiest game to get into and I myself had to take breaks from it. What really kept me hooked was having people to play it with to grind it out. I definetly do recommend playing this game with friends or eagerly searching for people to play with. It is a team game afterall and it makes it alot more fun.\n\nThat being said once you get into it is really fun. All the of the challenging aspects of this game aren't only intimidating but they are a also calling you out for challenge some might be eager to pursue and to accomplish. (Hard game? Challenge accepted)\nIt is one of my favourite pvp games. You win a pvp game by doing better then your opponent. And in this game there are a dozen of things you can do better in than your opponent to win the game.\nThere is no lost game. You might always outplay/outsmart your opponent, something other mobas lack I find.\n\nTo cut to the point. Should you play this game?\nAre you open for a challenging cooperative pvp game that requires you to reach perfection in an intimidating amount of aspects to do well in?\nAre you ready to invest a lot of time into a game to learn it from scratch and optimize your mechanical skill?\nAre you an open minded person, that thrives using communication to reach the full potential of not only yourself but of your entire team?\nThen I do recommend you check out smite.\n\nIf you are impatient though, faint-hearted, and easily get stressed out or if you just want something casual to burn time on, then unfortunately I can't recommend this game to you.\n\nIf you decide you are going to play Smite, here are some tips:\n-Find people to play with! I can't stress enough how much that will improve the experience for you.\n-Start using a mic & "curse voice" as soon as possible. (btw curse voice has great integration with smite)\n-Do analyze your mistakes. As a beginner you are doing EVERYTHING wrong. Therefore looking for mistakes is very rewarding. There will be many to find.\n-Be nice to people. Mute people that aren't nice.\n-If you have anger management issues use push to talk. It is a part of the being nice thing\n-Watch Smite streams and youtube channels of esport athletes.","September 8, 2015","true","112.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I have nothing but positive things to say about it. A lot of people are turned off by the term MOBA because they jump right to LOL. However Smite offers a new and fresh take on the traditional MOBA. By it's use of a third person control scheme. I am not a fan of traditional point and click MOBA's. I find the third person system in Smite to give more flexibility and easier controls. It also offers a faster paced gameplay faster more brutal attacks keep the excitement and rush of battle alive.","September 24, 2015","true","59.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also unlike many MOBA's (or any free to play game for that matter) paying money is not needed in the slightest to enjoy the game. Smite gems (the payed for currency) only give you aesthetic skins and unlocking characters can be done easily without gems (also you can do events or surveys to get gems for free). 10/10 all time favorite game","September 8, 2015","true","639.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some know me as Hell, some as Claptrap, but most know me through school, but this review is for all of you!\nI've been playing smite since Cupid release (about 2 and a half years ago). However, and unfortunate event happened and my account was stolen, so I made the account that I play on to this day. The company backing this game at that time refunded me my gems and limited skins, as well as deleting my old account.\n\nGeneral Info!    	Smite is a MOBA that pits you as one of many gods against other gods in modes with objectives such as (towers, pheonixes, titans, etc.) Also, all of the characters in game, are based on REAL MYTHOLOGY, such as the norse, egyptians, romans, greeks, and mayans. Smite is also third-person, which is what makes MOBA players from all over gather and play this mix of third-person and MOBA. My only tip for you is that this game will make you love it, and it'll also make you want to destroy it. No matter what, even when you tell yourself you're bad, stick with it. This game, unlike most others gets better over time.\n\nRecommendations!  	GOD PACK <3\nIts a great deal, although I'd at least wait until you're level 30 and are positive that you'll completely want it. It is a worthy investment at any price. You get all the gods that are out, and those that'll come out, all for 30$ I got it when there were only around 25 gods I think? I've never looked back.\n\nI recommend downloading Curse Voice to chat with friends, and to meet new people! I'd also recommmend to start out in arena and learn the basics of each god. Theres also this neat feature inside the game called VGS, its basically call outs that you'd make in chat rooms such as: [VVGH] Hi! [VSAA] I'll attack! and so forth. My personal favorite god is Hel (look at my name), she is the goddess of the underworld! Each character, like other games has jokes, and taunts. One of her "jokes" includes:\n(light side) "I know! We should make cookies!"\n(dark side) "COOKIES!? WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU!?\n\nNow of course, not every god talks about making cookies and beating the living "hell" out of each other. But please. without further ado, go out, and slam your own cookies in the battleground of the god, we're all waiting for you!\n\nIf you want to sign up for an account for the game, please use my refferal link below!\n\n\nReferral link for smite <3	[account.hirezstudios.com]\n\nThis can also be found on my profile, and feel free to ask to add me in game :) I'd party with anyone.\n\n[VVGL] & [VVGF]","September 9, 2015","true","656.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(No offense to LoL community.) I think this game is just a little more fun for me than LoL anyways. If you are new then I would say play Arena or Joust. My favorite game mode is mainly Joust and I love the game so much ever since I found out about it. I Mainly love playing as Anubis (Go figure) and Neith <3 Anubis is pretty broken with how much damage he can dish out and I love it lol. I wanted to write this just to tell people how much fun the game is and how much I recommend this game. I think the main reason why I love it more is because of the third person angle camera it has and that is a deal breaker for me!\n\nI mainly play this on XBOX ONE (Please don't hurt me :c ) PC is better yes but I love playing this more on Console, but I think this game is lovable no matter what! It's a great game mainly to play with friends who you know won't let you down and die everytime they run out into the battlefield.

For a MOBA, this game is quite nice. Could never really get into MOBA's until I played this. Don't have much time logged in on this version yet but have put at least 9 days of playtime into the Xbox One version. It's a very addicting game and has well written lore on the different Gods/Characters from the many different Pantheons. Has very simple controls and can be played with various gamepads/controllers that make them even simpler. Also, the in-game tutorials are very detailed and helpful for those who are new to the game. Another thing I like about this game is that, although you can use microtransactions to purchase characters/skins/VP/etc. You can also still earn the two different types of in-game currency simply by playing the game.

Smite is all about skill shots and if you can't aim this game isnt for you.\n\nYou know a game is great when you just do not stop playing it, even when you are tired of the game you still come back. This is the longest i've ever played a game in one go. I've played games like battlefield heroes for multiple years but that was when playing for limited amounts of time, lets say 6 months and then stop for another 6-8 months. This isn't the case for Smite. I've been playing this game non stop without long stops for 1+ year. The only time i stopped was when H1Z1, Ark survival and Fallout 4 came out. If you find some friends and bellends to play with, this is a great game. The matches are fun and can be either quick or really long. When you make a team with your friends and get to play a certain role, you have the chance to get better at that role and do more random ♥♥♥♥ with it. This game keeps you going and is fun to play when you have the time for it. Also this game contains Kukulkan.\n\nPros:\nDifferent matches each time you play\nKeeps you going\nRegular patches, every 2 weeks on tuesday/wednesday\nPlenty of gods\nPro scene is great\nAlot of players\n6 modes, 2 league modes and a match of the day\nFree gems\nPlenty of double xp, worshippers and favor weekends\nSkins for days\nAnnouncer packs, Borders, Ward skins, Icons, Pedestals, Emotes and Voice Packs. Everything in this game is customizable exept for your abilities, the map and the items.\nSemi-Good community\nAlmost everyone speaks english\n3rd Person view\nBeginner friendly\nEverything\nKukulkan\nKukulkan\nKukulkan\n\nCons:\nSemi-Long queues\nSerqet\nAddicting at first\nWhen there is a patch servers will be down for hours guaranteed\nSome nerfs and buffs that aren't needed\nNe Zha Remodel\nTryharders\nGod balance can be bad\n\nOverall this game is a great game is and definitly worth your time.\nI myself have 550 hours ingame atm, this isn't alot but i've been playing other games aswell in the meantime.\nThe gods have a great backstory and there are alot of gods to choose from. From the mighty zeus till the humble kukulkan.\n\nJust give this game a go and see if you enjoy it.\n\nI rate this game a solid 5/7 (Please get this reference, if not search Brendan Sullivan vs Robert Graves in google)\n\nPs: Kukulkan\n\nPps: Kukulkan is a joke, he is one of the worst gods, no good escape, if you are close to him he can't do much and will most certainly die without panic ulting\n","December 18, 2015","true","250.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then SMITE might be something for you. The difficulty curve is a lot smaller than in League or Dota 2 which makes the game more fun to play on the get go. The 3rd person camera angle makes the game feel much more fun and action oriented and you actually have to learn to aim to hit your abilities and attacks. Each god have a fun and unique personality that makes them stand out from the crowd and to top that every god is beautifuly modeled and greatly voice acted with voice packs you can buy in game so the voice commands are said by the god you are playing and bought it for. Skins are here too with a basic recolor that costs regular in game currency and different modeled ones for premium currency which you can buy for real money or earn on day six and seven as your daily log in reward. The game also features right now six different game modes so you will never be bored and every one will give you a win of the day bonus so you can earn in game basic currency faster, your standard three lanes with jungle game mode is present too of course. The graphics look good and the options menu is very extensive so you can modify the game to perform or look as good as possible on your PC. The community is far from as toxic as League of Legends and barely has any Russians in it like in Dota 2 so team work is almost always guaranteed. And the business model here is very generous compared to League. Everything is pretty much the same when it comes to premium currency and the cost for heroes but for 29.99$ or 23.99€ you can buy the Ultimate God Pack which gives you every single god in the game, every future god and a refund on all basic in game currency you have spent on any gods previously so you can spend all that on emotes or the basic recolors. Now that is a generous deal if you ask me. The only negative thing I can think of is that there is some balancing issues where some gods are too OP and some are completely worthless but thank god Hi-Rez is working to fix that. The god which was concidered by the community to be the worst god in the game just got a massive buff so he's on par with every other god and too OP gods have been nerfed in the past as well.\n\ntl;dr\nPositive:\n+3rd person camera angle and the aiming required gives the game more action\n+Easier difficulty curve\n+Noob friendly\n+Great gods with unique personalities\n+A lot of cool skins and voice packs\n+Earn premium currency in game!\n+Friendly and great developers\n+Great community (Compared to League and Dota 2)\n+Extremely fair business model\n\nNegative:\n-Some balancing issues\n-Too addicting\n-Will leave you sleepless for days\n-No Jesus DLC yet","December 16, 2015","true","228.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Some know me as Hell, some as Claptrap, but most know me through school, but this review is for all of you!\nI've been playing smite since Cupid release (about 2 and a half years ago). However, and unfortunate event happened and my account was stolen, so I made the account that I play on to this day. The company backing this game at that time refunded me my gems and limited skins, as well as deleting my old account.\n\nGeneral Info!    	Smite is a MOBA that pits you as one of many gods against other gods in modes with objectives such as (towers, pheonixes, titans, etc.) Also, all of the characters in game, are based on REAL MYTHOLOGY, such as the norse, egyptians, romans, greeks, and mayans. Smite is also third-person, which is what makes MOBA players from all over gather and play this mix of third-person and MOBA. My only tip for you is that this game will make you love it, and it'll also make you want to destroy it. No matter what, even when you tell yourself you're bad, stick with it. This game, unlike most others gets better over time.\n\nRecommendations!  	GOD PACK <3\nIts a great deal, although I'd at least wait until you're level 30 and are positive that you'll completely want it. It is a worthy investment at any price. You get all the gods that are out, and those that'll come out, all for 30$ I got it when there were only around 25 gods I think? I've never looked back.\n\nI recommend downloading Curse Voice to chat with friends, and to meet new people! I'd also recommmend to start out in arena and learn the basics of each god. Theres also this neat feature inside the game called VGS, its basically call outs that you'd make in chat rooms such as: [VVGH] Hi! [VSAA] I'll attack! and so forth. My personal favorite god is Hel (look at my name), she is the goddess of the underworld! Each character, like other games has jokes, and taunts. One of her "jokes" includes:\n(light side) "I know! We should make cookies!"\n(dark side) "COOKIES!? WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU!?\n\nNow of course, not every god talks about making cookies and beating the living "hell" out of each other. But please. without further ado, go out, and slam your own cookies in the battleground of the god, we're all waiting for you!\n\nIf you want to sign up for an account for the game, please use my refferal link below!\n\n\nReferral link for smite <3	[account.hirezstudios.com]\n\nThis can also be found on my profile, and feel free to ask to add me in game :) I'd party with anyone.\n\n[VVGL] & [VVGF]","September 9, 2015","true","656.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't want to pay a cent, the game has a ingame currency and a microtransaction currency, both of which you earn from logging in daily, with the "gems" at the end of a week. You can use both of these to unlock characters. Sure, you might of heard of past issues with the developer, but that shouldn't scare you off from this quality 3rd person MOBA. Smite has a growing competitive scene and has over ten million unique accounts as of August 2015 (evidenced by the Retrocles promotion,) and now, 20 million as of June 2016. Servers are on the east coast for the US, and this can cause some minor ping issues. In Wisconsin, with 10mb down/1mb up, my server experiences haven't been terrible, most, if any issues have been on my ISP. New content and balance patches are frequent, and the more players there are the higher the quality of matchmaking.\n\nI strongly recommend this game, if you enjoy MOBAs or if you're completely new to the idea. Smite is one of the most friendly MOBAs to new players, and I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I have.","October 27, 2015","true","652.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorsemanFanClub/recommended/386360/","HorsemanFanClub","「Horseman」","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorsemanFanClub/","637 products in account","Smite is a 3rd person MOBA drawing gods from various mythologies as playable characters. If you saw the word "MOBA" and immediately rolled your eyes, you probably shouldn't have, as this game is essentially the best MOBA for people who don't usually like MOBA's. The third person perspective makes the game feel more at home to people who play action games, and also make the game far more skill based as there are very few abilities in the game that aim themselves for you. In fact if you don't like the MOBA stuff at all you can easily play arena and be more or less rid of the typical MOBA gameplay, instead playing a sort of fast paced RPG Team Deathmatch. The third person perspective actually changes the gameplay cataclysmically, and if you've played DOTA or League of Legends before and you didn't like it, this one is definitely worth a shot. Characters are based on real gods or other various figures from Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Norse, Chinese, Mayan and Hindu pantheons, from universally known gods like Zeus to Ah Muzen Cab, the bee guy nobody cares about. The game's premium currency system is extremely fair, with all gods being bought by in-game currency with the option to use premium currency to unlock them immediately, as well as the option to use the premium currency on purely aesthetic skins, voice packs, ward skins, and icons. The game is updated very frequently, averaging out to around one brand new god added every month along with balance changes, new skins, etc. Overall amazing game, I've played hundreds of hours outside of steam and I'm looking forward to a thousand more on the steam version.","September 8, 2015","true","398.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

After having played the beta I gave SMITE another shot when it launched 1,5 years ago and I never looked back. More than a 1000 hrs later I'm still playing every single day.\n\nIt will take you some time and practice to get used to it all, but It's more accessible compared to other MOBA's due to it having less items and being able to turn on auto-buy/level. Positioning is a big part of being successful as well as aiming, timing, communication and synergy making it hard to master.\n\nThe game is based on mythology from 7 different pantheons and the 69 gods (at the time of writing) all have lore related directed taunts, which adds a lot of humour to the mix. 5 different classes, 8 game-modes on 5 different maps offer something to enjoy for everyone.\n\nRegular updates and patches keep the game fresh. With plenty of "free gems" events and sales you won't need to spend tonnes of cash on cosmetics if you don't want to. (I have accumulated 1000s of gems and free stuff in my playtime)\n\nBeing the 3rd Biggest MOBA with 2nd largest tournament prizepools in e-sports history I think I can safely say Hi-Rez finally hit the right spot with this game.\n\nThe only negative things I can think of are that on a rare occasion the servers lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky, which isn't too big of a deal if you don't play ranked leagues.

This is from someone who hated MOBAs and everything about them but I was a bit curious and thought that Smite seemed like a good entry point and since then this has been the only game I consistently play. The gods are all so cool and the mythology adds a fun layer with the characters plus actually seeing the skins you have on your god is pretty great. The motd is a fun addition because it spices things up a little if you don't want to play a traditional game mode, which Smite has a solid amount of. The daily log in bonus is great because I haven't spent a penny on this game and I have a bunch of gods and skins and ward skins and icons. If you're someone who doesn't like MOBAs I would suggest you give this one a try because it might just click for you.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Everyone from different pantheons, 7 pantheons.\nHi-Rez listen what the community wants/needs into the game.\nTheir game does not need a beast pc to run.\nEverything micro-transaction related is quite well rewarding, for example, the God Pack, you unlock all current gods and future gods for a really nice price(My biggest investment into SMITE and I dont regret it).\nThey give out free gems once in a while.\nThe minus parts that I only found is that I need to open the launcher with the Steam version, no account migration or etc. and some toxic people. Otherwise this game is awesome with their uniqueness.\nNow with the Steam release(which I and alot of people thought wont come) I can now finally sell my CS:GO skins and get gems.

After having played the beta I gave SMITE another shot when it launched 1,5 years ago and I never looked back. More than a 1000 hrs later I'm still playing every single day.\n\nIt will take you some time and practice to get used to it all, but It's more accessible compared to other MOBA's due to it having less items and being able to turn on auto-buy/level. Positioning is a big part of being successful as well as aiming, timing, communication and synergy making it hard to master.\n\nThe game is based on mythology from 7 different pantheons and the 69 gods (at the time of writing) all have lore related directed taunts, which adds a lot of humour to the mix. 5 different classes, 8 game-modes on 5 different maps offer something to enjoy for everyone.\n\nRegular updates and patches keep the game fresh. With plenty of "free gems" events and sales you won't need to spend tonnes of cash on cosmetics if you don't want to. (I have accumulated 1000s of gems and free stuff in my playtime)\n\nBeing the 3rd Biggest MOBA with 2nd largest tournament prizepools in e-sports history I think I can safely say Hi-Rez finally hit the right spot with this game.\n\nThe only negative things I can think of are that on a rare occasion the servers lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky, which isn't too big of a deal if you don't play ranked leagues. As with any online game you get a few toxic players every now and then, but they can easily be muted or ignored and more often than not you will find nice and reasonable folk in your matches.\n\nFurthermore I can reccommend playing/queueing with friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorsemanFanClub/recommended/386360/","HorsemanFanClub","「Horseman」","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorsemanFanClub/","637 products in account","Smite is a 3rd person MOBA drawing gods from various mythologies as playable characters. If you saw the word "MOBA" and immediately rolled your eyes, you probably shouldn't have, as this game is essentially the best MOBA for people who don't usually like MOBA's. The third person perspective makes the game feel more at home to people who play action games, and also make the game far more skill based as there are very few abilities in the game that aim themselves for you. In fact if you don't like the MOBA stuff at all you can easily play arena and be more or less rid of the typical MOBA gameplay, instead playing a sort of fast paced RPG Team Deathmatch. The third person perspective actually changes the gameplay cataclysmically, and if you've played DOTA or League of Legends before and you didn't like it, this one is definitely worth a shot. Characters are based on real gods or other various figures from Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Norse, Chinese, Mayan and Hindu pantheons, from universally known gods like Zeus to Ah Muzen Cab, the bee guy nobody cares about. The game's premium currency system is extremely fair, with all gods being bought by in-game currency with the option to use premium currency to unlock them immediately, as well as the option to use the premium currency on purely aesthetic skins, voice packs, ward skins, and icons. The game is updated very frequently, averaging out to around one brand new god added every month along with balance changes, new skins, etc. Overall amazing game, I've played hundreds of hours outside of steam and I'm looking forward to a thousand more on the steam version.","September 8, 2015","true","398.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It brings a whole new unique perspective into the world of MOBA and this game mostly relies on skillshots (except for Neith's ult) which I find fascinating. The gods/goddesses in this game are really detailed and fun to use. I prefer the 3rd person cam instead of the bird's eye view - it makes it harder to see what's behind me. They have a plethora of voice commands (it may be hard at first but after some time it'd be drilled into the back of your head) making it easy to communicate and purchasable voice packs to go along with it. There are also many outside references (ex: Khepri's victory dance with the cyclops aka Jake dancing with the beetle from Adventure Time) and taunts to specific gods. The community is farrrrrr better than LoL and the game mechanics are fairly simple.

I never got really into it since I was super into League of Legends.\nBut since i've put my League days behind me I've picked this game up again.\n\nI can honestly say that SMITE is a much more enjoyable experience than other MOBAs out there. The community doesn't make me want to shoot myself, the gameplay is interesting with it's third person view, and the game is simple enough for anyone to pick up. I've been playing SMITE casually with some friends and it's been an all around fun time for all of us. There was not a single person telling us to "Die and get cancer".\n\nMy only real gripes with the game are for the business model. It's both fantastic and a little bit wonky. In SMITE you can buy the Ultimate God Pack, which gives you every God and every God that will ever come out, this is probably the best thing you could buy in any MOBA ever. But there's also these chests with limited skins in them that come out once a year or during pro season. They're like crates in TF2 or CSGO, you have a chance to get the rare skin that's super limited or the one that you could've bought for cheaper in store. Also there's a lot of Limited skins that'll  NEVER  be released again, this is a let down because a lot of them are cool skins. Oh and Odyssey. F*ck Odyssey\n\nNow you might be saying "It's just skins why do they matter" I just want to look cool okay? But besides that the game is fantastic.\n\nFinal Verdict\nThis game is super fun to play, easy to pick up, and is a great game to play with some friends. (Just don't play with an Xbox controller)\n\n9/10 A fantastic game to waste your life on","December 12, 2015","true","21.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

The concept of MOBAs had always intrigued me, but I struggled to enjoy the ones I tried because of the mouse movement controls and isometric viewpoint, among other reasons. When I heard Smite was a 3rd-person, WASD-controlled MOBA with an emphasis on skillshots, I had to try it, and I'm glad I did. The game is a fantastic team-oriented experience with a great depth of stragegy/gameplay/skill. The character design and implementation is amazing, the lore of mythological gods battling is a blast, and the variety of abilities, skills, gamemodes, events, etc. has kept me coming back for more ever since I started.

Its a MOBA game that uses a third person camera at all times, while this may seem like a quirky gimmic that makes the game uninteresting in a few moments of gameplay it does not. It always keeps my attention and I waste hours playing this game without even realising it and thats the thing. Whenever I try to play any other MOBA game (Dota 2/League of Legends) I get bored quickly because I feel like the action just isnt there. This game on the contrary is always filled with excitment and im always on my toes when I play this game. All of the Basic attacks are whats called "skill shots" meaning you have to aim in order to kill anyone in this game. Unlike other MOBA games you do not click on the ground to move, instead you move with the WASD keys and you have to option to re bind them to something else. Currently the game has about 69 Gods to play as from different pantheons. Gods are essentially your character that you can choose to play as or a "Champion" if you will and they all look and sound Great! Hell the entire game looks amazing even when everything was turned down on low! The game modes vary from conquest (5V5) to Joust (3V3) and if that isnt enough you have a MOTD or a "mode of the day" which should add a little something to your life if you ever get bored of Classic 5V5. A MOTD is a random mode with the rules changed whether it be Extra money or all one character or a mode where everyone is already to the max level. In the end I could keep going about how amazing this game is ( I have played this for like a gazillion hours before it even came to steam) Or I could just end on saying, if you want to try a MOBA game thats a little diffrent but still fun Smite is your game!","September 8, 2015","true","615.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Very unique and much fun at once. Such action.\n- The characters are Gods from 7 different Pantheons and all are almost unique compared to others individually.\n- A very good F2P price model. A pack offers you all currently released and future gods for a set price and you can spend your ingame money on other stuff. Mostly cosmetics. No pay to win in this game.\n- Hi-Rez (Devs behind the game) are very kind and generous to it's players. Lots of free rewards and stuff.\n- Constantly beeing patch with new content. No end in sight just yet.\n- Meta is constantly changing, a meta never last really long.\n- eSport scene is thriving and watching pro players playing the game on high ranked play is a joy.\n\nThere's not much complain about, other than:\n\n- Community can be toxic sometimes. Mute and ignore if you can. This problem exist in every MOBA however.\n- Game has tad bit of optimization problems with AMD cards from what I can tell. Still, runs really well on older rigs.\n\nLove this game. I've been playing since Beta, took a break however (was playing League of Legends competetive at the time) and came 4 months ago back to it.

I can honestly say it is my favorite competitive game I have ever played. I used to play LoL but I fell out of love and started looking for something else. I tried DOTA but it never spoke to me. Smite speaks to me as a guy who plays action games like shooters and fighting games.\n\n- Controls feel great and the perspective feels natural. New players might feel awkward moving due to the movement penalty for strafing and backpedaling but you quickly get used to it and learn why it is there. Almost every attack is a skillshot that you have to aim including the basic attacks. This means that crazy plays and exciting moments are much more common in Smite.\n- The gods have amazing designs and have expressive personalities. Ratatoskr is adorable. Sun Wukong is awesome. Nu Wa is beautiful. Hel is funny. You get the idea. Being able to play one of your favorite gods is a big draw.\n- The game is fast paced and with lots of action. There is always someone to fight and the main Conquest map encourages more fighting and less farming than other MOBAs.\n- Game length can vary. They average about 25 minutes but low level games can drag on on to 50 minutes. Games where everyone on one team is doing well can end in 10 minutes.\n- The game features lots of other game modes. Arena for quick TDM type play. Siege for a simpler version of the main mode. Assault for all random characters down a single lane. 3v3 and 1v1 joust. Finally a Mode of the Day for a new crazy game mode every day. 80% CDR with only Zeus? Why not?\n- Frequent updates (2 every month) keep the game fresh and balanced. The balance is well done and almost every god is viable. New players might get frustrated against gods like Anubis and Ares but you will learn how to fight them (and how to buy actives).\n- The game has tutorials and practice modes with simple AI so you can get used to the controls and getting used to the mechanics. If you don't want to worry about items or leveling your skills, you can set the game to auto level them for you. You can even change what the game buys and levels for you before a match and of course turn it off altogether. This allows the game to be much easier to learn than most other MOBAs.\n\nOverall if you prefer your games fast paced or don't like traditional MOBAs, give this one a shot. You don't have to play the main MOBA mode and you can stick to Arena or any of the other modes. The perspective should feel natural for players who like shooters or players who like MMOs. Even if you don't think you like MOBAs, Smite is different enough in a lot of ways that it might change your opinion.\n","September 8, 2015","true","172.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drdinosaurphd/recommended/386360/","drdinosaurphd","DrDinosaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drdinosaurphd/","133 products in account","WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO PLAY SMITE\n- Third person, over the shoulder perspective. This is pretty big, and in my opinion, the game's biggest selling point. With one or two exceptions, abilities are all skillshots, and autoattacks have to be aimed. Direct control over your character is a much more enjoyable control scheme than click to move. (The downside to this is that you can't switch control or move the camera, so you'll never see a character like Lone Druid).\n- Multiple game modes. If you like the aesthetic and controls but hate the idea of playing a traditional 3-lane 5v5 matchup, you can still hop into Arena (5v5 deathmatch. Giant circle, kill the enemy team more than they kill you), Assault (Smite's ARAM mode, 5v5 with a single lane and gods randomly assigned), Seige (4v4, two lanes with a single objective), or Joust (3v3, single lane with small jungles). There's also the Match of the Day, which can be anything from a 4v4 match on the normal 5v5 map, or Arena with 80% cooldown reduction and inifinte mana.\n- Generous handouts. For $30, you can get all current and future gods. Every god has one recolor, and three "mastery" skins (gold, legendary, and diamond recolors), available for purchase with in game money. If you log in every day for a week, you'll get a total of 50 gems, and there are frequently sales and free gem weekends.\n- The VGS. Enemy leave your lane? Tap out VFF and your character will call out "Enemy missing!". The VGS is a convienience you won't know you're missing until you load up any other competitive game without the same level of communication tools.\n- Autobuy / Autolevel. If you don't want to sweat about what you should build or what skills you should level, you can tell the game to do it for you. In most situations, the autobuild is totally fine.\n- Quicker matches. The typical 5v5 match takes about 20 minutes, but they can take as long as an hour or so.\n- The aesthetic. Having the characters be taken from mythology is super neat. You've got gods like Zeus, Thor, and Anubis, battling alongside Sobek and Ratotaskr.\n- Anything earned in-game is aethetic only. You don't unlock any new mechanics, moves or items by playing more.\n\nWHY YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO PLAY SMITE\n- It's a MOBA. If you hate the idea of dealing with up to 9 other players in a competitive environment, Smite is still that. There is a mute button, but that's not always the best option. You'll also have to keep up with who goes where when, something that isn't explained anywhere in-game. The playerbase is generally good about explaining this if you ask, though.\n- The meta isn't super flexible. There are a handful of characters that can be played in multiple roles, and some roles / characters have multiple builds they can choose from, but in general you'll know what your build is going to be as soon as you choose your role and your character. This can be either a good thing (I don't need to worry about my teammates getting mad at me for building wrong!) or a bad thing (Even if I like a character's kit, if I want a different experience I need to switch characters).\n- Female character design. I'm aware I'll probably catch some heat for this, but for some people, it'll be hard to ignore. While the gods have a ton of varied and inspired designs, from the squirrel Ratotaskr, to the giant beetle Khepri, to the ice giant Ymir, the goddesses all kind of have the same body shape / type - they're pretty much all human shaped, with generic attractive "hourglass" proportions. This may either be a complete non-issue for you or be something you can't overlook.\n- You want a slower-paced experience. Smite's is kind of bursty, and by the end of a match the main damage dealers will be throwing out auto-attacks that can deal up to 1k damage (characters are generally between 2-4k health). Teamfights become an explosion of light and sound. If you want to clash and break off, slowly wearing down the other team until you can easily take them on, you probably won't find that experience in Smite.\n\nSmite is fun. It's got a completely unique control scheme that goes a long way towards making it an enjoyable MOBA, and there are a lot of tools to make even the casual experience enjoyable. It has its faults, but if you're willing to overlook them, or if they don't affect you at all, you should absolutely check out Smite.","September 8, 2015","true","86.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themris0/recommended/386360/","themris0","TRDF | Themris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themris0/","119 products in account","Been playing Smite for almost 3 years now. It is awesome.\nI have dabbled in many MOBAs (DoTA, LoL, Awesomenauts, Monday Night Combat) and have enjoyed all of them, but there are just a number of things that set Smite apart:\n\n1. The theme is awesome. Ever since I played Age of Mythology as a kid I've really liked mythology as a theme. These gods are just so memorable and interesting. Smite really lets them come to life, while also introducing you to many gods you have never even heard of.\n\n2. It's all a matter of perspective. At the end of the day, games are meant to be fun. And killing someone in Smite just feels SO MUCH MORE satisfying than it does in other MOBAs. Landing skillshots in 3rd person is much more viceral and impactful than it is in top down MOBAs.\n\n3. Good mechanics, without cumbersome mechanics: Unlike the big two (no names needed), Smite is not cumbersome. Buying an item does not require you to know what other 4 items need to be combined to make it. Beginners can simply turn on an "auto buy" feature in order to ease the learning curve. To buy stuff you just go to base and buy it. simple as that. No need for secret shops in the jungle, recipes etcetc.\nSimilarly, two core mechanics: last hitting and denial are wonderfully handled: Last hitting gives you more gold, but you also get gold for being close to enemies as they die, making farming less of a hassle. And, more importantly: there is no denial. I know some DoTA players have strong feelings about this, but to me this is a no brainer: denial is a stupid mechanic and I'm glad it is out.\n\n4. The game is financially very genorous. For 30$ (20$ on steam right now, which is insane) you get every god in the game and every future god released. Sure, you can argue that the heroes in DoTA are free, fair enough, but in comparison to LoL this is a huge upgrade. Additionally, you can also easily unlock every god using in game currency. Hi Rez also very regularly has promotions where you can earn premium currency for free. And it is worth it because the skins and voicepacks in the game are AWESOME\n\n5. Speaking of Voice packs: the VGS system is amazing. Rather than wasting time typing in game, a few quick button presses will inform your team about almost anything you could want to say. "Enemy missing left" "Ward the fire giant" "I'll gank right lane" "Save yourselves" "Ultimate is ready" "Chase the enemy" "Retreat left jungle" "You Rock" "Please??" etcetcetcetc. Each god, and many skins have unique voicepacks, making the whole thing extra cool\n\n6. Unlike most MOBAs, Smite has MANY game modes and they are all popular and all worth playing. This allows me to enjoy smite with my competitive friends, my noob girlfriend and my casual gamer friends. The game is balanced around conquest (the main competitive game mode with 3 lanes etc) as it should be, but the other game modes get lots of love as well.\n\nIn conclusion, I have played over 2000 hours of smite and look forward to playing 2000 more. 10/10, would slay gods again","September 8, 2015","true","244.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Smite was a wonderful MOBA that clicked with me instantly, I love the camera and how 99.9% if not all things are Skillshot meaning if you're 1v1ing a guy in lane, it's completely up to skill to decide who wins. If you enjoy MOBA's but are looking for something different than other MOBA's then Smite is worth a try! Being able to play as Gods of history like Zeus, Poseidon, Neith, Ymir, Odin, Medusa, Bellona and the list goes on and on. You have serveral different gamemodes so if you don't enjoy the tradional MOBA style'd game mode of defending lanes and destroying towers for 30 Minutes - 1 hour, Then you have fast paced Gamemodes like Arena ( Great for starters ) and MOTD's most of the time ( Mode of the day )! All in all I highly recommend Smite as a MOBA even if you didn't enjoy League of Legends or DotA 2, great helpful websites for starters would be  Smitefire [www.smitefire.com] for God builds and Guides and the Smite  Reddit page !

Smites camera is in a third person veiw unlike your generic moba. With this kind of camera, a lot more action and stuff is going on, and It actually feels like youre a god/champion witch other mobas failed to bring to the table. That being said it does come with a price of being a bit more hardware demanding so if you bought a clearance computer at wallmart for 400$ chances are your gonna be having some frame trouble. Also, it brings a much greater challenge into the auto attacking, unlike league of legends, dota 2, hos, etc you have to aim your attacks, Thus being said all abilitys are skillshots giving more of a challenge witch makes cluth plays that more awesome\n\nRate 9.5/10","November 29, 2015","true","99.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're familliar with any other MOBAS like Dota 2 or LOL then im sure you will like this game. 3rd person, MULTIPLE game modes (which is a godsend because other mobas dont really diversify much) and a large roster of gods to play. If you want to be able to play all the gods immediately then I recommend waiting for a sale. I got mine for $20. If you do not want to spend real money then you will have to buy gods and skins with in-game currency that you can earn by playing matches or by simply logging in every day. Gameplay wise I would say it's more of a casual moba that you dont have to spend a lot of time to enjoy yourself. If any of this interests you please give SMITE a try. Its worth the 10 min download.

Abilities are much more satisfying as all of the gods in the game only have 1 passive and the abilities bound to the first  4 number keys are cast making the player feel like they have an actual effect raver that giving him a simple buff that an item could give him/her;\n\nThe item system is much simpler than the other mobas that really lends to the game, you could call this game a gateway into "more typical mobas" but i have played this game as soon it came out of beta and  those games still don't appeal to me, people with a background in " typical mobas" would find it very easy to adapt to smite as the main game mode conquest has your " typical mobas"  3 lane 2 jungle map.\n\ni love how as you play you in turn learn about ancient and in the case of Hindu modern cultures from around the world from Egyptian to Norse the playable characters are all picked from these certain culture god and legends giving the game a therm standing lore for each god.\n\nITS FREE!!! and NOW ON STEAM you are mad not to "click play" game right now!","September 8, 2015","true","288.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Okay, so I now have over 110 hours on the Steam client and had somewhere between 300-550 hours on the original client. Now, I will say that there are negative aspects to the game. However these are more particular to MOBAs in general and less about Smite. Matchmaking in League, Dota, (I assume Heroes of the Storm, but never played and never heard anything about its matchmaking) and Smite is no exception. If you're trying to teach a friend to play without making a smurf account, well, it's really REALLY hard. Since a party will always play against people around the highest party member's level, it usually results in absolute domination by the opposing team because you have at least one team mate (Being your friend you are trying to teach) who barely understands the game. This is less of a problem for experienced players of other MOBAs like LoL or Dota, however not unheard of either. The grind to level 30 is also astonishing long. I should mention that even with all this time played, I am still a level 25. I've been playing since the closed beta in October 2012. Sure, I've been playing off and on in that time, however, that doesn't change the fact that I have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time in the game. The only reason this is a problem is that you can't play ranked until you are level 30. If you're playing a normal game in the "premier" gamemode Conquest, expect bad plays, bad team comps, and overall bad team players. I personally recommend that if you do play conquest, play with a friend who is on or above your skill level. If you're alone, I suggest gamemodes such as Arena and 3v3 Joust. Both are shorter games which means less time commitment and usually have more laid back people who aren't gonna wine if you end up being the first blood. This is not to say the game is bad. The game is a downright amazing game that I would recommend to almost anyone. The players themselves are the bad part. This isn't even mentioning the totally awesome concept of playing as freaking GODS. "Oh, so you're saying that in this game I can murder Zeus with Thor, proving my dominance as the best god of thunder? SIGN ME UP!"\nTL;DR\nThis is a free to play game with an awesome concept, awesome gameplay mechanics, and provides you with an awesome time. Play the game. There is actually no reason not to give it a go.","November 24, 2015","true","295.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You use WASD to move around rather than clicking on a map. Every shot is a skill shot. There are quite a few game modes, all of which are very fun to play. The community is certainly not perfect, but it's far better than LoL's.\nA small flaw in this game is that when a new God comes out, they will sometimes be either really bad, or really overpowered. They are always balanced within a patch or two. Items can sometimes be the same way (for example, an item called Bluestone Pendant is OP right now).\nThis game may appear to be pay-to-win, but it isn't. You get five Gods to start out with, one of each role. You can purchase new Gods using "Favor Points", which can be won by the hundreds simply by playing matches. You can also purchase the Ultimate God Pack for $30, which will give you access to all current and future Gods. When I started playing, I never felt pressured to buy a new God, as the starting five Gods were perfectly fine. The only reason I ever purchased a new God in the first place was because I wanted to try something new.\nThere is another form of in-game currency called Gems. You can earn 50 Gems by logging in 7 days in a row, adding up to a potentioal 200 Gems per month. You can also earn them by doing surveys and offers on Hi-Rez's website (I've yet to go a single day where I don't earn at least 30 Gems doing surveys). The items that you buy with Gems are 100% cosmetic: skins, voice packs, emotes, etc. You can also purchase Gods with them, however that would be a gigantic waste since Favor Points far easier to earn.\nSMITE is easily the single best MOBA out there, and I give it a 10/10.","September 28, 2015","true","307.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a great game and one of it's greatest qualities is that it can be rewarding. As in you have oportunities in getting ingame microtranzactions through logins and events. Like all games like smite or league there are balancing issues. Also smite isnt very challenging. League of legends is very challenging compared to smite. In other words, smite is like an easy mode league of legends except with a lot of overpowered gods and easy to kill minions. Yet smite is really fun, and if your looking for something to play casually, smite is the perfect fit.","December 14, 2015","true","402.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/luhmau/recommended/386360/","luhmau","luhmau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/luhmau/","134 products in account","Hi Rez studios has a big game changer in their hands with this title. SMITE is an insanely addicting and incredibly fun MOBA that is perfect for other players, both old and new to MOBA's, that are searching for  a new change of pace from your typical MOBA.\n\nPROS\nOVERALL - SMITE is a stupendous addition to the vastly expanding genre, and not to mention it definently stands out of the crowd. The gameplay is definently a changing factor in this than most common MOBA's.\n\nTHEME & ENVIRONMENT - The lore is absolutely astounding and gives this MOBA a beautiful environment that differs from any other. You WILL NOT get the same experience from any other MOBA.\n\nVARIETY - SMITE also has a variety of different game modes including Arena, Joust (3v3), Conquest(5v5) and many more including a special event gamemode that changes everyday! Everyday is a new experience in SMITE.\n\nULTIMATE GOD PACK - This game is also one of the few that offer an "Ultimate Pack" that's actually worthwhile! Tired of playing the same god all the time and don't have enough favor or gems to buy a new one? Spend $29.99USD (on sale for $20 at the day of this review) and you now have yourself every single god PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE FOREVER. To top it off, any favor your spent on your other gods are now REFUNDED BACK excluding gems. By that time you now have every god and favor to spend on getting some sweet looking skins for all of your favorite gods!\n\nFREE-TO-PLAY - SMITE is also one of the few FTP titles that is truly FREE TO PLAY. I love that I don't have to spend thousands of dollars or even in game time to try and grind out and get my in-game currency up to buy a new god\n\nGOD ROTATIONS - SMITE has a function that allows you to play up to 4 new gods every week. So instead of paying favor to rent gods and try them out just wait until they're on rotation, or just try a new god for that week. Who knows you might find your new favorite.CONS\nPLAYER RANK - Reaching max player rank (Rank 30 as of this review) gives no other reward other than access to the "Ranked League Matches". You get no unlocks or rewards upon reaching this rank. I just wish they would've done more with it.\n\nRANKED MATCHES - You cannot play a "Ranked" match until reaching the max rank of your player, I feel as though once you reach rank 10 you should have enough experience to play a ranked match but that is sadly not the case. Even if you get placed in a low league.\n\nNO BOOT SYSTEM - Imagine this. You're having a great time about to win a game and there is a Scylla that has no kills and 5 deaths and decides she will start feeding. There is no possible way to stop them from ruining your game unless your entire team has the skill to beat them. I hate this and wish there was a way to boot someone out of your game via a vote system but sadly there is not.\nOVERALL RATING\nMy standpoint on SMITE is that it is definently a great MOBA with alot of amazing potential to become one of the best MOBA's out there to date. This game has made me enjoy every MOBA much more than I did before just because of its learning curve that really puts new players in a position of learning how to play this game.\n\nYes. There are some flaws in this game as all other games have, but for what it is I say it is definently worth picking up and trying. You will not regret it.\n\nFINAL RATING\n\n★★★★★★★★★✩ 9/10 Stars - "This is a MUST have for MOBA fans, I can't stop playing it." -ShifT","September 9, 2015","true","96.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played for just over a year now, and have put nearly 900 hours in it.  Smite is a 3rd person MOBA.  If the MOBA aspect is a turn-off, there's a very popular 5v5 deathmatch-like gamemode, and a total of 6 different modes (including a special mode of the day, often with different rules) that all can appeal to different players.\nIn this game, all the characters are gods from different mythological pantheons (Greek, Roman, Norse, Hindu, Chinese, Mayan...likely a new pantheon next year).  Each character has just 3 standard abilities, and a passive, then one ultimate ability.  There's really only just a few ways to make them work together.  It's when you combine those with your team, and work around your opponent's abilities when it gets fun.  The gameplay feels really rewarding when you do something awesome with all of this.\n\nExcellent free-to-play model.  You get 5 base characters, and each week, a rotating set of 5 free characters.  You can rent new characters really cheaply (with in-game currency) to try them out (you can try them free in Jungle Practice Mode).  There are a few gods that are priced below the standard 5500 favor, and you can unlock a few through social media promotions.  Depending on how often you play, you might be able to get one new god each week.\nHowever, I will reccommend the Ultimate God Pack.  It is undoubtedly the best "pay" deal in all MOBAs. For $30 (AND IT'S ON SALE FOR $20 THIS WEEK...best deal in gaming), you unlock all 69+ gods (and if you spent favor to buy some beforehand, you get it back) plus all future gods.\nThe paid in-game currency (gems) is used for cosmetic god skins, god voice packs, emotes, ward skins, and some icons.  Free Favor can be used to unlock recolor god skins, some icons, and some emotes.\nA week of successive logins can get you about $1 worth of the paid in-game currency every week, so you can save up and continue playing for free if you have a skin you really want.\nThere are also ~monthly promotions where you get free gems for each first win in each game mode.\n\nI really like the Voice-Guided System, where you can quickly issue voice commands with a few key presses (and in the voice if your god if you've purchased it).  It's immensely useful, and I have fun with it sometimes.\n\nWant to try it out? How about a referral link, so you and I both get free stuff?\nhttps://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/default.aspx?ok=1&utm_source=RAF&utm_content=1405017&utm_medium=email\n\nNew player?

Its quite difficult but that makes it BETTER.There are a few kinks but thats to be expected! Everything seems quite balanced the only issue i have specifically with this game is that some of the items and main ideas that are introduced and essential to a moba are rather obscure. But thats just cuz im a noob to mobas everything seems really well thought out and i LOVE the idea of using gods instead of random people that the devolopers will spend maybe 10 minutes on thinking of. I feel that with the right community reception this game will dethrone league of legends and dota 2 especially since its a little easier to understand. As a complete scrub when it comes to MOBAS this game is definitely more attractive to me than the others simply because i mainly play FPS and this is 3rd person so it still has an "in the battlefield" kind of play. plus as a moba its just superior to most fps games because it requires you to ACTUALLY PLAY THE OBJECTIVE. Im just scared of how the community will go, if this games community ends up like counterstrike im gonna cry because counterstrikes community is so toxic i need a gas mask JUST TO PLAY CASUAL OR DEATHMATCH. I think this games going to do well tho it really just comes down to the devs the games off the floor and in the air people are playing time to make them stay. anyway i give this game a 10/10 simply because the only things i have against it are the cries of a scrub and im sure after a few hours of messing around ill get the hang of it PLAY THIS GAME ITS HARD BUT ITS FUN AND WORTH IT.","September 9, 2015","true","145.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game always adds new gods, skins and events that extend the playtime and prevents the gameplay from getting boring.\n\nThe only problem that I have with this game is that the community is a bit toxic (Sometimes you get the one that spams the chat with you needing to delete smite and die in the corner and sometimes you get the friendly guy and the one that wants to help) but generally it is okay. You can find a friend or two and play with them in a team.\n\nPersonally I enjoyed every bit of my gameplay of Smite and I would recommend it for people looking for an addicting game.","January 4","true","396.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Dota the vets can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to you and there is always that one kid who gets real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ he lost. LoL is the same thing but more Blaming eachother. Heroes of the Storm came close with every now and again that one control freak who gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you don't listen to him.There is also the disconnecting system unlike Dota with it's a bot will take over until he recconects well in this in a Co-op match against bots if someone leaves on your team they just remove one Bot from the enmy team during other matches however there is no system for a bot to take over but i do feel like there is some kind of equalizing system in place to enhance the teammissing one or more men down.\n\nNow the Third person aiming mechanic works a lot better then the previous MOBAs that did similar. Replacing the classic point and click you get a better control of your character I feel then Dota and LoL. With the aiming of your basic attack mechanic i feel that it doesn't give players a great edge like in Dota how your ranged character at about mid range never missed with there basic attack.Smite you can hide behind your grunts and use them like basic attack shields. Skills I feel have changed thanks to the third person aiming, Such as Sun Wukong the monkey king a playable character in Smite has a skill that transforms him into three seprate creatures the creature he becomes depends on how far you aim the attack, Again giving a strong since of control.\n\nFinally is the items, Now the items Range from a lot of different stat boosts from a Speed Buff to Magic damgae buff but unlike Dota were you only get cash from killing a minion our enemy you get cash and EXP for assists as well in Smite. Plus unlike Dota with it's Items that can make a character stupidly strong our make others seem really week in comparison Smite has a balanced choice of items that won't make you want to give up half way throught.\n\nWell thats my review I have wasted enought time on writing this and I would perfer to get back to playing this game is by far in my opinion a 10/10 IGN would bang again","January 14","true","54.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arena - Roman, Joust- Japanese, Seige - Mayan, Assault- Norse and Conquest- Greek.\n- Alot easier to learn than any other moba in my experiances (200 hours Dota2, 400hours LoL, 200hours Strife)\n- Fully Customisable HUD , you can literally set whatever you want it to look like.\n- All Voice Actors and Skins are amazing.\n- In game talking commands known as vg's. e.g (vvgl = GoodLuck, ver = You Rock, vea = Awesome ect....) All commands are easy to learn and take around a week to learn every single one.\n- Currently 71 gods so it has to take a while for you to get bored of every one.\n- Mastery System in the game so you can have your own Rank to any of the Gods you play as. e.g (Mastery 1 - 50 worshipers, you get 9 for winning a game that lasts over 20 minutes. Lose the game and you get 3/4 of the amount you would get if you were to win)\n\nCons - Some gods are completely unbalanced *cough* bastet *cough* loki *cough*","December 21, 2015","true","384.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/earvinarp/recommended/386360/","earvinarp","TAW | royal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/earvinarp/","32 products in account","I have just recently added Smite to Steam even though I played this game for over 1k hours in the last year or so. As far as MOBAS go, I believe only Dota 2 comes ahead of Smite. Smite is certainly simpler and easier to get into. It is quite fun and engaging right off the bat. And, yes, it takes some skill to get good and be an efficient team player. The last hit rewards gold to all makes it so it needs less micromanaging but, at the end of the day, someone in the team will be building stacks and will be keen to last hitting, which is pretty easy anyway. The god (hero) pool is quite large and varied, and mastery of any god in Smite takes only a few games. The quality of the graphics and character detail are excellent. The games are often shorter than other MOBAs, maybe with the exception of HoTS, as there are many casual games modes, all different from each other. The main mode (the league conquest) is still the most enjoyable, in my opinion. Getting to play ranked games is much faster than in Dota 2. As far as the community goes, well, there are plenty of kids playing the game, as it is logical, and there is no real banning system from Hi Rez (I have never seen anyone banned from a report). So, imagine. Kids will do what kids do (you know the drill - rage quit, place the blame on others, take no reponsibility, no patience, gratutitous insults, bullying). Thankfully you can mute people, similarly to Dota 2. However, the games being a bit more action packed early that in Dota 2, the raging usually starts right away. There is less of that getting comfortable on your hero during early stages of the game than in Dota 2.\n\nAll and all, Smite is a great game, truly free to play, which rewards good individual and team play. You can progress in this game spending no money (or very little if you want to support Hi Rez) and acquire all sorts of gear.\n\nThe pro community is small but watching their games is engaging. There are plenty of pro players with a healthy streaming schedule. The casters do a good job most of the time, even though they should start droppìng the "education" component from their casting, as the viewing community is well versed in the game by now.\n\nIn conclusion, play the game and check the community out. Start with a few gods, master these and see what role you like. The rest will work itself out.","January 1","true","147.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I only wish the achievements and hours transferred over from the original client launcher instead of me having to get them all again for Steam, that's my only CON so far. Because I have damn near all of them in game and roughly 200+ hours put into this game and the only MOBA I like paying for skins. They put some DAMN GOOD detail into the skins as well as the voice packs to go with those skins.\n\nAlso if you get hooked on the game get the ultimate god pack, if it's still out, it's TOTALLY worth it.

Got myself an early code and played since. I've enjoyed it since, i was told what a MOBA is from LoL and Dota 2. I tried both but the overview, and the click to move was just annoying in my opinion, but when SMITE came i thought why not, probably another click to move, but it wasn't. My opinion changed alot, i enjoyed the concept of MOBA since. To bring in the extra taste of SMITE, it has gods from different pantheons. Greek, Norse, Roman, Egyptian, Chinese, Mayan, and Hindu. It's a great game to try, even with friends. Refer me and then just add me in game. When signing up there is a Refer player just type the name and solid. Huxenbolt.

Smites camera is in a third person veiw unlike your generic moba. With this kind of camera, a lot more action and stuff is going on, and It actually feels like youre a god/champion witch other mobas failed to bring to the table. That being said it does come with a price of being a bit more hardware demanding so if you bought a clearance computer at wallmart for 400$ chances are your gonna be having some frame trouble. Also, it brings a much greater challenge into the auto attacking, unlike league of legends, dota 2, hos, etc you have to aim your attacks, Thus being said all abilitys are skillshots giving more of a challenge witch makes cluth plays that more awesome\n\nRate 9.5/10","November 29, 2015","true","99.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're familliar with any other MOBAS like Dota 2 or LOL then im sure you will like this game. 3rd person, MULTIPLE game modes (which is a godsend because other mobas dont really diversify much) and a large roster of gods to play. If you want to be able to play all the gods immediately then I recommend waiting for a sale. I got mine for $20. If you do not want to spend real money then you will have to buy gods and skins with in-game currency that you can earn by playing matches or by simply logging in every day. Gameplay wise I would say it's more of a casual moba that you dont have to spend a lot of time to enjoy yourself. If any of this interests you please give SMITE a try. Its worth the 10 min download.

Abilities are much more satisfying as all of the gods in the game only have 1 passive and the abilities bound to the first  4 number keys are cast making the player feel like they have an actual effect raver that giving him a simple buff that an item could give him/her;\n\nThe item system is much simpler than the other mobas that really lends to the game, you could call this game a gateway into "more typical mobas" but i have played this game as soon it came out of beta and  those games still don't appeal to me, people with a background in " typical mobas" would find it very easy to adapt to smite as the main game mode conquest has your " typical mobas"  3 lane 2 jungle map.\n\ni love how as you play you in turn learn about ancient and in the case of Hindu modern cultures from around the world from Egyptian to Norse the playable characters are all picked from these certain culture god and legends giving the game a therm standing lore for each god.\n\nITS FREE!!! and NOW ON STEAM you are mad not to "click play" game right now!","September 8, 2015","true","288.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Okay, so I now have over 110 hours on the Steam client and had somewhere between 300-550 hours on the original client. Now, I will say that there are negative aspects to the game. However these are more particular to MOBAs in general and less about Smite. Matchmaking in League, Dota, (I assume Heroes of the Storm, but never played and never heard anything about its matchmaking) and Smite is no exception. If you're trying to teach a friend to play without making a smurf account, well, it's really REALLY hard. Since a party will always play against people around the highest party member's level, it usually results in absolute domination by the opposing team because you have at least one team mate (Being your friend you are trying to teach) who barely understands the game. This is less of a problem for experienced players of other MOBAs like LoL or Dota, however not unheard of either. The grind to level 30 is also astonishing long. I should mention that even with all this time played, I am still a level 25. I've been playing since the closed beta in October 2012. Sure, I've been playing off and on in that time, however, that doesn't change the fact that I have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time in the game. The only reason this is a problem is that you can't play ranked until you are level 30. If you're playing a normal game in the "premier" gamemode Conquest, expect bad plays, bad team comps, and overall bad team players. I personally recommend that if you do play conquest, play with a friend who is on or above your skill level. If you're alone, I suggest gamemodes such as Arena and 3v3 Joust. Both are shorter games which means less time commitment and usually have more laid back people who aren't gonna wine if you end up being the first blood. This is not to say the game is bad. The game is a downright amazing game that I would recommend to almost anyone. The players themselves are the bad part. This isn't even mentioning the totally awesome concept of playing as freaking GODS. "Oh, so you're saying that in this game I can murder Zeus with Thor, proving my dominance as the best god of thunder? SIGN ME UP!"\nTL;DR\nThis is a free to play game with an awesome concept, awesome gameplay mechanics, and provides you with an awesome time. Play the game.

Definitely better than the more mainstream MOBAS (looking at you, DOTA 2 / League of Legends). Most MOBAs tend to bore me and infuriate me, but this one doesn't feel like a MOBA and that you're more in control than the click-fest the other MOBAs bring - plus the community is INFINITELY less toxic than other MOBAs (mainly because toxic behavior is not tolerated by HiRez or most of the players). Instead of an RTS stand-point, it uses a 3rd person action perspective. The gods are all fairly unique and they all have the potential to be amazing and game changing while focusing on teamwork and strategy. The nice thing about this game is that you don't really have to pay a single penny to play and it's not pay to win. The company is actually good enough to award you with their premium currency for daily log-ins (days 6 & 7), and with tons of events. I would suggest to get the Ultimate God Pack since you'll receive all 71 gods PLUS every single god that comes after this, and with the Japanese gods coming by on January 2016 (other pantheons include Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Chinese, Mayan, Hindu and Norse gods), it is an amazing investment (especially on this Thanksgiving weekend and periodically where they discount it at 33% off) and the premium currency can get you cool skins, voice packs among other cool stuff.\n\nIn conclusion: This game is a must have for anyone who likes MOBAs or actually dislikes the traditional MOBAs (like I did), but wants to give the genre one more chance.\n\n~~ TL;DR ~~\n\n█▀▀ㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ▀▀█▀▀ㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ █▀▀▄\n▀▀█ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ █ㅤㅤㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ ㅤ █\n▀▀▀ㅤ▀ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤㅤ ▀ㅤㅤ ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤ █▀▀\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ▄▀▀▄ㅤ█▀▀▄ㅤ █▀▀▄\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█▄▄▀\n\n─────███────██\n──────████───███\n────────████──███\n─────────████─█████\n████████──█████████\n████████████████████\n████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n██─────██████████████\n███────────█████████\n█──█───────────████\n█──────────────██\n██──────────────█────────▄███████▄\n██───███▄▄──▄▄███──────▄██$█████$██▄\n██──█▀───▀███────█───▄██$█████████$██▄\n██──█───█──██───█─█──█$█████████████$█\n██──█──────██─────█──█████████████████\n██──██────██▀█───█─────██████████████\n─█───██████──▀████───────███████████\n──────────────────█───────█████████\n─────────────▀▀████──────███████████\n────────────────█▀──────██───████▀─▀█\n────────────────▀█──────█─────▀█▀───█\n──▄▄▄▄▄▄▄────────██────█───████▀───██\n─█████████████────▀█──█───███▀──▄▄██\n─█▀██▀██▀████▀█████▀──█───██████▀─▀█\n─█────────█▄─────────██───████▀───██\n─██▄████▄──██────────██───██──▄▄▄██\n──██▄▄▄▄▄██▀─────────██──█████▀───█\n─────────███────────███████▄────███\n────────███████─────█████████████\n───────▄██████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████\n─────────██████████████\n────────███████████\n───────█████\n──────████\n─────████\n\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀▀█▀▀ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ█ㅤ▄█ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ█ ㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█▀▀▄ ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀ㅤ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀ㅤ▀ㅤㅤ▀ㅤ▀▀▀\n\n█▀▄▀█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ█▀▄▀█ ▄▀▀▄ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █ ㅤ █ㅤ█\n█─▀─█ㅤ█▄▄█ㅤㅤ █─▀─█ █ ㅤ █ █ ㅤ █ █▀▀ █▄▄█ㅤ█\n█ㅤㅤ █ㅤ▄▄▄█ㅤ ㅤ█ㅤㅤ█ ─▀▀ ─ ▀ ㅤ ▀ ▀▀▀ ▄▄▄█ㅤ▄","November 25, 2015","true","619.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(And other dota-like games that I didn't mention are just shadowed by Dota2) But they aren't as action-packed, aren't as visually polished as SMITE; their ranged attack can't be dodged or blocked; their combat field / lane / jungle are smaller, more crowded with incommensurately large model of characters and spells; their heroes have eyes in the back of their heads.\n\nFor example, I think Dota2's artwork is great. The other day, I roomed in and found out a man are almost as high as a tree and the landscape is just non existent, I'm so disappointed that I suddenly found out I'm just not playing an AAA game.\n\nFor the action-packed, juking and vision part. Go google SMITE top 5 plays casted by Inuki and one will feel the thrill that other mouse-clicking dota won't give. Just remember, when one dashes forward in SMITE, he/she will see everything moving backward and will have effective vision field shrinking. Compared to the more boring 360 degree vision field of most other dota games, one only have "part" of "720" degrees in SMITE.\n\nI said other popular dota-like games are great, but the comparison is cruel. So either 6/10 to them and 9/10 to SMITE. Or, if one can't accept they're 6, then 9/10 to them and 15/10 to SMITE.

It's good that they keep adding skins and new stuff to the game but unfortunately old issues still remain and one of that is the fps drop. This is one of the most unoptimized games i've played it's not that bad but when i compare it to let's say BF 4 things start to get really odd during matches i get 30-40 fps max (bare in mind everything is in low) and on BF 4 i get over 60 fps on medium. And that's one of the main reasons why i don't play it that often. Other issues include god balancing there are some really overpowered gods mostly the new ones (it's a consumer trick) every new god they relesease it's op so that you can buy him with money or with favor (igc). All in all if you can run Smite with good framerate and you are not easily agitated then i recommend it but if you have old pc or easily agitated i don't recommend it.","September 9, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than those people, this game is extreamly fun to play with friends, and if youre interested in learning about gods from different pantheons, it makes the game even more fun. You can also get all current and future gods in the game for a really good price. The good number of playable gods in the game makes no game alike, and the fact that there are 6 gamemodes to play, including the daily changing MOTD, which adds an even more fun twist to the normal gamemodes, such as being able to fire off all ablities at 80% lower cooldown then usual, without having to deplete your mana.

Simple? Simple. Well, your 3rd person viewpoint in this game is a lot different. Unlike HoTS, League of Legends, or Dota 2, SMITE does not use its same camera angle, and instead is directed behind the god you are controlling. SMITE has characters from different cultures such as Greek gods like Apollo and Artemis, or Chinese gods like Ne Zha and Huo Yi. Gameplay is very different from other mobas because you are viewing from a different angle, making skillshots feel very different than before if you have played from the LoL/Dota 2/HoTS viewpoint. Also, autoattacks are aimed too, making last hitting for gold or pushing more satisfying. Now, onto my opinion.\n\nPersonally, I really enjoy this game and very surprised I didn't try this game out earlier. This game has very satisfying and refreshing gameplay, and the gods have very fun kits to play around with. Personally, I found that my favorite assassin right now has to be Bastet. Don't look over this game if you are trying to looking for a new free-to-play game to try out, because you won't be disapppointed at all.","December 30, 2015","true","216.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played DOTA, HOS and LOL and other the HOS I quickly got feed up with the isometric style of MOBA.\n\nFirst off Smites biggest selling point is that it is in 3rd person. That is a game changer. It is more responsive and the action is so much faster. Also the cosmetic skins are amazing and have only gotten better and better. Not only that Hi Rez updates the skins of old Gods over time.\n\nI spend most of my time playing Arena and although I play Conquest, Arena is so much more fun for me. I main Ymir and Ares both 10 mastery, it is the first time I have found myself truly enjoying a support, tank roll in any game ever. Also support matters and can carry if you are good enough. Knowing every role can shine.\n\nThe game is free so there is simply not a reason to try it. Also the Ultimate God pack gives you access to all present and future Gods. I was salty that they have offered this deal post Beta but you know what, it brings in more players and that is great for Smite. Had Smite launched before or at the same time as DOTA or LOL it would be the number on MOBA in the world.\n\nTwo more points, Tribes is getting an update because of Smite, the game many claim killed Tribes. Hi Rez needs to make money and no game developers do no exist simply to cater to entitled gamers. Smite has been so sucessful that Hi rez can divert resources to do just that and has. Secondly Hi Rez is constantly doing in game events for gems which you use to by skins and voice packs as well as Gods. Never use gems for Gods because you can use the free currency to do that. Use your gems for skins and voice packs.\n\nI recommend this game as fully as I could ever recommend anything. If you find COnquest getting you down try Arean and yes it is okay to only play that and MOTD. It is your game time so your rules. Please join me in Smite it is a bannar time.\n","December 30, 2015","true","352.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It might be the 3rd person camera, or the fact that I can play 5v5 Arena instead of just lane-pushing, but whatever the reason I really do like this game. Which is suprising because my initial time spent with it, before it came to Steam, didn't exactly grab my attention.\n\nThat aside, there's not much different here from LoL or DOTA; same general mechanics, same gameplay (save the perspective).\n\nThe difference is that the learning curve isn't as high. It's still there, don;t get me wrong, and some Gods take a lot of skill/practice to play and not end up with no kills and double digit deaths. But it's not *as* high as a lot of other MOBAs. The community is mostly silent, from what I've seen, so it's not as toxic to ne players as something like LoL where if you ♥♥♥♥ up you're getting yelled at by 12 year olds. You still get idiots saying stupid things, but not as often.\n\nMy only advice for new players is to buy the Ultimate God Pack DLC. For $20-30 USD you get every God in the game, plus any new ones they add. This saves grinding so you can use all your Favors (in game currency) on skins for the Gods you like instead.","September 19, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hi-res can't make up their  minds on how to nerf or buff a god.\n-not alot of variety  in item builds to the five roles.\n- did I forget to mention the community will make you kill yourself.\n- Alot of bugs that need fixing\n-heard from alot of people that, old accounts that are being integrated into steam and having alot of troubles.\n-steam achievements dont unlock if you play the game before           (♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off because I should have all of them)\n-hi-rez will do anything for your money. Aka over priced in game items and skins\n- you need the god pack to actually  enjoy the full game....\n\nAll in all, Smite is a great game to play. But the community  is sooo toxic. Most new players will.probably quit because of "hard core smite fanatic s". You can't play ranked without someone trolling. But I have hope for the community to smarten  up lol.

Because of this it feels way more action based and almost all abilities/auto attacks are skill based aim.\nI prefer the regular Conquest map (3 lanes, jungle in between, 5 roles for you and your team to play) game mode but they have something for everyone! They have a total of 5 game modes + special one of the day, and a 6th you can access in custom games that was taken out.\nThere is currently 69 gods and they come out with new ones reletively fast! I'd say about 1 every 2 months give or take. Frequent patches to adjust balance and all that good stuff.\n\nPros.\n+Third person\n+Learning curve isn't as steep as other MOBAs\n+Deep competitive play\n+Many gamemodes\n+Frequent Patches\n+69 characters at time of writing this review\n+Has a much better community then LoL or DOTA in my experiance\n+Pretty cool theme of ancient gods battling it out\n+Servers rarely lag but I live close to them\n+Has casual and competitive modes\n+There is a esports community, last world tournament having prizepool of 2.6 million $\n+Indie company that made it, cares about it's game\n\nCons.\n-When a new god comes out they tend to be unbalanced for the first 2 weeks.\n-because it's a teambased game, if a teamate disconnects it can screw you over.\n-toxic teamates are annoying.\n\nFinal thoughts.\nThe idea of abunch of ancient gods from Egyptian, Chinese, Hindu, Norse, Greek, Roman mythology battling it out is awesome.

Most multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) titles feature top-down, isometric action, but Smite gives players the chance to play in third-person with a first-person shooter feel. Even auto-attacks are skillshots, making combat feel different from other MOBAs. Smite also features significant mode variety, allowing players to compete in unique deathmatches or themed games.\n\nSmite puts you in the role of an ancient god; the character pool currently draws upon Greek, Norse, Chinese, Mayan, and more, allowing Hi-Rez a nearly infinite pool of flavorful characters with appropriate abilities. Thanatos can sense death and has a skillset focused on assassination, paired with an ultimate ability that allows him to execute a weakened player in a single, long-range dive. Zeus comes with all the powers you’d expect a thunder god to have, and Poseidon has the signature ability to “release the Kraken,” doing heavy AOE damage. The colorful cast of characters is interesting, and each god and goddess feels unique in terms of skillsets and style.\n\nSmite’s third-person design changes things significantly from the top-down isometric MOBA paradigm. Every attack requires skill, so you can’t just rely on auto-attack to do your work. Everything from the basic slash of an axe or magic from a stave needs to be carefully timed and aimed in order to land. The range of each move is generally shown after a skill has been highlighted, and then you direct it to land in a specific area. Smite presents a huge change from games that often have “click-aimed” skills and abilities, and each character has specific nuances to master.\n\nSmite features a classic competitive mode that mirrors the structure of the go-to MOBA map: creeps spawn in three lanes and are assisted by players pushing, ganking, and team-fighting to the opposing base. Smite also has an all-random, all-middle mode that is becoming more popular in MOBA titles. While the standard mode is certainly the go-to for competitive league play and balance, Smite’s Arena and custom modes make it stand out from competitors","February 3","true","062.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example Neith was great when the game launched with its beautiful skins and playstyle people loved to play it, but now you can easily DESTROY her with another ADC.\n\nIf you are interested in mythologies (?) this game is great for you.

HOWEVER, it has the worst AI coding i have ever seen in a moba. Most dont care since they are only in it for the online play, but since I play with my young daughter that is all we play and was important to me.\n\nOf the 70+ available gods they only programmed about 8 or so in total. If you play joust (3vs3) you will play vs the same 3 every game, unless you use one of the ones the cpu wants, then it will use the same ones 2-3x making your match trivially easy to build gear for. Same goes for arena where i see the same god used for all 5 opponents at times.\n\nIf you play co-op conquest (5vs5) or clash (4vs4) the enemy will also pick the same gods every single game that will go down the same lanes every single time. If your team doesnt fill up in under 1min it will give you ai teammates that are so bad, that my daughter outplays them every single game (not joking). You are teamed with the same ones every single game, and they are horri-bad.\n\nI have played around 20 games with Kali and Sobek as teammates and I have never in all those games seen either of them get even a single kill. They wont push lanes and you will see them just sitting behind your phoenix and watching it die.\n\nDespite the lack of intelligence in the ai the game is still pretty fun and would still reccommend but not as highly as if they had put more effort into getting more ai up to snuff.\n\nThe community is usually pretty good in game, but on steam forums quite the opposite. Probably the most toxic collection of people I have ever wasted my time talking to. Most have run out of ritalin and are so bored they argue with you over literally any comment you make. Pretty much any thread on there about anything has the "Git gud" crowd chiming in thinking that its still pretty original and funny.\n\nThink your god is op and boring? "Git Gud"\n\nCant log in?

God Pack is an awesome deal)\n- Have you seen the goddesses (and other models)?

It feels more like an RPG-style PVP than it does an MOBA, and the lore behind all the Gods/Goddesses is a really neat aspect that a lot of MOBAs are missing nowadays (I'm looking at YOU, League of Legends).","February 15","true","294.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Smite is a very rewarding game, in that you are able to progress with each character you select. Getting my first level 10 mastery for a god was a very happy day, as I was able to see the work I put into getting to that point. You can buy the skins and chests in the game by simply logging in daily and playing for favor, but sometimes you need to pay if you really want a nice skin. The seasonal events are great and rewarding. You feel more in control of your character in this third person action MOBA, rather than a top-down style. I'd say, give it a try, and you may just get hooked.","December 7, 2015","true","236.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Its quite difficult but that makes it BETTER.There are a few kinks but thats to be expected! Everything seems quite balanced the only issue i have specifically with this game is that some of the items and main ideas that are introduced and essential to a moba are rather obscure. But thats just cuz im a noob to mobas everything seems really well thought out and i LOVE the idea of using gods instead of random people that the devolopers will spend maybe 10 minutes on thinking of. I feel that with the right community reception this game will dethrone league of legends and dota 2 especially since its a little easier to understand. As a complete scrub when it comes to MOBAS this game is definitely more attractive to me than the others simply because i mainly play FPS and this is 3rd person so it still has an "in the battlefield" kind of play. plus as a moba its just superior to most fps games because it requires you to ACTUALLY PLAY THE OBJECTIVE. Im just scared of how the community will go, if this games community ends up like counterstrike im gonna cry because counterstrikes community is so toxic i need a gas mask JUST TO PLAY CASUAL OR DEATHMATCH. I think this games going to do well tho it really just comes down to the devs the games off the floor and in the air people are playing time to make them stay. anyway i give this game a 10/10 simply because the only things i have against it are the cries of a scrub and im sure after a few hours of messing around ill get the hang of it PLAY THIS GAME ITS HARD BUT ITS FUN AND WORTH IT.","September 9, 2015","true","145.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's a great game and one of it's greatest qualities is that it can be rewarding. As in you have oportunities in getting ingame microtranzactions through logins and events. Like all games like smite or league there are balancing issues. Also smite isnt very challenging. League of legends is very challenging compared to smite. In other words, smite is like an easy mode league of legends except with a lot of overpowered gods and easy to kill minions. Yet smite is really fun, and if your looking for something to play casually, smite is the perfect fit.","December 14, 2015","true","402.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely better than the more mainstream MOBAS (looking at you, DOTA 2 / League of Legends). Most MOBAs tend to bore me and infuriate me, but this one doesn't feel like a MOBA and that you're more in control than the click-fest the other MOBAs bring - plus the community is INFINITELY less toxic than other MOBAs (mainly because toxic behavior is not tolerated by HiRez or most of the players). Instead of an RTS stand-point, it uses a 3rd person action perspective. The gods are all fairly unique and they all have the potential to be amazing and game changing while focusing on teamwork and strategy. The nice thing about this game is that you don't really have to pay a single penny to play and it's not pay to win. The company is actually good enough to award you with their premium currency for daily log-ins (days 6 & 7), and with tons of events. I would suggest to get the Ultimate God Pack since you'll receive all 71 gods PLUS every single god that comes after this, and with the Japanese gods coming by on January 2016 (other pantheons include Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Chinese, Mayan, Hindu and Norse gods), it is an amazing investment (especially on this Thanksgiving weekend and periodically where they discount it at 33% off) and the premium currency can get you cool skins, voice packs among other cool stuff.\n\nIn conclusion: This game is a must have for anyone who likes MOBAs or actually dislikes the traditional MOBAs (like I did), but wants to give the genre one more chance.\n\n~~ TL;DR ~~\n\n█▀▀ㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ▀▀█▀▀ㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ █▀▀▄\n▀▀█ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ █ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ █ㅤㅤㅤ █ ㅤ █ㅤ █ ㅤ █\n▀▀▀ㅤ▀ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤㅤ ▀ㅤㅤ ㅤ ▀▀▀▀ㅤ █▀▀\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ▄▀▀▄ㅤ█▀▀▄ㅤ █▀▀▄\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █\nㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ█ㅤ █ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ█▄▄▀\n\n─────███────██\n──────████───███\n────────████──███\n─────────████─█████\n████████──█████████\n████████████████████\n████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n█████████████████████\n██─────██████████████\n███────────█████████\n█──█───────────████\n█──────────────██\n██──────────────█────────▄███████▄\n██───███▄▄──▄▄███──────▄██$█████$██▄\n██──█▀───▀███────█───▄██$█████████$██▄\n██──█───█──██───█─█──█$█████████████$█\n██──█──────██─────█──█████████████████\n██──██────██▀█───█─────██████████████\n─█───██████──▀████───────███████████\n──────────────────█───────█████████\n─────────────▀▀████──────███████████\n────────────────█▀──────██───████▀─▀█\n────────────────▀█──────█─────▀█▀───█\n──▄▄▄▄▄▄▄────────██────█───████▀───██\n─█████████████────▀█──█───███▀──▄▄██\n─█▀██▀██▀████▀█████▀──█───██████▀─▀█\n─█────────█▄─────────██───████▀───██\n─██▄████▄──██────────██───██──▄▄▄██\n──██▄▄▄▄▄██▀─────────██──█████▀───█\n─────────███────────███████▄────███\n────────███████─────█████████████\n───────▄██████████████████████\n████████─██████████████████\n─────────██████████████\n────────███████████\n───────█████\n──────████\n─────████\n\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀▀█▀▀ㅤ█▀▀█ㅤ█ㅤ▄█ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ█ ㅤㅤ█▄▄█ㅤ█▀▀▄ ㅤ█▀▀\nㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ▀ㅤ ㅤ▀ㅤ ▀ㅤ▀ㅤㅤ▀ㅤ▀▀▀\n\n█▀▄▀█ㅤ█ ㅤ █ㅤ ㅤ█▀▄▀█ ▄▀▀▄ █▀▀▄ █▀▀ █ ㅤ █ㅤ█\n█─▀─█ㅤ█▄▄█ㅤㅤ █─▀─█ █ ㅤ █ █ ㅤ █ █▀▀ █▄▄█ㅤ█\n█ㅤㅤ █ㅤ▄▄▄█ㅤ ㅤ█ㅤㅤ█ ─▀▀ ─ ▀ ㅤ ▀ ▀▀▀ ▄▄▄█ㅤ▄","November 25, 2015","true","619.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel as if it takes a bit more skill than most of the others which are basically a button mashing fest. Sure they're pros and cons to every game developed, but out of all the MOBA's or even out of the nearly 150 games I have I pick this one the majority of the time to play. I only wish the achievements and hours transferred over from the original client launcher instead of me having to get them all again for Steam, that's my only CON so far. Because I have damn near all of them in game and roughly 200+ hours put into this game and the only MOBA I like paying for skins. They put some DAMN GOOD detail into the skins as well as the voice packs to go with those skins.\n\nAlso if you get hooked on the game get the ultimate god pack, if it's still out, it's TOTALLY worth it. All of my hamer friends I tell about this game and I've gotten several hooked on Smite. I love it and so do they. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone.

Probably better than LoL and Dota 2 because they have more toxic communities and especially in case of riot games they dont ue the power they have over their game correctly. I played the smite beta and since then it has improved drasticly. If you wont to have a full experience buy the all god pack and starter pack which both have really good value. In terms of skins its the most creative of the mobas.\nThe new 3rd person perspective compared to the overview perspective of the other mobas is a good change ut also limits the abilities they can add a lot and the originality of new gods added to the games. The amount of skills that are cones straight lines and circles around the gods make different gods very similar.\nWhen i got into this gamei realised i stomped everyone because i had alrady played other mobas. I Highly recommended for already moba players, new to mobas may have a bad experience because you need to know the basic concepts and not trat it like team deathmatch where you can die without impact.","November 23, 2015","true","245.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's so exciting, interesting and it's got so much fun! I can recommend playing it with friends. It's a game where you learn how to make good tactics with your friends, and that brings players together. It's a game where you have to build up a strategy to make the best/strongest team of Gods, which I like. I like how you start from the bottom and have to work to the top.\n\nBad things:\nI actually don't have any complains about this game at all. I think it's only fair that some skins can only be achieved with gems. It makes me want to play even more to unlock them.\n\nGood things:\nI like the different God styles and the skins that you can achieve to them. It's great that not every kind of skin cost gems, as it would have turned out to be boring in the end. If I'd have to go through an awfully lot to get every single gem in the game, I'd probably stop playing it after some time. I think the game's quiet easy to play, and the rules are easy to relate to. It's not too hard and it's not too easy, that's how I like games. It makes me focus on training my Gods, which is the whole point of SMITE. x3 I also like the kickout system that kicks inactive players out of the arena or the different multiplayer games. It's fair, as a team should work together. They depend on each other, in my opinion.\n\nSo my conlcusion is: This game is amazingly good, if you like tactics, multiplayer games and Gods! x3 I can definitely recommend it!","March 22","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But smite doesnt do that. you see Riot games doesnt respect other people saying that meatwadsprite  (aka videogamedunkey) is toxic. Dunkey said something so bad to that player he even got banned on league of legends so he can play again on september 17, 2015. you know what im done playing league of legends. dunkey is done playing league of legends. so lets just all play smite the best moba game in the plublic marketing.\nleague is so shity even nobody is not gona play the game. its so stupid now.

Apart from more common Moba skills, like map awareness and tactical awareness, Smite also requires you to hit much more skillshots than other Mobas, which makes it interesting for more serious players, potentially with a background in shooter games\n\nPros\nfriendly learning curve\nintuitive controls\ngood tutorials for new players\nUltimate god pack (all current and future gods for one price)\ncasual game modes\nhigh skill ceiling\nskillshots\ninteresting god design\ngrowing e-sports scene\nA lot of these cons are technical and will hopefully be resolved soon\n\nCons\nbad matchmaking\nbad servers (a persistent issue that keeps coming and going again)\nannyoing idiots (like every Moba, Smite sadly hasn't been able to get rid of this)\nWho is this game for?:\nAnyone who is interested in the Moba genre and is looking for a more casual experience.\nAnyone who is looking for a familiar control scheme and more skillshots.\nAnyone who wants to play a competitive Moba with a different design.","September 9, 2015","true","478.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
