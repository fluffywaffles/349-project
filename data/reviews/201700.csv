It´s a game focused on arcade racing with lots of destruction and car madness, unlike the other games from the DiRT series that had a more "serious" approach, mixing simulation with arcade. This game still has some similarities with those, while being a completely different experience. One thing I can grant you, it is extremely fun.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is extremely satisfying, especially the sweet car destruction (which is basically the main focus in this game). The arcade handling feels great in this game, very easy to master and enjoyable. The AI opponents is ultra aggressive, but that works well in this game since it is based on pure car carnage (reminds me a lot of the flatout series), a shame you only face 8 opponents though. This game also as a nitro boost that slowly recharges over time and much more faster if you create some chaos and hit the opponents cars, never seen on any DiRT series game, but again, this one is essentially a spin-off, with a few things borrowed from the other DiRT games. Track design is amazing as previous DiRT games, a shame that the game borrows many tracks from those later games, but at least they feel fresh in this game. Lots of game modes too, from basic racing, to pure demolition derby carnage will keep you entertained.\n\nLongevity and Replayability\n\nThe longevity of the career mode is strangely small which is a bummer, I completed it in about 8 hours. Still you have other modes like joyride with tons of missions and challenges to complete, like in DiRT 3, which will get you around 2 hours to complete it 100%. Then of course, you have the multiplayer where luckily you will spend a good amount of hours but I will address that below in my review. It does not have that much tracks either, even though most are awesome and have many variations, you can get a little bored of constantly racing in the same places. Essentially the single-player part of the game is kind of a letdown since you complete it rather fast.\n\nGraphics and Presentation\n\nNow the graphics and presentation. I have only good things to say in this matter. The tracks are beautiful, they are a blast to the eyes. Filled with life, great colors, they really transmit a good vibe. The cars are amazingly detailed too, with great deformation models which greatly help improving the experience. Smooth visuals as in all games in the DiRT series. Presentation-wise it is top notch too, very similiar to the treatment of the late DiRT 3, with similar menus and art style.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound department is sharp too as expected. The sound of the people reactions, the engines roar, the destruction, everything is amazing. Well except for the commentary during races which is insanely cheesy and lame. I loved the soundtrack too, it fits perfectly in this games, a really great song list in my opinion.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe multiplayer is a blast. Playing this game online is a blast. Insanely fun, crazy-action packed races. Sadly few people play it at the time (game was released in 2012), but with some luck you will still find filled lobbies. I noticed some lags in some chaotic races that can get into your nerves, but nothing that makes the game unplayable. Another important aspect in the multiplayer is that this game supports split-screen. You heard it right, SPLIT-SCREEN! A feature that many games nowadays do not have, that makes for some awesome gaming sessions with friends.\n\nPerformance\n\nGame performed amazingly on my native resolution 1440x900 in highest settings, locked in 60fps with almost no dips, both single-player and split-screen, on my budget rig (check my profile if you want to know the specs). It is well optimized and has tons of graphical options, so unless you have a potato pc, it will handle it perfectly.\n\n\nSummary\nPros:\nExtremely satisfying races and car destruction\nGreat graphics and presentation\nSimplistic arcade handling, yet it feels very good\nGood range of game modes\nOnline is incredibly fun\nCons:\nSingle-player career is very small\nLame commentary\nOccasional lags in multiplayer\nMy personal score: 7.5/10\n\nIf you like arcade racing games this one you should get. It is extremely enjoyable, yet the single-player runs out very fast. And the multiplayer is almost dead, so you should pick this up when its on sale and not full price since it is when the multiplayer can get resurrected and have people playing it for a few days and the single-player definitely wont justify the game base price (even though it is not that expensive). A great game to spend a few hours when you are bored!","August 14, 2015","true","12.5"," 77 of 91 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","77","91","5","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/recommended/201700/","roadrunner1","Road Runner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadrunner1/","551 products in account","Dirt Showdown is in my opinion a bit underrated and really misunderstood by some people. They consider the game as the successor of Dirt 3. However, Showdown is more a spinoff, that has nothing to do with the other Dirt games besides the 'Dirt' name. That being sad, I think this game is really good in what is does. Just mindless 'demolition derby like' fun. The car handling is just right for this type of game in my opinion. It also has great graphics and sound. There's single player with a career mode, wich will keep you busy for a while. It has enough variety with many different gamemodes. And then there's another SP mode, called Joyride, were you have to complete a series of tricks and collect all the Showdown logo's. Well, if you want those achievements at least :)  But the game really shines in multiplayer. Unfortunately, the MP isn't really active anymore. Often you find yourself in an empty lobby. The best idea is to look on the forum for people to play with. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend the game just for MP. But like I said, there's enough fun to be had in SP alone.","November 8, 2014","true","118.4"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","48","50","0","0"

For once, Codemasters went out of their way to turn their arcade-ish rally simulator into something even more arcade-ish, and not even in a good way. Even so, don't let that discourage you from getting a copy of it. It's still kinda fun to play.\n\nDiRT Showdown, unlike its previous predecessors, now operates like a crossover between Flatout and the Destruction Derby racing division of GRID, minus the head-on-collisions-that-cause-drivers-to-fly-out-from-their-windshield factor. There are many key features that differentiate DiRT Showdown from other games. One of those key features is the introduction to health bars and nitrous, as the previous DiRT games never had any health bars or nitrous (provided in an actual rally game, your car only dies when you severe the parts hard enough for it to malfunction and it's not rocket science to find out that using nitrous is illegal in official rally races). In DiRT Showdown, there are no rules. None. It's you against 7 other drivers and your objective is to win first place by hook or by crook. Do whatever it is necessary to secure the podium finish. Either slam, shunt, spin or even T-Bone your way to victory.\n\nThe selection of cars is less compared to the previous DiRT series and although the derby cars may look fake, they actually do exist in real life (at least, the Jupiter San Marino does). And although they removed the rally cars altogether, they managed to preserve the cars used in DiRT 3's gymkhana, such as the Ford Fiesta, the Subaru Impreza WRX GD and many others that I'm too lazy to mention in this review.\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention the game modes that are available in DiRT Showdown. Some game modes have been preserved in DiRT Showdown, such as Domination, Gymkhana and Head 2 Head, while they added new game modes that show what DiRT Showdown is all about, such as 8-Ball (an 8-player race to the finish line), Survival (where it's you against gladiator cars and your objective is to survive for as long as you can) and Sumo (where you wrestle other cars out from the ring). It may be brutal and it certainly is unforgiving, but it sure is a lot of fun.\n\nThe only downsides to this game are the price for the game (seriously, 30 bucks?) and the fact that the game looked like it got ripped off by Bugbear Entertainment (a.k.a the developers of Flatout). DiRT Showdown may not shine as the authentic DiRT experience, but the game certainly is a must-play to those who like serious games that, at the same time, isn't so serious.\n\nTry to get this game in a sale or during a bundle sale, unless you have 30 dollars to spend.","February 23, 2014","true","21.5"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","42","49","0","0"

There's nothing that can be related to what made Dirt games famous among racing fans and this choice left many people disappointed in the Dirt series. We can only hope for a better future for the upcoming Dirt. The TOUR is really, really short. I mean it took me at least twice the time to finish Dirt 2 Tour or Dirt 3 tour. I had no idea they cut so much racing from this game. Not even a 10 Hour long tour, it's a bit embarrassing. While I'm not sure why,  I couldn't make a single Challenge but this might be on my end or just bad luck. Servers never were available. Also, after finishing a race if I decided to press "Send Challenge" the game would crash on me. A bit of search in the Steam Community and I can see there were more people with the same issue. Another less good point is about the commentator which is really, really bad. The choice of words are bad, the vocabulary is very limited and the jokes are, well, they are no jokes at all.\n\nHowever, I still managed to find good things too. The selection of cars are good enough to keep you happy, experimenting several cars while upgrading some of them. The game can look, really, really good. Believe it or not, but I remember when 4K TV's were released on the Market, this game was one of the games for them to show "pretty visuals" on their TV's while having a powerful PC hooked up. You can see this specially when playing at night, in Tokyo which is simply mesmerizing. The lights, the wet floor and the drift really made the game shine during these particular races.\n\nSo why did I recommend this game?\n\nIf you can find it for the right price -and never pay full price for it- Dirt showdown is a small but safe bet. Again, I recommend playing this game if you get it for a very kind, cheap price. The game is no more than a snack to eat between meals but while it may satisfy you, it will not last longer if you are chasing to fix your racing needs. Here's hoping for a better Dirt in the future more focused on pure Rally events and races.","June 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieceOfMind1/recommended/201700/","PieceOfMind1","PieceOfMind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieceOfMind1/","2414 products in account","A much more casual racer than previous CodeMasters DiRT offerings, but still fairly fun for what it tries to be.  As usual with CodeMasters, the graphics and audio are overall impressive.\n\nWhere the game IMO falls down is its oversimplification in too many aspects.  How often do you see a racing game that does away with the speedo?  Gone are gear changes and cockpit view.  In are boost and "car health", and almost never having to use the brake.  Most races on intermediate you can finish well without ever taking off the accelerator.\n\n\nPositives:\n+Graphics.  Colourful and fluid racing gameplay.  So many fireworks!!  Stunning backgrounds.\n+Audio.  Decent soundtrack, satisfying engine sounds.\n+Difficulty. Can select between three difficulties. I found intermediate enjoyable.\n+Decent variety in event types and number of tracks\n+Replays.\n\nNegatives:\n-Annoying announcer. CodeMasters seem to have mastered the terrible dudebro announcer in their series.\n-Oversimplified car controls. No manual gears, no need to brake, no speedo.  If you approach this as a purely arcade racer, this may be a positive to you.\n-Multiplayer is dead\n-Crashes when connecting to server to send "challenges" to friends.\n-Game length.  Does not take very long to finish the single player campaign.\n\nYou can see that with DiRT Showdown CodeMasters have really tried to capture the most exciting parts of their previous games and condense them down into an action-packed arcade racing title.  In doing that they sacrifice the skilled racing that was needed in previous titles.  Slamming into opponents is now encouraged, and bumping into objects like tyres and barrels does not even slow you down.\n\nAs an offshoot of the DiRT series I don't recommend it, but as a pure mindless arcade title you might have some fun here.","November 7, 2015","false","8.8"," 68 of 99 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","68","99","4","4"

My problem is I have a bit of OCD towards the genre. If it isn't exactly what or how I want it, I don't like it.\n\nAnd Dirt Showdown got my interest, though not much because I played pretty much all racers since 2004's Burnout 3: Takedown, which is the masterpiece of racing games. That perfect title that never leaves your memories. It had stellar graphics, perfect controls with perfect responsiveness. Also has the best soundtrack of all time of any game or movie, ever! Car variety was huge! Campaign was huge as well! Replayability was huge! Menus were super slick and everything about it was just pixel perfect! One of the best games of all time and I still have the whole soundtrack on my phone :D\n\nAnyways, and those racers since 2004 never gave me that spark again for the racing genre. My reaction were always "Ugh, wtf is this sh*t?" or "Meh..." and I proceeded with the uninstall process.\n\nBut I got in a trade with a friend Dirt Showdown because it was being given away alongside the pre-order of GRID Autosport and I couldn't really let this slip by my fingers.\n\nI installed as soon as I got it and started playing.\n\nYou have no. Damn. Idea. Of the levels of joy I had when this brought me fond (VERY fond) memories of that 2004 classic game you should know by now. It's like a Burnout 3: Takedown 2! Everything I needed was there! The fantastic graphics, the absolutely AMAZING Soundtrack, the perfectly responsive controls, the car variety and level variety. It even has an announcer like 2004's B3 and this one is also really good! He keeps throwing little jokes, funny puns, etc. It's really cool! It really is!\n\nAnd after 22 hours of 100%'ing the whole game. [Campaign: Everything gold. Joyrides (2 Open World maps for you to complete missions in and also find all the 100 hidden collectibles): all 150 missions done and all 100 Hidden Packages found (which reward you with something if you find'em all (not saying what, of course!)) and level 12 in Multiplayer Sessions] I can safely say this is the best racing game and the best racing game experience I've had in the last decade! (That's 10 years!!!!!).\n\nModes are also very unique, it's not just racing like most borefests of racers. You have regular racing, domination (get the best time in certain track portions), 8-balls (super fun variation of the regular racing mode), ram rage (destroy and wreck ♥♥♥♥ up! (Demolition Derby, pretty much) King of the Hill (knock all cars out of the podium), Head 2 Head (Gymkhana competition between oponents (whether it's 2 or more people or 2 teams). Smash and grab (get a bag full of loot and hold it (avoid getting hit) for as much as possible to get as much points as possible to win). Capture the Flag (FFA or Team based), etc.!\n\nI don't think I have anything else to say do I? I already said it. Great graphics, great level variety (different weather conditions as well!), top notch of perfection soundtrack! (Also on my phone), great announcer, super slick and responsive controls. Loading screens are very short and this game is a PERFECT PC VERSION! Everything it needs, it's there! Controls are great (though, of course, controller's always better), benchmark tool! Wide range of options to tweak for weaker PC's to be able to run this game well! (Which I believe pretty much any PC can! I tried this on my regular PC, can play 60 FPS "almost" maxed out no problems. And I tried on my older PC (quite weak) with a 2.4 GHz Dual Core and an AMD Radeon HD 3650 (Mobile version (yes, a laptop)) and it ran really smooth at 50-60 FPS, though I had to tweak most stuff to low and others to medium, obviously.)\n\nOh yeah! Problems with the game: Campaign (called the "Showdown Tour") is REALLY short. I finished it in 10 hours with everything gold (1st place). I wanted at least 20 hours! But the multiplayer's there to make up for it. Sadly, the MP's pretty dead. I can (and so should you be able to) find occasionally some MP matches to play in and I can say it's one of the best and most fun MP experiences I've ever had the pleasure of trying! It's so varied and fun! Lots of modes to play (around 8, I think) and all are unique and fun to do!\n\nCampaign's short but the JoyRides are also there to make up for it (1st place Gold in every campaign level and 100%'ing all missions and getting all hidden packages in both JoyRide maps took me between 17 and 18 hours of pure adrenaline running, head shaking, song-humming fun!\n\nI can't recommend this enough! And at it's current price on steam of 19,99€, there's no reason for you to not get it! If you still don't know about it, it's easy! Try the free demo on steam! The game also goes on sale quite often, when other Codemasters games are on sale too. So, grab it and come wreck stuff in MP with me! :D\n\nOh you want a score? Ok fine. 22 hours of quality, no problems except the fact that it's too short the SP campaign (and even then, it's not much of an "issue") But even then, the game wasn't the classic rip-off 50€ full retail price. It was cutback to the more reasonable and accessible 39,99€. They knew this SPIN-OFF (it's a SPIN-OFF, not "This shouldn't have Dirt in the name") was a smaller and more digestive experience, so it's commendable for them to reduce the pricetag. So the smaller length's is proportional to the price. Think of Alan Wake and it's Spin-Off: American Nightmare. It's kinda like that!\n\n10/10. One of the VERY few games I've played in my life that deserve a perfect score. Enough said. Have a great day!","September 27, 2014","true","25.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","3"

This game doesn't cost too much like DiRT 3 Complete Edition but doesn't contain that much like DiRT 3 Complete Edition. But still game is really cool. In this game you need to beat...wait! You must beat, break, push, incapacitate other cars if you want to win of cource. This is not just because some kind of competition exist for example: "Rampage", "Ball", "Hard Target". Even in normal race with sportcars i recommend car with good strenght. I was  thinking like:" Hm good sportcar with awesome handling and power and bad strenght...but wait! Who needs strenght in normal race?" Yes... this was my first mistake... :D More better to drive like a wolf who  not actually that fast but can easily push other cars to become first than be like a rabbit with a good speed but bad strenght and always be afraid that someone will push you in your back. I'm sure that you will not need strenght on "Trick rush" and "Head 2 Head" but only there in all another don't be afraid to take cars with good strength. Music actually awesome in this game! Sometimes even you can see that in races when you need to beat, push cars most of all you can hear rock and in another races where you must to drift and make some tricks most of all you can hear electro. I don't see in this idea something bad because i like all music here even i can say that i'm not a big fan of rock but here.... Awesome!\nBy the way if you played this game and can't find name of your favorite song -here all names of all songs! So i recommend this game!

You can play in events varying from races to destruction derbies and sumo wrestling for vehicles. (I'm serious)\n\nIt's a little less realistic than the other games in the series, but you know, I'm totally fine with this. It's clearly meant to be a spin-off from the series, and isn't really connected to DiRT 3 for example. Although, if that's what you want, then I wouldn't recommend it. There's a greater focus on aggresive driving and smashing up opponents, rather than clean rally driving.\n\nI'm personally having a lot of fun with the Rampage event where you smash the hell out of every other car in the arena, but the races are a lot of fun too. I recommend you gives this game a try, DiRT fan or not!\n\nMy only minor complaints is the lack of cockpit camera and the lack of ability to import your own music to the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWlTx77_quo","September 7, 2014","true","16.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

And I wasn't mistaken\nYes, I know nearly every fan of DiRT series considers this one ♥♥♥♥, but as a man who played neither of DiRT games, I want to say, this is a game in general was great fan.\n\nI might do some mistakes, but mostly because I'm not familiar with most of DiRT games\n\nWhat I wanted to note first is Flatout style of this game. Yes, it has demolition arena, yes it has 8-tracks, though they're really more interesting than Flatout ones. But this is a prelude\n\nGoods:\nThis game has decent graphics and by saying decent I really mean that, for a racing game it looks really cool, all damage done to car is pretty visible and detailed, same is weather graphic decor. This game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥A of different cars - from metal garbage to sportcars, it won't hvae you bored with variety or vehicles. It is generally easy to play (by the end playing on medium became pretty easy and a bit boring for me), so, if you're quite a noob, don't worry about that too much. It's generally fun as well, I mean, senseless crashing cars against everything, isn't that fun? Most likely (+1 to humanity decadence), however, nearly every demolition/rampage/8-ball race was pure amusement for me. Especially 8-ball, where you will not always survive to the end. It has rather realistic physics. I won't be saying too much about it, you'd rather see it somewhere.\n\nBads:\nIt's laggy as ♥♥♥♥. Steam layout doesn't change language when in-game, whenever you want to open windows in-game, your fullscreen mode will be canceled. I eventually got used to this stuff, but it is really irritating at times. The game might crash just out of nowhere, leaderboards never load (which left me hesitating if they even exist), and I couldn't make a name myself in-game since it doesn't change langauge in-game either (my default language is russian and the game doesn't accept cyrillic symbols). After all, it doesn't have just "usual race" mode where you can choose location, number of players, laps, etc. All races are within the Showdown Tour only. (Or I haven't just explored it enough to notice that mode)\n\nIn conclusion, YES, it's a good game. YES, it lags as much as STALKER, but if we leave this out, we get a pretty decent stuff. It might look like Flatout rip-off, but it's generally better than Flatout, even though it's a failure among DiRT games.\n\n8.9/10\nAmused me as much.\nThanks for reading, play games!","June 23, 2014","true","16.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

In later versions of the game other car sports were added like Gymkhana, destruction derby, ect. With the Showdown version focused on the more spectacular driving events might create a good game.

Dirt Showdown is one of those games you play at the weekend, sometimes. If there's nothing else to play. Good to play with friends and just 'okay' to play on your own. It seems rushed, due to a alot of repeat tracks from previous Dirt games, of which the developers have just added a few ramps and tyres to. There's a fair variety of things to do in the game though, ranging from Destruction Derby, to races and then Gymkhana (where you do donuts and jumps etc). You will have to play all these types of modes as in career mode you are made to in a random order. So one second you're told to 'put your foot down and plow in to your opponents' and then told 'don't scratch your car or you lose your points'. The AI has rubberbanding or 'catch- up' which is also easily noticeable online, considering me and my mates were laughing at how slow your car suddenly go if your quite far ahead in 1st place, when the guy in last would be given an uncontrollable amount of speed boost. Having said that, in Destruction arena's or 'knockout' this doesn't happen because all you have to do is wreck opponents and earn points for hits.\n\nLikes about the game:\nDestuction modes- 8 Ball style tracks, knockout and derby's, which are intense and a good laugh.\nGraphics- Apart from the crowd, graphics are as good as always from Codemasters. So shiny as well.\nCars- I like the cars that you are given, you get different ones for the different game types. Some are made up, some are real. Depends what mode you are playing\nMenu's- BIG, BOLD, LOUD. NICE.\nCar Handling- Easy to get used to, which is right for this type of game\nParty modes- For online, like capture the flag and smash and grab.\n\nDislikes:\nAnnouncer guy- He needs to shush. Plus, you can't mute him. Says stupid things which aren't funny\nAI rubber banding/ catch up for online- Kills any point of skill. It kills skills.\nRepeat tracks - 'I saw that track from Dirt 2.......aaaaaand Dirt 3\nOpponent amount- Only 8 players. Come on, they could of at least done 12 which they did for the game GRID.\nOnline ranking- Takes forever...mainly because no-one plays online anymore and you need a full lobby to get a good amount of levelling up points.\nGymkhana- There's only a certain amount of times you can do jumps, donuts and drifts till it gets repetitive.\n\nI recommend only if you like arcade racers and don't mind getting smashed up by others.\n6.5 (maybe a 7)/10\n\n","December 12, 2014","true","41.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProbablyAlligator/recommended/201700/","ProbablyAlligator","Probably Alligator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProbablyAlligator/","295 products in account","DiRT Showdown is an arcadey driving game. I avoid the term “racing game”, since racing is not the only (though perhaps the biggest) part of the game. Unlike other DiRT games, Showdown capitalizes on Destruction Derby-like game modes that focus on crashing your car against others more than avoiding collisions.\n\nIn the Showdown Tour, being the main game mode, we have 4 series of races, each of them including 13 races in various gamemodes. Let's go over them real quick.\n\nFirst, we have the purely racing modes. Race Off is as simple as racing gets: first to finish line wins. Then there's Eliminator, where every 20-ish seconds the last driver drops out of the race, Domination, where you drive a few laps trying to get the best possible time in each segment of the track, and 8-Ball, being almost like Race Off, but with the race track including numerous crossroads, ending up with cars crashing straight into their opponents' sides, often ending up with half the drivers not finishing the race at all because of how much damage they took. The racing modes are all quite solid and fun, and imho the best part of the game.\n\nThen we have the modes where havoc and destruction are the main objective. First is Rampage, where you get the more points the more damage you do to other cars. A small variation of Rampage is Knockout, being basically the same thing but on a stage, so you can push others out of the arena for extra points. Lastly we have Hard Target, where we're trying to survive as long as possible having every single opponent trying to chase us down and wreck us on a small, enclosed arena. I found the destruction modes alright, less skill-based than the racing ones, but quite fun to play and exciting.\n\nNow, in this case, “last but not least” doesn't fit too well. The last modes are imo the weakest part of the game, not fitting the racing nor the smashing themes too well. First we have Trick Rush, where we try to do tricks like jumps, drifts and obstacle smashing in an small area filled with ramps and obstacles. Then there's Head 2 Head, being a set of tricks you have to do sequentially on a race track while a single opponent tries to do it faster. Lastly, and I did save the worst for last, we have Smash Hunter. On a big, open space we have to hunt for colored barries to drive right through. The order is not known upfront, and while there exists an optimal driving path that'll take us through all required barriers in the shortest time, it's not very easy to figure out what it is; in one case it even includes driving straight through a wooden fence, which is apparently destructible too: a mechanic that the game doesn't introduce or explain before. A small help is an ability to rewind time a few times each race, but even with that I found Smash Hunter more annoying than not, and felt relieved when I finally got that 3rd place and could move on to the fun stuff.\n\nI mentioned that the game puts quite a bit of focus on the destruction aspect, so let's look into that a bit. In all gamemodes the game gives you an incentive to harass your opponents by smashing your car into theirs, which fills your boost bar that you can later use for increasing your acceleration temporarily. The harder you hit them the more boost you get (hitting them at a 90 degree angle is worth more than slightly bumping their rear), and all cars have a health bar (regenarating, but so slowly that it hardly changes anything). In classic, racing modes a car with health reduced to zero is removed from the race completely (but remains on track as an obstacle), while in the destruction modes is respawned after a moment. Even in the simple Race Off events I found giving another driver an “Insane T-Bone” a lot of fun, and I can imagine it gets even better when playing with friends (Showdown supports both splitscreen and online multiplayer).\n\nYou can't mention destruction without mentioning the Announcer. He accompanies you through the entire game, commenting every collision and overtake that happens, and while some of his jokes are a bit lame (“it's like watching two cars drive into each other! Oh wait, they do”) he doesn't repeat himself too often and I think he adds quite a bit of charm to the game; I haven't even considered disabling him for a moment. In the background of the announcer we have the music, consisting mostly of various rock (mostly heavy and fast-paced) and some drum-n-bass-ish tracks. I didn't find a way to disable individual ones, which some people like, but personally I didn't feel a need to; I think they fit the game pretty well.\n\nApart from the Showdown Tour the game also features a Joyride mode. It puts us on one of two big, open areas, where we can complete a total of 150 missions while not constrained by any time limit. 150 sounds like a lot, but in reality the “missions” are just single tricks in specific places, like “jump between blue containers” or “drift under the crane”. Some are more challenging than others, but none from the 40-ish that I completed took me more than 5 minutes, with some (like “smash the red boxes”) taking almost no time at all. In addition to missions there's also Hidden Packages, similar to Secret Tapes from Tony Hawk series. Some are quite cleverly hidden, and apparently there's a bonus for finding them all, but I didn't take the time. I suspect it's a unique car unlock or something.\n\nI didn't mention cars themselves yet, and there's a reason for that. We have quite a huge set of cars to choose from, unlock, and buy with in-game money that we earn from winning races. They all have statistics like Power, Handling, Strength etc, and sometimes we can spend extra money to upgrade them. Does it actually matter though, that's another story. Game employs rubberbanding quite heavily: when you're behind, your opponents will slow down so you can catch up with them, when you're ahead, they'll get a speed boost and sometimes absurdly overtake you right before the race ends. As an experiment I took the fastest car I unlocked and tried my best in the first race in the game, and while my car was visibly faster than others and I was able to finish 1st without even using boost, it still took me a few tries to do it, with opponents surprisingly overtaking me every now and then. That makes me doubt if unlocking and upgrading cars actually gives you any edge in the end, but perhaps it does make sense in multiplayer, which hopefully doesn't do rubberbanding.\n\nAll in all, I had a lot of fun with DiRT Showdown. It took me 12 hours to complete, and while I wish I could forget the time spent playing Smash Hunter, I enjoyed the game a lot. While it's not a realistic driving simulator, far from it, it's a really enjoyable casual racing game, and I can easily see myself having some good time with it at a LAN party or hopping on Joyride every now and then to play a few missions.","January 15","true","15.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

From the videos I've watched, it looked nice and various Linux reviews said that the port has very good performance, better than Windows on some machines and for 2,99€, I just decided to pick it up.\n\nDue to my inexperience with racing games, I can't really comment on the mechanics, but the cars felt good and I had no issues playing this with my keyboard. Later I tried a PlayStation controller and it's much better with that, the game also picked up the controller right away without me doing anything.\n\nI also can't decide if the announcer is annoying or brilliant, though he's definitely repetitive, as well as some maps that are used throughout all leagues. Fortunately every league introduces new maps and cars.\n\nOne thing I think the game lacked was any meaningful personalization to the cars, especially since they were very DIY-y in the beginning. You don't need to go full-on Need for Speed mode, but a bit of variety from the standard paintjobs would have been nice. The Monster Energy cars look pretty good though.\n\nOne thing I wanted to add: I like the music in the game, there are some really nice tracks in it but most of the tracks are just there to add ambiance. The soundtrack consists mostly of rock, EDM and some hip-hop.\n\n\nGraphics\n\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is the color-palette. I get that they were going for a certain look, and it works on most maps, but there are snow maps where the snow looks brown/yellow, so not very pretty to look at. Unfortunately there's nothing you can do to change that.\n\nIf you don't mind that, you won't have problems. I should also add that after extended gameplay, it didn't bother me anymore.\n\nOther than that the game looks very good, especially reflections, dust/smoke effects, lighting and lens flares. The car models are also very detailed, as are debris/physics effects.\n\n\nSome words on the Linux port\n\n\nI've had no crashes, hiccups or lags. The game runs extremely smoothly on medium-high settings (1080p) on my Core 2 Quad Q8200, 4 GB RAM and 560 TI 1 GB with NVIDIA Proprietary 355.11. Loading times are virtually non-existent and I also didn't get framedrops driving around when the game was loading in new assets, which is extremely impressive since the game sits on my fairly old SATA 2 mechanical hard drive.\n\nSome issues I've had:\n\n-The game starts on the wrong monitor, something which most eon ports suffer from. Issue was resolved simply by adding --eon_force_display=1 to the Steam launch options.\n\n-The resolution won't stick when I restart the game, it defaults back to the resolution of my left monitor, so I have to change it every time I run the game, but that's no big deal.\n\n-Very often cars simply won't have tires, just rims, so they float around, which looks and feels extremely wrong.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou can get at least 8 hours of gameplay out of the singleplayer campaign and then you can still play it casually to pass a few minutes here and there and there's also multiplayer.\n\nFor 2,99€, I'd definitely recommend it, even if you are no racing guy, especially since this is currently probably the only serious racing game on the entire platform.","October 23, 2015","true","16.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I can understand that remark. Those people were probably not overly happy when this game was announced, as it appears to be a major "<expletive> you" to them, being loud, arcadey, adding boost, destroying the previous ratio of race events to Gymkhana, and making nearly everything a demolition derby of some sort laced with pyrotechnics all over the place.\n\nI feel there's only one way to truly appreciate the content in this game, and that's to ignore that it has the "DiRT" name on it. It feels very tenously connected to the DiRT games, and actually kind of takes root from the single Demolition Derby event in GRID, which it also hardly resembles. If you're expecting a DiRT or GRID game, you're expecting the wrong thing. If you're just expecting a fun game made with Codemasters quality, then you will be pleased.\n\nThree kinds of events take center stage on the Showdown Tour: Race-Off, which is classic circuit racing with boost added, Demolition, which is a demolition derby focused on vehicular carnage, and Hoonigan, which provides varieties of technical driving a la Gymkhana. Race-Off is classic fun. Demolition takes many forms, and can get quite intense (and sometimes aggravating, but not as much as most racing games, I find), with inventive spins like Hard Target (survive as long as you can as enemy cars work together to take you down) and the classic 8-Ball (figure eight tracks) adding the most thrills. And the Hoonigan events are surprisingly nerve-racking, though a little bit of practice ahead of time makes all but the Smash Hunter events considerably easier.\n\nI feel as though the worst part of the Showdown Tour is simply how quickly it ends. Trust me, you'll be wanting more when you finish that last race. The environments are nicely varied, although 3/5 of the tracks are set in the USA, so there isn't much of a globetrotting feel. Still surprising variety, however. Fan-favorite Shibuya returns in beautiful form, Michigan's off-roading brings the DiRT to the title, and Colorado's brutal mountain passes lead to some intense racing. If you just like driving around for the sake of driving, there's the Joyride mode, which leaves Yokohama and DiRT 3's Battersea available to you to roam around as you please, pulling off stunts and finding hidden packages. I can't tell you what getting all of them does, though. Not out of secrecy or anything. I honestly don't know yet. Some of these are a pain to get to.\n\nIf you're someone who'll play a racing game regardless of arcade or sim style just to see your favorite cars rendered in glorious detail, you may be disappointed to know that even since GRID, nobody seems willing to have their brand shown getting torn apart by other cars. So, it's all fictional equivalents in Race-Off and Demolition. I found that to be surprisingly unobtrusive, though, as you generally just focus on what cars work for you, and the liveries are loaded with sponsors. You're able to upgrade these debadged vehicles to compete with the big guns, but you might still want to opt for one that's higher-end from the get-go later on. Hoonigan events and Joyride have licensed cars, however.\n\nThe soundtrack gets a little repetitive, but it's pretty freakin' catchy. The announcer, however, does manage to break a bit of the immersion, not by his repetition of lines occasionally, but the fact that he hardly ever uses your audio name, and that he refers to everyone as "they". They just rammed them. And they take the lead. This is an excellent win for them. I'm not even kidding. Still, he does a decent enough job. Just seems like they didn't finish recording.\n\nAll in all, if it weren't for the top-notch quality of the vehicles, handling, and graphics, it'd be hard to believe this was Codemasters. It's like an unholy marriage of Flatout, Burnout, GRID, and DiRT, and it works way better than it should, though for a shorter time than one hopes once they really get into it.\n\nEDIT: Since writing this review, I have tried the online aspect of the game. There basically isn't one. Nobody's on. Also, you will run out of money if you try to get all the cars only through single-player money. So I dunno what to tell you there.","November 30, 2013","true","28.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With approachable car control, fun tracks and a wide array of game types, this is an excellent pick-up-and-play racer.\n\nAs an added perk, Showdown features the most advanced lighting and rendering system in the history of PC gaming.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bromli/recommended/201700/","bromli","bromli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bromli/","319 products in account","After 3 games in the DiRT series, Codemasters set out to throw the baby out with the bathwater and create something that the gaming world had not seen since the likes of FlatOut. They wanted to create a good old fashioned demo derby arcade game that you could just play and not have to care about.\n\nThat idea is fine and the game executes that idea fairly well. The modes strike a good balance between demolition derby, straight races, and gymkhana competitions. The cars handle in a nice arcadey way and the game is almost annoyingly shiny with the lens flares. It is good, cheap fun that doesn't require anything to play.\n\nI wish that were it though. The main question that I and other fans have with this title is why it carries the DiRT name. Codemasters themselves said that they wanted to create a spinoff title, and if that is true why did you keep the name? This game has nothing to do with any of the previous 3 installments in the series yet it carries the name. That doesn't make sense to me but it doesn't really bring the game down for me.","October 20, 2015","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

WHAT? You can only turn it to 50%, which is somehow even  more  annoying, because it's still always in the background, but it's just so quiet that you have to listen to it to make out the words.\n\nThe music is annoying, pretty standard bad classic rock fare. Like the commentator, you can only turn that to 50%.\n\nThe sponsor spots are annoying. There are giant inflatable cans of Monster everywhere. EVERYWHERE.\n\nEven the menus manage to be annoying, because they somehow commited the cardinal sin of not only making a menu that doesn't look very good, IMHO,  THEY FRIKKEN MADE IT UNREADABLE!!! .

There is no map, no cocpit view, no speed board, no progress bar on the side, its really arcade.\n\nIt has modes like a destruction arena that you smash cars with each others, earning points and listening to the same comments from the spectator like "T-Bone-a-saurus!" and "its like 2 cars smashing each others, oh wait.. they are" or "its like 2 cars kissing each other, awww!", he really sucks.\n\nIts not a bad game, its kinda fun, the main events ladder will take about 10 hours to beat (took me about that much) and there are more stuff to do like challenges with tricks, like previous dirt games. Personally i hated those, they did not belonged to dirt, they were the worst part but in this game they fit right in.\n\nThe game is a let down, its fun but nothing special and some events like the the tracks that are an "8" and you smash on others while leading the race is frustrating, but the AI (on the medium difficulty that i played) sucks and the rubber-banding will let you lead the race again if you drive ok, or will pass you on the last few turned even if you raced your hardest.\n\nAlso another thing that i did not like was that the selection of tracks felt small, i felt like i was racing the same tracks again and again and again, more variety would be welcome.\n\nIts hard to choose to recommend this game or not, i will not recommend it because i feel it was a poor try.","October 8, 2014","false","2.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Now, in my honest opinion, DiRT 3 is much better. Showdown just feels like a watered-down version of 3 in terms of car physics, destruction and length of the 'career'.\nHaving said this, though, it's quite an enjoyable game. Rampage, Knock-Out and 8-Ball are really enjoyable race-types where wrecking other cars is key to winning. Unfortunately, this is let down by the level of destruction achieved. A bit of shattered glass and some dents to your vehicle just don't seem enough. If this damage to your vehicle actually affected your car's performance (other than a missing wheel which WILL affect sterring), the game would be even more amazing.\nBut it's not. It's a fun game though, so I would recommend it, just not if you're looking for something a bit more 'authentic'.

I don't care nearly as much about these supposed famous people as you seem to do, Codemasters.\n\nIf you've ever played Need For Speed: Shift, joined the 8-track with max. racers and smashed everything to bits.. You know what this game is about. This game is that, but polished to high-hell. It's beautiful. There's a gamemode where you're thrown into an open space with a large group of other cars set to destroy you. Litteral laugh-out-loud moments to be had.\n\nNote: Did have two hard-crashes. Dumbing the graphics down a bit seems to have fixed the issue. Blaming my rig for the time being.\n\nEDIT: Now finished the game. Another con: During the races, AI is a bit unrealistically aggressive. They'll throw away a 1st place position just to f**k you over. Some salt spilled there, but still very, very enjoyable.","October 8, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are very good there are people and fireworks going off and other weather affects. The cars are varied and name brands you will know. Ford, Subaru and others. The cars do show damage and there are several paint jobs for each car. The sound is great however the music is very blah and a very generic rock band.\n\nThe game has a lot of different events. Drift events, crash events and race events. You will visit such places as LA, Colorado and Tokyo and more. So lots of maps and a good selection of cars and they all handle very good. The game is not perfect however the bad woud include the music ugh. The events while varied are sometimes annoying to play mostly the drift events. I have not tried the multiplayer.

This game has none of that. Boost is on a recharge, so it just recharges over time, but it's not even like it helps you. You will accelerate to cars just as quickly as you would driving normal. You can tell by all the other cars slowly coming toward you that are not boosting. That also makes it feel like difficult is inhanced via the "Quick, he is almost winning, everyone SPEED UP!" method, which lends to the feeling of the computer cheating.Turning is impossible since e-braking for a drit results in a tiny micro drift, or you spinning in circles, unable to break the drift. It's like they tried to keep the realism of their main franchise, and just let you hit people. Which does, again, nothing and will most likely result in you spinning out.... again. Controls are loose, gameplay is not very fun, and why do I need an upgrade system in here? Who thought that would be a good idea? Overall, I do not recommend this to anyone who has never played it before, or is a fan of other arcade racers.","February 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Just saying it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.  I've never experienced such instant and complete hatred for a game mode more.. It is so detached from the tone of the rest of the game..  It's like this:\n\n"Okay in order to complete this event, you must collect the four flags on top of these poles.  Then swing from ring to ring without falling in the water.  Next you need to run around this track and hop over each hurtle taking care not to trip over any of them.  Finally, remove the pistol from your holster and shoot this puppy.  Ready?  Go!"\n\nI'm not alone on this.. Check the game's discussion forum and you will learn of the hatred for HEAD TO HEAD.\n\nI'll never complete the game's tournaments because of this oozing tumor of a game mode.

Noob (Nightmare Lyra)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmarelyre/","406 products in account","Despite the promise of high octane action and carnage in the veins of Burnout, this is a very slow, sluggish and quite frankly unexciting racing game with mechanics that feels like something from the early 2000's, and it feels tame even compared to things like Need For Speed.\n\n"Crashing" and "hyper-energised events" are quite frankly lies as it's not so much crashing as it is lightly punting into other cars with no sense of impact or destruction, and the events move along at a snail pace with no sense of speed, adrenaline or tempo to anything, not even in the races.\n\nThe cars handle really badly, and while you can upgrade things to increase the stats of each car with money won from winning races and crash events, the oversimplified controlscheme that resembles (and feels like) a Flash game still makes it highly unpleasant to try and drive anywhere.\n\nThe game also constantly bugs you to film replays and upload them to YouTube and share stuff with your friends, which seems less like something you want to do and more like the developers desperately trying to make the players do viral marketing for them, which is just obnoxious and distracting on top of everything else.\n\nAll in all it's a nice looking game, but one that feels and plays like a Flash game. Not worth it, even on a 80% sale.\n\nOh yeah, the bloody thing also installs bloody bloatware on your computer without asking for permission too, apparently having it so it needs this bloatware to get the ingame sound running right, which is absolutely ridicolous.","March 13","false","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Most DiRT fans are people who like Rally Simulators. Myself included. I own all 3 Dirt games, and now DiRT Showdown. This game is like flatout with the dirt name on it. IF you like the flatout games this is GREAT! I played it with a Logitech GT Driving Force wheel and Pedals. Just like I play the other dirt games. The feedback on the wheel is amazing, and the colisions are lots of fun. T here is also a really good soundtrack! I highly recomend this game if you have a racing wheel and like demolition. ~PR0XIDIAN","May 2, 2013","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Cars are slow, there isn't enough "punch" with the collisions, maybe there should be more explosions, big flames when we boost, it should be BRUTAL but it's not. This game is as brutal as bumper cars, nothing more. So, that's the first thing that made me stop.

However, there are several aspects of the game I find disappointing.\n\n1. Hoonigan or tricks. I absolutely hate these sections. Because I am not good as this aspect of the game, I am, basically, stuck because I need to get top three in one of the only two competitions available, and BOTH are Hoonigan. In addition, it seems abitrary whether or not you complete the trick. If it says donut around a pillar and I do it, I should get points, but you don't always. You have to be the correct distance. Seems silly.\n\n2. You basically need to purchase the newest cars. I don't mind the upgrading of your cars, but when I have a "A" level car, I should be able to compete in every race. However, you will need to pruchase (in-game money) the newest cars to remain competitve. I like the open-wheel racer, which is an early car, and I completely upgraded it. Racing on a dirt/mud track I can't maintain the pace behind the sports cars, even though it states both have the same power. It makes zero sense, especially on a dirt track.\n\n3. I know the game has that "attack" element, but it often seems as though the AI targets you specifically. On several occasions I will be leading the race or working my way through the pack, then suddenly get side-swiped or t-boned. Then they just keep hitting you or they will stop right in front of you so you need to reverse and drive around them. I spend more time working my way back through the pack than anything else.\n\n4. There is a finite amount of money to win for each race. Example: Let's say the prize money for a race is $10,000. On your first attempt you get 3rd place. You will win $5,000. Unsatisfied, you try again and get first. You will win $5,000 dollars. Why? Because the total prize money you can win on the race is $10,000. If you try the same race again and place first, you will not win any money because you have already obtained the allotted $10,000.\n\n\nThe game is not bad, but it is not great either.","January 7","false","20.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's just that the rubberbanding and the vehicles being disrespectfully superior to yours no matter the car you're using makes it frustrating to play the other 10%. Couple that with how there's a track that's literally 2 straights and 2 hairpins and you end up with an unwinnable race.\n\nThis is my experience playing Advanced difficulty, which considering I was able to finish DiRT 3 in Advanced I thought that I wasn't biting off more than I could chew.

But it has one problem: it's not fun. Could have been a good multiplayer game, but it's sadly so frustrating. You don't get to choose the track and mode directly, but it randomly chooses them and you can "veto". Then it makes you wait in the menus and then wait some more and then wait again. The races could have been fun on LAN parties, except the game has no LAN mode. The single player mode is not very entertaining either, it's too easy and the damage doesn't seem to change the car's handling. Graphically DiRT Showdown is pretty good but all in all I can't recommend it. At all. This game's boring and frustrating.

The feel of the cars is just meh, was released after Dirt 3 and feels like a real downgrade. The extra events added in get old pretty quickly and  there is no proper rally btw. Boost?? Really?? Might be an up side or a downside depending on your tastes but in my opinion no Dirt game should have boost. The menu UI is nice (as always) but the HUD looks like ♥♥♥♥. No speed either in kmh or mph which is just silly. If you want a proper Dirt game then get any of teh others in the series (Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3).

That's a huge negative considering my favorite aspects of DiRT were gutted in order to make way for its arcadey aspects. And so all I'm left with is an arcadey racer where skill or driving lines don't really matter (at least in the race-oriented events), and where success largely lies with what the AI decide to do - and no sense of mayhem or insanity to make-up for that mindless arcadeyness and randomness.\n\nOverall, DiRT Showdown is not a bad game by any means.

I'm not saying that DiRT 1 and maybe 2 weren't fun but from 2 - 3 they both felt the same as 1 but with a few changes but whatever I still liked playing them. And because one of my favourite things about DiRT was the realistic car physics I thought a demolition derby type DiRT game would be awesome... no.\n\nThey ruined all the fun from the game, it seems like they redid the cars so you couldn't really damage them properly anymore and they replaced the amazing damage system the older games used to have where for example you crashed the right side of the car and that got damage, or your radiator overheated and started to break the engine etc but they replaced it with a simple damage meter and the whole game was just stale and boring.\n\nTo anyone looking to get a game for crashing or whatever they were aiming for with showdown then I recommend getting a flatout game or something, but DiRT showdown for me was just a waste of money and a waste of time.\n\n3/10","January 3, 2013","true","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That's a huge negative considering my favorite aspects of DiRT were gutted in order to make way for its arcadey aspects. And so all I'm left with is an arcadey racer where skill or driving lines don't really matter (at least in the race-oriented events), and where success largely lies with what the AI decide to do - and no sense of mayhem or insanity to make-up for that mindless arcadeyness and randomness.\n\nOverall, DiRT Showdown is not a bad game by any means.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wesleysmalls/recommended/201700/","wesleysmalls","WesleySmalls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wesleysmalls/","427 products in account","I'm not going to recommend it, but only on the slight edge, let's start with the good part\n\nThe game is extremely enjoyable, it is easy to pick up and the game modes are extremely enjoyable. The game itself offers a bit of destruction and chaotic racing, which is great fun. Also the tracks and it's area's are amazing, and so are the cars that fit the setting really well. There isn't much depth to it, which makes it perfect for something to quickly pick up and to be enjoyed by everyone, but this also is it's downside.\n\nThe racing is incredibly simplistic and I don't feel that your driving can be 'perfected'. The game offers no challenge at all and this makes the game incredibly dull to play for longer periods of time. Yes, you can set the difficult higher, but that only mkaes the game harder, not more challenging. The gameplay is incredibly dull, you are pretty much doing the same stuff over and over again. Driving three laps on similar tracks get rather boring rather quickly, a bit of variation on this would have been a welcome sight.\n\nAs great as the cars and tracks are, there is very few of those, very, very few. This is something that keeps coming back to Codies, ever since DiRT/GRiD content has been reduced at a drastic rate which also isn't helping to the overall experience. There are only a handful of tracks and most of those have been there in previous games or had their settings from a previous game. Out of the few tracks, I believe only Miami actually is new, the rest all have been to some sort in previous games. The settings look beautiful and picture their location rather well, but the tracks are unchallenging and rather uninspiring in their design.\n\nThen we go to the cars. Although they look beautiful and fit the game really well, there simply are too few of them. Not only that, but they all drive and feel the same. There is absolutely no difference between any of those cars and how they drive. There are a few simplistic upgrades, but they change nothing to how the car drives and it's only change is visible in times, which also is pointless because of the Catch-Up system which makes sure that the AI can keep up with you, all it does is make the races last less long, which shouldn't be something you wish.\n\nThen we go to the worst parts; The game doesn't have a speedometer, so you never have an idea how fast you are going. This is happening in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ driving game. It is rather incredible that a racing game misses such basic gauges(oh yes, it misses the revs and gear also).\n\nAnd then the last thing; an cockpit cam is missing. I have never been a critic on this as it is an arcade game, but I must say I really missed it in this game. Being T-boned while in cockpit view would have given an incredible experience to the destruction in the game.\n\nOverall it is a rather fun game that truly has potential. It is for the laziness of the developers that has made the game fail. But we can be relieved; since they have cut basic features like a speedometer that means that they cannot cut anything more from the game. Really, this game would have fared much better if it actually had some content instead of re-do's of content from previous games. No, there is nothing wrong with bringing tracks from previous games to the new one, but then remember to actually add new content. I hope that they actually realize that too and that they create a much larger experience to the next games in the series.","February 2, 2014","false","15.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/201700/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","Its more Dirt, but not the Dirt I expected.\n\nBasically the game is more of a destruction derby type game with Dirt sorta mixed in. Theres only 2 or 3 game modes where you are even racing at all and the others are a literal destruction derby, a destruction derby where you have to stay alive and everyone wants to kill you and another game mode where you do tricks and another where you hit specific color blocks that the game tells you to hit to gain points or you fail.  I may be missing another game mode but thats the essence of the selection here. Most of the game modes are so similiar that they are really just the result of reusing assets and making a "new" mode.\n\nThe problem is that they just kinda all blur together and you end up playing some very similiar game modes over and over. Its not as bad as past Grid/Dirt games as they do mix it up with snow and rain tracks aswell as some very diffrent game modes compared to the normal Dirt games but unfortunately theres to much overlapping among game modes that are here so it makes the novelty of new modes wear off faster than is preferred.\n\nThe damage model is a bit lame aswell. Your car has a health bar and getting hit or even tapped fairly lightly can take a big chunk off your hp. In a pileup in cars your hp will tick away each time the group bumps into you. This is horrible and extremely frustrating. It dousn't really matter where you hit cars it seems like outside of getting points. Aslong as you hit them hard enough HP will be taken away, speed seems to be more important than where you hit or get hit.\n\nIts pure arcadey and features a boost and mechanics applicable to it. When not boosting it feels like your going super slow. This is really annoying for a racing game. AI also are real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will randomly go super fast then slow down and let you pass them. Its very strange to see it happen over and over and over every game. Also they will be real ♥♥♥♥♥uckers and wreck you randomly. This is extremely enraging after you lead a race for multiple laps only to end up in the middle because the AI wrecked you.\n\nIn all its a bit more boring than Grid/Dirt games of the normal type. If you want this sort of game it might be a solid game to get, otherwise its not that great. Its not a good racing game or a good destruction derby  game. Wreckfest is much much better.","May 10","false","2.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This game is essentially Dirt: Demolition Edition. That being said, it is still an excellent game.\n\nRally races have been replaced with rampage events which are nothing more than demolition derbies. The actual race events use the same locations and tracks as Dirt 2 and 3, such as Baja, Aspen and Michigan, but with added jumps and obstacles to keep things interesting. The Battersea compound is also carried over to Dirt Showdown and has more missions and more collectables scattered about the map than Dirt 3. The missions are not impossible this time as icons pop up to show you where the missions can be completed.\n\nThat being said, this is not just Dirt 3 again but with a little more destruction. There are more, varied types of events which, personally, I have not seen before. All of the events are hard in their own way; no lead is safe and you are never out of an event. Some races have crossovers in the track which can be great if the opposition crash into each other, but also requires a bit of luck to get through cleanly yourself.\n\nThe graphics in this game are very good. They have the same style as the other Dirt games even on the standard settings. I have a very basic laptop by today's standards with an i3 processor and that runs the game just fine.\n\nOverall, while this game is not a traditional Dirt game, it is very good at what it does. The events are fun and manage to be different even though environments are being recycled. The new damage oriented events are very fun and different than almost every other racing game. This is an excellent game and it is highly recommended.","December 4, 2014","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Voices are annoying and more than anything this seems like an expansion to DiRT 3 than a stand alone game.

Feels a lot like Need for Speed ProStreet meets DiRT. This game can be quite challenging with the addition the Gymkhana challenges. Too bad that you can only drive the rally spec cars in Gymkhana challenge events or joyride. Speaking of Joyride, this mode gives you freedom to drive around a compound in a rally car with addition of challenges for you to complete. A good practice for the Gymkhana events in tour campaign. There are a lot of cars that you can drive and upgrade. All of the cars come with a number of good liveries to choose from. No visual overhaul customization in this game or any other DiRT games.

However I can't help but feel a little disappointed. It feels like they have taken the previous very good game, dirt 3, and gone how can re-cobble together bits from this into a new game. Many of the tracks are rehashed versions of tracks from previous games. One thing they have got right is they have significantly improved the gymkhana type events to be much more fun. But these levels don't seem to bear any relation to the rest of the stock car based races. The balance of winning seems to have shifted away from skill towards luck. The 8 ball tracks are designed to promote crashes but give you no incentive for crashing. It is easy to speed off into a strong lead then suddenly cross paths with some tool who is half a lap behind and end up losing the race and there is nothing you can do about it. I'd probably advise giving this one a miss and just stick to the other much better Codemasters racing games.","January 19, 2013","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To support this theme, the AI has been programmed to be aggressive and pick fights to wreck you and other cars. The new game modes range from simple circuit racing and 8 shaped circuits with intersections to destruction derbys where you have to wreck cars or push them off a platform to score high. As usual with Codemasters, there aren't a lot of tracks, some of them are reused from previous Dirt games and they get boring long before the end of the game. The game modes, combined with challenging difficulty make for a short but fun experience. You will not look back at Showdown in moments of nostalgia but that's not to say you should miss it. There is a new challenge feature which allows you to challenge your friends to beat your times and earn in-game money in doing so, I hope we will see a return of this feature in Dirt 4.","February 27, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I can't help but feel a little disappointed. It feels like they have taken the previous very good game, dirt 3, and gone how can re-cobble together bits from this into a new game. Many of the tracks are rehashed versions of tracks from previous games. One thing they have got right is they have significantly improved the gymkhana type events to be much more fun. But these levels don't seem to bear any relation to the rest of the stock car based races. The balance of winning seems to have shifted away from skill towards luck. The 8 ball tracks are designed to promote crashes but give you no incentive for crashing. It is easy to speed off into a strong lead then suddenly cross paths with some tool who is half a lap behind and end up losing the race and there is nothing you can do about it. I'd probably advise giving this one a miss and just stick to the other much better Codemasters racing games.","January 19, 2013","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of serious racing, this isn't for you. A touch bit of oversteer will slide the rear right out, but it's pretty easy to slide around nearly everywhere in the game, so that's not too bad either. The best fun you'll have will be in the rampage events, seeing how fast you can go straight into the side of someone else, although the commentary about not liking doors gets old real fast, so that's a bit of an issue. The career mode takes somewhere around 25 hours or so I believe, and it's pretty well worth it. Sometimes you'll have to restart an event after almost winning it, which is a real pain, but none of them take more than 4 or 5 minutes per race, so it's not a huge amount of time lost. The only annoying thing in this game is a lack of a cockpit camera, but even that doesn't seem too bad if you just play the game and aren't looking for the most accurate racing simulation possible, if you're looking for that, you're better off with Assetto Corsa, or a bunch of others that you could find online like iRacing.","September 7, 2014","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had no intentions of ever buying this game. I thought it was just going to be another arcade racer with some demolition derby in it.\n\nBoy, was I supprised.\n\nThe game is very well structured around you being an absolute skrub, and you have to work your way up in the leagues to get to legendary status (aka ESPN, but they don't like racing). People that have played Grid 2 are going to notice some places getting reused, like the first race you will compete in: Miami Race Off. It's a nice touch, and it makes you believe DiRT Showdown and the Grid series are in the same universe, which they are. Wheather the roads and places used in this game exist in real life, let me just say I don't know. I live nowhere near anywhere popular to notice any resemblance to games. The closet I'm going to get to that is probably American Truck Simulator, and that is in a far off future when they reach where I live.\n\nNow, race mechanics, are Codemaster's quality. Top-notch. AI is very good, and the difficulty rises at a steady pace to make the races easy enough for you to win, but hard to give you some competition. Track design is nice, music selection is great, especially for a company that makes games with no music in them except for menus, and the car selection is pretty good, consisting of both real cars, and cars that are probably fake.\n\nBad things, there isn't really any.

What it is, though, is a fun arcade-like racing game with some additional modes like demolition. The two-player split-screen is also a nice option, and like all the Dirt games it has a benchmark that can be useful.\n\nIf you are a more casual racing game player, this is a good buy, especially since it's frequently on sale for under $5.","May 4, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Although it's completely different from the other games from this serie, it's really fun the play, it's fantastic to see all this crashes. It is extremely easy to play, even on the hardest settings (but some races still make me suffer).

Personally, I bought this to hold me over until Grid Autosport is ported to Linux so I could have SOME driving game. (P.S. - Codies if you do Dirt Rally next I will love you forever) If it's on sale and you need a Linux driving game, you may get your money's worth. If you're on Windows don't bother unless you love "hooning." I frown thoughtfully every time I see "hooning" in the game.\n\nThere is a career mode that I probably won't try again. It's mostly demolition derbys so far. Maybe there's some real racing buried somewhere, I'm not bothering to look for it. The best part so far are are the Joyride levels. You're dumped into an untimed free drive around setpiece drift, donut, jump, spins, and destruction challenges. While you're going down the mission list (jumps and things are spelled out for you) there are also hidden packages to find. It reminded me a lot of Tony Hawk.\n\nThe game runs decently on my poor specs - Core 2 Quad 2.4 GTX 460 (nvidia closed drivers 355.xx installed with SGFXI), though it's got it's issues. Tires seem to disappear randomly - not like they're knocked off the car and handling changes, you just can't see them. The car drives normally.","November 13, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I purchased it on sale for 2,99 Euro. It's somehow worth it.. but not more.\n\nIt's not the fun Flat Out stands for.. not half of it. Cars upgrades are just a joke. Damage of cars is just shown as a 0-100% health-meter. No race campaign mode, just a chain of random events where you can jump through.\n\nThere is no radar, minimap or track info.. you need to know the tracks. You can view back but ( at least for me ) the rear view is delayed on pushing the key and there is delay on releasing the key. Very annoying while driving.\n\nThe game doesn't show you your speed or RPM. I'm just missing this.\n\nThere are many cars to unlock.. and then you need to buy them ( which is somehow expensive ). But if you finished one event.. you can play it again.. but you don't get more money for it. You can upgrade your cars which is expensive too. Actually I don't know how to make enough money to buy later cars and some upgrades.\n\nKnockout mode is not working because of broken hit + knockout detection.

You can buy new cars as they become "unlocked for purchase". The upgrades are very simplistic and include being able to upgrade the speed, strength and handling of the vehicle as opposed to a simulator (like Gran Turismo) where you'd be able to swap out the tires, the driveshaft, add a supercharger, do a weight reduction, etc.\n\nOverall, I'm having a lot of fun with this game and give it a 9/10 even despite the fact that I'm personally more of the racing simulator type.","October 23, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, there's also Linux support, which is pretty much why I bought this -- I wanted to see how well EGO was ported in light of Linux release of GRiD Autosports, and my oh my, this is by far THE BEST Windows-to-Linux port I've ever seen -- runs smoothly, no glitches, halts or crashes.\n\nBut as the other side of the coin, car physics are junk, game modes lack variety, and campaign is really short.\n\nIn total -- no, this is not a bad game, but it's no DiRT3, that's for sure. I believe it'll do for "couch playing" while sipping beers or something, but this is a funky arcade at best. Nevertheless, it has its moments, and as I previously said, I've enjoyed derby mode very much.\n\nAll in all, looking forward to Linux port of Autosport.","November 11, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I bought this to hold me over until Grid Autosport is ported to Linux so I could have SOME driving game. (P.S. - Codies if you do Dirt Rally next I will love you forever) If it's on sale and you need a Linux driving game, you may get your money's worth. If you're on Windows don't bother unless you love "hooning." I frown thoughtfully every time I see "hooning" in the game.\n\nThere is a career mode that I probably won't try again. It's mostly demolition derbys so far. Maybe there's some real racing buried somewhere, I'm not bothering to look for it. The best part so far are are the Joyride levels. You're dumped into an untimed free drive around setpiece drift, donut, jump, spins, and destruction challenges. While you're going down the mission list (jumps and things are spelled out for you) there are also hidden packages to find. It reminded me a lot of Tony Hawk.\n\nThe game runs decently on my poor specs - Core 2 Quad 2.4 GTX 460 (nvidia closed drivers 355.xx installed with SGFXI), though it's got it's issues. Tires seem to disappear randomly - not like they're knocked off the car and handling changes, you just can't see them. The car drives normally.","November 13, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me a while to actually get myself to play it, but once i did, I was completely wrong. On the first race, I already felt that this was a really really well done racing game. The graphics are so off the charts and very playable (40-60 fps - using intel HD graphics 5500). The driving mechanics are so good and well done. Turning and drifting felt so smooth and easy. And crashing and smashing is so fun. There was no problem at all with the driving and racing mechanics, not even the slightest. The race modes are many as you progress, and many different types of races. Upgrades were possible and when racing, I didn't feel the length of the races to be as long and tiring. I couldn't find any flaws in this game during the time that I played, though, I have to mention, there was no minimap. At first, I didn't like the fact that there was no minimap, but during the first race, I started to like it, as I realized that it adds to the suspense and the intense driving. Excellent job overall, and to those who gave this game a negative review - please, just give it another chance, its a good racing game.\nHIghly recommend for everyone.

So don't go into this game expecting anything serious,professional, or realistic, This is the type of racing game that the racing comunity loves to hate,but secretly loves.  It's the arcadiest of racing arcade games, you don't even get a speedo,tach, or manual option, instead you get a health bar and a boost gauge. Half the cars are fake, made-up fictional cars and the others are actual real life cars, the tracks are fun and they atleast try and make driving feel different when the weather or surface change but this is still a very "arcade like" racing game. My few complaints so far are: The lack of a minimap while racing (Good luck memorizing the figure-8 track races), the announcer's voice (WHICH CANNOT BE DISSABLED,only turned down), and everytime I launch the game I have to manually change my graphics settings and switch it to fullscreen.\n\nTL;DR: If you enjoy a casual arcade racing game get this when it goes on sale,I picked it up for $2.99.

This is not to say that the game is bad. It is quite fun but no for those who have been fans of the series since Collin McRae days. This game is more arcady and it does well to live by that mantra. The selection of cars in the game are anaemic and the  tracks look like they could use some work but for what the game provides, I think that is good enough. I went into Dirt Showdown expecting one thing but got another. A welcoming suprise though since it was fun to tear across the tracks crashing into opponents and listening to the wailing of the engines as I drifted across the track. This is fun in short bursts so i it will appeal more to the casual game although there are some aspects available for purists. All in all I will suggest that you waited a for a price drop in order to pick this one up since in my opinion Codemasters didnt do enough to warrant a full price for this game. With all this said I will give this game a 6/10 on the grounds that it took away from the franchise it claims to hail from and the focus on casual gamers.","June 25, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me a while to actually get myself to play it, but once i did, I was completely wrong. On the first race, I already felt that this was a really really well done racing game. The graphics are so off the charts and very playable (40-60 fps - using intel HD graphics 5500). The driving mechanics are so good and well done. Turning and drifting felt so smooth and easy. And crashing and smashing is so fun. There was no problem at all with the driving and racing mechanics, not even the slightest. The race modes are many as you progress, and many different types of races. Upgrades were possible and when racing, I didn't feel the length of the races to be as long and tiring. I couldn't find any flaws in this game during the time that I played, though, I have to mention, there was no minimap. At first, I didn't like the fact that there was no minimap, but during the first race, I started to like it, as I realized that it adds to the suspense and the intense driving. Excellent job overall, and to those who gave this game a negative review - please, just give it another chance, its a good racing game.\nHIghly recommend for everyone. Good job Codemasters\n","October 31, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Damage of cars is just shown as a 0-100% health-meter. No race campaign mode, just a chain of random events where you can jump through.\n\nThere is no radar, minimap or track info.. you need to know the tracks.

But if you finished one event.. you can play it again.. but you don't get more money for it. You can upgrade your cars which is expensive too.

The game is really satisfying in terms of demolition and smash your opponent kind of thing. I really like the knock out and 8 ball events. It gets really crazy! It's a fantastic game to turn your brain off and just ram into others. Just for this it's A+\n\nThe game is really gorgeous, stunning lighting and car details, when you drive in Nevada, it is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, the game does not run too well on my system, I had to turn off a lot of options and set the others to medium to get an average of 40fps, which is a shame because I can't enjoy all the candy it has to offer. My pc specs are well within what's recommended but my catalyst driver is old, last one supported for vista so I suspect this had to do with the poor performance but on the other hand Dirt 3 runs fine with much higher video settings. If you are one of the few people running on vista like me, this could be an issue if you want better performance.\n\nThe game is a great addition to other racing games like Dirt 3  as it offers an arcade feel as opposed to sim driving if you already have one to fill this position. Overall a very cool game with lots of different cars and tracks but you can't mods your cars ,there is only predetermined upgrades available. You can't change your cars settings like in Dirt 3 but again, it is not this kind of game.\n\n","April 14","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its fun for about 10 mins and then its same old challenges, cars! do this then do the same later, then again later, go do a *yawn* pointless race that gives you money to buy a identical car, to upgrade it, then the same process. Ive noticed its pointless in upgrading your cars, AI always seem to be ALOT quicker (another Juiced 2 game???).. Its missing its excitement for me! like pulling a chair and watching a freshly painted wall to dry!..\nIf you get it, get it on a 90% sale or something close to that, cause it will be something you play for a bit and then let it build a nest on your HDD.!","July 21, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some races feel like Destruction Derby (8 ball, rampage, hard target) while others emphasize on racing (race-off, elimination and domination) or driving tricks (trick rush, head to head).\nThis variety is refreshing and the arcade orientation makes it a no-brainer, fun game.\n\nSo why the negative review? Due to some 3rd party issue (according to the github tracker) with nvidia drivers and gamepad drivers, the game occasionnaly experiences hard freezes.\nOn my computer, those freezes always occur in 8 ball races during the last 2 championships (champion and legend) making it impossible to finish the game.\nAnd since savegames cannot be shared with the Windows version of the game (and I don't want to start again), I'm stuck with an unfinishable game.","March 5","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is an arcade style demolition racer with arcade driving physics to match. Unfortunately it just isn't a very good one. The crash physics simply aren't satisfying enough to make crashing into other cars enjoyable and wrecked cars phase out instantly instead of exploding or even staying on the map so you could appreciate the results of your work. There are a number of different events but they all feel very samey, especially the arena stages. Just play Dirt 3 again or if you want a demolition derby game try something from the Flatout series instead.\n2/5","July 18, 2012","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Here you have nitro, this refill while you doing the race (I'm not a big fan of this type, I like that nos that once is consumed, remain consumed).\nIt has decent variety of race types and for me the most fun in this game is the Demolition Derby events.\nDrive through fireworks, who does not like fireworks?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherrydouble/recommended/201700/","cherrydouble","cherry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherrydouble/","134 products in account","I really don't know where to begin.\n\nI guess I'll give some arbitrary precautions to fans of the original DiRT series who may be contemplating purchasing this game. First off - this is not a sim. This could not be farther from a sim. There have been episodes of American Horror Story that are far more realistic than this game. Do not buy this game expecting to see tire wear and fuel depletion in the pre-race menu as options. Do not expect the AI in this game to be exceedingly tough. Do not expect the physics engine to be some revolutionary system that utilizes quantum mechanics, designed by Niels Bohr himself. Do not. Please do not.\n\nOn to the actual review. DiRT Showdown is an arcade-y circuit racer with multiple different event types, with emphasis placed on online multiplayer. In the campaign mode, new event series are unlocked by completing previous events and finishing in the podium. Finishing in the podium is heavily incentivized, as you will be rewarded with more credits to spend on cars and upgrades for those cars upon finishing in at least 3rd place in an event. Single-player events don't deviate from the norm that much; there are standard circuit races, elimination races, destruction-derbies, and domination events (Very similar to the "Sector Shootout" events from Need For Speed: Prostreet. Every driver on the course drives several laps; each course is divided into several sectors, and upon competing a sector of the course, every driver is rewarded with points. The amount of points that a driver is rewarded with is directly proportional to their performance and level of aggression towards other drivers. The driver with the most points at the end of the race wins.). The signature "Hoonigan" events from DiRT 2 & 3 are also present in Showdown, including Head 2 Head, Trick Rush, and Smash Hunter. While the physics are surprisingly unrealistic, it doesn't stop these events from being extremely fun.\n\nThe port from consoles to PC was astonishing. Performance issues and crashes are almost nonexistent (For me, at least.).  My computer has a GTX 760 and I found that this game ran at 60FPS constantly, with no hiccups whatsoever. Kudos to Codemasters for doing such a great job.\n\nThis game might be nearly four years old, but it's aged wonderfully. The reflections are beautiful and jagged edges on object models are absent. The lighting is breathtaking. Only problem is that the shadows are nearly nonexistent. There's absolutely no variation between the environments that the tracks are in, however. Every track has a vaguely desertlike backdrop, and it's obvious from the very first time that you start racing.\n\nThe sound effects and soundtrack are... forgettable, for lack of a better word. The engine noises are almost unbearable, a constant drone. It's horrible. The soundtrack consists of electro house, dubstep, and mid 2000s era rock music that'll make you want to rip the soundcard out of your computer's PCI slots. It's bad. Very bad. Understatement of the century bad.\n\nThe AI, even on the highest difficulty, is nothing special. Nothing worth mentioning twice, and barely something worth talking about in the very first place. The AI. even on the highest difficulty, is sluggish when compared to the AI models that were featured in the main series entries, such as DiRT 2 & 3.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game an 8/10.","April 12","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
