FOREVER.  I have way more time in this game then steam says (because I played prior to steam).  I have a full stable of gladiators and had actually bought thier currency to try to support them.\n\nWith that said, this is bascially a mobile "wait" type of game.  You fight with a gladiator and he has to "wait" x amount of time before he can fight again.  So to make money they bascially sell you things that reduce the time you have to "wait".\n\nI can not recommend the game because I absolutely HATE that mobile mentality of making people "wait" and then pay to not have to "wait".  And I hate it even more on a PC game because at least with a phone you tend to be doing other things but when you are sitting in front of your PC to play a game.. You are there to do that one thing and scratching yourself while waiting for timers to go down is just stupid.\n\nThats not to mention this game is totally P2W..\n\nhere is a link to the the dev's forums.  This game has been out a while and has a bad reputation before it got to steam.\nhttp://community.gladiatorsonline.com/index.php?/forum/2-general-discussion/","November 4, 2015","false","0.9"," 351 of 386 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","351","386","18","22"

Everyone who says otherwise is either paying himself or doesn't want to see the instant benefits of spending money on the game to come out on top of the herd.\nFor example: you recieve new gladiators through constant bidding on the same gladiator with the ingame currency (silver). You get outbid multiple times until the timer runs out. The paying customers (aka whales) can INSTANTLY purchase gladiators of HIGHER LEVEL, HIGHER POTENTIAL and THOSE DO NOT DIE they just resurface again all to the purchased currency (gold).\nAnd this is just one of numerous examples.\n\nThe reason the two viedeos on the storefront are devoid of actual gameplay footage is because the actual gameplay is boring AF. It is in no way fluid nor responsive.\n\nAnother example why games shoulnd't be greenlit because the filter is made out of stupid people with milewide gaping wholes in it.\n\nPS: Any downvote will regarded as Butthurt and further strenghtens the P2W factor and the BS community that voted for this game.","November 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 225 of 275 people (82%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","82","225","275","30","15"

I did enjoy the filthy commentator during battle, the music and the way the game is actually set out in building your stable of fighters. That said, everything is at a cost for gold or silver coins. Healing, buying space for new fighters, staff to tend to the fighters etc etc... the list goes on.\n\nThe gold and silver you start out with is obviously not very much and you wont get far with it. Sure, you could grind away for a long time if you want, but if you hit the 'Buy Gold Here' button at the top of the screen you will be presented with different packages to purchase coin for real money and speed the progress up. This is where I closed the game down and left it alone. I knew this before installing the game, but I wanted to see how the combat was.\n\nSo the combat was OK I suppose. Simple to understand and works for how the game is designed. It's not fast and frantic, but more  like an MMO with cooldowns and timers. Personally I'd have liked something faster, flashy and fluid, but this does actually work quite well. You can time your block (I tried several times and pulled it off a few times) and you can dodge by pressing W or S at a certain time (no obvious sign and I didn't manage it). The main hub has a ton of things going on. It was quite overwhelming at first glance. After looking around after the very basic tutorial, it didn't seem as bad.\n\nI have only played about 30-45 minutes and the main reason I do not recommend this F2P game is because it's a time sink that encourages the purchase of gold with real money. It may be F2P and not P2W, which in theory is true as you apparently only get matched up against people of the same level, but that is just splitting hairs where I come from. This could have been fun with a price tag on it.\n\n\nLooking at the gold purchase page shows the 'Best Value' package costing £24.95 for 10,650 coins.\nsome things you can buy....\n\nMurmillo Viii                = 2050 coins\nDoctores (high level)    = 7950 coins\nMedicus (High level)    = 5450 coins\nMasseurs (High level)  = 5750 coins\nCourtesans                 = 3000 coins\n\nTotal ---------------------->= 24,200 coins\n\nThen there are consumable items during battle, armour, weapons.

I kind of expected it to be more of a tycoon based game than how it is.\n\nAlso its never a good sign to see "BUY GOLD" as soon as you enter the game, I knew it was down hill from that point.\nNow on the point of "pay to win" I personally never came across anyone "I don't think" with the "premium" gear or a "premium" gladiator but after reading the info on them in game... to say the game died for Me at that point is an under statement. So the way gear works is they degrade over time and you have to pay for repairs, however the premium gear never degrades or breaks and the states are rather high to its level counterparts. As for the premium gladiators, they never die.\nHow it normally works is if you lose a high risk there is a chance of dying, RNG and all that. And once they die thats it, the're gone for good. Now I liked that idea but the premium gladiators are "resurrected" and stay around forever "on top of again, having higher stats to their same level counterparts"\n\nSo would I recommend this game? No. It is far to pay to win to be enjoyable and to be honest, feels like a mobile game so I'd give this a pass and save your time for playing something else.","November 6, 2015","false","1.1"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","55","65","3","4"

"The action combat is great! Come meet me in the arena!!" ... right.\n\nThe "action combat" is actually kind of a quasi-turn-based RPG style.  Certain hit/block percentages come into play, but the animations don't show this. There is barely any difference in the (already choppy) animation between a block and a hit, you just have to see the floating combat text to see the result. You can be holding your block button down the entire time, your opponent can swing at you and still land a savage blow. This would be fine, if the animation showed it at all. It doesn't. You just look at the floating text and hope for the best. The mix of skill-based and percentage-based combat just doesn't work.\n\nReview continues below my first impressions video here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5s1pfiROoY&feature=youtu.be\n\nThere's very little skill invovled here, and the fairly awkward controls don't help either. You have to keep fingers on the space bar, shift key, WASD, and number keys at the same time. It's clumsy, especially when you have to do them nearly simultaneously. (I guess in this way it's a good thing that nothing you do in combat seems to matter all that much).\n\nDuring the 2nd step of the tutorial, I had to wait a couple of minutes for it to find a CPU opponent for me, and one time I had to relaunch the game to get it to work.\n\nAside from the combat, there's also a kind of Tycoon-style management for your school. You recruit and train gladiators (and heal them on a timer, up to 1.5 hours). It seems done well enough, but it's all there to supplement the combat-- and the combat is awful. This game should've ditched the combat and called itself GLADIATOR TYCOON and sold for 5 bucks.\n\nThere is a cash shop, and while I can't speak to how necessary it is due to much currency you can acquire for free (I'm not going to play this abomination long enough to find out), but for what it's worth: There's indestructable weapons in the cash shop for what amounts to FIVE DOLLARS in cash shop currency. On the plus side, you can literally purchase "Bull Tesitcles", so it's got that going for it, which is nice.\n\nedit: Formatting, and I would like to say that the announcer/narrator is actually awesome. That voice actor did an amazing job.","November 4, 2015","false","2.7"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","32","40","5","0"

But alas I can't, I joined the game and noticed well I don't see any pay to win button right out in the open. I complete the tutorial and ahh yes there's the pay to win button I have heard all about.\n\nI look around the interfaces and realized that the same stuff can be achieved as a FTP player. I decide I should go do PvP after 30 seconds of looking for another player it pairs me up with a AI ok fine. I wreck his face barely recieving a hit and move on.\n\nNext fight I decided to just get right into and get paired up against idk a player a AI maybe? Either way it did not matter because right before the fight comences the fight freezes so I relog and I now have one of my few champions stuck in a well known common bug where it is virtually taking up space as a gladiator because its stuck in fighting status.\nSo alright then I report the bug (Did not even need to find out how to correctly write the report there was already 10 other reports where I could just replace my name.)\n\nI move on to the next fight with another gladiator I go to fight this one everything is smooth until the lag hits causing any skill based advantage to become more or less meaningless and I am over powered by the sheer amount of lag and the laggy guy spamming spear thrusts, Losing my first match. Or second if you wanna include the character that is forever stuck fighting.\n\nAfter my first 3 fights being failures I left the game and decided I won't come back to this for a while until it get its bug fixed other then it being buggy right now though, Id say the game has potential its a good mix of genres of games and seems like it could hold its own in the future.\n\nOverall I rate the game 4/10 I do not suggest playing this game in its current state, Give it a month or two first.","November 6, 2015","false","1.7"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","28","36","5","0"

However, if you enjoy the challenge of not only raising characters but optimising your gains from risks this game excels.\n\nI started earlier in the week as a free player and found it incredibly frustrating. My gladiators were dying (because gladiators never die right?) I wasn't winning a lot (actually the wins to loss ratio wasn't that bad I was just mismanaging my income and button bashing in fights.) and I was all but ready to give up.\n\n\nWell... with some perserverence I managed to build my surviving gladiators up, my wins to losses got much better (my two best dudes died though so that was annoying) and I was raking in silver which was awesome. All on a free account.\n\nSo I woke up today and bought some gold and purchased some premium gladiators and support staff.\n\nThey're not that op which is gratifying, I still have to think about how I fight matches (though I don't always... I'm lazy like that) because while the Gladiator is replaced on death he loses all his accumulated XP. The free replacement of Gladiators isn't that much of a game changer as A) you still don't them to die because of the accumulated XP so playing does not in the least become a no brainer and B) the bonuses they get to XP, Silver and fan rewards are nice but low key enough not to sky rocket you to ascendency! The real asset from the premium gladiators has been that I don't need to waste silver constantly buying new meat for the grinder. But it's not THAT pronounced.\n\nI would however highly recommend buying premium Gladiators just on the replacement you get if they die. But you can play just fine without them.\n\nNow this is not an RPG really, what it is, is a roguelike gladiator sim wherein the actual fightin in the arena is only maybe two thirds of the game.\n\nAs long as you go into the game with the understanding that it IS hard and that your men WILL die you'll be fine and have a great time.\n\nMy only complaints are a) the controls sometimes go unresponsive but that might be a fault my end I haven't bothered playing other games this week to test it and B) I can't select to automatically go against the computer.

Such as nerfing the warriors that you could buy gold and changing it so that you can heal using the fastest option for silver etc.\n\nUntil they fix some of the most important issues I simply cannot recommend this and instead suggest that you stay far away and come back in a couple of months when the devs have fixed everything.\n\n4/10 has potential but broken and impossible to sustain any in game currency as everything is so expensive.\nI suggest taking this game with a pinch of salt and definitely DO NOT BUY ANY GOLD!\n\nEDIT:\n13/11/15 - As of the latest hotfix they are fixing a bug which I have seen people moan about countless times where their gladiators did not return from battle. At least they are supporting their game\n\nEDIT:\n19/11/15 - The latest patch that took place after my last edit is supposed to of fixed some major issues with things such as the server saying that you defended to late when you did not.\nI pasted a quick snippet from the patch notes below of the most important issues.\n\n- FIXED: Defense is timed too slow on the combat servers so that the players sees a lot of “Defense too Late” issues while raising the defenses should have worked for him\n- FIXED: Several 100 gladiators stuck in fighting (pls contact us via the discussion boards if you still have a gladi stuck in fighting after this update)\n- FIXED: Several lag & combat delay issues connected to movement when one player as a bad connection to the server (300ms and higher)\n\nEDIT:\n20/11/15 - The latest patch brings a nice host of gameplay changes which may make me change my review to a recommend soon!\nAs you can see below they increased the amount of silver at which you can earn, this makes me very happy as you would start off with a few thousand but then immediately lose it all as you had to equip and purchase new gladiators.\nSnippet from the patch notes:\n\nGameplay Changes:\nNew camera angle, you can now fight in third person (old camera is still available via the settings menu)\nManual Surrender, the auto surrender range has been removed, now it's up to you to choose when to give up.\n\nBalancing Changes:\nRemoved ludus tier restrictions for staff members. Now you can hire all staff members for silver as well.\nIncreased highest risk contracts rewards from levels 2 to 7 by 20%\nIncreased sell price of items to 50% of their normal cost (making it easier for players to retain enough silver)\nRemoved ludus tier restriction increased prices for equipment on higher level (prices now remain the same regardless of tier)\n\nKeep it up devs!\nAlthough the game had a dodgy start keep at it and soon this could be a "Mostly Positive" rated game!\n\nWhat could they improve?\n\nFirst of all lets start with a major problem.\nP2W.\nIt is a horrible feeling to both and play a game which has P2W features.\nThese greatly restrict both players and developers in the long term.\n\nMy proposal to tackle any P2W features:\nAs far as premium gladiators go, having both better stats AND them not dying is amazingly overpowered. I would suggest that instead of objectively getting better stats that they may get more from training (e.g. from the longest training session they could get 1.5x time training from sessions.) (If something like this is possible that would be great!)\n\nAlso, to tackle the P2W from items/ the lack of items:\nSome new items would be great, at the moment the only real option for each tier is one thing that defends slightly more or one that slightly increases a single stat.\nAn idea to improve this very limited system might be, a weapon which give your gladiator a 30% chance to survive a fatal fight. (Just an example, a little tough if you want your game to be somewhat realistic.) (Something like this may also help make the difference between prem and non-prem gladiators a little smaller)\n\nFACTIONS/GUILDS:\nThese would be cool and offer up new and exciting opportunities such as.\n\nFaction wars!, delcare war on a faction and battle other online members from the opposing faction, whoever can aquire more wins in 7 days, wins and gains gold? silver? respect?\n\nFaction league!\nSimilar to normal league but factions gain points for victories over other factions.\n\nFaction quests:\nAs a faction aquire 250 wins. (30 days)\nAs a faction have no more than 5 gladiators die in a month. (30 days)\nWin a faction vs faction. (30 days)\nHave a total of 30 members. (Constant, reward: 5000 silver for each member, can recieve only once per account)\n\nCUSTOMISATION:\nThis would be cool.\nSome simple things such as being able to change a colour of a shield of a bit of clothing etc. Or being able to add an emblem to your shield. Different helmets. Speech packs (The in-game insults get very repetitive.)\nAlso, make sure that the customisation options are a one-time purchase!\nThere is nothing worse than buying things only for them to last 1/7/30 days etc.\n\nAnother feature:\nAnother thing that would be nice to add is daily missions.\nQuite franckly these should be in most games.\nThere are a great feature for both the players AND devs, they kep the players playing and also offer the option for new and more exciting items in the future.\n\nExamples of daily missions:\nWin 3 fight.\nWin a fight whilst staying above 50% health.\nGo on a 4 win streak.\nLevel up a gladiator. (For level 4+)\n\nHope I helped.\nFeel free to ask if you would like more ideas.\n(This was very rushed, there WILL be either some spelling mistakes or a couple of bits which you may not understand, just ask!)","November 12, 2015","false","8.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","5"

Well, first consider that it's a "free" game and not a paid for so consider that obviously the developers have to make money... and I think they've done it in the best possible way.\n\nBuying gladiator packs won't really give you any advantage other than saving time. I've managed (with work) to level my in game gladiators up to better/preferred specs than the couple that I've bought with cash... the only major advantage they give is that it saves you having to repurchase them if they die... BUT. This isn't necessarily a good thing.\n\nI bought a level 3 gladiator thinking "Hey, he looks fantastic!", but then a few levels later and him dying at a level 6 automatically respawned a new level 3 when actually I'd preferred the spare slot to buy a replacement level 6 with in game money...\n\nYep, I'll vouch that it's free to play and it's not the classic play to win. It's a great game, the devs are HIGHLY responsive to threads which means that they really do try and patch faults... for free, give it a try, you can't really lose :)","November 28, 2015","true","39.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Unfortuntly it in its current status is not..\n\nHopefully if the devs do continue to work on it they will rethink the controls and ease down on the pay to win aspect a bit.. for starters you should'nt have to pay money to heal your gladiators or be forced to wait..\n\nMaybe take a page out of the League of Legends model and make the game fully playable but just make skins cost money or earlier access to special heroes that you can otherwise save game currency cost money But nothing that drastically effects the balance or limits your play.\n\nIf you want to play a MMO with action and fighting that is actually good I suggest you might like this https://triadwars.com/\n\nUnfortuntly Gladiators Online is terriable..  Prehaps if Ryse Son of Rome goes on sale in the steam store for 75-90% off  and ends up costing like $2.50..

Each move for a step, block and attack has a cooldown timer.\nAfter each fight you'll need to heal which takes time depending on how much $$$ you want to pay on timer.\n\nPay to Win? Pay for everything.\nYes Free to Play games has to make money somehow, but this game has the most need to pay I'd ever seen.\nIt makes you wait on each Gladiator after each of their fights. Because so, you have to pay for healing timers, available slots to heal each of their traits. Health, Stamina and etc.\n\nUpgrades ? No problem, Buy, Sell and Upgrade your Gladiator. Weapons, Traits, Looks, etc. The best part is the traits in Offense, Defense and Health/Stamina is a roll of the dice. You dont' pick but pay or earn enough points to click a roll of dice and if you hit the Stat numbers you like, you'd apply.\n\nOverall if this is a game style you would dedicate to and spend money on it does have a lot of things you can and manage on.","November 5, 2015","false","2.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Anyone remotely interested in playing it better wait a few months, will need that ammount of time to fix what's wrong with it. And trust me, there's a lot that needs fixing.\n\nI started playing this about a month ago, quit after trying to be the bigger man and not be bothered with the bugs and latency issues(only to quit), to come back after rewatching Spartacus and replaying Shadow of Rome. And quite frankly, despite their attempts at trying to fix it, it might have actually gotten worse.\n\nThe latency is the big bad guy in this negative review. After nearly 2 months after release it still rears its ugly head and makes the process of trying to play it a near nightmare. If you're not experiencing frequent framerate drops in multiplayer, you'll love flying all over the place versus bots. Used to be that despite having bad matches against other people, with latency downright f**king you in the ♥♥♥ at the most inopportune of moments, you'd at least be able to make some form of progress by farming AI. Not nearly as fun, but it worked. Now I'd be lucky if I manage to beat the AI with the 3 second delays I keep getting on my actions, whether it's attacking or just moving around.\n\nI'll be uninstalling this sucker again until a later date, hoping that the issues present will be addressed, because despite all: it is a fun game to play. It just isn't right now.\n\n\n","December 26, 2015","false","24.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

All you want is to have your suspicions confirmed.\n\nPay To Win\nI can confirm. Yes, it's a complete P2W fest. Non premium gladiators and staff are ultimately temporary. Gladiators die, and staff leaves. Only paid stuff remains - but it's not enough. The paid stuff will eventually become useless as well, unless you continue paying for more expensive and higher tier staff/gladiators. That means you could spend $40 at the start of the game, just to be forced to spend even more some hours later, as your low tier premium gladiators won't be enough. The amount of money you need to spend keeps exponentially expanding - if you had any experience with this kind of mechanic you would walk away right now.\n\nBut you're still reading, so I this is just for you:\n\nIt's a C game with a 5xAAA pricetag. Only way to have any fun with the game is to keep pumping exorbitant amounts of cash into it. In theory it's possible to earn the premium currency in-game. But where you gain a few dozen/hour, at most - the game requires tens of thousands. It reminds me of those incredibly crappy F2P shooters with timed gear - pay $25 to have some assault rifle for 1 month. Or spend 50 in-game hours to be able to buy the same weapon with non premium currency, for 1 week.\n\n\nAdditional note: 0.2 hrs is enough to find out how the flow of the game is going to go, what insane amounts of cash you will need to spend to have some basic fun, or worse, what insane amounts of frustration you will need to get through if you don't wish to pay.","November 6, 2015","false","0.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Will we be successful or will out dreams die with our gladiators?\nI tried really hard to like this game. I think its an awesome concept, and several of the things they did are really cool.\nHowever, So many parts are tragically flawed its basically futile, Firstly your chance to match against a human player is EXTREMLY Low. This is because of several reasons but mostly because of the flawed matching system\n1. There is likely not many players on at one given time to match with you as the game is not hugely popular,\n2. Then you are matched based on the level of gladiator you have chosen\n3. Then you have to be further match based on which prize you choose\nThus to have an human opponent you need someone who is online, fighting with the same level gladiator, and happened to pick the same prize you are after. I played the game for over 2 hours, and got matched with a human once, and I think that was luck and pure chance.\nBesides that at the higher levels, It costs as much (or more) to repair your equipment and maintain your gladiators as you win. And that’s considering you win your match, if you lose, your basically lost money, and have to use your lower level gladiators to make a profit. So essentially your high level gladiators which are the most expensive cost you money to fight with.\nThis is not taking into account that the game is totally Pay To Win,\nSo I tried to like it, but it’s fatally flawed.","January 18","false","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can also sell gladiators to the salt mines for a decent prize the higher the gladiator level the higher the selling prize. There are also leagues like Bronze League, Silver League and Gold League and every season that lasts about 7 days you will have a chance to win gold depending on in what League and League Rank you are in.\n\nMany people playing this game for the 1st time are like this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is P2W, this is full of bugs, how do you even play this, the game is broken, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game i'm quitting and so on. But they have to realize this is a new game and this is in greenligth and if they would read a bit before playing it they would know a lot more about it and then there is no need for crying with caps on in chat all those things I mentioned earlier. They should change their own attitude if they wan't any help from others in the game.\n\nMany people that will start a new game in Greenligth expect the game to be ready while they should do something about their lazyness and read about it. I've played this game about 3 or 4 weeks it's not that hard to play. Of course new games are full of bugs because the game is still in development. This game is far more than a bad game don't believe everything that others write in their  review if you are unsure about is it good or not try it out yourself. If you don't understand something about the game you can always ask questions in in-game chat there are a lot of people willing to explain everything about the game and I am one of them.\n\nThe game itself keeps getting better and better. Developers are also nice people (at least at this time I don't know about the future but we will see) that will listen to people's ideas , reports and issues for example I've posted many ideas, some are now in game and some are on to do list for later on because developers are busy clearing the bugs and with each new update there migth be new bugs but that's why there are gamers that will try it out and make discussions about the game so it's much easier for developers to fix it and make it more fun for everyone.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that likes hardcore figthing. This game keeps getting updates every now and then which  contains bug fixes and also ideas of the people. So far so good so just give it a chance and this game migth become one of your favourites with in time.\n\nI will give it 7/10 since it is not ready yet.\nThank you !","November 24, 2015","true","58.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For a game with SO MUCH potential it dies an slow painful death, like one of it's gladiators on the lag problem in the arena. It's not just the arena that lags, it's the whole game: you log in and you are often stuck on the first sctreen you go to. I understand the designers want you to "understand" everyone dies, but a basic lag problem this should have been solved prior to release. The control system for gladiators seems a mobile port, a poor choice of keys which lag so with a good connection you win, bad connection you loose no matter how skilled your gladiator or how fast your reactions.  It could have been better it may be ... but for now - read the discussions posts on lag to verify what I'm writing about.","November 11, 2015","false","86.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The gladiator matchups are fairly even, but the further you get in the game the more you need to spend real money to continue. The redeeming quality is that computer opponents are always inferior and can be played to generate experience.\n\nUPDATE: After playing this game for about a week, I have to really point out some serious issues. The game servers regularly go down, causing you to lose any training or healing that your were conducting. Also, the game program itself FREQUENTLY crashes while upgrading gladiator attributes, costing you those attributes. More seriously, if the game crashes while you are fighting, you lose the fight and your gladiator is killed. If this only happened once in a while, no big deal; but this happens about every other day! I cannot recommend this game at all until the server and program issues are fixed.","December 6, 2015","false","30.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/recommended/385880/","Apokalupsis","✫ Aionion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/","447 products in account","Very disappointing.\n\nThe game feels like a mobile game. Overly simplistic combat (SPACEBAR to attack, SHIFT to defend, AD to move back and forth, WS to "dodge", and a few # keys for skills that are gained through a grueling grinding process).\n\nCombat exists of you and the other player basically taking turns swinging at each other. There are no combos, you attack, then forced to wait about 2-3 secs before you attack again. No fight anywhere in the real world or gaming consists of "attack, force wait 2-3 secs, then attack again."  Every time you dodge or defend, you lose stamina.\n\nAfter combat, your gladiator must wait several minutes to recover health, stamina and if he loses, morale.  It's a forced wait mechanic like a mobile or Facebook game.\n\nIt's interesting to buy gladiators on the market and to equp them, but even that is overly simplistic. The winnings of a match are about 5% of what it costs to buy and equip a gladiator.  The winnings are ridiculously low.\n\nThe game definitely wants players to pay to get ahead. Many F2P games entice players by offering a lot then offering certain benefits for paying (cosmetics, boosts).  This game however, offers players a little then frustrates them to buy just so they can have what ought to reasonably included for a decent play experience in the first place (such as sufficient room in your Sanitarium (hospital) or Training area (which also is forced wait AND reduces stamina, which means train then go "heal" before fighting, or even the staff you need to develop the gladiators.\n\nDevs claim there is no waiting because the player can let one gladiator heal while others are fighting. You can do that of course, but it does not prevent the wait times, even with 4-5 gladiators. The wait times are far too long and they cost far too much money.\n\nHere's the last kicker...\n\nYou can actually LOSE money by fighting.\n\nI'll repeat what I just said...you can LOSE money by fighting. You earn so little in a fight, that the cost of repairing equipment + healing + restoring stamina + resotoring morale (if you lose) is FAR, FAR greater than the tiny amount that you earn.\n\nAnd when you win, your net after all the healing and repairs is negligible, making your income gain a serious grind.\n\nThe devs have "brilliantly" created a system where there is a state of exceedingly slow gains in income (due to losing it and slow progress of it) income, making the player stay at the very lowest levels OR pay for in game money if they want to advance.\n\nFor example...a net win at level 2 is around 130sp. A loss of the match will get you around 65sp.  Want to increase your Sanitarium space so you can have another gladiator be trained because you have 4-5 gladiators now? Pony up 7,500sp.\n\nBest case scenario...50 or so wins just to increase the space. No one gets that many wins w/o losing a lot though. If you are an average player, expect a 50/50 ratio...which means clos to 100 matches played just to expane ONE of your buildlings (nevermind the others).\n\nIt's absolutely absurd.\n\nIt's a horrible system. The "Mostly Negative" review rating this game has received is not exaggerated...it really is, that bad.\n\nIf you were expecting a decent gladiator school / fighting game...this is NOT it, not by any stretch of the imagination.","November 4, 2015","false","2.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

(good, comparing to other free games)\n\n*Truly Premium quality music\n(not expected by a free game) I'm a pro level composer myself, so I can tell even lots of retail games haven't got tracks with this high production quality and good historical music awareness.\nFew and short tracks though, as expected from a free one.\n\n*Graphics for the GUI is pro level, I think.\n\n\nMINUS SIDE:\n\n*For free, it gets a bit repetitive, probably with paid upgrades as well (?)\n\n*The turn based in-fighting system might have a strategy game vibe, but it feels like trying to wear two hats without total success. Either a more strategically developed turn based in-game system and/or a more realistic real-time action related system. For a full retail version, both would be nice but perhaps that's asking too much.\n\n*Some deeper character info could easily be done, like a bio for each one.\nAbility to create nicknames for each one, and perhaps the character screens could have them holding fully covering helmets sometimes, for increased connection with the characters. Helmet on, and it's sometimes like staring at a robot/monster a little bit. I like to pretend I care about my characters in any game.\n\n*As many has stated, Pay system has some upgrades are ridiculous percs like immortal fighters. A non-magical sollution would seem way better, IMO.\n\n\nI don't mind a few minutes wait, and I don't mind losing big sometimes either. These things both makes it feel more realistic to me actually. Of course the competetiveness amongst players gets a bit lost from the latter though.\n\nFor the wait periods, why not run the game in a custom positioned window, doing other stuff with your PC while waiting. You do get a ready-sound notification when something happened in the game.\nI just turn the music off during this off-time. Not sure what you expected from a free game...\n\nI'd consider buying a more developed "Full version" game, if it had enough additional value like a story-mode, or more indepth managing, or deeper character customizing (prob even beyond what the paying system offers)","November 7, 2015","true","19.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Which i hope can be fixed with time. The game has potential.\n\nThe good:\n1. Manage your own house and your gladiators\n2. Decent graphics that will run on low end machines\n3. Fun IF you like the spartacus TV series or gladiators in general.\n4. A unique game. There aren't many in this genre which is a shame.\n5. Good tutorial\n\nThe bad:\n1. Not enough blood and gore for a gladiator game. Let me cut of limbs and cause wounds that you can see on the gladiator (slice marks and puncture wounds) and let those leave scars so your gladiator looks battle hardened.\n\n2. Some pay to win elements in the gold armor being better then the normal silver armor of the same tier (except tier 10)\n\n3. The fights are boring and lackluster. Hit, block, use some skills, hit block etc. Would be more fun IF it were more dynamic and action combat based and not the current boring animations.\n\n4.

The combat is akin to something you'd play on a mobile phone or the Wii. Lots of different game mechanics to abuse. Many will make you want to rage quit. Developers work hard, but they're changes revamp what "works".\n\nMeaning you can spend real money on a premium gladiator, invest hours of time into developing him. Then one day an update comes which fixes some type of game mechanic abuse (Like battle desync and sidestep spamming), and because your gladiator was developed to abuse one type of mechanic that's now been patched, hes weak and loses every fight. Or perhaps all your gladiators are now weak and lose every fight.\n\nBecause everyone else is abusing the new best mechanic. Shift spamming!\n\nAt least sidestep spamming was fast-paced and somewhat enjoyable.
