"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/recommended/17140/","GoldenHopper1983","Ryebread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/","205 products in account","This game was a disappointment, and it weighed on me doubly so because it's based on an idea I love.\n\nHinterland is one-part Diablo-style action game, and one-part village-management. Essentially, you go around a randomly-generated map, fighting monsters and trying to find resources to sustain a village. At the same time, you're recruiting villagers to your humble land who can then set up shop as tailors or blacksmiths or guards. These villagers, regardless of profession, can also be armed with gear and set up to defend their village during monster raids or adventure with the player in a party.\n\nHowever, it is SUCH a shallow experience. The graphics are visibly of bargain-basement quality (as you can see from the screenshots). Combat devolves to pointing and clicking, then watching your adventuring party (you can only ever control one) beat up whatever is in the area. Worst of all, the village you build up becomes supremely underwhelming when everything it produces are far outshone by loot from the wilderness. The loot itself is never visually appealing or causes satisfying effects beyond making damage numbers higher.\n\nPersonally, I have always wanted a game village that takes an active part in the player's game. After all, has a NPC farmer ever asked you to kill 5 rats? Haven't you ever wanted him to kill his own damn rats? You have pitchforks! You have hammers! Fight with me against the enemy hordes! Don't just squat in your stinky huts with exclamation marks over your heads, waiting for Almighty Player to save your stinky hides!\n\nThis game took a few small steps towards an interesting idea, and then plopped down and went no further. Tragic.","December 29, 2013","false","25.5"," 55 of 71 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","55","71","2","1"

Mix of H&S and city builder in oldschool style and in my opinion it's very good idea. What is quite unusual, when you play in this title, you feel like playing some board game. Interesting title for oldschool players.\nMight be more polished and potential is not fully exploited, but it is still good game. I wish that second, better part will be developed.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're a oldschool gamer, you should try it. Maybe you will like it as me and will return to it for years.\nIf you're fan of extra-modern games only, I'll not try to convince you for that title.\n\nLike this review?

Pick your class and your rules, then begin your journey to conquer the lands around your village, bringing in resources and improving your town's standing as you go.\n\nWhile the game's overall concept and execution are simple, it is nevertheless an engaging experience. Many other reviewers have likened it to a board game, and that really is the best way to think of it, not as an adventure RPG, but more like a strategy game.\n\nWhile the game's general performance can be poor, it is never more than a minor nuisance, and the game features a great amount of  replayability.","June 6, 2015","true","13.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Its quite enjoyable and addicting. I ended up playing 6 hours of it in one day to complete my first playthrough. I will definitely be coming back to play it on the highest difficulty.\n\nThe combat is diablo-style. You dont have any skills though. You can only auto-attack enemies. They drop loot, and you get money for slaying them. A certain number of enemies guard specific locations on the map. For example, when you venture out of your base, you will come across a iron mine. Guarding this mine will be 7 enemies of a certain indicated (difficulty) level. After you kill them all, you gain access to the iron mine as a resource hub. In the same way, there are other locations populated on the map, such as a graveyard, herb field, portal, neutral point, etc.\n\nAt the same time, you have to manage your base. Every few days, you get new visitors to your base. These visitors are of various trades: guardsman, craftsmen, herbalist, innkeeper, etc. You have to recruit these people to your town by paying them. After paying them, you build them their structure (guard tower, workshop, farm, etc) on a tile in your town. Afterwards, you can upgrade these structures for added benefits. Occasionally, the king will send you requests (similar to those in xcom: enemy unknown), and enemies will attack your base. Your job is to take over the whole map.\n\nAs a plus, there are steam achieves. :)","January 16, 2013","true","11.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Monster lair will spawn monsters that will run a straight line towards your town and that's about it. Town building is simply hiring people that show up and give them a building to live in. There is little interaction between people in town other than some people require some other building first.\n\nUltimately the game feels too shallow to worth the price I paid for it (which is 20 USD at the time), it's now only 10 dollars, but I personally still wouldn't spend money on it.\n","November 30, 2013","false","8.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

The result is a seemingly confused game. Action RPG with strategy elements that's geared towards 20-30 minutes gaming sessions.\n\nIt's also a game that you feel is missing something. The gameplay has a very arcade feel to it due to the lack of any sort of metagame or campaign, every round being a one off attempt at a high score. The lack of any sort of proper tutorial or explanation of the various game mechanics is also something that severely hurts your experience, forcing you to guess at how things work along the way.\n\nGraphically and sound-wise the game fits squarely in the indie catagory, nothing impressive but functional enough that it doesn't bother you too much.\n\nHinterland is a confused mess of wasted potential and it really is a shame because there's some good ideas hidden in there.","November 7, 2012","false","49.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

At first glance, it's like a kind of toned-down Diablo I, with a few city building/management elements thrown in..  And that's pretty much what it delivers.  Perhaps the younger set or the hardcore strategy or simulation players won't like it, but I'm finding it to be.. almost refreshingly nostalgic.  It has a pretty "old school" feel to it, and it's fairly challenging and moderately replayable.  I imagine the harder difficulties will prove much beefier to get through than the "easy" games I've done so far.. I could see very much how it can scale.\n\nI only have a couple modest criticisms.. The first and foremost is what I would call a "bug".. when attempting to use a rejuvenation potion, I frequently have to drag it to my character's face icon 4 or 5 times, if not more, before I hit the one *little* spot on the picture where it actually *registers* the "hey, drink this" command.  Never could get the Potion of Hardening to work, but the standard Potion of Healing worked without a hitch.\n\nThe second is more of a general gripe, I confess. A lot of the "city builder" games have this feel of "having to fight the engine when it makes no sense to have to do so."  Which kind of breaks immersion. If you're a lord of a city in some kind of fantasy kingdom, I'd expect you'd be able to say.. place an order for goods that your citizens produce, instead of being held at the mercy of whatever random output they feel like offering up that day.   It leaves the situation involving a whole lot of "Standing around waiting for product X to show up in the rotation" when you need more of it..  In my case  it was  "sit through 2 raids waiting for 2 doctors to produce enough healing potions for me to go take over another territory, but no, they would constantly  crank out at least 3 rejuvenation potions for every healing potion produced.  Likewise, 2 armor smithies set up specifically to try to get a decent suit of plate made before I expired from old age, when both of them had researched it and were dead set on producing wooden shields or some other useless junk.\n\nYou'd think a Lord would be able to, you know, *commission* something. Or specify what is to be focused on for production.\n\nBut those gripes aside. It's been a fun game. I've enjoyed playing it, and I'd recommend it to others, Perhaps not the really hardcore uber-competitive types.. but for casual gamers who like this sort of thing, especially with a bit of a nostalgic fondness for the oldschool, it's likely to be a pleasant time for a while on a few bucks.","July 12, 2014","true","103.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Glitchy as heck, and not always the fun kind. Supposedly its a city-building strategy game, but it plays like an arcade; there's limited enemies save some respawning raiding groups, so you can't level grind... at all. Early enemies drop in just a couple of hits, giving you next to nothing in terms of levels, and then suddenly enemies are WELL over your power with no warning. Raid groups are the same; either too easy to be worth anything or unstoppable game-ending apocalypse armies. Followers can APPARENTLY level up, but despite my BEST efforts and care I haven't seen one live long enough to level up past hitting with the might of a cricket with health to match.\n\nResources are either accessible or not; but all of them are COMPLETELY critical to your survival. You *can* get stone, iron, fresh water, and herbs by spending HERETICAL sums of gold, and that can often be the only way to get it before the endgame itself. Of course, if mandrake or a crypt aren't nearby and lightly defended you can't get them until you level past the point of needing them.\n\nIn summary, it tries to be a city-building strategy game, but horrible balance issues, glitches, and shoddy design make it an unplayable wreck.","December 11, 2013","false","42.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

You play the lord of a small fantasy medieval town. You can recruit townpeoples, each of which provides unique abilities, like producing weapons, armor, potions, or providing your town with food and services. Each townsperson can be kitted out with gear that you either produce or find while adventuring, and can be brought with you as part of your party instead of staying in town.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to clear the map of enemy camps, which vary in difficulty and monster composition, and provide a source of loot and gold. Periodically, one of these camps, which is the monster stronghold, will send out raiding parties to attack your town. There is no campaign or much of a story beyond that though, so it's mainly a score attack kind of game. Each game lasts roughly a couple of hours.

This coupled with the 10+ classes will keep you replaying over and over","July 3, 2011","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
