"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YicklePigeon/recommended/373390/","YicklePigeon","YicklePigeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YicklePigeon/","180 products in account","I decided to buy the game after seeing the first two episodes of Jesse Cox & Dodger's playthrough of it, and it's an interesting game if perhaps leaving a lot of decision making out of the equation at times (such as non-interactive cutscenes that could have been timed puzzles/QTEs) and you can't accuse/arrest the wrong person, which I add only for completion as that may or may not be important to you as a player.\n\nI appreciate the HD video, but at times not the acting which can range from being (unintentionally?) comical (especially the player character Inspector Jenks, who also perhaps got his dress sense cues from McCloud rather than Morse, which I find to be diverting) and then the acting being ineffectua throughl to playing the scenes straight. The story is okay, but could have been solved almost immediately with the all-important clue being blatantly obvious and yet the option to compare and contrast the statements given yielded no results.  Not until the final in-game hour anyway.\n\nThen there are the elements of a paranormal/horror plot, which sadly was only touched upon and could have made this much more of a game. More than likely the budget constraints put paid to developing that plot, but at least there were little touches in the form of short scenes informing the player of potential events (one I recall being optional, that being the scene in the Reading Room where you're told to go away because "we're about to start a session").\n\nAs it stands, I achieved a 96% completion rate by the end of the game. This says to me that there is a way to solve another murder mystery that crops up, but there isn't any warning box/prompt before selecting the option that ends the game.\n\nYou cannot fail to get the murderer of the student that Inspector Jenks is investigating the death of, which for me makes the whole experience feel more like a guided tour that you unlock pieces of if you compare the right choices, but that's it. If Contradiction had much more of a budget? Then we could have had a potential Tex Murphy-esque game to play, but right now I can only recommend this to those who don't want to wait for the aforementioned (or any other) Let's Play to be completed or as a party game given that £6.99 is a fair enough price and I got some enjoyment out of it with about 9 hours of play.\n\nAll said and done though, there is potential here and I would like to see the developer take another stab at making a detective adventure game.\n\nADDITIONAL: This, as per the game's Steam store page, is perhaps best played with two or more people as opposed to solo like I did. In that case, I'd say it would play out like a Cluedo-esque murder mystery evening. Approaching Contradiction in this manner would, in my view, override any qualms about the acting and improve the experience overall.\n\nThere are some glitches in the form of typos ("North Lane" instead of "North Road" when outside the pub) and also in the conversation with Rebecca (her name is sometimes spelled as "Rbecca" and a summary statement of hers that should start with "Usually" has been misspelled as "Ususally", I've preserved the casing for the developer to quickly get to the problem); Steam integration isn't perfect (the Steam overlay and the taking of screenshots isn't possible at this time); when you get to the end of the credits, the "resume" button is available and Jenks acts as though the conversation with the person-in-question ended normally, however the final end credit text is still overlaid on the screen and prevents access to the game's UI (ALT+F4 to the rescue at that point).  Given the developer is very quick at updating (again, as per the game's Steam store page), I expect all these will be fixed soon enough.\n\nI vaguely recall other typos being present, but I can't recall them right now. To the developer, be assured I mean no disrespect and I have added all this to help you/yourselves in refining your game. :)\n\nFurthermore, I've tidied up my own review for the purposes of clarity. :)","September 17, 2015","true","9.0"," 224 of 240 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","224","240","8","4"

been gaming in the 90's you might remember the emergence (and sad demise) of the FMV sub genre.\nGames like Gabriel Knight, Phantasmagoria and the Tex Murphy titles started to embrace Full Motion Video footage.\nInitially it was viewed as a novelty, real actors playing out the narrative in all the interlaced video glory the 90's could muster.\nFMV seemed liked a perfect fit for cut scenes and narrative heavy titles and I loved it!\nEven some real "Hollywood" actors were seduced by the rise of the interactive movie, with the likes of Mark "Skywalker" Hamil heading up the Wing Commander games and Christopher "Pulp Fiction" Walken starring in the 1996 FMV thriller "Ripper"\n\n\nRIP FMV\n\nUnfortunately, my love for all things FMV wasn't shared by my peers,  I was in the minority and the FMV trend had almost died away completely by the end of the 90's.\nThis was partly due to the technological limitations of the time.\nThe video was often interlaced or blocky, the frame rates were poor and the amount of space required by the footage used up a huge amount of CD-Rom storage, the game Ripper I mentioned earlier was spread across 6 CD's!\n\nMany FMV games also suffered from cheesy writing and equally bad acting.\n"Phoned in" performances were the norm and as such a stigma began to emerge in the media around the whole "interactive movie" genre.\nThis stigma probably had as much to do with the death of the genre as the technical limitations of the 90's, but whatever the reason, the interactive movie died, I mourned its passing and moved on, but now I've discovered a game which has rekindled my interest, a new, modern FMV experience in all its interactive movie gaming glory.\n\n\nThe Stage\n\nContradiction: Spot the Liar! to give it its full (and unnecessarily long title) is a "whodunnit" detective adventure set in the sleepy little English village of Edenton.\n\nEdenton isn't just a stage for the players either, its a character in its own right.\nFrom the village pub to the surrounding woodland, all the locations are beautifully realised and tie together to create a charming and peaceful setting, you'll even see the odd Union Jack fluttering in the breeze.\nThis rural tranquillity gives Edenton a charm of its own, it feels like a real location that you'd find if you drove out  into the green and pleasant land that is the English countryside.\nIt's this tranquil charm which makes the recent events in Edenton all the more shocking.\n\nThere's been a suspicious death in the village, a young woman, Kate Vine, has drowned but was it suicide? a terrible accident? or something more sinister?\nYou've got one night to find out, let the investigations begin!\n\n\nThe Players\n\nYou play as Detective Inspector Jenks, an interestingly likeable character with a compelling interview technique which is sure to make you smile, he's also somewhat of a kleptomaniac and has the added side effect of making me want to start wearing a hat.\n\nAs you explore the village you'll come across some equally interesting locals, friends and acquaintances of Kate's all getting on with their lives, each with their own personalities, view of events and secrets to hide.\nI can't overstate how well written these characters are, without exception everyone you come across feels like a fleshed out and fully realised person, from the landlady at the village pub to the father and son team who run "Atlas" an exclusive business training course which seems to be popular with the local students, they're all engaging and make each interview a pleasure to play through.\n\n\nOne Week Later...\n\nJenks arrives in the village of Edenton one week after Kate Vines death, it's a Friday evening, the locals are going about their business and it's your job to snoop through their things and interview them regarding the death.\n\nEverything in this game is presented through video footage, from the navigation of the village through to the interviews themselves, but more on that later.\n\nMovement around the village is a simple, go  left, go right affair, each location has its own video loop, there are no static screens here, Edenton is a living, breathing village.\nStand by the lakeside and waves will ripple in the light whilst branches move and creak  in the wind, the level of immersion this creates is undeniably impressive.\n\n\nThe Questions\n\nYou'll find yourself searching through locations, finding clues and interviewing the locals.\nThese interviews are the meat of the game, initially you'll only have a couple of "conversation pieces"  to enquire about, the dead girl, Kate Vine and her driving license which was discovered some distance away from her body.\nQuestioning the residents of Edenton quickly opens up your investigative  options as you uncover more information about events leading up to Kate's death and "acquire" items to ask about from your inevitable snooping.\n\n\nThe Play\n\nIt's not just a case of ask everyone about everything you discover either, that's just part of it.\nYou actually need to listen to what people say,\n\nWho's lying?\nWho's telling the truth?\n\nIt's listening out for contradictions in characters answers that will help reveal this information.\n\n\nThe Lies\n\nThe actual mechanic of spotting these contradictions is well implemented too.\nAs you question a person, notes of their relevant answers are recorded in your journal.\nYou can go through these notes and if you spot two that contradict each other you can question the person further regarding the holes in their story.\n\nWhy did they lie?\nWhat are they hiding?\n\n\nThe Lost\n\nThis game is by no means easy either, you're not going to breeze straight through the story without actually thinking about what people have told you and going through your notes.\nHaving said that, there is a hint system if you find yourself stuck at a dead end.\nThe hints are given by going to the phone box in the village (Jenks is an old school kind of guy and doesn't seem to have a mobile) and calling the police chief who will offer an insight to help get you back on track.\nIf these hints aren't enough there's always the old faithful option of just plain cheating too, but try and avoid it if you can, the satisfaction of catching someone in a lie is what this game is all about.\n\n\nI Spy\n\nOne thing I wasn't keen on with this game was the snooping investigation mechanic.\nWhen you reach a scene with something interesting for you to discover a giant magnifying glass icon appears in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nClick on it and Jenks will investigate whatever it is that he has spotted at that location.\nIt works fine but I would have enjoyed a little more subtlety here.\n\nThis mechanic is likely a throwback to the titles mobile gaming routes but as a PC gamer the ability to scan your mouse over a location to discover something for yourself would have been more rewarding.\n\nI'm just being picky though, this didn't tarnish my enjoyment of the game,  it's a just a change that would have added something to what otherwise was an excellent experience.\n\n\nHDTV\n\nVisually this game is hard to fault with high quality full motion video throughout.\nThis is an FMV title with the production values of a primetime TV show.\nFrom the camera angles to the sets themselves, everything works to draw you into what feels like a real place populated by real people.\nThe sound is equally impressive, with an excellently appropriate musical score to accompany the ambient sounds found at each location.\nThe voice recording itself is generally of a high quality, occasionally you'll...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/373390/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Oh was this an experience to play. It was incredible and I was hooked from the start. Not many games can have me playing for 3 hours running and have me feeling like i've only been playing for about half an hour.\n\nI feel like there isn't a whole lot I can say about this game without spoiling the story to readers so i'm going to structure this review into a few smaller sections explaining the main premise of the game and linking in my opinions/experience.\n\nGameplay\nContradiction is an FMV style game. I'll admit though I have never before played an FMV game. I wasn't around during the FMV craze that I heard about. So I am not sure what typical gameplay is like in them type of games. But I can explain how gameplay functions in Contradiction.\n\nYou play as a detective. You are investigating the death of a character named Kate Vine. You do this by exploring the small village and finding the clues along the way. All areas that you explore are real areas and nothing is animated. The clues that you find can be used to interogate other characters that you meet accross the way. After asking all the questions to people your goal is to spot who is lieing. You have to put two responses together that disagree with each other and then interogate the person more about this Contradiction.\n\nThe game is an investigatory experience. It could be compared to the likes of L.A NOIRE or Sherlock Holmes. But Contradiction decides to strip it's core mechanics down to the basics. They decide to focus on the questioning mechanic. The responses are well thought out and it is very enjoyable to listen to what the characters have to say. You often find yourself linking replies that you got right at the start of the game to ones that were said very late in the game. This means you need to have a good memory or else you could find yourself having to look through pages of replies. Although boy is it satisfying when you finally find a contradiction amongst all of the replies.\n\nThe UI\nNow this game is controlled entirely with the keyboard. The UI is key to making sure the experience is fun. It does this well to an extent. The initial controls the game gives you are horrible. You probably want to rebind them to more appropriate keys as soon as you start playing. Although even navigating the controls screen isn't great. There is no way that I could see to just rebind one single key. You have to go through the entire list and rebind each key instead of just picking one. What I would like to see is the introduction of mouse control, even if it was just across the main menu. It would definitely make the experience a bit better.\n\nThen you have the map. Initially it is kinda confusing to use. You have 2 choices of how to explore. You can use the map and go to a location straight away using that. But you can only use the keyboard to control it again. Originally I didn't realize you could use the map for movement because I was trying to use the mouse to click on the location. But once you realize that you can then it is a much better form of movement. The second way of navigation is through the arrow keys. You get given a choice of places to go to next from your current location. The problem with this is that the game seems to confusingly decide to change orientation. This means you can't just spam up for example to keep going in that direction. You need to keep an eye on what direction orientation the world has randomly decided to go to. This factor confused me for quite a while and made me go in the wrong direction numerous times. But I did get used to it in the end.\n\nThe Characters\nSo each character is played by a real life person including the person you play as. The character development throughout the game is great. Your really do get to know the characters which is key in an investigatory game where your main focus is to spot the criminal. Some of the acting is vastly exagorated, especially Jenks(Your own character). But this is OK I think because it makes sure you don't miss anything but sometimes it is a little bit cringeworthy.\n\nSome characters in contradiction I felt were amazing actors and definitely gave their characters a personalilty. To name a few the characters of Ryan, James and Simon were played excelently and I want to take the time to praise their actors. Obviously the rest of the other actors were also great as well. But there were some moments were I felt the acting was kinda bad. I have to wonder if it was the bad dialog that the script writers had given them that made these moments cringeworthy. But the majority of the dialog and acting was amazing and I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nSummary\nSo would I recommend Contradiction. YES, YES, Oh boy yes. It was an incredible experience the likes of which I personally havn't seen before. If you love detective games this is definitely the game for you. It sees the detective experience from a different perspective that isn't usually focused on in games. The game ends gearing up for a sequel. But they need peoples support on this game if they are to make another game. I really hope this game succeeds because I would love to play another game of this and experience some more backstory behind the characters. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. Especially at the very reasonable price point of £6.99. It is a bargain for how much fun you get out of it. It took me 8 hours to complete which is well worth the price.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was given a early press key by the developer to make this review.","July 15, 2015","true","8.0"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","60","62","3","0"

Its on the verge of selfawareness, knowing that it is goofy, but there are enough characters that are believeable that it works. In no way I'm saying that the game is bad, its that the quality and tone rides a very thin line and frankly balances perfectly.\n\nI highly recommend this game, whether to just support the developer so that similar efforts can me made, or if you are looking for a murder mystery with a lot of camp and charm nailed in around the framework.\n\nSuggestion to the developer for a sequel, retain as much of the cast as possible, just create a new mystery for Jenks to solve with eerily similar characters.","July 20, 2015","true","4.6"," 44 of 44 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","44","44","2","0"

There is more than meets the eye, but it's hard to tell what exactly is going on and every suspect act suspicious enough so it's hard to tell who is lying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/373390/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Contradiction is a live-action FMV Murder-Mystery game. You play as Inspector Jenks, a British Policeman who goes to investigate the death of a girl named Katie in a small outskirt village. Her death was investigated and called a suicide, but there was morphine in her blood at her time of death and her driver's license was pinned to a tree in the forest away from the scene of her death, leading our character to suspect there's more involved in this case which he takes personal interest in. His work quickly leads him to find there is indeed something going on in this town...\n\nSo, like many FMV games, this game does have an edge of B-charm, laugh-out-loud moments, a lot of this comes from some of the acting and facial expressions the actors can have in specific scenes. But that's not to say this is a so-bad-it's-good type of game, in fact the opposite, it actually got kind of gripping as it developed and in contrast some moments were acted out rather well. It's got a multi-layered mystery that gets deeper and deeper as the night goes on, and is actually surprisingly interesting.\n\nGameplay is rather basic. You walk around a town and look for clues hidden about, and people to interview. When you interview people, you take out clues, both physical and conversation topics you earn from talking to others, and watch FMV scenes as they interact. When the scene is done, your character has taken 'notes' to the key points of the discussion. You then can take the key notes from that discussion, and every other discussion you've had with that character, and try and spot any 'contradictions' the character may have said. If you find a contradicting point, it triggers another scene, which either will lead to you having to do further digging or creates a new conversation topic you can raise up to others. Other conversation topics can be found around as objects or weird things in town that strike up a good conversation topic, and some rare objects found can be used to explore deeper certain areas in the village.\n\nThe game has a solid cast of something like 10 main characters, and is backed by some rather good-quality video for the backgrounds, FMV scenes, etc., and an actually pretty wonderful soundtrack. Music added a lot to specific scenes, and there were a few moments without music where you can hear the atmosphere sounds and drone noises that made some scenes legitimately creepy. On that, while the game is down-toned most of the time, there's the odd scene that plays every once in a while that can catch you off-guard, something that's just kind of creepy, or unexpected, shocking in some cases. I won't spoil anything with that, but the game has a few sudden scenes that happen as you investigate that might catch you off-guard.\n\nIt's got a few minor flaws. There are a few times where something the character said was obviously a lie or a contradiction to something you already knew, but because you didn't have the 'conversation topic' piece, you couldn't accuse them of this. A few contradictions (or what seem like contradictions) the game doesn't think quite are. Also the game, while it does have an ending and wraps up the case, proposes more questions, especially near the very end, and has several loose plot threads. They seem to be a sequel hook, and past the game credits a message pops-up confirms this saying  "Thanks For Playing!", they'd like to make a sequel, but the only way to do so is for the game to do well-enough, and they appreciate reviews/videos/the like on their project.\n\nSo that raises the question, "Is it worth it?" To which I say, for me, absolutely so. I liked it, I enjoyed it. There were a few moments I got stumped on what to do (get too stuck and you can use a cheat system to tell you what to do next, a feature I never used, or call your chief for a vague general hint) and as you collect more clues you're given maybe too many conversation points to look over, but I actually ended up enjoying the mystery that unveiled in the game, the loose plot threads interest me to see continued, and the story had some fun twists and turns, was sometimes unintentionally amusing, but other times more consciously so, and was gripping at times. Worth it if an FMV Murder-Mystery sounds up your alley, and want something between hammy entertainment and something more gripping and interesting. Hope to see this world revisited in the future.","July 17, 2015","true","7.1"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","35","36","0","0"

That really isn't as exciting as it used to be. Maybe I'm just getting old. I'd probably start yelling at clouds, but I never go outside. Whatever the case, Contradiction - Spot the Liar! is a great example of what the medium is capable of.\n\nDetective Inspector Jenks is tasked with solving the mysterious death of a young woman. Over the course of a single night, he will collect evidence, interview suspects, and discover contradictions. In terms of game-design, the process isn't complicated in any way. Take the Phoenix Wright series for example. In those games, your primary method of progression is tied to spotting contradictions. If you mess up, you're punished with a loss of "life". There are no punishments for mistakes in this game. You can even take as much time as you need to solve the mystery. I appreciate the more casual approach to this investigation. Due to my cautious nature, I tend to save every couple minutes in the Ace Attorney games, which really hurts the pacing.\n\nAn aspect that I really enjoy about this game is it can feel like nothing is really happening. I compare it to the Gene Hackman movie "The French Connection". If you take out the car/L-train chase and the shoot-out at the end, you're left with nearly an hour and a half of "boring" police work. A lot of attention is paid to the characters, and how their mostly fruitless investigation plays out. You'll go through a similar process in this game. With every new piece of evidence, you'll  end up asking everyone what they might know about it. Some won't know anything at all, but you're still treated to an answer. The person you're questioning might also make an odd quip or comment. Even if they don't have anything to do with the investigation, these character moments add a lot of personality.\n\nThat's why I strongly suggest that - unless you're well and truly stuck - you don't use a guide for this game. Aside from spoiling the answers, you're also taking away the immersive qualities of this game. A lot of the detective work in this game could be considered dull, but that's usually how it goes in the real world. Often the evidence won't consist of something significant like a murder weapon or a fingerprint. In any case, since you're essentially working to solve this mystery in a single night, you won't have access to a bunch of CSI gadgets. All you really can do is think about what everyone tells you, and weed out the red herrings.\n\nThis game was made on a budget of 3,000 pounds. 3,000! The more I think about it the crazier it sounds. Some of the voice recordings sound a little off, and the "night" scenes were filmed in the day-time, but otherwise there's nothing that really stuck out as cheaply done. The acting is fine as well, though you're liable to remember Rupert Booth's (Jenks) 1,001 facial expressions most of all. He makes even the most banal scenes amusing.\n\nDefinitely give this game a look, especially if it's already in your library.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","23","24","4","1"

I think it's worth it for ten bucks.  Interesting concept and all.. However...  there are a few issues, and I'll try to keep it spoiler free.  1.  The main actor overacts like nobody I've ever seen.. wouldn't be bad if campy was what they were going for.. but nobody else in the game acts that way.  2. There are a couple loose ends at the finish.  Nothing too annoying.. but rather obvious (So wait.. but what about that guy? -  sort of thing) 3. For 99% of the story, you don't really feel like you're getting any closer to solving the mystery but are just randomly collecting miscellaneous clues, character backstory,  and factoids.  Then literally right at the end, the very last thing you do  - is get a Columbo confession out of someone - where the perp could literally avoid capture by just shrugging their shoulders and saying "Yeah I dunno,  that IS weird inspector." So rushed ending,  could have used more characters.  perhaps a more convenient clue system.  Some of the contradictions you have to find are maddeningly obtuse to find "I could have SWORN I asked that character about THAT".  But then I stayed up to 4am finishing it,  so you'll probably get value out of it nonetheless.","September 15, 2015","true","7.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PuerNoctis/recommended/373390/","PuerNoctis","PuerNoctis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PuerNoctis/","324 products in account","Personal Rating: 9/10\n\nGames with FMV (Full Motion Video) are very rare nowadays and had their peak during the 90s when 3D graphics weren't as elaborate as they are today. But they have a certain charm to them, just like watching an 'interactive movie' as such games are often described. You don't get that alot of that feeling with the artifical rendered characters and scenery anymore. With that said, being an adventure-enthusiast, it's quite a treat to see 'Contradiction' has found it's way onto the steam store.\n\nWhat is the game about? You play as a scotland yard officer investigating a supposed suicide in a small village in england. Many facts of the initial investigation didn't quite fit into the whole picture, that's the reason the player has until 12pm to find any evidence that proves that the victim did not kill itself, but that other circumstances where the cause of death. The game progresses one hour at a time, effectively dividing the game into several "chapters".\n\nWhat is the gameplay like? You navigate about the village through your cursor keys, and all the interactions with characters and the general shots of the locations are actually filmed by a film crew and actors. If you are of a somewhat older generation you can perfectly compare it to games like 'Gabriel Knight 2', 'Ripper' or the 'Phantasmagoria' series. A big part during your investigation includes interviewing several suspects and otherwise involved people in the case. This is the main component of the game, as you have to find contradictions to the statements a person has made throughout the game after you asked them about different topics. In general, whenever you found a contradiction you'll get new clues regarding your case or you get people to confess something to you that they have been hiding from youn earlier. Finding those contradictions basically moves you onto the next chapters of the game and is a meassure of progress so to speak. This goes on until you finished the game, and only occasionally you have to use 'items' in certain locations, so there is no complex inventory management or combining of objects of any kind.\n\nNoteworhty things:\n- The FMV is high quality and the actors are not as cheesy at you would expect them to be. Each actor has quite a unique personality to them and although it is understandable that they could not hire top stars from hollywood, the actors they have chosen do a good job in general.\n- The game becomes harder as you progress, since you have more and more topics and statements to speak about with each character you meet with every chapter you advance. This can get quite frustrating after some time but it actually helps to give you a more lasting experience. You have to pay very very good attention to everything everyone says.\n- There is no replayability, at least I don't think so.\n- A few contradicitons (about two or three) are quite tricky and can give you quite a headache since the important scenes for them can not be replayed anymore. You have to pay very close attention to what you see and hear as mentioned above.\n- The controls are quite awkward at first, but you get used to them quite quickly. Menu navigation is the most confusing part when you begin playing.\n- Everyone who has ever played FMV games knows that e.g. transitions between locations can be quite annoying if there are video sequences playing and you have to travel back and forth all the time. This game actually fascinated me in the way how smooth and well done such intermediate shots are integrated. I never felt that any cutscene, as short as they might have been, was annoying me at any time. Especially the intro/outro scenes of an interview.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game to anyone who likes adventure games, and for anyone that wants to play a good FMV this game is honestly a must. Very well done, good puzzles (in the sense of contradictions to be found) and a good amount of game-time for the asked price and considering the amount of work behind movie based games. Anyone not interested in adventure games may like the game if they are into TV crime series. Otherwise you probably won't enjoy it.\n\nI'd certainly like to see more!","July 14, 2015","true","10.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/373390/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","The CD-ROM era both birthed and killed the Full Motion Video game. While still in its crib, a generation-long curse was laid upon the genre, dooming all creations branded with the FMV tag to receive nothing but scorn and contempt in every village around the world. And to be honest, the reputation was wholly deserved.\n\nDecades later, hard drive space is now cheap and the codecs plentiful. The creators also seem wiser this time around, focusing on small and intimate, non-branching storylines and cutting the flashy sizzle reel tricks and animations altogether.\n\nContradiction is, like other recent FMV games such as Her Story and Tesla Effect, a detective mystery: A girl has been found dead in a small rural British town. You play as Inspector Jenks who's been sent to investigate, mostly interviewing the residents about the incident and doing some minor inventory-based sleuthing.\n\nChats with people open up more points of discussion, and the idea is to find contradictions in the statements of the suspects. This is easier said than done, since the conversations always bring up dozens of possible subjects and pinpointing the slips of the tongue requires attention and thought. Just randomly trying things will get you nowhere.\n\nI was surprised at how engrossed in the game I got. The characters are intriguing and I have no major problems with the acting (Jenks himself can get a bit over the top on occasion, though). The setting and the plot are also atmospheric, with a lot of hints towards something truly sinister. The music properly sets the mood, and the village itself is visually a rather charmingly beautiful little slice of English countryside.\n\nPacing around the town can get slightly frustrating if you get stuck, but the game has its own elegantly integrated hint system so you're never truly lost. The game is definitely no walk in the park either, so expect your little grey cells to get an outing they probably deserve in this day and age.\n\nThe only downside of Contradiction is that you can sometimes see a few corners cut where budget limitations apparently came into play, however, cheapo after effects are blessedly kept to a minimum. Biggest bummer is that some of the major story strands are never brought into conclusion after the case is cracked, but are left to be resolved in a potential sequel.\n\nAnyhow, this is FMV gaming done right. I finished the game in one nine-hour sitting and had fun the whole time. That's more than I can say for most games, FMV or not.","July 13, 2015","true","9.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Everything is saturated with style and charm, including the main character. Your job is to guide our detective as he interviews and gathers clues in this seemingly dickensian like village. Of course not everything is at it appears and it up to you to unravel the mystery. Being a FMV(Full-Motion Video) game, Contradiction is completely based off its acting. Which it does exquisitely. The mechanics of the game while very simple, are complimented by the clever writing and eerie atmosphere. As hours go by in the game, more of the story is slowly revealed to you and the plot thickens. The contradiction system in the game has you matching statements and clues, trying to catch suspects in a lie. This isn't easy in the least but there are helpful hint systems in place if you do get stuck. While many will compare this with Her Story, this is a completely different experience. You are far more involved and progress is completely based on your keen senses of listening and deduction. There are times that Contradiction can feel a little cheesy but that all plays into the genre of the game. So get your thinking cap on, its time to solve some delicious murder!!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/YLxD7ZGppJM\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 20, 2015","true","6.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","4"

I do enjoy adventure games and the nostalgia of FMV, so I'm a little biased.  I thought the dialogue got the job done, and the acting (ranging from campy to outright ridiculous \m/̷  ) certainly sold it to me.  There isn't much in terms of gameplay beyond cycling through dialogue regarding evidence and notes you happen upon in your adventuring while weighing potential contradictions, but I think the minimalism of this approach works in the game's favor.  It's refreshing to enjoy an FMV game that isn't too cumbersome about gameplay for this price! While I was a little mixed about the ending, I'm okay with it being an issue of time and budget on the developer's end, I still think the overall package presented of Contradiction is awesome and I'm definitely left wanting for a sequel.\n\nBy the way (this is a bit of a tangent), if people liked the darker undertones of this and was looking for something even more graphic and unsettling while being open to the prospect of digging up a visual novel, Kara no Shoujo is probably my all time favorite among murder mysteries across gaming media.  Higurashi is also up there if you're big on a heavy read, and that is on Steam! I was sort of expecting some super dark twists out of Contradiction considering the age gate, but it doesn't quite get there. For those familiar with FMV games of yore, it is certainly no Phantasmagoria in graphic content; Contradiction is quite tame! Still, it did do an excellent job in satiating my FMV murder mystery hunger.  Speaking of FMV murder myster hunger with respect to Contradiction, however, I'll certainly be hungry for a sequel!\n\n\m/̷","July 20, 2015","true","7.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","12","12","5","0"

Apparently it was a Kickstarter game that somehow passed by my radar and it’s headed by Tim Follin, the composer for games like Plok and New Zealand Story. It’s actually been out on iOS for a couple of months as well but I didn’t know that either. After having completed Her Story when it came out and loving it I was up for another FMV detective game and Contradiction didn’t disappoint.\n\nUnlike Her Story which took its own unique approach, Contradiction is very much like a traditional 90’s FMV adventure game only upgraded to the HD age. The primary gameplay is finding evidence and then using that evidence to find contradictions between a person’s statements, it’s a bit like Phoenix Wright in execution. The game is never truly obtuse either, I beat the game with no hints. It’s clear that it was meant for mobile first because you only use the keyboard and not the mouse, and it’s a bit clunky at first, but you get used to it fairly quick. The game is pretty low budget and it shows in that there’s not many varied locations and the like but they also worked really well within in these constraints because its real quality, the FMV is very clear, its shot well, and the game is really atmospheric. The acting is quite solid and the protagonist, Inspector Jenks, is a ham but in a likable way. The mystery is entertaining too, though it’s not really complex and there’s never any real “Holy sh*t” moments or the like, but it will definitely keep you engaged.

Gameplay consists of finding evidence, interrogating suspects, and, in the event they contradict themselves, or lie, Calling them Pinnocchio as their nose grows. (The nose doesn't really grow). The further into the game you get, the more evidence you get, making it more difficult to find a contradiction, as you pick through the different topics (Something you WILL have to do), that is, unless you're Sherlock Holmes, in which case you'll have no troubles at all.\n\nThe acting in this is is superb, It really feels like a good detective movie. While there are a few instances of the actors hamming it up, it never really takes you out of the experience. The writing is great as well, the more information you get, the more you, the player, will actually start to speculate "Whudunnit", as it were.\n\nAs for the contradictions, Most of them make perfect sense, but there are one or two that, for me, feel like a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe audio is great, you'll hear the crunching of footsteps as Jenks walks around, the relaxing sound of the wind, and even the ticking of a clock in the background of some scenes. I wish I knew where this was filmed, because the scenery is really very good, it's one of those places that you want to visit on vacation.\n\nI'd say this game is a reccomended purchase for anyone who loves a good mystery, and my personal rating is a 9/10 on the whole thing.\n\nHope this was helpful!!","October 11, 2015","true","6.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Everything is HD and the audio quality is good, but they do just slap a colour filter on some scenes to make it seem later in the day. A small detail but I found it a bit odd.\n\nThe acting varies from great to being a bit campy. Overall I didn't mind but the main character, Inspector Jenks, did come across as too 'happy' or 'nice' when he is supposed to be investigating suspects in a murder case. Paul Darrow as Paul Rand was superb though.\n\nMy two biggest complaints are that you can't actually get the wrong person and the inventory is a bit of a mess.\n\nYou progress through the investigation 'one hour' at a time and are supposed to solve it before midnight. But time only passes when you reach a certain point in the story and confront a character with contradictions in their statements. Until then time doesn't pass in-game, so the time limit is a bit arbitrary. You also can't fail, something which would have been interesting but is not explored at all and would have added some replay value.\n\nThe 'inventory' is cluttered, including items (screwdriver, torch etc.) as well as evidence to present to suspects and statements to ask them about. But when you are interrogating someone you are given a list with all of them in, even things you can't actually speak to them about and items that you only use once in the story. They are colour coded but I think that splitting them up would make a lot more sense and make the questioning sections a little more streamlined.\n\nIt's a decent enough story, they set up/tease the possibility of a sequel which could be good. It doesn't have ridiculously tedious adventure game style puzzles but still makes you pay attention to what is going on. Overall I would recommend the game to mystery and point-and-click fans who want something a little different.","April 23","true","5.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The acting was great, the story was interesting, the puzzles made sense. The central mechanic of finding inconsistencies in people’s stories works pretty well. It’s so much more enjoyable than QTEs, minigames or the typical adventure game thing of collecting random items and combining them in weird ways.\n\nThe one thing I didn’t like is the way you have to keep revisiting the same locations over and over again just to see if anything has changed. This repetitive process pads out the length of the game considerably.\n\nTwo of the hardest contradictions to spot (for me) were at the very end of the game, so I’d say it’s pretty well balanced difficulty-wise. By the way, if you do get badly stuck, but don’t want to cheat, I’d recommend rewatching the cutscenes: at least two of the contradictions rely on remembering minor details you could have easily forgotten about if you’re not playing the game in one sitting.","January 6","true","11.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

Since I love detective games and tv-shows I decided to give this one a go. This is a lovecrafted masterpiece, great from start to finish. I'm gonna try to explain why.\n\nYou play as detective Jenks, investigating a girls suicide in an english village. Mysteries surrounding the suicide quickly leads to a murder investigation. Jenks only have a day to solve the mystery. He quickly finds out about a private school for adults called Atlas that uses some questionable methods, and you learn more and more as you go. Every chapter is an hour in the game, but every chapter took me more then an hour each. It's a pretty tricky game, but you can use clues if you get stuck.\n\nYou interview people that live in the area and find clues. You look for contradiction, opposites, that a character has said and use that against him/her. It's very exciting and satisfying when you prove that someone is lying.The FMV is very nicely done, captured with HD cameras and different view-angles. They re-used a lot of footage for the enviroment and moving, but added filter to it once it got later at night, a quite smart technique actually. It's made by a small studio with limited resorces after all.\n\nJenks is very funny, and he really acts out. You will smile a lot during the dialougues. Don't get me wrong though, the voice actors did a great job. Most of the characters are very serious, so it's kinda nice that Jenks mixes it up a little with some humor. The best actor is the boss at Atlas, he is an old grumpy man with some great lines.\n\nYou can also find the FMV game on IMDB, if you want to see the list of actors. Score is at 8,9/10, which is a really high score, but I think Contradiction deserves it. I looked up some of the actors and they have been doing lots of movies and shows before. They feel believable which is of course important in a game like this. I could never figure out who the killer was until the end, and the plot was great.\n\nI won't spoil anything, but let me just say that the ending is kinda open for a sequel. Yes, you do get a satifying story from beginning to end, but there is some loose ends that scream for a sequel. Things that weren't investigated enough, characters that obviously had more to them. I looked at the forums and comments on the internet and it seems like everyone just wants more, a follow-up game. It really hope so too, because I really like these sorts of games.\n\nThere was some spooky moments in the game, or somewhat creepy at least. It added to the mystery in a nice way and it keept me playing until the end. The old english village with stone houses, lots of wierd things going on and with a bunch of intrigues between the characters just gave me that "murder in midsomer"-vibe. You know, that english tv-show about a chief inspector solving crimes. I really love that, cause I think england is a good place to film these sorts of detective FMV (full motion video) games.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with this game. It was different, and I love to combine two of my favorite things, crime detective drama and video games. I would recommend this game to anyone else interested in this sort of experience. I hope this game get the success needed to fund a sequel, because I really wish to find out more about the village, the characters and some of the unsolved mysteries. This experience is worth full asking price, no doubt.","June 6","true","15.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","2"

He knows how to frame shots, and in almost all of the "idle" screens I've seen, there's something moving without being distracting. This is notable because I haven't seen any compression artifacts, the video is always crisp and sharp whether there's movement or not. Everything looks fantastic. The dialogue is a bit tinny on occasion, but never during suspect interviews, and it's not even close to being distracting or inaudible. The game had a very small budget, and that's really the only time it shows, yet it's still not enough to be considered a detriment. His background in music also shines through, and I hope the soundtrack will be offered as DLC.\n\nI've played for about an hour and a half and according to the story's deadline - you have 7 hours to investigate, with time advancing an hour with each pre-defined major breakthrough - I've only advanced 2 of those 7 hours. The other 2 reviews up right now have 4.3 and 7.3 hours clocked, and based on that and my own personal rate of advancement, those two numbers seem like a fair estimated range of total time for a single playthrough.\n\nThe fullscreen option wasn't evident to me at first, but it works great and seamlessly (just press F). Gamepads are supported and don't quite feel right, but I'd prefer a mouse and keyboard for this type of game anyway and it is tagged as having only partial controller support, so it's fine. Also impressive is that this has cloud support, a nice bit of effort, and something games like Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition don't have.\n\nAlso of note: The hint system of calling back to police headquarters using a phone booth is great. I've been going through the game pretty quickly, but I'd love to play again later and hear all the hints for places where I wasn't stuck.\n\nIf you at all like FMV games, this won't disappoint. I'm not done with it yet, but having a ton of fun, and unless there's a sudden and drastic change in game mechanics or story, I would strongly recommend it to anybody interested.","July 11, 2015","true","7.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

You can only ever catch them on things they have said, not with evidence or statements from others.\n\nThe story revolves around a bit of a jolly weirdo detective who has been sent in to do a last minute re-investigation of a case that had been ruled a suicide.  He only has until the end of the day to work out what really happened, so he's going to be bothering the people of this small town continuously for the rest of the night.\n\nAs for the actual game:\nThe gameplay is about 80% talking, 10% "finding" items, and 10% running into people in the woods.  The acting ranges from "pretty hammy" to "extremely hammy", but I would rate that as a good thing, personally.  The interface isn't the best and the controls take some getting used to (don't even try to set up a controller on PC, it's essentially keyboard-only at the time of this writing), but once you stop hitting Escape hoping for a menu, it all works out.\n\nThe game is about 7-8 hours long, depending on how much time you spend thinking about what people have said, but does have a built-in hint and cheat system if you just want to move on.  I genuinely enjoyed it and hope they can find a way to making a sequel.

The characters have charm for days, and despite the game's limitations, it takes a very simple concept and a decently plotted murder mystery and makes it something special and most importantly entertaining.\n\nThe main mechanics of the game are investigating the area and interviewing each character multiple times and using their statements on the evidence provided to point out contradictions in their stories. That's really it. It's a more streamlined Phoenix Wright and the contradictions are clever enough to make you have to stop, think, and re-examine each statement to find inconsistencies. If you can't figure them out, there's no real penalty or fail state, so there's no real big deal if you end up stumped, and the game has a pretty good hint system to help out.\n\nUnless it just isn't your thing, it's really hard to not admire this silly little "from out of nowhere" game.  The intrigue of the murder mystery and the acting sell it and its solid set of investigative mechanics make it a solid package that overcomes its minor production flaws.","July 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The game has a novel problem solving engine which involves identifying contradictions in individual character statements.  The interface was a bit unusual, and took some time to get used to, but was also weirdly satisfying once the routines sunk in.  The story is compelling and the characters have the right balance of richness dimensionality for a story of this kind.  A couple complaints would be that the storyline itself has some small internal inconsistencies, which are not identified as contradictions within the gameplay.  This proved to be mildly frustrating at times.  The other complaint would be that the process of finding contradictions only took place character-by-character and not across characters (unless it happened to come up in that context).  This made the game more manageable as a puzzler, and still satisfying.  But there were times when characters would say contradictory things with respect to each other, and there was no way to cross examine suspects and access those kind of conversation threads.  Nevertheless, I strongly recommend it for those who enjoy neat, self-contained, story-driven mystery adventure games.","July 20, 2015","true","18.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Outside of Tex Murphy though few developers got it right. Contradiction brings back everything that was good about FMV gaming while avoiding most if not all of its negatives. For a low budget game this has very good acting and a fairly polished and easy to use interface. There is just something very appealing about getting to play the detective and this story has a lot of interesting clues and sub plots that keep you driving to a solution. The basic gameplay premise works very well. Collect clues, interview subjects and spot contradictions in their testimony. This is much more challenging than you would think as you end up with a large amount of testimony from several suspects throughout the 7 to 8 hour experience and finding the contradictions as you get towards the end can be very challenging. You also end up with a large number of red herrings that can distract you from what is important in the information you uncover. There are a couple of hint systems available in the game, but it's very satisfying to work through the testimony on your own to find the solution.\n\nPros:\nHD quality video and solid acting\nSmooth interface that is easy to navigate once you get the key commands down.\nBacktracking is helped by map that allows you to quickly return to locations\nVery interesting mystery that keeps you pushing towards the solution\n\nCons:\nAudio is a bit over compressed causing it to be tinny. Hopefully this is fixed in a later update.\nStory ends with many of the subplots unresolved, but open to a possible sequel.\nController support broken on Windows currently.\n\nYou will have to backtrack and speak to suspects over and over as you unlock more clues. This part does have some of the downsides of old 90’s games, but I enjoyed Inspector Jenks so much I didn’t mind and was willing to overlook this. Also, over the course of the many in game hours of interviews the suspects will mostly be in the same places. Drinks will stay the same level and suspects will stare into the same fireplaces. This can take you a bit out of the experience, but I’m sure all the dialog was recorded at the same time and this was necessary for the game design.\n\nOverall this is one of the best FMV and Mystery titles ever made and is quite the achievement on the very small budget the game was made with. I can only hope the game does well enough to make a sequel possible. Game is well worth the asking price.","July 12, 2015","true","7.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The game gets off to a slow start as you rapidly figure out the interface and game conventions, but the initial world to explore is quite small with only a couple of characters which the game slowly widens and adds to as you call out the characters on their lies.\n\nThe writing and acting are superb, which really helps bring you into the story, and the sense of achievement when you spot the contradictions is great because the script is intelligent and doesn't dumb things down. The quaint British village setting and the cult/occult storyline make you think of classic British TV.\n\nOnly real criticism so far is that sometimes the audio for the actors speaking is a touch distorted. This isn't enough to detract from the gameplay and more of the pointer to the producers so that when they make their next game (yes - this is more than good enough to warrant a number of sequels) they're able to improve on this aspect.

A bit, but not enough to preclude it being ludicrously delightful. I think it was intentional, as well. I enjoyed visiting, questioning and contradicting all of the different characters. There is a map which you can travel free form or jump from point to point.

I was a bit wary at first because I was afraid you wouldn't really be doing very much actual playing, but the contradictions are so fun to dig out and it always feels like an accomplishment to exult in when you catch someone in a lie.  It really is one of the best games I've played this year and it has left me satisfied but still wanting more.  I'm very excited to see a sequel.\n\nIt does have its weak points, but most mystery plots do.  You will find yourself yelling at characters to notice things that seem so obvious but they totally ignore.  But if it can happen to Sherlock I can forgive them a bit.  It did not take away from the enjoyment for me at all.\n\nThe acting is spot on.  If you like British television, especially their mysteries, or really any sort of whodunnit style entertainment then this will be right up your alley.  It has all the intrigue with a hint of the macabre lurking around every corner.  There are campy characters who you will find yourself laughing out loud at constantly and ones with such gravitas that you actually find yourself shrinking back in your seat in intimidation.\n\nSo yeah, this is well worth the $10 and the 6-8 hours of your time for a playthrough.  I would not say there is much in terms of replay value, but I did finish with 96% completion and am really curious to see what I missed.

Every aspect of the game struggles against its limited budget but that gives it some element of charm. I'm a huge fan of detective style games like Ace Attorney and Danganronpa but something about cracking the lies and contradictions wasn't as satisfying in Contradiction as in those titles.

The original generation of FMVs are a bit before my time, but I understand that the tech often didn't live up to the ambition. Well, that one's more area where grasp has now caught up to vision. The video works beautifully with well-chosen angles and smooth movement between shots. The characters are well-cast and well-rounded - it feels like an interactive BBC drama - and the contradiction game play works really well. The setting feels genuinely eerie and tense without being heavy-handed, and the ominous atmosphere only built as the sun went down (lovely touch, by the way). It's challenging enough to cause some head-scratching without becoming completely frustrating (see the Steam walkthrough if you need it - the cheats function doesn't appear to work). The game's plot kep me guessing, tying the main investigation up at the end while creating an intriguing world that I hope will be built upon in further installments.\n\nThere are a couple of things Pneuma could do to improve. Auto-playing the prologue video when the game starts would help set the scene for the player. As it is currently, you just land in front of the pub feeling a little confused. A run through of the controls at the start would also benefit the game. I was told to use the 'investigation' and the 'inventory' buttons by text boxes, however, there had been no explanation what these were ('s' and 'enter'). That said, there are control instructions on the Menu screen so it's easy enough to figure out. Going back to the Prologue Video, there's a fair bit of unnecessary exposition. In the next game I'd cut this down to scene-setting only and let the game do the rest of the work (which it does, very well). Last point, a couple of the scenes where Jenks attempts to assert his authority felt a little silly. A bit more research into police descalation techniques would help remedy this.\n\nAll of the above are just suggested improvements and don't detract from the fact that I enjoyed playing this game a lot. So much so, I completed it in a single sitting (lovely way to spend Sunday). I look forward to returning to the world of Contradiction and finding out more about the clandestine workings of the Atlas Institute.","July 13, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I think the biggest weaknesses were the sheer amount of back and forth; a staple of the genre, but seemed odd here, that people were happy for you to keep dropping in at any time of the evening and act like nothing had happened? I understand this will be required to a certain extent, and appreciate that the developers didn't have much to play with, but it just seemed a little odd.\n\nThe other is that sometimes the summaries of statements made by the characters seemed too similar. There was one particular point where I ended up using the "cheat" function because I was stumped, only to discover I had basically found the contradiction, I just hadn't combined the particular statements the game had expected. Though for the most part this wasn't a problem, and the amount of red herring statements was great actually, did give it some depth and difficulty, as well as fleshing out the characters.\n\nThe characters were pretty decent too, and the acting was actually really good, very cleverly done that it was hammed up the TINIEST bit, which lulled you into the tone and made it all much easier to take in.\n\nThe other main problem I had is that the final deduction you have to make to complete the game is reliant on you picking up on something you see only once (as far as I could tell) right at the beginning of the game. Now, to me, it stuck out like a sore thumb and I wanted to be able to follow up on it far sooner, so it was frustrating that it ended up being brought into it as the solution right at the end... however, if I hadn't noticed it then I would have been tearing my hair out trying to figure out what the game was getting at. This wouldn't have been so much of a problem if it was a mid-game puzzle, but as it was literally the final player action it left me underwhelmed.\n\nThe ending itself I liked though, although it left a lot of loose ends (which is explicitly acknowledged in the dialogue) it seemed believeable enough in the context of everything else, and the detective/police procedural TV shows that the game is obviously inspired by.\n\nI also loved the music and actually found the keyboard control scheme pretty good, once I'd gotten used to its quirks. The cinematography was great too, lovely colour grading on the day-for-night footage.\n\nI do hope that the game is a success and continues to get great reviews, because I would love to see what the team behind this could do with a bit more scope and budget. Something with more varied locations, and perhaps even multiple cases? Maybe this isn't viable, but I would be more than happy to pay £30 for a sequel with 20-30hrs content spread over four cases with subtle links, like the Ace Attourney games. But even if that doesn't come to fruition, I immensely enjoyed my 6 hours with Contradiction, great value at £6.99 for the effort that's gone into the production.","August 10, 2015","true","12.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That said, I jumped at the chance to play through Contradiction, an adventure game with a bit of a twist on the traditional formula -- there's actually no "point and click". The character you control, Inspector Jenks, is controlled entirely via a few keyboard keys. Furthermore, the vast majority of puzzles are dialogue-driven (spotting contradictions in the statements of Edenton village's residents). There are few inventory-based puzzles, but the use of inventory items is very simplified, so just a heads up in case you were expecting more traditional adventure game elements such as combining inventory items.\n\nThis different take on adventure gaming is refreshing, and I found myself growing to like Jenks' character quite a lot, as he charmingly asks questions regarding the suspicious death of a university student, Kate Vine. Afternoon turns to evening as Jenks' investigation progresses, and I loved how the atmosphere got a bit more suspenseful as time went on. It's the "little things" that demonstrated so much attention to detail that impressed me -- for example, as Jenks walks past a bush, its leaves rustle in the wind, showing us that as night approaches, things are getting a bit more eery. The camera-work in this adventure game is excellent, as is the music soundtrack. The acting overall isn't bad, and I was very happy with the game interface. I particularly enjoyed being able to fast-travel to hotspots within the village via the map (the "d" key by default), as well as the handy built-in hint system, accessed via "a". The hint system gives the player a gentle nudge in the right direction without any spoilers, and it was a very cool thing to see.\n\nWhile I could go on about the many things I enjoyed about Contradiction, I want to stress that I don't think the actual storyline was of a very high standard. I've written a bit more about my opinion on the storyline at the end of the review, underneath a MINOR SPOILER warning.\n\nTLDR; I recommend this game, but with reservations. The actual dialogue-driven puzzle-solving is excellent, as is the general atmosphere (to include cinematography and music). However, I think the storyline gets more and more ridiculous as Jenks' evening progresses, to the point where there really is no cohesion in storytelling (in my opinion).\n\nMINOR SPOILER REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION SUBJECT MATTER BELOW:\n\nAs Jenks' delves deeper into Kate's mysterious death, he stumbles upon the subject matters of hallucinogens, paganism, business ethics, mind control, AND satanism. I felt like in the later stages of the game, writer Tim Follin just threw in whatever seemed "taboo" into the plot, to the point where the story becomes a bit of a disjointed mess.","July 20, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Then the media quality is good as well, since videos are in full HD. Characters are just awesome: they could literally be all killers and that's what makes the plot interesting, since it's really hard to understand what happened until the very end.\n\nI have to admit that sometimes the game is a bit repetitive, especially in the mid-part of the story: if you are not particularly expert in puzzle games, you'll most likely end up stuck in a boring loop of: find a clue-talk to everybody- find a clue - talk to everybody -and so on.

The end.\n\nOkay, so without giving anything away, the game is mostly about listening to suspect interviews and trying to find contradictory statements.  There is minimal use of the traditional adventure item inventory. If you have no interest in the backtracking, reviewing conversations, or getting stuck that is typical of the last 30 years of adventure gaming, stop reading, because this game won't convince you to like those things.\n\nHowever, if you are still reading, there are only two questions worth considering for whether you should play this game.  Is the acting too cheesy to tolerate, and does it play well as an adventure? As for the acting, I enjoyed it.  The casting is good, the voices are good, and only the main character (the inspector you play) is heavily overacting, but in the most endearing way possible.  Of course realize that I am predisposed to enjoy the genuine British accents and setting, so without that bias, you may not fall as heavily in love with these actors as I did.  You've got some believable ladies, and several appropriately disturbing gentlemen, one of whom stands by a mantelpiece and channels a smarmy Tim Curry while the other sits in a comfy chair and does a condescending Ian McDiarmid.\n\nAs for gameplay, I was able to finish (and 100% the game with no cheats) in a couple of days amounting to maybe seven or eight hours without ever getting maddeningly stuck.  Regarding gameplay, here's my breakdown.\n\nThe so-so:\n\nYou backtrack a lot.\nThere aren't many locations and only a handful of items of very limited use.\nDue to the nature of the writing, you will think of tons of connections that you can't inquire about.\nYou can only get further info on contradictions (see the name) and no other connections.\nYou can't inquire about statements from two different characters that contradict each other, only the self-contradictory statements.\nThe scenes aren't really reshot for different times, just put through a blue filter for darkness (wait, that's not a gameplay element).\nThere are typos.\n\nThe good:\n\nNone of the contradictions are impossible to spot, but only a few are totally obvious.\nIt's satisfying to find a contradiction because you noticed something visual in the scene that isn't really stated in the summaries you choose from. The statements that act as inventory items are helpful enough, but a keen eye helps too.\nThere are options for hints and cheats, although I didn't use them.\nCalls to the police chief serve to summarize where you stand in the case without acting as cheats.\nThere is no lore-reading necessary.  All of the story is fully acted out or recounted through live interviews.\nThe feeling of progress is extremely satisfying, and the advancing of hours acts as milestones.\nThere are red herrings everywhere, which creates a believable atmosphere, fully fleshed out.\n\nI've played a lot of adventure games since the 80s, and I think you should play this one, even at full price.","December 14, 2015","true","9.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not usually into point and click adventures but this FMV (full motion video) game feels like a sleeper hit. This was a kickstarter game from a small but enthusiastic studio. You can tell they put a lot of time into this. The characters each have their own personality and the acting is better than most indie games. The story feels rushed/iffy at times but overall it's enjoyable.\n\nThis was fun to play from the couch using the steam controller, there is a nice profile someone created or you can just use the built-in mouse emulation feature of the controller.\n\nThe save system is a bit quirky--if you choose "Save and exit" next time you start it will look like it is showing 0% progress, just click "Resume" and it will usually put you back where you were. It's safer to manually choose "Save 1" or "Save 2" before exiting the game and then manually load your save by selecting "Load 1" or "Load 2" the next time you start.","January 18","true","6.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

You play as Jenks, a detective sent to a small town to investigate the death of a young student in a small town that's a little strange. The game has clear influences like Twin Peaks and the Wicker Man, but manages to carve out its' own identity. You'll be going around largely to talk to the cast of about 7ish people, and finding their stories when it comes to pieces of evidence and various other things. There are some light "adventure game" puzzles to solve with inventory items but they are fairly simplistic. The meat of the game lies in the dialogue system, as you hear their tales and catch them in their lies, spotting the titular contradicitons. It is somehwat like Phoenix Wright in that way.\n\nJenks is a very fun lead character. At first he seemed a bit over the top but I soon got into his zest for needling suspects for answers. For the most part the cast does well outside him too, particularly the imposing actor playing Paul. My only complaint would be the PC controls just aren't that great. The default keybinds are a little goofy and while you can rebind them, for some reason the game would forget them everytime I closed the game. You can't use the mouse for much more than clicking locations too.\n\nEasily worth the asking price, and would love a sequel.","July 24, 2015","true","6.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You basically interview a few different people about a murder.  As you interview them you discover more information.  The goal of the game is to catch people in lies, which then advances the game's progress and reveals more clues.  Eventually you solve the case.\n\nEarly on the game is a bit of a slow burner and finding contradictions can be a bit tedious.  But as more characters and information becomes available, the game hits it's stride.\n\nUnfortunately there are are few instances where you will spot an obvious contradiction but the game won't recognize it.  Additionally, you'll become stuck at some points because the only way to progress is to go to some secluded spot on the map that you've already visited and would have no reason to visit again.  Fortunately there are hints and even cheats that you can access if you become stuck but this takes away from the immersion.\n\nThe acting is good in most cases, although the main actor Inspector Jenks seems to "over act" much of the time.  For example... he'll be interviewing a witness and pull out a simple driver's license and say, "What do you know about.... THIS!" and hold the driver's license up as if it's a smoking gun of evidence, then the witness will dully say, "Um, I don't know anything about that, why would I?"  So there seems to be a dissonance in the acting and in the overall "mood" of the conversation, although Jenks' wonky personality does lend some color to the conversation as well.\n\nAnyhow, definitely worth $10 if you enjoy this sort of game and I look forward to the sequel.","July 15, 2015","true","12.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/373390/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: Buy this excellent detective adventure game so that we can have more!\n\nFull motion video (FMV) game, huh? That's a blast from the past, this one funded by a kickstarter of mere 4000 £. There were many FMV games in the 90s though I only remember playing Terra Nova and Command & Conquer franchise with their acted interludes. One problem with them was the huge space and computing power requirements of video and it still looked pretty bad. Large-volume hard discs, speedy downloads and technological advances in computation make those problems go away and you are left with problems of writing, acting, shooting and editing. This being a game, the gameplay is also important. So how're those things holding up for Contradiction?\n\nIn the game you are a police investigator. Remember all those detective stories they show reruns of in the afternoons? This is like a single, long episode of that, with you doing the actual deducing and detective work. Well, you embodying the detective of stereotypical looks, Mr. Jenks. He has been sent to check this little Twin Peaksy town somewhere in England (I presume), because someone there has died under suspicious circumstances involving a suicide claim, a creepy business school and alcohol.\n\nOur protagonist seems to be a tad old-fashioned, as he goes around asking questions and generally snooping around the town. The main game mechanism is to review the statements people give you and then call any contradictions you might find in their answers. Now let me say it: this is the coolest aspect of the game! We had tremendous amount of fun and frustration alike trying to spot the one or two contradictions in the rather large amount of statements. Some of them are dead obvious, while others are sneaky as a still animal in a forest: hiding in plain sight but hidden by the vegetation. Sometimes you even have to listen their statements again to get that piece of missing information.\n\nSpeaking of forest again, this broke us to a small inside joke that I'll give out here as a tip: if you don't know what to do, go to the woods because random ♥♥♥♥ happens in the woods and sometimes that's the only way to go forward. This is because to ask questions you got to have questions and you could find additional evidence in all kinds of places. In addition to exploration the progression sometimes involves minor puzzle solving like using items in correct places but nothing fancier than that.\n\nStory is all paced through one busy evening, during which you meet the quirky locals: various students, misfits and businessmen and -women. Everyone seems to know more than they are letting out. Acting is nice despite the actors being fairly unknown. Editing has been done very well, movement between places by video feels fluid and quite natural. I am not totally sure if Mr. Jenks' actor was taking it seriously though as his actor could be described as rather "expressive": he was making surprised and curious faces all the time, which was frankly pretty hilarious and actually fits the quirky detective-type.\n\nThere are four minor flaws I must bring to attention. The most serious one is perhaps the user interface. To be honest it isn't that bad once you get used to it, but when you start playing it can be confusing. Walking around map and asking questions is easy enough (just using arrow keys and Enter), but there are three special buttons that are at default mapped to 'A' (menu key), 'D' and 'S'. Especially the menu key is weird, as 'Esc' would be the logical one. For all I know these issues could and hopefully will be addressed in the future. For example, when we played it there was no mouse support yet but it's being implemented bit by bit as you read.\n\nThe other minor qualm is the lack of Steam Overlay (so you can't take screenshots in the regular Steam-fashion). Also for some reason the unlocked contradictions and event videos have been hidden in the main menu instead of, for example, a log book or similar that would feel more logical or authentic. Finally, in the outdoor areas there were occasional green screens, a flicker of sorts, like the video was "cut" and suddenly restarted. This was a minor annoyance but might be an issue of editing or perhaps my rig.\n\nNow, an observant reader will have noticed me referring to "us" multiple times. We would play this with my wife every evening for several days and she would anxiously wait for me from work so that we could continue the game, unusual as normally she'd just play or watch whatever: I deduce she really enjoyed it. It took us 18 hours to finish the whole story (which is actually just a few hours long) and we enjoyed it thoroughly, only having a couple of frustrating moments when we were stuck at some part of the story.\n\nContradiction was a very nice experience and it stayed exciting throughout. We bought it at full price of 10 euros, which in my opinion was cheap for this game: I would have happily paid at least 15 or 20 euros for this. Here's for hoping it succeeds and gets a sequel!","July 29, 2015","true","18.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/recommended/373390/","dinoracha","Dinoracha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/","426 products in account","FMV games are an unknown territory for me as a genre, especially since my younger self did not have access to them during the phase of its fad-like popularity. Looking at previous titles however makes me wonder if it truly was ever popular, as many FMV titles seemed to be all about the technology and visual wow factor rather than the gameplay or story-telling aspects. Contradiction must be familiar with this trend as it shirks the all style, shallow substance method, and instead brings an engaging story with a varied, likable cast who’s performances only add to the experience as you progress along the game... Even if most of said performances are outright the most bizarre, silly examples of acting I’ve ever seen. (It’s a good thing, really.)\n\nContradiction is set entirely within and around the limits of the sleepy British village of Edenton, and has the player character, Inspector Jenks, investigating the apparent suicide of a resident. There’s a pseudo time limit to complete the case, but each passing hour acts like a chapter, rather than pressure to hustle you along. Being an adventure game, hopping around the different areas will reveal potential clues to pick up, events revealing new characters, or more information on your current suspects once your leads have run dry. Jenks’ journal at first has only a handful of clues and subjects, but getting your gumshoe on will eventually have a plethora of possible lines of questioning (and a few red herrings, to be expected) to use on people of interest. Most of your time will be spent interviewing the various Edenton residents with said collection of clues, and unlocking more subjects in the process. This is where Contradiction’s gameplay lies, as you might expect in a game based on police investigation, people end up lying or trying to mislead you, and Jenks must use their testimony against them by taking two statements to reveal a titular contradiction, and break the witness’ lie to get the truth - Or more fibbing. Rinse and repeat until the game is over. While this sounds like it would become mighty old in a mighty hurry, the actors and their performances is what keeps the game engaging right to the closing credits... Not because of sheer brilliance that should be reserved for Broadway, but because of the sheer campy, humorous way in which things take place.\n\nI wonder if the director is secretly a mad genius, since the acting can get so silly at times yet remain so believable that it’s both comical and interesting how characters won’t react or call out each others quirks, save for moments of intense emotion. I will confess my expertise on live action acting is severely lacking in order for me to truly explain performances, but look up some videos and you’ll begin to understand what I mean. The way Simon (Magnus Sinding) seems to act sketchy and suspicious after nearly every question he answers, the way Rebecca (Melanie Gray) hardly budges in her seat and speaks like she is in ownership of an evil spy empire, how Ryan (John Guilor) cannot help but speak and gesture like he is always trying to impress, and his posh-ness makes it impossible not to giggle at him constantly. And of course there’s Jenks (Rupert Booth), who’s wild eyes, head bobs and expressions make me wonder if it’s a police tactic to seem a bit weird in order to lower the guard of witnesses. I am certain that if the actors played the script straight and with the severity that the story had, this would be a much tamer if not duller experience. The campy acting may not be for everyone, but I can only applaud the actors and director for allowing the goofiness to run rampant and free, entertaining the player more for it.\n\nAfter the praises I have previously sung, my complaints against Contradiction are quite minor, and are generally tied to the menus. At some point, you will end up with a lot of clues and subjects to sift through, which can be an annoyance when looking for two specific statements to use as contradiction fodder. You’re given a master list of testimony to thumb through everyone’s answers regarding a certain clue which is nice and all, but the game follows a very tight script on what is and is not a contradiction, and the script doesn’t budge for lesser lies. Things that should feel contradictory are ignored, as the game only wants the big, apparent lies to be revealed to keep the intrigue and story going. Still, it’s quite satisfying when Jenks finds a contradiction, as he goes from generally friendly and approachable to snarky, sarcastic and borderline demeaning once he catches someone in a lie, and watching the witness squirm is only icing on that cake.\n\nI like Contradiction a whole bunch. The acting is wonderfully nutty, the story is dark yet becomes very engaging as more is revealed regarding the secrets of Atlas and the skeletons in everyone’s closets, and one can see their way to the end in about five or six hours. I can give it a hearty recommendation for anyone looking for a story driven adventure game, but those who want a seriously written script may want to look elsewhere.","August 20, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The acting is entertaining to watch, especially later on as the characters get more rattled by inspector Jenks.\n\nHowever there are a few things that I didn't like. For one you only have the option to skip some of the longer scenes. Now since the game has zero replayability this won't be a problem for most people. But if you need to play the game again to get all the achievements, or as in my case, you have a cat who somehow manage to reset your game when you have reached 70% completion and therefor have to start from scratch....well it would have been a nice feature at times. The game itself isn't too long and it does end with several things unresolved, but there might be a sequel to fix this.\n\nAlso I can't help feeling that the ending was a bit rushed and didn't really make all that much sense. And by that I mean you will most likely end up going "Wtf game!? I noticed that detail much earlier, but you didn't allow me to do anything with it!" And despite wondering if maybe the good inspector should be demoted it was a very enjoyable ride. (Seriously though....he doesn't use gloves when handling evidence, nor does he keep evidence bags at his disposal)\n\nIn the end I would say try the game if you enjoy murder mysteries, but you might want to wait until it's on sale since you most likely will only play this game once.","September 22, 2015","true","9.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It definitely had that old school point and click vibe going on, but mostly I was reminded of Phoenix Wright. The investigation segments, and of course the interviews were a lot like cross examining a witness, listening to their statements and presenting them with evidence to the contrary. The story is fascinating. There's so much going on in that small town, this game barely scratches the surface. The acting is pretty good. Paul Rand is spot-on as a cold, methodical character. Inspector Jenks is a clever guy. Everyone settles into their role well, giving the game a good feel.\n\nThe soundtrack was good. It was never too invasive, and during some of the interview segments it really served to puncutate statements well. Visually, it's all live action. Some people might gripe that later on in the game as it gets close to midnight, it's really not as dark as it should be outside, but I would argue that what they chose to do for those times is better because you can actually see what's going on, something that I imagine would have been much harder had they filmed at night.\n\nI'd like to see this game get a sequel.

For a small budge game they really did an amazing job with it. The entire time we were playing he kept saying that they should make a series out of it. I 100% agree with him. If they make a sequal, I will gladly keep throwing my money at them.\n\nIf you're on the fence about getting the game, do it. The 10 dollars is 100% worth it in my opinion. I wouldn't say the game has a lot of replay value unless you bring a friend in and play along with them, but I don't think that deminishes the value of the game in the least. Hopefully, the game will get enough attention and enough fans that they will make another game.","September 17, 2015","true","8.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I expected that with such clear options to choose from it would be easy to find the answers, but it really gave me a lot of excellent "AHA!" -moments when I figured out what the solution was.\n\nThe one thing that really bothered me about the game was how some scenes seemed to be accessible for a long time with very little to do in them, and then certain events only happened when visiting some scenes. I was constantly re-visiting all the locations with no clear reason, just to make sure I found any events in seemingly random locations.\n\nI can definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys any kind of mysteries and adventure games, or is looking for an unique story experience.","March 6","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The story itself started out interesting enough to catch my interest, and the further we dove into it the better it got. The acting was awkward and cheesy, which you're either going to love or hate. Personally I enjoyed it, it was all very charming.\n\nThe actual gameplay was interesting, but could get frustrating. Towards the end of the game I felt the clues and category of clues got a bit much, and could make it difficult to find specific statements to make a contradiction with. The difficulty was spot on for me. We had some frustrating moments in the beginning, trying to find the contradiction, but in the end it felt fair and just right. Unlike other people, I'm glad the game had no QTEs or other gameplay features tacked on to provide more involvement for the player.\n\nThe mystery was very captivating, and if there was anything this game lacked it was tying together a few more loose ends. While you do end up solving the objective of the game, it leaves you with many more questions than when you started the game. If we do end up getting a sequel for this game, I will without a doubt buy it and play it.\n\nIf you enjoy FMV games, mystery solving, or just want to kick back with a laid back story I would definitely recommend it.

What the game has doene well is provide a very subtle mystery. You play as a Detective who has 7 hours to solve a mystery at a small village. The acting for the most part is really good with one actor who I recognised, which was Paul Darrow or Avon from Blakes 7 (Yes i was doing lawmakers, lawbreaker let's fight them all why not?) However the main actor who is good seems to be a invovled with the game and the things going on. I did like the FMV settings and also the sotries you elarn about. However i would love a bigger game with more stuff and longer as I beat this inside 7 hours now I would not get a refund however there are some people who would.

The acting is SUPERB, rivalling a solid BBC whodunnit. Rupert Booth as Jenks was excellent, oozing charm and wit. (And THE CAMP. Oh my lord, the CAMP. When Jenks turns to each suspect in turn and flourishes his hand into the "devil sign" asking people if they know "WHAT THIS MEANS", in ever more over the top ways, I near fell over laughing.) Paul Darrow as Paul was incredible as well, with his tongue flicks and delightful inflections at the end of select, tasty words. The rest of the cast was excellent as well! (Shout out to James, that ol' rogue. What a character he was.)\n\nThe writing was top notch, with believable dialogue and realistic fast paced storyline. Solid mystery whodunnit with multiple believable suspects, and an overarching mysterious setting.\n\nThe actual main/inventive game mechanic of "Contradiction", of catching the statements that don't line up - to piece together the mystery, is unlike anything I've played in this genre. Quite fun, challenging, and enjoyable. Also, very much enjoyed how the map/world unfolded as you progressed through the game, each area unlocking as the night progressed.\n\nThe score was tremendous, weaving in an out mid-FMV scene, and as the mystery started unfolding. VERY seamless.\n\nThe only 2 minor gripes I had were, A) the control scheme at default on PC was a bit wonky, compared to the standard for this genre, but the keys are all customizable, so it's fine. Wish there was some actual use for the mouse as input though. Would have loved a bit more challenge looking for the clues.\nB) At times the audio seemed inconsistent and muffled. Different interrogation locations, had a different tone to their recording. After a little while I got used to it, but for a game with as EXTREMELY high production values as this, I just felt it to be a bit jarring.\n\nStill, if you have ever felt the joy or love of a good whodunnit, in ANY form, be it BBC dramas or video games like the Sherlock Holmes or "The Raven" series, you will CERTAINLY enjoy this. You will be wrapped up in the story, obsessively trying to find the culprit and come to the ending, and enjoying it all the while.\n\nAlso, check this link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzQFPkAerfw) out at 7 minute mark: One of the actors, Paul Guilor (played Ryan) explained that he thought it was important to ham the acting up and advised Rupert Booth (Jenks) to do so as well. Otherwise the dialogue is just "functional" technical stuff in many places. SO happy they went that direction.","July 22, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

THE FOOL!\nThe characters were a strong point for the game, even if the acting sometimes fell short. Jenks was intelligent, calm and occasionally humorous. The rest of the cast appeared to have depth and real individual personalitles.\nAt times it was a little frustrating as information i wanted to further investigate was brushed aside immediately after it was revealed. I also took exception to not being able to ask certain questions to avoid upsetting a character, i couldnt imagine a real detective sparing the feelings of possible suspects while attemepting to solve a possible murder.\nThere were times that you would notice a contradiction between two characters but be unable to follow that obvious line of questioning. it was almost like them giving you vital clues but then shaking keys in front of your eyes as a distraction so you didnt solve the case too quick. It made the game feel as though you were looking for clues to progress the story and not looking for clues to solve the case. Kind of like being shown a giant tender steak cooked to perfection, with roasted vegetables and a small amount of mushroom gravy on the side but forcing you to eat multiple entrees made up of non delicious fillers, before sinking your teeth into that juicy rare steak.\n\nUsing the map as a fast travel can stagnate your progress as walking through certain areas at times will trigger events that you may otherwise not travel to. They regualrly feel unimportant to your progress.\nWithout revealing spoilers, the story couldve been rearranged in a fashion to make it fit together more smoothly instead of feeling like you've ignored vital pieces of information.\nI also feel that the game could have benefitted hugely from flashbacks.  I wouldve loved a chance to get to know the victim through story driven flashbacks as important  information was revealed. Maybe this was a budget issue for them and it was something they were just unable to include, which is understandable.\n\nIt was a fun FMV detective game. But some small adjustments couldve improved the immersion immensly. mainly the organisation of the story and how in the timeline you were given certain bits of information.\nIt really feels like they have opened some interesting oppurtunities if a second game was to be created.\n\nOverall it was an enjoyable game with potential to become a fun series, especially on the back of Inspector Jenks.\nWhile i do reccommend it, I do so hesitantly. I've attempted to explain what i found to be frustrating with the game and hopefully help you to make an informed decision before purchasing.","January 6","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And you’re the one who is willing to unveil the truth, and bring the justice to itself.\n\nThe game itself may look like very "simple" designed and uninteresting. However, the magic trick is: it turns the very simplest system into a quite brilliant and incredibly addicting experience to really play with. You need to think really hard as a detective in order to find the proofs against dishonest interviewees, and to read their answers again and again to solve the puzzle and uncover the truth.\n\nThey introduced a “Contradition System” to match 2 different answers from the same interviewee to reveal whether he/she is lying.  And the successful results  will make your progress go further.\n\nThe gameplay is very addicting (might result you can’t stop saying: “Yes! I did it!”). And yet, the price is highly competitive.\n\nPersonally, I think the price is fair, far beyond lots of AAA title games that sell twice expensive as this game is, with very forgettable storyline that only worth 1 playing through.\n\nContradiction is different, for its unique way of unfolding the crime mystery and the ultimate experience that precisely delivers to its audience. It’s certainly one of the fewest games that will make you remember it once for a while.  It is also one of the fewest games that I can seriously recommend and commented as “worth every penny you’ve just spent”.\n\nI write this review mainly because I saw none of my friends have already own this game, and would like to contribute a bit to the community. If you’d interested into crime puzzle solving games and would like to get yourself involved in a decent story, this is a gem for you.\n\nIt might be a bit silly to say so, since I am from England, and I’m often supportive to the video-game industry from homeland, because we want to see more people get involved in it and make the industry has a better future tomorrow. But even without this factor, I would still write this review simply for its magnificent content.\n\nI’ve completed this game twice so far, the 1st time for my own play-through, and the 2nd time to show it to a friend. While showing to him, I couldn’t finish the 1st chapter before he stopped me from playing and purchased it to enjoy it himself.\n\nAlso from the high percentage of the positive feedbacks you can also tell I am not lying.\n\nScarlet's Score: 8.6/10","September 2, 2015","true","18.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Except when it doesn't... at least 1 instance of the game requiring you to match 2 statements that don't explicitely contradict each other, unless you expect the detective to add information he witnessed (which he never does except in this instance). Basically, the game doesn't follow its own rules.\n\nAlso, the game has the defect of all old-style point and clicks: you have to click exactly what the programmer thought was the right solution, in the order (mostly) the programmer thought was good for the narrative. Therefore, expect to be frustrated by the game not letting you make obvious connections simply because you're not clicking the exact 2 statements that can trigger the next event. (possibly because you haven't roamed aimlessly through the unskippable mini cut-scenes between each game-board tile in order to hope and find a random event and a new clue)\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, I recorder 2 instances of the game storing a "corrected statement" of one of the "suspects" in a unexpected place, forcing me to search for them in random discussion menus.\n\nIn short, this game comes from a good idea, but is 2x longer than it should be, and not executed as well as it should.

This is irritating, but in every case I was able to either replay a video and then the controls would come back, navigate away using the map button, or exit and start again. So yes, it's annoying, but it's not a game-killer.\nI liked the method of the blue filter to make things feel more like night time as the game progressed. It would have been good to have something similar inside, though - it was a bit strange with some midnight scenes being shot in daylight.\nThose are really minor, minor things though. Just tips for improvement on the next one.\nVery good game with an original, Midsomer Murders (or "Barnaby" in Europe) style. Love it!","October 25, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the same with the actors too, none of them are perfect, but that makes the experience more down-to-earth and real feeling. Almost like  a classic comedy sitcom like friends or BigBang Theory, it's not really believable, but its so..real that you still find yourself getting emotionally involved with the characters.\n\nThe game does have flaws, it gets slightly tedious watching the same 3 second peice of film 983749623642364234 times whenever you go back to a place you've visted before... and this must also of been filmed in alaska as it's still daylight at midnight. But i put this purely down to the budget, and hopefully..... if you all take my advice, and buy this excellent game, that will change for the promised sequel.\n\nIn short, it's excellent! and on such a tiny budget i would love to see what these developers could do with more money, so.. buy it, try it, and I promise you.. you won't be dissapointed.","November 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a quick but highly engrossing game with plenty of Christie-style twists and turns that should keep any player interested from start to finish.\n\nAll game play is HD full motion video with real actors.  This is part of the "experimental" aspect of the game.  The idea is that the player is interacting with a short movie, or possibly a TV show, on a fundamental level.  While I feel like the game missed that intended mark, the FMV added charm and personality to the game that traditional CG graphics wouldn't have achieved.  The acting is on-point.  The characters are stocky but effective.  The writing results in several genuinely heartfelt, menacing, and terrifying moments that make unlocking scenes and finding the next clue exhilarating.  The story is linear--there is one murderer with one motive--and while this doesn't bother me, I would be interested in seeing any future installments playing with a "choose your own adventure" theme.\n\nMechanically, Contradiction is a simple point-and-click adventure.  You use your mouse (or the arrows on your keyboard) to move around the map, choose clues from a list, and find contradictions.  It doesn't bring anything new to the genre, except for maybe the cut scenes, and it does fall into a lot of the same issues that other traditional adventure games are prone to.  My playthrough involved a lot of walking back and forth between locations whenever I got stuck, easily adding on another hour to an hour and a half to my play time.  There were also a few extended cut scenes that definitely felt like they were intended to be part of a longer interview section, but were gutted to meet the developers' very strict budget.\n\nI can't say that Contradiction is a difficult game.  The contradictions themselves, with an exception here and there, were easy enough to find.  Rather, Contradiction runs the risk of being frustrating.  There is a lot of evidence, a lot of characters, and a lot of dead ends and red herrings to sort through in order to get to the end of the game.  The game keeps track of everything each character has said, but it's on the player to remember what six different characters said about upwards of two dozen pieces of evidence.  Increasing potential frustration is the fact that contradictory statements have to come from the same character to count.  The player can't use what character A said against character B until character B slips up.  And then characters A through F say the exact same thing about a piece of evidence, which doesn't get you anywhere.\n\nAnd while I found the ending of the story to be satisfying and clever in hindsight, I thought that the last piece of evidence was a little disappointing, if only because it was maybe too obvious, especially after all of the running around we did.\n\nOverall, I would give Contradiction a 9/10.  The developers have done a lot with a simple concept by focusing on what makes the game unique.  By keeping it a relatively short game--5-7 hours tops--Contradiction stands out as an excellent Friday night game to share with friends.  Like any good story, there's room for speculation and growth.  Even if we never return to Edenton, Baggy Cat has succeeded in a lasting and endlessly enjoyable classic mystery.","September 21, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We used a voice chat and both had a copy of the game, so we just chose to go to the same areas at the same time and notify each other on options to click. It's been a ridiculous amount of fun. There's a distinct satisfaction in discovering that contradiction and seeing the text go green. The acting of Jenks IS over the top and sometimes threw me out of the story. He was wonderfully hammy and it wasn't horrible though. So while I comment on the acting, I also almost feel it was charming. The cast in general acted very well and I felt genuinely intimidated by one particular character even though he was somewhat stereotypical villain. They did a good job of rewarding falling back to check areas you've already been to. Overall, it's been a ton of fun and the only real qualm I have about it is sometimes the music got too loud... even when I had ambient music turned off so that it wouldn't echo in my chat with my friend.\n\nHonestly, considering how much fun it is to play with another friend, I'd love it if any future games like this considered some sort of chat integration or way to ease playing together rather than just timing it. But that's a minor thing. Mystery fans should definitely check this game out!\n\nEdit: Just finished the game and it was excellent all the way through.

Slightly overplayed acting, but I found that exactly this added greatly to the charm of the game.\n\nThe main mechanic of finding contradictory statements is also really fun, and the difficulty of the contradictions had a good varians throughout the game. Going from the very obvious to the you having to remember what was said in the on the "CD" which is referenced in the summary to catch the lie.\n\nOn the other side the game does suffer from some minor glitches, where you get a flash sudden flash from a different sceen or the items in the inventory not displaying their options at first.\n\nAlso the sound options is a bit lagging. you can only adjust the background music (which is very nice and fits the atmosphere well). It would have been nice to have been able to adjust the ambiance levels aswell since they at times were REALLY loud.\n\nAlso the game really! tries to setup for it's (supposedly) secuel, which for me annoyed me a little in the ending.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/playbahnosh/recommended/373390/","playbahnosh","Playbahnosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/playbahnosh/","264 products in account","Contradiction is essentially a FMV (Full-Motion Video) crime novel with point&click elements. I'm not gonna lie, at first I expected a disaster because the premise reminded me a lot of the FMV fad in the 80's and 90's, where you could get these "interactive movies" that had little prompts pop up on the screen sometimes and you could use the remote to choose what will happen. Haven't heard about those? No wonder, the fad never really caught on, and for good reason: IT WAS HORRIBLE. The story was almost always stupid as hell, the acting was atrocious and the production value usually rivaled a ground school drama play. But it wasn't always just movies, FMV was mixed into video games at the time, which made it even worse. The corny acting and pixelated, low-res video was jarring against the blocky 2D (or faux-3D) graphics of the era. In short, technology just wasn't there yet. Fast-forward 20 years, and we get Contradiction. I'll be honest, I didn't expect much, but the premise of seeing an FMV disaster after so many years just made me itch for nostalgia. It was surprisingly cheap, so I bought it for sh!ts and giggles. Turns out, I was wrong on so many levels.\n\nApparently, technology advanced far enough to make FMV a pretty damn viable form of storytelling. Contradiction looks very good! High definition video, pretty locations with nice sets and I really liked the little cutscenes of transitioning between shots/scenes. Most of the locations have different views depending on where we arrive from, it's a nice little touch that adds a lot to the immersion I think. The technical aspect is also nice, really good editing, shot composition and angles, it's all unexpectedly high quality work for a pretty low-budget production. But, not matter how pretty the window-dressing is, what makes or breaks a medium like this, is the acting and the story.\n\nThe acting is...okay. Which in itself is far better than any FMV thing I've seen back in the day. The actors' performances range from "pretty good" to "don't quit your dayjob". I really liked Paul, Emma and Rebecca was okay, the rest of the cast is kinda forgettable. Except for one guy, Inspector Jenks, who was pretty much a disaster. This is particularly bad, since he is the protagonist, and we have to watch him all the time! His performance is truly cringe-worthy, the guy dreadfully overacts every single line, so he comes off more like a circus clown instead of a police inspector. It really grates on you, it's nails-on-chalkboard level at some parts, so the game becomes more of an endurance test instead of a detective story. (I would criticize Ryan's performance too, but since that character was designed to be a pompous, annoying jerk, I can only say: mission friggin accomplished!)\n\nAs for the story: it's better than I expected. It has a few twists and turns, but nothing spectacular. There is more mystery and intensity in an episode of Murder She Wrote, but Contradiction essentially being an amateur garage project, you can't really expect Sherlock-level storytelling, can you? It starts out really strong and keeps the interest up with new reveals and builds momentum constantly, but...there is one huge problem: the ending. I won't spoil anything, but this was without doubt one of the worst, flimsiest endings I've seen in a long while. The story was doing a great job of building up to a potentially grand finale, and at the very end it just goes and throws all that away in favor of a shoddy cop-out. I don't get it, if it's supposed to be sequel-bait or something like that, but it really overshadowed the whole experience for me...\n\nFor gameplay, well, there isn't much to tell. It's a sort of "point&click for dummies". The game mainly consists of interrogating people around town about facts or things you've found, and finding contradictions in their answers (hence the title). At first, it's pretty straightforward, but as the story unfolds, your list of clues and answers grows exponentially, to the point you'll be strained to sift through everything when looking for contradictions. Some of them are quite hard to get, so sometimes it devolves into flat out guesswork or the good 'ol "rub everything on everything until something works" method puzzle solving. Thankfully, the game is pretty generous about handing out tips, and there is even a cheat system, when activated, it outright tells you what you should do next...you know, in case you wanna rob yourself of actually playing the game.\n\nDespite all the criticism I leveled at Contradiction, it was truly a nice surprise. It's an FMV video game that DOESN'T SUCK, in fact, it's pretty decent for what it is. It's surprisingly cheap and has plenty of content. It's an enjoyable detective story with a few good twists, and if you can excuse the tedious endgame and the terrible finale, it's a really nice experience! I'll be getting the sequel, if there's ever gonna be one. I really recommend this game if you wanna try something unique, or if you wanna finally wash off that awful taste those old and horrible FMV games left you with all those years ago :)","September 15, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Took about seven hours with the two of us thinking on everything, no cheats used. It's a wonderful challenge, and none of it particularly unfair; often with these kinds of games you get into a situation where you're lost in the verbage, trying to figure out which exact lines the game wants you to choose, even if it's not the most logical. This game doesn't suffer from that at all, and we were generally able to single out the exact choices we had to make when hit with inspiration.\n\nActing is spot-on; my only real complaint is about how jarringly hammy the lead detective is, but it's so over-the-top that it eventually becomes strangely endearing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/recommended/373390/","evil_incarnate","Evil incarnate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/","1022 products in account","This is one of the best FMV games that I've played, if not THE best one. That isn't to say this is a flawless masterpiece, there are many problems, but there are also alot of positives.\n\nI'll start with the negatives - and this is my biggest complaint. The clue/hint system itself. As you progress through the game your list of possible contradictions naturally grow, making it more difficult to scroll through the list and decipher the short, vague descriptions of what the character said. I think to counter this, there needs to be less possible contradictions, perhaps separate them with "interest" notes that act as a reminder of what the character said. Also, there should be more to it than simply selecting and combining two statements; introducing evidence as part of the contradiction adds more variety and, well, sense.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of direction... it's as if the game doesn't know whether it wants to be linear or not, forcing yourself to explore every location multiple times throughout the night, or use the hint system (which you will be using ALL the time). I would have preferred if the game was linear, only being able to explore areas that are needed, and introduce a sort of point 'n' click mechanic where you move the mouse over things in the room rather than a generic magnifying glass.\n\nWith that, I think the rest of the game is absolutely phenomenal (especially given this is an FMV game). My favourite elements are this game's writing, music and story. Whilst it IS your bog standard murder-mystery detective story, there are certain things this game does that spice it up, adds flavour, makes it more... involving and personal. For example, I just love seeing the short clips as Jenkins walks up to a house, or turns a corner, or up steps; showing his shoes, his hand opening a door, or his awesomely smug face that you can't help but smile at. And speaking of Jenkins, he's a loveable character, acted out well and is my favourite character of the game. However, this isn't to say the acting for every character is amazing, certain actors I feel weren't up to par or tried too hard to the point where their dialogue and execution felt unnatural. I won't name names, and I did on-the-whole enjoy all the acting, but these two characters stuck out to me as being below average.\n\nThere's also the "aha" eureka moment when you finally find the contradiction, Jenkins will confirm this with a Tomb Raider 2-esque "aha" that Lara Croft does when she finds an item. Which is awesome. Another game I feel like this is similar to is Scratches, another game set in England, with an English cast, and offers another murder mystery with a plot twist or two. I mean, even in both games you report to your colleague about updates (Scratches was Jerry, here it's the Chief). Then there's the whole British setting to it that I like and can identify with. The village this is set in was a nice change from the typical towering urban American and I like the lighting and the fact the game takes place in the evening 'til night, the idea of hours progressing based on your own actions is a neat, immersive, organic way to approach progress.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but it does leave some threads hanging, and not in a good way. Certain characters seem to have disappeared off the face of the planet, collected evidence which were completely useless and character statements which are pointless filler. Having said that, some of that unnecessary digester flavour is what makes this game more life-like, as a real detective won't have perfect results with each candidate.\n\nIn the end, I loved the game despite its flaws, I wish they offered a downloadable soundtrack as I feel it was put to good use, the tingles and bells as you explore and find out more about the murder sounds great and as if you're making it closer to the truth. I can recommend this game to adventure lovers, movie-goers or people looking for a nice, relaxing, charming, well-written mystery presented in a clean, HD format.","March 18","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The actor playing Jenks kept the entire story light and fun despite the dark connotations of the events. He might have gone a bit too far with silly faces from time to time but honestly it was refreshing and entertaining given nonstop wicked overtones.\n\nPros\nThe acting is well done for such a small budget, Jenks is straight up wacky in some scenes and calm and reflective in others. I cant imagine he takes his job too seriously. Its a shame because I feel like there are some specific scenes where acting more like a professional and being more concerned for his personal safety would add to the character rather then feel disjointed.\nThe musical score was very involved as well, gave a nonstop air of foreboding that really helped to set the mood and atmosphere of the game. It also sounded like the major plot points and reveals happened to often coincide with heavy piano notes being played. Could be my imagination but I think that it was done intentionally.\n\nCons\nThe interface was a bit jarring at first until you got used to it, various topics would highlight as green while others stayed blue but this didnt actually translate to any hints or topics you should try to converse next. It felt random and led to lots of extra time spent re-exploring topics that werent needed to find contradictions that didnt exist\nYou will find dozens of things that people say that are contradictory by definition that dont lead to cutscenes, this can be  frustrating over time as you feel that you caught a person in their lies but the payoff never results of actually discussing it with them. Likely this was an error of budget contraints or logical omissions in the games story and script. Either way I would highly encourage the developement team to either include cutscenes for each of these in future games, or more carefully write the dialog so that we dont spend half the game pouring over linking contradictions that aren't intended by the developer.","September 19, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You are supposed to be an investigator, but you can't really do things an investigator should be able to do. If you ask two people about the same subject and you know one of them is lying, you can't really see a contradiction between dialogues of different people. You also can't investigate for yourself. It claims to be a point-and-click, but all you do is click on a magnifying glass and Jenks do all the job for you (not very nice for a game...). Basically, the game is about talking with people and just waiting for them to lie about something (because none of them are very good liars).\n\n2) The ending. It is the most disappointing ending in any murder mystery investigation game. If this was a real-life investigation and I was the investigator, I would probably solve the case in 20 minutes, but apparently Jenks takes 7 hours to do so because he's either lazy or clueless about clear evidence.\n---KIND OF SPOILERS AHEAD---\nBasically, there's an unique tape on the victim's driver's license (you can see at the trailer). I noticed it right away and early on the game Jenks comes across the same tape on window. However, this is not presented as a clue (even though it would clearly be something a real detective would notice and use as evidence). Anyway, this would not bother me if this particular tape was not the only thing that actually frames the killer. Near the ending, the tape comes across as important again, and when you ask the killer about it, he or she just confesses the crime. This to me is just the most stupid thing.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you want a good point-and-click mystery game, look for some of Nancy Drew's games. They're way better in gameplay and mystery plot.","December 31, 2015","false","7.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

The story is interesting, the characters are varied and fun, the gameplay is easy to grasp without much explanation. Some of the acting can be a bit campy depending on the characters, though I personally find this pretty entertaining.\n\nThe keyboard option for the game feels a bit unwieldy for interrogations, but for walking around the map it functions fine. Personally, I prefer to play using the mouse. (I didn't try using a gamepad/joystick.)\n\nBut, alas, I can't recommend the game for one big, glaring reason: the interface tends to bug out randomly and stops functioning until I close and reopen the game when I play with the mouse as input method. (I did not test the keyboard mode enough to know if it's also affected.) Sometimes this can lead to losing progress, especially if you haven't saved the game manually for a while. The good news? As far as I've noticed, the interface bugs don't corrupt save files or break the game permanently, even if you save after the bug kicked in.\n\nI also have to warn you that this game's ending is a bit open-ended and has a sequel hook. It's not really a cliffhanger, but if you want your games wrapped up neatly with no questions left unanswered, you'll have to look elsewhere.\n\nIf the interface issues don't bother you, don't mind to regularly save manually using the two save slots and have no qualms with endings that don't give full closure on every detail, I think you can safely buy it, though.","November 12, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

I'll start with the bad and then skip to the good stuff:\n\n1. I quickly tired of circling around and around and around and around asking a handful of characters one or two questions at a time.  I appreciate that the makers *tried* to make it less repetitive by letting us skip around on the map but it was still a couple steps each time - e.g. to get from Simon's to Atlas, you could skip all the way across the map, but then you had to click to get into the grounds, click to get into the entryway, click to get into the next room (forget what it's called), then click to get into Ryan's office.  Every time you wanted to visit.  It just got VERY boring going James-Rebecca-Simon/Emma-Ryan-Ryan-Simon/Emma-Rebecca/James, with the occasional search the woods & call the chief thrown in for, uh... variety?\n\n2. Semi-related to the above, one's pace in the game felt extremely restricted.  I couldn't decide I wanted to ask about "such and such", I had to wait for the game to let me.  I couldn't decide "I want to go further this way", I had to wait for the game to let me.  What was really frustrating was when I looked up the solution and a major clue - as I see someone else in another negative review has already mentioned - shows up almost immediately, and you *can't ask about it*.  I mean it's so bloody obvious that I wasted a lot of time in the beginning trying to *find* a way to ask about it because it seemed impossible that an actual inspector wouldn't take one look at that clue and say "... hey, waitaminute."  I eventually gave up, but throughout the game I felt like the questioning method functioned the way it did just to slow you down and increase the gametime (e.g. you have to find something *one* character has contradicted themselves on, you can't say "hang on, so and so said this about you and that contradicts what you said" - again, what kind of lousy, lousy detective would you have to be...?), and that, well, kind of reinforces that feeling.\n\nThings I did love:\n\n1. The live video idea is a lot of fun and I admired it even as I grew more and more bored with the actual story.  I would like to see this done again, just with a less repetitive, restrictive game behind it.  I especially like the guy playing Jenks (he's very clearly enjoying the hell out of himself) but of all the characters I saw, they were all doing a good job at the acting - which you can't always depend on in smaller games.\n\n2. I really love the system where you can ask for hints or outright 'cheats' without any real punishment (except a 'count' of cheats if you use those).  I've always felt that story-based games might as well let people who aren't as good of players enjoy the game by giving them a helping hand - it's a lot less intrusive to the story to be able to click on a quick 'hint' icon and get a nudge in the right direction than to alt-tab out, go search for a walkthrough, try and find the point you need without spoiling yourself for the rest of the game, alt-tab back in and continue.\n\n3. Despite my complaint above, I do like *some* of how questioning was set up - i.e. you had a list of things you wanted to ask about, it let you know if you'd already asked them and kept a record of their responses, and you could review people's responses by person or by item.  At its heart, that's a nice design.","September 16, 2015","false","3.9"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","10","32","0","0"

It seems to have been developed by somebody with only the most basic understanding of what video games even are, and no understanding of what makes them fun. The technical and design issues alone are numerous and baffling. Sometimes you can use the mouse, sometimes only the keyboard. Controls can only be configured by going to the menu and setting them all up in a row, and can't be set individually. There are inscrutable menu options you can't use. When navigating around town, forward becomes back and back becomes forward, based on whatever room you were in previously, but with no change in perspective to indicate it. A single button is shared for both "inventory" and "use".\n\nHear me out: I'm not complaining because I went to a silent movie and there was no sound.

The acting strikes a perfect balance between taking it seriously and being self-aware. There are some really good performances from the cast, and progressing through the story with Jenks is an excellent ride. It's a great example of how fun FMV can be. The story itself moves at a good pace - there is always the sense that something major is about to be discovered which makes the game hard to put down. The setting of a quaint English village also gives it a nice atmosphere.\n\nThe UI and controls are not the greatest, with the keyboard controls being a bit odd to start off with. Once they become familiar however, it's a very minor point and doesn't detract from the experience. Being able to easily compare responses from difference suspects would be a nice addition to the UI which just in general needs a bit of a polish. But again, the UI didn't detract from the experience, and actually adds a bit of charm to the game in it's own unique way.\n\nI'm glad Giantbomb brought it to my attention, fingers crossed for more Jenks!","July 31, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To add to this the cliffhanger with Atlus, while I get it's part of a series, I feel should of just been actually resolved instead of just teased that more adventures abound.

There is an over-abundance of information, and trying to figure out contradictions among it all can be quite hard. And unless you get contradictions, you can't make any progress. So often times I felt like I was beating my head against a wall.\n\nBut the game is brilliant. It feels so amazing when you do get a contridiction. And the video aspect of it is, in my opinion, a better choice than whatever 3d digital world/characters someone could have made. The story was pretty interesting, the characters pretty unique, and I couldn't stop thinking about the game once I started playing.\n\nThe ending felt a little weak, and it left some unanswered questions.\n\nI would 100% buy another game like this for around $10-$15.

A lot of amazing comedy in the line deliveries, great acting performances.\n\nGame itself has maybe a bit too much back and forth like you have to go back to each character you're interviewing a lot for every new piece of dialogue or clue you can ask them about, not really sure how that could be made different though. There maybe aren't enough item or environment puzzles, only very few inventory items you use in the world, and it's all very basic. The inventory is mostly for storing different topics to move all the different characters' dialogues.\n\nQuite a few smaller plot threads don't necessarily lead anywhere except in a roundabout way to other clues on semi-related topics you use with different characters than the plot thread originally were about, not really red herrings just stuff that doesn't feel sufficiently followed up on. So there could possibly have been added quite a bit more smaller dialogues for that stuff. And the last few chapters feel a bit short or rushed maybe, the ending is definitely weird and hinges on a pretty random item and a cutscene that kind of forces the ending to happen without a lot of player interaction.\n\nReally like how you get bits and pieces of information from the different characters, but you can't just go around accusing people, you have to catch them all in contradictions of their own. Can only use things said against the person that said it, not what someone else said. So you're always sitting with a bit of a bigger picture informationwise, just drawing your own conclusions from what several people are saying, than you're getting from each character on their own. Really nicely written.\n\nOverall a really fun story with great characters.","August 11, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's not a bad thing - a game that lasts just a week. It provided seven hours of fun that we thoroughly enjoined.\n\nFor a kickstarted game it was very well put together, great acting (the detective's scene chewing aside), nicely filmed, and the cast was entertaining. A couple of spelling mistakes in the text did not detract from our fun,\n\nThere are fewer than a dozen items to pick up, find, use, whatever, and it's pretty obvious where each is used. Once you get the hang of how to select two different statements by the same person and compare them for "CONTRADICTIONS" the gameplay is pretty much sorted. Talk to everyone about everything, and if you get stuck call the chief - but in general if you think you've got nowhere else to visit and nothing else to talk about, it means you have at least one person who has contradicted themselves and you have to select both statements. That will cause another cutscene that will add to your evidence and off you go to talk to everyone else about it.\n\nThe game installed easily, started up quickly, and the video playbacks were seamless. [Win 10, Geforce GTX 570, 24GB RAM]\n\nWorth the price of a round of drinks at the pub.

It works just enough that you can play the game\n-You can only ask characters about their own statements - you can't ask them about the statements of others.

I have been waiting for a game like this for aaages, having loved many FMV games from the 90's and just being a 'whodunnit' fan. Hands down the Brits own this genre of television and to have a game that feels like a juicy Midsomer Murder is awesome. I just wish I knew about the Kickstarter beforehand to support it. The game has a small quaint town filled with moody atmosphere and secrets filmed amazingly in glorious HD. But what got me was using the video to create the 'still' directional screens to show you where to go - added a terrific environmental quality when they could have just used a still image. The acting for this 'low budget' event is actually fantastic, especially Paul and Ryan who had me on the edge of my seat, and of course the detective who I reckon enjoyed every second grilling his costars. Finding items to quiz people is understandably easy as the real crux of the game is trying to finding contradicting evidence in people's testimonies. There are plenty of adventure games where having a large inventory provokes conversation, but this game has managed to use the wonderful performances and nuances of the actors to provide that 'inventory' for you.

I always half expected someone to jump up behind me and beat me down with a sledgehammer and then drag my mangled corpse deep into the woods and leave it out in the open for the animals to nibble at while all of the town's people turn a blind eye.\n\nThe actors were decent, the visual quality was wonderful, and the only real issues I had were getting used to the controls at first, since there was no real indication of what buttons you're supposed to press in order to do everything, and the sound quality. It was quite poor at times and I had to turn on the captions to ensure that I made everything out. But other than that, it was actually quite top notch, wish it were longer, but six hours of play time isn't that bad for 10 dollars. I truly hope that there'll be a sequel to this game.

I just couldn't stop playing and beated the game in one seating in 6 and a half hours straight. And this comes from someone who lost faith in the gaming industry for a long time.\n\nTo add to the amusement, the act is flawless and at the same time the main character - Inspector Jenks acts like a goofball most of the times, however, somehow, it adds to the dept of his carachter. It is like he is trying to act in a mocking way in order to irritate the people he interogates.\n\nLike Shenmue III, the game was done through crowd funding and it is impressive the amount of detail and depthness they went through with such a small budget - that is the magic of Indie development! The love that independent developers have for their creations is something that someone who only wants to make a quick buck by making a next generic sequel of a generic First Person Shooter or something.\n\nIs the independent developers and crowd funding what will save the gaming industry?

A simple interface, good audio/visual quality, and pretty well written.  The idea of comparing pieces of interviews to catch people in a lie was new and interesting, although sometimes some of the "contradictions" seemed a bit of a stretch, while other times something that seemed clearly out of place didn't count as one.\n\nI do have a couple complaints.  For one, you can't skip any of the video transitions between locations, which can start to grate your nerves if you go back and forth a lot between some locations.  Also, most of the acting is very well done.  Most of the suspects' testimonies feel very natural, and a couple feel comfortably heightened (a bit of moustache-twirling, without being fully cheesy).  The protagonist, on the other hand, is irritatingly exaggerated.  As an inspector looking into a potential murder, he almost comes across like he's having a good time and not taking any of it seriously.  Everyone else is playing it straight, while he's hamming it up.  I called him many bad names in my head while playing.\n\nWithout giving anything away, the door is left open for potential sequels, which I'd be glad to see.\n","March 28","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One absurd aspect was the item system that were necessary for the story system - if you found something of someone else's and asked them about it, they would talk about the item and then hand it back to you (the reasoning was anecdotal and completely unbelievable).\n\nAll that said, it was still fun!","April 2","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a detective who is inspecting a suicide of a college girl named Girl, who happens to be enrolled in a business course of an organization called Atlas which has all the right amounts of shady. It’s a brilliant setup and is very engrossing. I started playing this with my mom, who had never ever played any sort of video game. She immediately liked it and that’s saying a lot!\n\nComing to the mechanics, I really loved it. I think it has got its roots from the very famous board game 'Cluedo' and it works on the same principle of questioning the suspects and finding a contradicting statements they have made and so spotting their lies. It’s a really neat mechanic and it meshes in perfectly with this game.\n\nThe presentation is well laid out and the menus are easy to traverse. I really loved the little cut scenes which play out when switching between areas but it got a little monotonous in the end and I wished there was an option to skip it. But it’s not a very major gripe that it will keep you from playing the game at all.\n\nSpeaking about cut scenes, the main cut scenes are quite enjoyable. Mainly due to the over the top acting of Detective Jenks with his ridiculous outfit, with the more serious acting by the rest of the cast. There were some time where I felt that the acting was not up to the mark but it was negligible. I really enjoyed the acting of Mr. Paul Rynd who had a tone very similar to Professor Snape from the Harry Potter Series.\n\nThe story, wow it did grip me all the way from the beginning till the last bit. The ending for me was a letdown, I feel it was rushed and left many questions which I wanted to know unanswered. They introduced a lot of supernatural and horror elements which was fantastic for the brief about of time it lasted, but they shied away from it towards the end. Maybe due to the time restrictions they had to rush the final bits of the game. But I’m sure if they had given more time it would have been a 10/10 experience. This was one of the two issues I had with the game.\n\nThe other issue was some of the contradiction puzzles seemed easy, it may also be because I was always in track with all the replies given by each and every suspect for each and every evidence, but some contradictions are very hard to find.\n\nOverall I had a lot of fun playing this game, it kept me hooked throughout until the end bit. They did throw a hint for a sequel in the end which would solve all the mysteries. I hope they manage to come out with it in the future. Finally saying that I do not recommend this game to anyone will be a contradiction itself, so yes go and play this game, its good! I want more of this please!\n","February 16","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the video aspect of it is, in my opinion, a better choice than whatever 3d digital world/characters someone could have made. The story was pretty interesting, the characters pretty unique, and I couldn't stop thinking about the game once I started playing.\n\nThe ending felt a little weak, and it left some unanswered questions.\n\nI would 100% buy another game like this for around $10-$15.

I have been waiting for a game like this for aaages, having loved many FMV games from the 90's and just being a 'whodunnit' fan. Hands down the Brits own this genre of television and to have a game that feels like a juicy Midsomer Murder is awesome. I just wish I knew about the Kickstarter beforehand to support it. The game has a small quaint town filled with moody atmosphere and secrets filmed amazingly in glorious HD. But what got me was using the video to create the 'still' directional screens to show you where to go - added a terrific environmental quality when they could have just used a still image. The acting for this 'low budget' event is actually fantastic, especially Paul and Ryan who had me on the edge of my seat, and of course the detective who I reckon enjoyed every second grilling his costars. Finding items to quiz people is understandably easy as the real crux of the game is trying to finding contradicting evidence in people's testimonies. There are plenty of adventure games where having a large inventory provokes conversation, but this game has managed to use the wonderful performances and nuances of the actors to provide that 'inventory' for you.

I wasn’t expecting much from the game. To my delight, Contradiction – Spot the Liar made for an entertaining evening… and late evening… then early morning…  I hooked my pc to the big screen and played along with a house guest who doesn’t play a lot of video games. We were hooked almost from the beginning.\n\nThe navigation is simple and reminds me of DVD games. I thought the gameplay would get dull – location, interrogate, repeat, but the pace of clues and strength of the acting kept that from happening. Like most games that rely on questioning suspects, there are questions the player wants to ask that never come up. As this relies on finding contradictions, this does become more of an issue at times, but not to a point that crippled gameplay. There are lots of red herrings or lines of inquiry that go nowhere. I can’t tell you how many times we picked up an item and said “Don’t forget what Simon said about that. That’s important.” only to have nothing happen. Rather than annoy, it left us with a longing for a sequel.\n\nThe acting is great. I found Jenks’ shoes and hat a bit annoying, and every time he flourished the evidence at a suspect I expected him to say “Is this your card?”, but it added to his quirkiness. Paul Darrow is great. He brings nuance to the role and is still one of the best “reaction” actors I’ve seen.\n\nThe only real downside is replayability. I’d love to get my game night group together to do this, but it won’t be as much fun for me. I’ll still probably do it.\n\nIf I were the producers, I’d make a 20 minute playable demo using the existing material and mechanics to help sell this and get money for a sequel on Kickstarter. Something that shows off the ease of interrogation and introduces most of the characters would be a great marketing tool and short enough to share with friends (particularly the non-gamer 40-55 demo who would love this game if they knew it existed).\n","October 11, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I found the mystery intriguing and the gameplay strangely addicting. Catching people in lies is a blast, especially with this cast of characters.\n\nThe ending was honestly pretty unsatisfying, but I get the sense that the game designer was aware of this. It seemed like a lot of the mystery we uncovered ended up being inconsequential and too quickly disgarded in the end. No matter, because while the destination may have been drab the ride was a blast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlitty/recommended/373390/","schlitty","Schlitty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlitty/","617 products in account","This is a very cautious and very reserved recommendation. This game will not be for "everybody". At all. It is quite rough around the edges and suffers a few frustrating faults. But. I personally enjoyed it immensely and think it is very much worth looking in to. I got this game in a bundle without having heard of it or it's Kickstarter campaign. It wasn't on my radar at all, even when purchasing the bundle I had my eye on other titles in it, this was just going to be a “throw in”. But it was easily the star of the bunch!\n\nThe game is impressively well acted, written, and shot. No Oscar performance or anything but also not cheesy in any way. A lot of “FMV” games or live action cutscenes in video games tend to be on the more campy side of things but this finds the balance in between. They're clearly having great fun, but still portraying the characters well. Never a “cringe” moment. The story and writing is solid and deep enough to mostly keep you guessing. And develops a full atmosphere. Then the cinematography or whatever you want to call it is great within the context of it being a game. Exteriors are particularly well framed.\n\nBut it is rough around the edges as I mentioned;\n\n-The “along for the ride” straight line story and not being able to accuse anyone or effect outcomes might bother some but I enjoyed it. Nice casual experience. You don't change the story or have options, you just figure out how to keep it going.\n\n-My biggest issues were some of the “contradiction” choices. You progress the story by presenting evidence to different characters you're interviewing and then taking their answers and finding things that contradict. Doing this flusters them and makes them reveal more to the story. I found at least two of the contradictions annoying in the fact I was on the right track but you had to make sure it was the exact right two statements to get it to trigger. Even though very similar (almost identical) answers wouldn't trigger it. The first time this happened to me I was certain I was on the right track but just happened to not match the perfect two. After circling the map and characters multiple times I thought I bugged the game. Which led me to consult a guide. I felt a "oh comeon!" moment knowing I had virtually pointed out the exact same thing with a different answer. And I hate consulting guides! Haha. But searching for these contradictions led me back to a guide once more later in the game... I feel shame. Then some other contradictions just felt a little too buried in the grey area. And then I'd have to glance over a list of the contradictions somewhere but I also seem to recall an early one not even feeling like a contradiction, but don't quote me on that.\n\n-The last chapter has a lot of clues uncovered by stumbling across corners of the map manually. Which is fine because I like checking corners and had developed a habit of it every chapter. But the game up to that point triggered these events automatically when fast traveling over the area. Might get someone stuck/annoyed.\n\n-Ending was fine with me but might leave some asking for more. There was a deliberate attempt to put more information than needed in the game to make the detective work worth it but this led to more story arcs that went nowhere. And some unresolved that did go somewhere for a bit. Which is kind of the point as well... We live in a world of sequels. And with some fine tuning and smoothing out I'd look forward to a sequel from the same team! Though I think an entirely new adventure would be more thrilling. Either way I hope the people involved from the gamemakers to the actors have more up their sleeves in some form.\n\nIts a fair price for the entertainment value if you aren't expecting deep gameplay or any replay value. Me being cheap and the higher percentage chance of the average gamer not enjoying it, I would recommend waiting for a sale or getting it in a bundle of course. But I think $9.99USD is fair for what you get if its in your budget. Check it out!","October 19, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You travel back and fourth between various suspects to question about clues that you find or through talking to other suspects. The main aspect that sets Contradiction apart are the full-motion video that feature great actors; my favorites being Jenks and Paul. It does remind me of a beloved series Ace Attorney although it is much more simplified but still enjoyable.\n\nAs the entire game is shot in full-motion video, it is a joy to watch and interact with the game. You can really tell when a character is nervous or lying from their acting. The most endearing part is the investigator, Jenks with his comical expressions.\n\nAlthough this game is quite straightforward and not really a game that you need to replay I think it is still worth playing. I do agree with some that the ending is bittersweet as you slowly uncover deep hidden evils within the settings and characetrs, however I think it is only an encouragement for a sequel that I really hope they will go ahead with.

I wasn’t expecting much from the game. To my delight, Contradiction – Spot the Liar made for an entertaining evening… and late evening… then early morning…  I hooked my pc to the big screen and played along with a house guest who doesn’t play a lot of video games. We were hooked almost from the beginning.\n\nThe navigation is simple and reminds me of DVD games. I thought the gameplay would get dull – location, interrogate, repeat, but the pace of clues and strength of the acting kept that from happening. Like most games that rely on questioning suspects, there are questions the player wants to ask that never come up. As this relies on finding contradictions, this does become more of an issue at times, but not to a point that crippled gameplay. There are lots of red herrings or lines of inquiry that go nowhere. I can’t tell you how many times we picked up an item and said “Don’t forget what Simon said about that. That’s important.” only to have nothing happen. Rather than annoy, it left us with a longing for a sequel.\n\nThe acting is great. I found Jenks’ shoes and hat a bit annoying, and every time he flourished the evidence at a suspect I expected him to say “Is this your card?”, but it added to his quirkiness. Paul Darrow is great. He brings nuance to the role and is still one of the best “reaction” actors I’ve seen.\n\nThe only real downside is replayability. I’d love to get my game night group together to do this, but it won’t be as much fun for me. I’ll still probably do it.\n\nIf I were the producers, I’d make a 20 minute playable demo using the existing material and mechanics to help sell this and get money for a sequel on Kickstarter. Something that shows off the ease of interrogation and introduces most of the characters would be a great marketing tool and short enough to share with friends (particularly the non-gamer 40-55 demo who would love this game if they knew it existed).\n","October 11, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Interactive fiction, yes.  A full-motion video game (FMV), sure.  But more than either of those, it is a modern-day implementation of the age-old tradition of art commission.\n\nA small team of talented and passionate people reached out to the gaming community and humbly petitioned them for support; the help they needed to bring something they truly believed in to life.  In the end, an understandably skeptical KickStarter community offered £4,010.  Let me repeat that.  £4,010.  At that funding level, Contradition is an astonishing achievement; not only in its polish and enjoyability, but also in what had to have been the colossal charity and collaboration of everyone involved in its making.\n\nContradiction is an interactive fiction experience in the form of a high-definition, full-motion video game.  A young woman has been found dead; drowned in a lake at the outskirts of a charming hamlet in the English country-side.  Detective Jenks arrives on scene at 5:00PM to investigate and finds the inhabitants of the village not nearly as wholesome as their idyllic surroundings.  At the center of it all is an inscrupulous father and son duo and their cut-throat, corporate executive training program, Atlas.  Jenks has until midnight to solve the mystery,  Tour the town, gather the evidence, and interview the witnesses.  Spot the contradictions and help Jenks close the case.  The Chief is counting on you.\n\nThis is British Detective Pulp at its finest.  From the quirky and unflappable Detective Jenks to the deliciously villainous patriarch, Paul Rand, great performances throughout elevate the story-telling well past what I would have alllowed a work of this budget and format could deliver.  The settings are lush, but genuine.  The makeup and costumes are "just right" in their tasteful understatement.  The music and sound effects create mood and communicate enviroment in as expert a fashion as I have ever heard.\n\nThe game design is both intuitive and innovative.  The control interface is clever and unobstrusive; an asset to he gameplay instead of a necessary evil.  The offering of both a hint system and a full-on "cheat" bailout welcomes players of every commitment level.  Chapter progression marked by advancing hours and subsequent nightfall are perfect for communicating urgency in a natural and realistic way.  The game is altogether worthy as a vehicle for delivering the quality acting and engrossing story.\n\nI ran into only two challenges with the gameplay and those are easily overcome with a couple of no-spoiler hints:\n\n1.  Start every new chapter by walking the entire length of the village, including the nooks and crannies, and entering evey location.  The quick-travel map can result in a vital progress point being missed for a frustratingly long time.\n\n2.  The hourglass symbol that signifies that there is something in the scene for Jenks to investigate is easy to miss.  Watch closely for it, especially when making the aforementioned new-chapter walkthrough.","October 12, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stumbled across this game when I learned that one of my all-time favorite composers, Tim Follin, had returned to the video games industry since "retiring" from it in 2005 after his amazing talents had been wasted on mostly unknown or poorly received games. It was quite to my surprise that Follin was returning to the industry to work on a game not only as a composer, but as a designer and writer as well. So how does a game made by someone with no design experience who's been absent from the industry for 10 years play? It plays about how you'd expect, for better or for worse. It's not all bad though, Contradiction is charming in a unique way that I think can only be accomplished by a first-time designer who, as far as I can tell, has been isolated from the popular design trends, progressions and philosophies that have developed in the last decade or two.\n\nContradiction is a full FMV murder mystery game straight out of the 90s which I admit would have been way more eye-rolling if I hadn't just played the excellent "Her Story". You play as Fredrick Jenks, a British detective who is tasked with investigating a murder in a small fictional village. All locations in the village are essentially still frames, even though some are animated, and you can move between the frames by clicking on UI arrows displayed on the screen which always triggers a short movie of Jenks strolling to where you guided him. While interviewing suspects, Jenks has a list of topics he can ask about which when selected, loads an an FMV scene where Jenks grills the suspect about whatever you selected which often then reveals more topics to ask about. The main gameplay mechanic in Contradiction is to find pieces of the suspect's story that don't quite add up or are downright contradictions, hence the title. Most of the contradictions are pretty logical, but some are a little more of a stretch or are otherwise debatable. Thankfully, this game is pretty generous with hints and gives them to you in a way that doesn't make you feel stupid or like you're cheating. Jenks can go to the phone booth and call his chief who will generally point you in the correct direction to progress the game or also may hint at contradictions suspects have made.\n\nFollin, whose composing career work dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum days, also composed the music in Contradiction. It's not quite as in-your-face as some of my other favorites of his. It's more appropriately subtle and blends in perfectly as Jenks traverses the village looking for clues and interviewing suspects. Aside from the music, the extremely cheesy acting is another standout in Contradiction, especially with the actor portraying Jenks who loves to smirk at his suspects with his trademark goofy deductive grin. In fact, Jenks is so excitably overanimated and the acting in general is so cheesy that it makes me wonder if it was an intentional directorial choice or if Follin actually thought his actors were delivering believable performances. In any case, I'm happy about it. The delightfully cheesy acting seems to fit the style of this game perfectly as does the music.\n\nBut in addition to the cheesy acting, there are several other strange design choices and signs of low budget production you should be at least aware of before playing this game, especially if that sort of thing bothers you. I've heard this game was riddled with UI problems at launch that have since been corrected, but one holdover is the strange combination of topics Jenks can ask about with the physical items he's carrying into one functional grouping. Your items and your topics appear together, but you can't use a topic like an item and most items you can't bring up in conversation, making this a puzzling design choice. I've also encountered a bug a few times where none of the suspect's answers were selectable as contradictions and I had to leave and re-enter the scene in order to fix it. (Minor spoilers ahead). The budgetary constraints this game was made were apparent in the poor sound quality in the FMV scenes but especially obvious in the ending to this game. The latter half of the game really seems as though its building up to something as the plot starts sprinkling in elements of the occult and mysticism. But it's all thrown away at the last second when the murderer is revealed and the game just ends quickly and unceremoniously - but not before strangely setting itself up for a sequel. I later read that this abrupt ending was apparently due to financial constraints and a sequel would only be possible with enough support of the first game\n\nSummary\nIt has design problems, bugs, obvious budget problems and wonderfully cheesy acting but I really enjoyed Contradiction in spite of itself. It was a flashback to the old puzzle games I played as a kid. All things considered, Contradiction is a pretty good first attempt at making a game for someone who has no experience doing this sort of thing. At the very least, I'm glad Follin is back doing things in the games industry and I hope he gets the funding and support to make a sequel so we can see what lessons were learned and what improvements can be made\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","October 8, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I stumbled across this game when I learned that one of my all-time favorite composers, Tim Follin, had returned to the video games industry since "retiring" from it in 2005 after his amazing talents had been wasted on mostly unknown or poorly received games. It was quite to my surprise that Follin was returning to the industry to work on a game not only as a composer, but as a designer and writer as well. So how does a game made by someone with no design experience who's been absent from the industry for 10 years play? It plays about how you'd expect, for better or for worse. It's not all bad though, Contradiction is charming in a unique way that I think can only be accomplished by a first-time designer who, as far as I can tell, has been isolated from the popular design trends, progressions and philosophies that have developed in the last decade or two.\n\nContradiction is a full FMV murder mystery game straight out of the 90s which I admit would have been way more eye-rolling if I hadn't just played the excellent "Her Story". You play as Fredrick Jenks, a British detective who is tasked with investigating a murder in a small fictional village. All locations in the village are essentially still frames, even though some are animated, and you can move between the frames by clicking on UI arrows displayed on the screen which always triggers a short movie of Jenks strolling to where you guided him. While interviewing suspects, Jenks has a list of topics he can ask about which when selected, loads an an FMV scene where Jenks grills the suspect about whatever you selected which often then reveals more topics to ask about. The main gameplay mechanic in Contradiction is to find pieces of the suspect's story that don't quite add up or are downright contradictions, hence the title. Most of the contradictions are pretty logical, but some are a little more of a stretch or are otherwise debatable. Thankfully, this game is pretty generous with hints and gives them to you in a way that doesn't make you feel stupid or like you're cheating. Jenks can go to the phone booth and call his chief who will generally point you in the correct direction to progress the game or also may hint at contradictions suspects have made.\n\nFollin, whose composing career work dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum days, also composed the music in Contradiction. It's not quite as in-your-face as some of my other favorites of his. It's more appropriately subtle and blends in perfectly as Jenks traverses the village looking for clues and interviewing suspects. Aside from the music, the extremely cheesy acting is another standout in Contradiction, especially with the actor portraying Jenks who loves to smirk at his suspects with his trademark goofy deductive grin. In fact, Jenks is so excitably overanimated and the acting in general is so cheesy that it makes me wonder if it was an intentional directorial choice or if Follin actually thought his actors were delivering believable performances. In any case, I'm happy about it. The delightfully cheesy acting seems to fit the style of this game perfectly as does the music.\n\nBut in addition to the cheesy acting, there are several other strange design choices and signs of low budget production you should be at least aware of before playing this game, especially if that sort of thing bothers you. I've heard this game was riddled with UI problems at launch that have since been corrected, but one holdover is the strange combination of topics Jenks can ask about with the physical items he's carrying into one functional grouping. Your items and your topics appear together, but you can't use a topic like an item and most items you can't bring up in conversation, making this a puzzling design choice. I've also encountered a bug a few times where none of the suspect's answers were selectable as contradictions and I had to leave and re-enter the scene in order to fix it. (Minor spoilers ahead). The budgetary constraints this game was made were apparent in the poor sound quality in the FMV scenes but especially obvious in the ending to this game. The latter half of the game really seems as though its building up to something as the plot starts sprinkling in elements of the occult and mysticism. But it's all thrown away at the last second when the murderer is revealed and the game just ends quickly and unceremoniously - but not before strangely setting itself up for a sequel. I later read that this abrupt ending was apparently due to financial constraints and a sequel would only be possible with enough support of the first game\n\nSummary\nIt has design problems, bugs, obvious budget problems and wonderfully cheesy acting but I really enjoyed Contradiction in spite of itself. It was a flashback to the old puzzle games I played as a kid. All things considered, Contradiction is a pretty good first attempt at making a game for someone who has no experience doing this sort of thing. At the very least, I'm glad Follin is back doing things in the games industry and I hope he gets the funding and support to make a sequel so we can see what lessons were learned and what improvements can be made\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","October 8, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy detective shows and/or FMV games you'll love this but despite its very simple interactivity there are some major interface bugs. First of all, never EVER click the middle mouse button or the game will reset on you causing you to lose progress. Secondly, there is no option to skip the video if the interface ever bugs out/becomes unresponsive.  Eventually I learned to get through the game by making sure I left click scrolled for everything.\n\nOnce you get past the issues its an incredible game for how little money it was made for, 3000 british pounds. The camera work is top notch and the acting surprisingly watchable which shows the pedigree of the game's maker, a professional DP and British film professional. Leveraging his experience and contacts undoubtedly was the only way the game was made so cheaply. He creates far more of an interesting world and backstory than the game ultimately reveals this time around setting up for a sequel, which hopefully does get made. Ultimately Contradiction is worth supporting so that happens.\n\n8/10 (2 pts off just for the bugginess)","October 23, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tim Follins has figured out a great and simple mechanic to interact with a fairly linear scripted story. Listening to each of the characters detail specific facts only to catch them in a lie is quite rewarding. Although the acting comes across as fairly hammy in the beginning, it grows on you and I'd say works mostly throughout the game.\n\nI played through the entirety of the game with my Girlfriend and we both enjoyed it throughly. The only slight critique I'd have is that the game on occasion requires you to walk around the small village in order to trigger a certain event before letting you continue. There's no real gameplay reason to do this, as the map function conveniently lets you warp most places. In fact, seeing the same travel animations time and time again becomes a little tedious, so it's somewhat counter-intuitive that this is occasionally required for the sake of progression. Perhaps in a future installment the game would force these required encounters if you were to warp past something.\n\nThis is - however - a minor detail and on the whole, it was well worth the money spent. Give it a go. It's the type of game that definately deserves a sequel.","October 24, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They say that this game was created on a tiny budget and it shows but not in any place important.  The actors were very good--they could be (and probably have been) on any quality BBC production.  With a larger budget, they could make the sequel this this truly fantastic.  For example, in this game the characters were always interviewed in the same place.  Ryan seemed to have an endless glass of whiskey over the many hours that the game takes place.  Simon always appears to be in a bright afternoon kitchen even at 11:00 PM.  And Inspector Jenks doesn't have a mobile phone but has to return to a pay phone.\n\nHaving the next sequel end with one of the classic mystery wrap ups where you have everyone in the same room and reveal the actual murderer would cost a lot because you would have to record many different video takes that would not be used.  However, the fun there would be you could replay the ending multiple times.\n\nI played this game with my wife and we enjoyed it as much as a good British mystery series--maybe a bit more because it was interactive.

I wasn’t expecting much from the game. To my delight, Contradiction – Spot the Liar made for an entertaining evening… and late evening… then early morning…  I hooked my pc to the big screen and played along with a house guest who doesn’t play a lot of video games. We were hooked almost from the beginning.\n\nThe navigation is simple and reminds me of DVD games. I thought the gameplay would get dull – location, interrogate, repeat, but the pace of clues and strength of the acting kept that from happening. Like most games that rely on questioning suspects, there are questions the player wants to ask that never come up. As this relies on finding contradictions, this does become more of an issue at times, but not to a point that crippled gameplay. There are lots of red herrings or lines of inquiry that go nowhere. I can’t tell you how many times we picked up an item and said “Don’t forget what Simon said about that. That’s important.” only to have nothing happen. Rather than annoy, it left us with a longing for a sequel.\n\nThe acting is great. I found Jenks’ shoes and hat a bit annoying, and every time he flourished the evidence at a suspect I expected him to say “Is this your card?”, but it added to his quirkiness. Paul Darrow is great. He brings nuance to the role and is still one of the best “reaction” actors I’ve seen.\n\nThe only real downside is replayability. I’d love to get my game night group together to do this, but it won’t be as much fun for me. I’ll still probably do it.\n\nIf I were the producers, I’d make a 20 minute playable demo using the existing material and mechanics to help sell this and get money for a sequel on Kickstarter. Something that shows off the ease of interrogation and introduces most of the characters would be a great marketing tool and short enough to share with friends (particularly the non-gamer 40-55 demo who would love this game if they knew it existed).\n","October 11, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

As other reviewers have noted, the acting is weird, stilted, and melodramatic. Somewhere between a latin soap opera and David Lynch project, set in a rural English town. And the UI is servicable, but not pretty or easy-to-use.\n\nBut the actual act of bumbling through interviews to solve the mystery is exciting in its execution. The game asks you to build a detailed mental model of what's really going on in the town, and rewards you for making remote connections.\n\nAnd one of the more interesting ways it does this is by not letting you "gotcha" a suspect by surprising them with information given by another interviewee. Every character provides plausible responses to each new piece of evidence presented, but is only pressured into breaking character when you actually find contradictions in what they have said themselves.\n\nFor example, say Alice tells you she didn't steal an envelope of cash, but Bob tells you that he saw Alice steal the envelope. You can't do anything with that information. Instead, you must look for contradictions only in Alice's previous statements that would support Bob's story and present them to Alice. It's devilishly clever, and prevents you from blindly progressing in the story without building those connections yourself.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but a really fun way to spend around 5 hours playing goofy detective. And playing with a group is even better.","January 1","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is essentially a throwback to classic FMV games from back in the day. It doesn‘t take itself too seriously but still does have it‘s serious moments. The gameplay is barely existent but that is kind of the point. The gameplay really focuses on the player finding contradictions in people‘s statements and reactions to items you show them and tales that you tell them. My favorite character has to be the main character: Detective Inspector Frederick Jenks, played expertly by Rupert Booth. He does a fantastic job at being serious in most moments but does have his silly moments as well. An honorable mention here would be Paul Darrow as the Atlus money man, Paul Rand.

Contradiction, while it didn't get me into a serious mood, it did get me into a mood that made me really care about Jenks, very invested into Atlus, and wanting to close this case.

I stumbled across this game when I learned that one of my all-time favorite composers, Tim Follin, had returned to the video games industry since "retiring" from it in 2005 after his amazing talents had been wasted on mostly unknown or poorly received games. It was quite to my surprise that Follin was returning to the industry to work on a game not only as a composer, but as a designer and writer as well. So how does a game made by someone with no design experience who's been absent from the industry for 10 years play? It plays about how you'd expect, for better or for worse. It's not all bad though, Contradiction is charming in a unique way that I think can only be accomplished by a first-time designer who, as far as I can tell, has been isolated from the popular design trends, progressions and philosophies that have developed in the last decade or two.\n\nContradiction is a full FMV murder mystery game straight out of the 90s which I admit would have been way more eye-rolling if I hadn't just played the excellent "Her Story". You play as Fredrick Jenks, a British detective who is tasked with investigating a murder in a small fictional village. All locations in the village are essentially still frames, even though some are animated, and you can move between the frames by clicking on UI arrows displayed on the screen which always triggers a short movie of Jenks strolling to where you guided him. While interviewing suspects, Jenks has a list of topics he can ask about which when selected, loads an an FMV scene where Jenks grills the suspect about whatever you selected which often then reveals more topics to ask about. The main gameplay mechanic in Contradiction is to find pieces of the suspect's story that don't quite add up or are downright contradictions, hence the title. Most of the contradictions are pretty logical, but some are a little more of a stretch or are otherwise debatable. Thankfully, this game is pretty generous with hints and gives them to you in a way that doesn't make you feel stupid or like you're cheating. Jenks can go to the phone booth and call his chief who will generally point you in the correct direction to progress the game or also may hint at contradictions suspects have made.\n\nFollin, whose composing career work dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum days, also composed the music in Contradiction. It's not quite as in-your-face as some of my other favorites of his. It's more appropriately subtle and blends in perfectly as Jenks traverses the village looking for clues and interviewing suspects. Aside from the music, the extremely cheesy acting is another standout in Contradiction, especially with the actor portraying Jenks who loves to smirk at his suspects with his trademark goofy deductive grin. In fact, Jenks is so excitably overanimated and the acting in general is so cheesy that it makes me wonder if it was an intentional directorial choice or if Follin actually thought his actors were delivering believable performances. In any case, I'm happy about it. The delightfully cheesy acting seems to fit the style of this game perfectly as does the music.\n\nBut in addition to the cheesy acting, there are several other strange design choices and signs of low budget production you should be at least aware of before playing this game, especially if that sort of thing bothers you. I've heard this game was riddled with UI problems at launch that have since been corrected, but one holdover is the strange combination of topics Jenks can ask about with the physical items he's carrying into one functional grouping. Your items and your topics appear together, but you can't use a topic like an item and most items you can't bring up in conversation, making this a puzzling design choice. I've also encountered a bug a few times where none of the suspect's answers were selectable as contradictions and I had to leave and re-enter the scene in order to fix it. (Minor spoilers ahead). The budgetary constraints this game was made were apparent in the poor sound quality in the FMV scenes but especially obvious in the ending to this game. The latter half of the game really seems as though its building up to something as the plot starts sprinkling in elements of the occult and mysticism. But it's all thrown away at the last second when the murderer is revealed and the game just ends quickly and unceremoniously - but not before strangely setting itself up for a sequel. I later read that this abrupt ending was apparently due to financial constraints and a sequel would only be possible with enough support of the first game\n\nSummary\nIt has design problems, bugs, obvious budget problems and wonderfully cheesy acting but I really enjoyed Contradiction in spite of itself. It was a flashback to the old puzzle games I played as a kid. All things considered, Contradiction is a pretty good first attempt at making a game for someone who has no experience doing this sort of thing. At the very least, I'm glad Follin is back doing things in the games industry and I hope he gets the funding and support to make a sequel so we can see what lessons were learned and what improvements can be made\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","October 8, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Excellent acting and fun characters.  The inspector really carries the story nicely with his Columbo meets David Tennant's Doctor style of acting which was fun, lol.  The plot was not horribly transparent as a lot of detective games tend to be.  The premise is to interview people surrounding a murder and notice contradictions in their statements and turn those around to further question them.  Some of the contradictions will jump right out at you, but others took a bit of thought and re-reading though all the info to figure out.  It was a really good balance between not being to easy and not straining too hard to where it loses momentum.  It took me about 10 hours to play though which was a lot of enjoyment for such a small price tag.

One absurd aspect was the item system that were necessary for the story system - if you found something of someone else's and asked them about it, they would talk about the item and then hand it back to you (the reasoning was anecdotal and completely unbelievable).\n\nAll that said, it was still fun!","April 2","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You progress the story by walking between locations in a sort of Google Maps fashion, and interviewing the characters you find in the hopes of making them contradict themselves. The overall feeling is one that players in the UK will recognize if I say "weekend evening ITV murder mystery". It's a police procedural that has more in common with Poirot than The Bill.\n\nThe core mechanic gets a bit wobbly once you're a couple of hours in, because the list  of available topics is so long that it's impossible to hold it all in your head at once, and spotting contradictions is a matter of scrolling up and down the list, reading off each point at a time until something you spot something. And them hoping that the game recognizes it as a contradiction, because not every instance of contradictory text is necessarily something that will move the game forward.\n\nIt's charming in setting and cinematography, and the acting is winningly hammy, so the niggles with the problem-solving fade away, especially since a lot of it is easy enough that you can just keep propelling the story forward.\n","March 21","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The inventory is mostly for storing different topics to move all the different characters' dialogues.\n\nQuite a few smaller plot threads don't necessarily lead anywhere except in a roundabout way to other clues on semi-related topics you use with different characters than the plot thread originally were about, not really red herrings just stuff that doesn't feel sufficiently followed up on. So there could possibly have been added quite a bit more smaller dialogues for that stuff. And the last few chapters feel a bit short or rushed maybe, the ending is definitely weird and hinges on a pretty random item and a cutscene that kind of forces the ending to happen without a lot of player interaction.\n\nReally like how you get bits and pieces of information from the different characters, but you can't just go around accusing people, you have to catch them all in contradictions of their own. Can only use things said against the person that said it, not what someone else said. So you're always sitting with a bit of a bigger picture informationwise, just drawing your own conclusions from what several people are saying, than you're getting from each character on their own. Really nicely written.\n\nOverall a really fun story with great characters.","August 11, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the genre's best were Spycraft, Titanic, the Elk Moon Murder, and Gabriel Knight II.   The mechanics of those games were complex compared to this game.  They all had varying puzzles relating to dialogue, inventory, and environment.   But the fun thing about them was the same as Contradiction- for each little puzzle you solve, you are rewarded with an entertaining new video segment.\n\nContradiction's simplistic single mechanic (give interviews to find new information, progress by discovering contradictions), puts less of a barrier between you and the next video reward.  It does a great job of keeping the plot moving.\n\nThe director of the game has you watching the faces of each character intently, with close ups on the eyes, and body language cues.

I have been waiting for a game like this for aaages, having loved many FMV games from the 90's and just being a 'whodunnit' fan. Hands down the Brits own this genre of television and to have a game that feels like a juicy Midsomer Murder is awesome. I just wish I knew about the Kickstarter beforehand to support it. The game has a small quaint town filled with moody atmosphere and secrets filmed amazingly in glorious HD. But what got me was using the video to create the 'still' directional screens to show you where to go - added a terrific environmental quality when they could have just used a still image. The acting for this 'low budget' event is actually fantastic, especially Paul and Ryan who had me on the edge of my seat, and of course the detective who I reckon enjoyed every second grilling his costars. Finding items to quiz people is understandably easy as the real crux of the game is trying to finding contradicting evidence in people's testimonies. There are plenty of adventure games where having a large inventory provokes conversation, but this game has managed to use the wonderful performances and nuances of the actors to provide that 'inventory' for you. The game does hint at a sequel but honestly they could create any number of other murder mysteries in other settings that I'd be enormously happy with. Please support this game, burn the pirates, and I hope very soon we see a sequel :) 9.5/10","August 2, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is what the FMV games of old always aspired to be but could never actually quite achieve.\n\nContradiction is a fittingly theatrical experience that plays just like an interactive movie. You play as Inspector Jenks, who is merely a polite and humble police officer going about his job. Little else is shown about Jenks, except for occasionally emphasized spades of moral fortitude and righteous indignation, and helpful hints and speculations in the form of brief inner monologues. His more hollowed out vagueness serves as an appropriate vessel for the player to experience the story in, where the progress of the plot hinges on their every move, while managing to avoid coming off cliche or one-dimensional.\n\nJenks is investigating the death of a young woman named Kate Vine who was found in a lake in the woods, and has less than an entire day to solve the mystery (fortunately, the game does not progress in real time or possess a time limit, or else this would be much more difficult). His suspects and witnesses include a well-rounded cast of characters each with their own quirks and individuality, each of whom are equally amusing and interesting.\n\nContradiction is a thoroughly cerebral experience, as it requires you to constantly remain engaged in every detail you come across, similar to how classic Sierra Adventure games encourage players to explore every proverbial nook and cranny. The game doesn't hold your hand when you feel sure enough to try to figure things out on your own, but will give you just enough information to get back on track when you're stuck. You progress by investigating numerous places and seeking out evidence, as well as interviewing suspects and witnesses and checking the evidence against them, as well as their responses to that evidence, and whether or not their stories add up.\n\nUsing only filmed footage and photographs in place of computer generated graphics, it works remarkably well with presenting a gorgeous environment and sets, along with aesthetically pleasant costume designs. Even more impressively so given that it was all shot on a low budget, funnily enough reminiscent of the kind of thing you might see on BBC.\n\nThe acting may not exactly be Oscar worthy, but is still quite well done. Overall, the game's cinematic presence is easy to appreciate. With just the right balance between a plucky Sherlock mystery and a seedy film noir, it establishes a darkly playful tone, feeling right at home with themes such as the occult and Satanic forces, along with a balanced critique of Objectivism not unlike the first BioShock (major plot points even revolve around an institution called Atlas being run by a father and son team named the Rands; at one point, the phrase "greed is good" is quoted).\n\nFor $9.99, Contradiction is worth the price. The overall length of the game itself may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I believe that it ultimately depends on how quickly the player can figure out what's going on and whether or not they ever want to rely on any hints or cheats. I could also see replay value in trying it again after some time, like The Wolf Among Us, and it would be a delight to share with friends and watching them try to unravel the mystery. The game even ends with the tentative teasing of a sequel, left on such an open ended note that it just begs to be made. This would be an absolute steal on sale, and a solid investment at full price. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I think anyone who likes a good story and a chance to challenge their minds could appreciate it similarly.","July 26, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The contradiction system works superbly 90% of the time, the characters are deep and varied, and new locations open up all the time.\n\nSome will say that the game doesn't hand out enough clues. I'll say this is patently false. On top of the hint system, players can call the Chief, and even get flat-out cheats to help them along when needed. The ever-increasing amount of conversation points also means that the amount of answers to verify grows as well -- but that just means you can't be expected to simply throw statements at one another hoping they will stick. One has to fully remember everything to get around in Contradiction.\n\nThe most disheartening thing I have seen regarding this game is the Rock Paper Shotgun review for it. By saying the game should directly tell the players when new events are available at locations, when contradictions are left to be made -- and with whom -- the author only put his inability to appreciate freedom on display. TellTale's The Walking Dead this is not. This is very much a game, and not an interactive story. The only valid point that review brought forth is the game's technical shortcomings; it is true that the lack of resolution options is jarring, and the general UI and presentation is odd at first. But not only is it absolutely not a deal breaker, I feel like it kind of gave the game a very distinct, simple vibe. It was never distracting or frustrating. It took me a couple of minutes to get used to it, then I never gave it a thought again.\n\nReally, for all fans of classic, hardcore adventure games, looking for a modern take (in terms of presentation) on the classic genre, Contradiction is a gift from the Gods. Do not hesitate. Do not watch trailers. Do not try to know anything about it, except that it is a great, great game. Just dive in, headfirst.

Sound design was equally detailed and amazing.\nThe game guides the player to the solution and it's impossible to improvise, but I don't see this as a bad thing.

You travel back and fourth between various suspects to question about clues that you find or through talking to other suspects. The main aspect that sets Contradiction apart are the full-motion video that feature great actors; my favorites being Jenks and Paul. It does remind me of a beloved series Ace Attorney although it is much more simplified but still enjoyable.\n\nAs the entire game is shot in full-motion video, it is a joy to watch and interact with the game. You can really tell when a character is nervous or lying from their acting. The most endearing part is the investigator, Jenks with his comical expressions.\n\nAlthough this game is quite straightforward and not really a game that you need to replay I think it is still worth playing. I do agree with some that the ending is bittersweet as you slowly uncover deep hidden evils within the settings and characetrs, however I think it is only an encouragement for a sequel that I really hope they will go ahead with.

My husband and I played the game together so we would bandy ideas back and forth, often times reacting to the contradictions we heard in an interview at the same moment.\n\nWe both really loved the setting being in England, and the quality of the video was very good.  I love good crime dramas so this game fit very well into my wheel house.  There was one point where we hit a snag and didn't know how to proceed, but we took a bit of a pause on the game and came back with fresh ideas the next day.  There was something about this game that just made us want to play.  We both would be thinking about "the case" all day while at work and as soon as we could we would come back to playing to see what else we could find.  Both my husband and I would highly recommend this game to anyone.","April 14","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is essentially a throwback to classic FMV games from back in the day. It doesn‘t take itself too seriously but still does have it‘s serious moments. The gameplay is barely existent but that is kind of the point. The gameplay really focuses on the player finding contradictions in people‘s statements and reactions to items you show them and tales that you tell them. My favorite character has to be the main character: Detective Inspector Frederick Jenks, played expertly by Rupert Booth. He does a fantastic job at being serious in most moments but does have his silly moments as well. An honorable mention here would be Paul Darrow as the Atlus money man, Paul Rand. He does a really good job in his role. I won‘t spoil the ending here but, suffice to say, it did surprise me and took me a while to figure it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maverickdelta/recommended/373390/","maverickdelta","maverickdelta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maverickdelta/","140 products in account","The basic mechanism is really just typical "Ace Attorney" gameplay (i.e. finding contradictions) with high quality FMVs story clips.  But unlike games associated with either features, it is not campy.  In fact, its presentation is top-notch.  The cinematics have been framed, edited and treated with exceptional care.  No green screens or CG effects.  No explosions or major action scenes.  The movies avoids the usual trap of taking on a too big of a scope.  It actually looks like a TV movie.  Except that it is not.  It is a game.\n\nBut behind the clips lie a writting team that produced a story that, although quite simple at its core, keeps you engaged like a typical page-turner.  The rich scripts are delivered by superb acting.  Your avatar, Inspector Jenks, at first appears to be a bit too expressive, an over-actor if you will.  But, much like Columbo, his quirks grows on you, and you come to accept his maneurisms (which is good, since you see him all the time...).  Then, unavoidably, there is the sinister Paul Rand, expertly played by veteran actor Paul Darrow.  If you have come to love "Kerr Avon" for his cynicism and egomania, rest asured that Paul Darrow has not lost any of his reptilian flair from his "Blake's 7" days.  The rest of the cast also handles themselves up to par.  No one acts "amateurish"... Well except one "dazed" person, but that could have been intentional...\n\nGameplay-wise, one feature that is THANKFULLY lacking is the dreaded "pixel hunt".  There is none.  When a location needs to be investigated, you do not need to smash the mouse button around the screen like a maniac.  You just simply click the magnifying glass that appears at the bottom of the screen, and Inspector Jenks will then handle the rest.  This allows you to focus on solving the contradictions.  In fact, gameplay can be summarized with A) walking around ( with some fast-travel points to instantly move between locations that are far apart), B) talking to people, and obviously C) finding contradictions (i.e. match two items from a conversation with a character that contradicts each other, exposing a lie...).  There are very little "use-item-here" situations, and when there are, they are quite obvious.  Also, there are no time-based or reflex-based situations either.\n\nHowever, there have been times when I wanted to scream at the game that "THERE IS A CONTRADICTION RIGH THERE", but that being said, I only needed some external help only 3 times along the way, once being my complete ignorance on a certain subject that prevented me from knowing that "such" with "such" was an impossibility.\n\nAlso, although the case do have a sense of closure, you do get hinted that there are more at stake.  So you could say that the ending is... "partial".\n\nHowever, these problems do not diminished the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed my journey through this game.  This is one of the first of recent "serious" FMV games.  Solid production, engaging story and acting, fun gameplay.","February 22","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, the actors are great in their roles and the story gets interesting really fast. There is a hook for a sequel at the end, but the main story concludes in a satisfactory manner.\n\nPros:\n- Really well acted and directed FMV adventure game. Decent soundtrack, too. It's incredible that all this was accomplished on a short budget.\n- Interesting way of navigating around the locations.\n- Virtually no pixel hunting.\n- The UI helps a lot in order not to get stuck - and if you use up hints and chief calls and still don't have clue, there is also a "cheat" system to power through your predicament.\n- It is not really a short game, or at least doesn't feel like it. It takes its time and you get to meet and get to know most of its (multiple) characters quite well.\n\nCouple of drawbacks:\n- The gameplay is mostly backtracking over locations to interrogate/ ask questions based on new info you discover. However, there is a three-level hint system integrated in the game that assures that you will never get stuck\n- 1 or 2 of the (several) contradictions that you are required to spot seemed a bit far fetched.\n\nA definite recommendation from me to anyone who enjoys FMV adventures.","January 31","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The acting is good; the main character overacts a bit, but it actually works well here. This game is great fun, highly recommended!","November 14, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is chock-full of uncooperative characters, all with interesting personality quirks which makes it fun to just question them. In addition, main character Inspector Jenks is such a goofy character, his facial expressions and mannerisms are simply hilarious, reminding me of Columbo in a way. While it might sound like a knock against the game, I find it's quite accurate of the murder-mystery shows on cable TV: the actor does a fine job, as do the various characters.\n\nAs for the technical aspect of the game, it simply looks fantastic. The backdrops' quality are beautiful, the indoor shots are for the most part very well done, and the actors all work very hard to obviously show their hand when you're supposed to pick up on a contradiction.\n\nMy only real issue with the game is that the audio mix is sometimes odd: the voices sound a bit tinny or distorted. In addition, there is a striking lack of sound effects. I feel foley work would've made it even better, or more ambient noise would've helped bring the world to life.\n\nAll things considered, "Contradiction" is a very well crafted game with a strong intrigue and only a few drawbacks. Even the actors, who are quite good at chewing scenery and making the lines about them, manage to turn in a strong performance all-around. It makes them more believable in a way, and more suspicious which is exactly the point of the game. I am definitely looking forward to seeing more FMV (full-motion video) games like this, and I'm hopeful the team at Baggy Cat will have something new for us very soon.","January 15","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The acting is pretty over the top, and most of the performances were memorable. There were a few scenes that are quite a bit too ridiculous, but otherwise most responses and scenes are played out very entertainingly. The general gameplay involved interviewing people associated with a crime and trying to suss out contradictions in what they say. There are a few that are pretty tough, and a few that I feel could have been contradictions but were not counted by the game, and game does suffer from some interface problems, and I do believe two of the tips that I used were a bit broken, but otherwise I think you have an interest in fmv games, over the top acting with a bit of ham, or investigation games in general - check this game out.","January 10","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The year was 1995 and it was a miracle for a child to make a real person move by only a single mouse click. After 20 years, although the video quality is much higher and I am not considered a child anymore, I still enjoy playing FMV games.\n\nFirst of all, this game has a very solid story and good acting. The events and consequences have logical relations and acting is neither ridiculous nor amateur. The cast gives you the feeling that you really are the inspector and they are the suspects.\n\nFurthermore the contradiction finding technique is so cleverly designed, that it makes you feel like you achieved something really important when you find their lies.\n\nOn the contrary the bugs and the "not so easy to understand menu design" are the downsides. Sometimes it is not possible to change the cursor to a hand and one needs to watch one of the former dialogues to fix the issue and exit. The menu is definitely not very user friendly and not so easy to comprehend.\n\nBut still, I respect everyone who contributed this game only because I enjoyed playing it. As I mentioned above, the game is not perfect but it is worth playing, I hope they develop a new game, maybe a sequel or a game with a new story in the nearest future. As a result, in my opinion the developers, cast and the rest of the staff deserve an applause for their effort.

Excellent value for the money at the current price, and must-have if/when it goes on sale. The players are wonderfully odd, and several of them give a lesson in how great actors can be seated most of the time and still chew the scenery. About the right mix of live action and finding contradictions, and the clue system covered just about every sticky point. A little repetitive on comings and goings but transitions are quick, so not much time is wasted.\n\nAs the game description suggests, this would be an excellent game to play through the TV for a group, but probably could not be finished in a single get-together or party setting. Also, I see little replay value unless you want to more closely parse the dialog.\n\nPart of the enjoyment for me was the English village setting, great locale!

The acting is still as amazingly cheesy as it was decades ago but the shots of course look way nicer than before.\n\nI give this a recommendation although I have two major complaints:\n\n1) This will be familiar to players of the Ace Attorney series. Throughout the game you spot contradictions and facts that just don't add up, but you're sadly restricted to point out the contradictions the game wants you to spot at the appropriate times. The game would hugely profit if there was a way to give more freedom to the players and their own wits. Ways to actually FAIL, different ways to tackle the same problem and things like that.\n\n2) Mild spoiler alert. People who want to buy the game should stop reading here.\n\nThe game sets a lot of conflict up and admits itself that Jenks has only scratched the surface of what is going on in the story. This of course stirs the appetite for a sequel but the problem is, that it really devalues the game as a whole. The payoff of the whole murder mystery is quite meager compared to the huge setup(s) which might leave some players dissatisfied at the end.","January 16","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a fun puzzle dynamic that's a little bit similar to something like L.A. Noire, but that requires more actual thinking on the part of the player. The acting is suprisingly really solid, not overly campy or godawful like a 1990s FMV game. The guy playing Paul is freaking intimidating. It's also got some sweet horror elements, and the writing is mostly great. The story is like Law & Order mixed with Call of Cthulhu. If that sounds like something you want to see, you will probably like this game.\n\nIt's also surprisingly long for something that costs $10. It probably will keep most people busy for a good 6-8 hours, depending on how much you cheat. Which is quite a bit longer than most of the Telltale episodes, which usually cost $15.\n\nIf you like detective games, adventure games, or horror, this is a must play.\n","April 22","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters seemed a little flat in all honesty without much in the way of depth to figuring them out and it seemed that this was one of those I need to rush through cases that really didn't need to be rushed and it's rather linear with things being hard to miss and there's not much of a replay value unless you want to work through a speed record.\n\nNow this isn't to say it is a terrible game. The simplicity of it shows care given to the indie style that it is. They went basic and put more effort into the concept of finding the mystery then sending you out and about which shows that while they want to make an awesome game that will last they want you to ENJOY the game which is more than what a lot of indie makers these days seem to do.","June 4","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The scenes and acting were delightful, and I especially liked stumbling across scenes that weren't expected. I'd love to see a sequel!\n\nCritcisms- only that I want to be even more involved in the story than our investigator was! This game definitely walked the tightrope of being too close to simply watching a movie. While I'd say the creators succeeded in avoiding that, I'd like to see the game depart even further from it. I realize that may be pretty difficult, given the nature of the game. There was a lot to keep track of and to keep consistent, and I imagine that's a difficult balance. Bottom line, I'd recommend it.","June 3","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's unique, interesting, and most of all, fun to play. The game comes with a built-in hint and cheat system that is very forgiving; this is in fact one of my two complaints. It feels like mystery games shouldn't be this easy; you get directions and suggestions on where to go anytime for no penalty. My other complaint is that there are parts where it can drag on a bit, but otherwise, it's good.\n\nI definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a new mystery game to play.\n\nAlso, I definitely want a sequel to this sometime.\n\nI will say...okay, I have three complaints. There were times where it took me an unnecessary amount of time to find a contradiction. Some are hard to spot, which is good, but each conversation gives you only tidbits of what was said, and the vague descriptions + vague connections can make figuring it out hard. And you can't contradict between witnesses, you can only find contradictions within the person's own testimony.","June 6","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
