After each level you earn from 1 to 3 stars if you win. And you can spend them on a upgrade tree. You can reset the tree and spend your stars in another way to try a different strategy for a specific level.\nYou can transform your towers into marines basecamp and have soldiers on the battlefield\nReally a lot little nice idea who make this game great\nPolished, bug free\nIt cost only 6$\nI totally recommend this game for any Tower Defense lover.

It's also got a lot in common with Kingdom Rush and that's no bad thing, e.g. in-lane warriors, missile strikes and para-troopers are similar to KR's knights, meteor strike and re-enforcements, but it's all sufficiently different that I feel that this is money well spent.\n\nThe pacing is nice, perhaps a little slow, but some of the linked tower upgrades are fantastic and the pacing might be required to introduce you to them. Linked upgrades mean that you don't just build, say, a flame-tower. Instead you build a MG-tower, upgrade its range, which unlocks a ranger tower. Upgrade the ranger tower with rockets and that finally unlocks the flamer. It's a neat system and reasonably logical so you don't have too much to remember. But it adds flexibility to your strategy overall.\n\nIf you like TD generally and you like Kingdom Rush especially, you'll love this - it's slickly done and dirt cheap for the quality on offer.\n\nA few videos have noted that there's no option to change music/effects volumes, but you can at least togglel each on/off.","September 10, 2015","true","7.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It is more minimalistic, but fits in well to the game.  The interface is sleek and simplistic, One minor issue I had was that you could only increase the time of the round x1, where it would have been nice to have a x2 option. Another small gripe would be that there was no way to tell what type of creatures would be coming up in the next round. It was a bit annoying, as it didn't give me time to prepare for what was coming, and increased my chances of having to redo the level not out of enjoyment, but out of frustration. The two most important factors to consider in a tower defense game are the level design and the tower defense layout, which go hand in hand with each other.\n\nLevel Design;\nThis was done extremely well in this game. Magnificent, even! They did an excellent job of designing each level so that it challenged the player, and accommodated the increase in towers and attack strength as you progressed through the game. I never felt that I was replaying the same levels over again, which is hard to find in tower defense games.\n\nTower Design;\nThis game requires a certain knowledge of what each tower does, and a tactical knowledge of where to place them. The towers are interchangeable, and as you  increase in level, if you want to, you can change the towers to a completely different style. There are large tech trees in this game, with a large variety of different types of towers that you can change to to battle against the different types of enemies. Each individual tower also has a decent selection of upgrades that do an excellent job of increasing the power of those towers.\n\nThere are marine style barracks and outposts, some of which are more powerful than others, which i go over more in my video review. There are also more tech lab style outposts, which offer air assault units (which I found to be largely useless due to poor AI). The variety of attack/ dps/ armor units give more options to defend against different attacks. While there are towers that are stronger than others as the game does suffer from a power creep issue. Although it still comes down to the right placement of the towers on the map. The enemy offers a large, diverse variety of units, that have certain buffs that you need to be ready for.\n\nBosses\nThe bosses are also large and varied, and may require you to replay them. The enemy troops synergize well with each other, more than your towers do with each other. Each level is based on a 3 star rating; the stars can be used to purchase upgrades. You need to have an understanding of tower defense games when you play this game, as it does not start at a noob level, but has a higher entry difficulty bar. The game starts at a moderate level, but quickly increases to a veteran level, then hardcore. You do feel a sense of progression due to this, and the end boss really requires a tactical eye rather than just relying on the skills you have acquired up to that point. The game never wasted my time, which I appreciated.\n\nSummary\nAt the end of the day, the towers may have some issues, but the enemies and levels that you face rotate so that you constantly feel challenged, and keeps you on your toes. The balance between the ascetics, the gameplay, the mechanics, and how it all works together there were no issues. I didn't feel like it wasted my time, or that the hours spent in this game were for nothing.  I can absolutely recommend this game for those who have a base knowledge of the tower defense genre. There is a tactical element required for this game, and this game shines in that respect.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","October 10, 2015","true","19.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Alien Robot Monsters (ARM) is a really addictive tower defence game.\n\nThe goal of each mission is simple. Your base is invaded by swarms of enemy robots and you must fend them off by strategically placing various military towers and tech buildings in the area. The enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, as you'd expect from any tower defence game, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, each of your buildings is made to deal with a certain enemy type better than with others. Getting overrun by hordes of weak enemies? Get yourself some mortar towers. Having trouble with armoured tanks? Build an orbital laser. And so on.\n\nAfter completing each mission, you get a rating out of 3 stars. If none of the enemies got through your defences, you get full 3 stars. If some went through, you get 1 or 2 stars. If too many get through, you lose the mission. The stars are not just there for you to feel proud, either. They're used as skill points to purchase upgrades to your buildings. Hence there's a lot of incentive to do well on each mission and even a chance to replay the harder missions later in order to get a better rating on those.\n\nNormally there's no way of knowing what sort of enemies to expect in each mission, so the latter missions often require a bit of trial and error and can be quite hard. Regardless, I'm having a blast with the game. Fun gameplay and a great presentation. What more could you want?\n\nIf you've ever remotely enjoyed any tower defence games, give this one a try. It's really cheap and affordable despite its high quality.","September 12, 2015","true","33.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It is in the puzzle genre within tower defense (as in you cannot place towers everywhere so you have to make good decisions and tactics are important). Difficulty is well balanced and its easy to get into. There are only some moments where the curve increases a bit but you can always ask for help at the forums (helpfull community and the dev too).\n\nThere are plenty of towers and lots of variety between them (for example there are towers that spawn marines which can actually stop enemies or e.g. have abilities like laying mines). There are plenty of maps (~35). Maps are not too long so it doesn't get boring. The enemies are also varied.\n\nAnd finally you get 'star' points after winning a level which you can use for upgrades which give you a passive bonus on each map or give you an active ability.\n\nI would give it a 9.

There's one small problem, there seems to be robotic inhabitants that keep attacking you at every turn as you try to carve out a place to live, and of course build defenses to protect those who came with you.\n\nI'm not going to lie, you're playing as the "asshats" in Alien Robot Monsters. You land on this planet get attacked and then you retaliate, that makes total sense, but then to go on the offensive and decide that you are going to commit basically genocide seems a bit rough.\n\nNow of course we are talking about a fictitious world, and of course this is just a scenario to help you into the story of a tower defense game. In this game you will be unlocking upgrades to your towers, as well as upgrades to units that you'll be able to utilize later in the game. You are given specific locations where you will be able to place your towers, so even if you have extra scrap metal (that's the currency) that you could use to purchase a tower, once all the spots are filled you are going to have to either blow up an existing tower, or just work with what you have.\n\nThis game is quite challenging and you will definitely have to pay attention to what is coming at you down the predetermined paths. I will say that there is definitely a balance needed between what type of towers you have out there as well as the order in which you upgrade them. You're going to get a basic tower with two gunmen to start off but as you progress deeper into the game you're going to be able to change that tower into many different types of towers, some of them will have units that you'll be able to place outside of the tower to try to take on the enemies as they come. There will also be towers that will shock your enemies, literally, and though expensive, a very good addition to have on the maps to help you through some of the tougher spots.\n\nOne of the things I do like is the fact that there is a little bit of customization that is done between levels. You can decide how you use your victory stars. For each level you will get 1 to 3 for successfully getting through the level. Now of course you're going to want to have every level give you 3 stars, but lets be honest there are sometimes when you just misjudge the enemy and a couple slip through, ruining your perfect run on that level. Have no fear though you can gain those missing stars with a replay.\n\nAnyways you will use the stars to upgrade damage by weapons, unit health, more scraps collected per kill, etc. I personally like to at least get the base level of each upgrade but there's definitely reason to try to max out one upgrade before giving the rest some attention, its all in the way you play, and I think for this reason it definitely caters to the player.\n\nThe graphics aren't going to blow you away, but the overall flow and design that you are presented with looks great. I do enjoy the fact that there are enemies of all shapes and sizes and that each out is truly different, be it in speed, attack, or durability. There's also bosses that you need to be concerned with, if you survive specific levels you will find, after the final wave, that there's one more monster that wants to destroy you, get through that and you're well on your way to victory.\n\nThis game can be your's right now on Steam, and if you are a tower defense type of person, this is something that you're going to want to add to your collection. So with that being said I'm going to give this game an 8.7 out of 10.","September 28, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumorig/recommended/391250/","kumorig","kumori","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumorig/","926 products in account","Very solid tower defense. Most levels are challenging and you have to try many different strategies before you find one that fits. The progression is not immensly original but at least it's decently interesting. You get more stars if you ace a level. You can then spend said stars on a dozen different upgrades - all resettable at the click of a button. So you can change up your strategies a lot and it gives you a strong incentive to go back and clear earlier levels 100% to give you a better chance at the later ones.\n\nAs the sucker I am for achievements I enjoyed how you can complete pretty much all of them in one playthrough. (So yeah maybe a bit on the easy side.)\n\nThe bad stuff:\n* The controls and UI feels like a bad port from a mobile game. The tapping (upgrading towers, troop rallying) and swiping (map scroll) would make sense on a tablet or phone but feels stupid on PC. There are also many missing keyboard shortcuts and nothing is rebindable. This is easily my biggest gripe with this game.\n\n* I have found no way to see what in-game upgrades carry over when you evolve your tower into a new type. Range upgrades sometimes carry over and sometimes not. Amount of marines in a tower sometimes carries over and sometimes not. Even if you learn with time you'd still expect to be able to see what active upgrades a tower has (in the tower stat screen perhaps?). This is inconsistant and very annyoing early on.\n\nThe linearity of skills and upgrades *seems* to be boring and underwhelming, but the strength of the game is the time you spend figuring out what towers/upgrades are the most exploitable in any given situation so perhaps the subtle ramping in upgrades is one of the game's strengths. (But some progression upgrades certainly feel superfluous!)\n\nTo sum things up:\nEven with the bad points I think it's safe to assume that any real fan of tower defense will enjoy this title immensly - I recommend it even at full price.","February 13","true","49.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Game presents a steadily rising challenge with tower choices where there are no universal winners in lane clearing power thus requiring experimentation and adaptation for each level if you want to get through all levels undamaged.\n\nEach tower is sufficiently different from another and in some cases even benefit from manual control from the user as in the case of redeployable marines and their derivatives. There are multiple cases where the optimal solution consists of re-prioritizing their focus in mid-level. Upgrading towers doesn't simply increase damage and range, but ofter changes completely the mode of operation. A great example of this is that one upgrade path from the tech tower is a satellite-based weapon that shoots any targets from off-map. There's also units that are resilient or weak to certain types of damage.\n\nIn many strategic games the main focus is in gameplay leaving visuals and audio as secondary, but in developers of ARM have not taken a shortcut here. The soundtrack is great, I like the voicing with the humour it has, sound effects are lively and the semi-retro 2d graphics fit the game perfectly.\n\nMy verdict for ARM is that it’s a solid tower-defence which doesn’t try to be all around revolutionary, but does everything it strives for with top-notch quality without compromises.","November 27, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd say it has 20 hours of content to play through all the way once the first time.  That's what it took for me anyways, and I didn't succeed at every level the first time I played them.\n\nThe music of some levels seems a bit reminiscent in parts to the old "Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan" in a space voyage-like theme.  Blue marines shooting at the robots is reminiscent of old school starcraft.\n\nIf you like tower defense, I'd say this is one to pick up for sure.  If you want a fairly low-key game you can pull out, play a little bit, and then extricate yourself this is also a really great choice for anyone.\n\nIf you get stuck on a level, just try something different.  There actually are different ways of beating the harder levels, despite some people thinking otherwise.  I've come back and replayed this a few times, so I know.\n\nThe other big complaint some people have is that the harder levels are not all at the end.  They are sprinkled in different places in the game.","April 26","true","63.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the most diffucult tower defense game ever. I doubt that there will ever be a harder tower defense game than 'Alien Robot Monsters'.\n\nIn principle the game is fun and comes with the typical addiction tower defense games offer. Graphics are fine and the music is very good. Towers and enmies are interesting. And although I really like tower defense games 'Alien Robot Monsters' was a rather painful experience.\n\nThe problem with this game is that it only allows one solution. You have to play maps again and again and again to find out which setup works. IMO that's not how a tower defense game should work. If you look at 'Defense Grid' you can use tons of different approaches to beat maps. 'Defense Grid' does not let you down. It allows you to experiment and reach your goal with different strategies. This is not the case for 'Alien Robot Monsters'. There is only one way and you have to find it in order to collect three stars on a map. It's like a racing game with 200 different cars but all players select the same car because it's the only car that allows you to compete with other players. Try 'The Crew' to find out more.\n\nI consider a game a good game if it's fun. 'Alien Robot Monsters' caused me far too much frustration to recommend the game. Since I do not want other players, especially not friends of mine, to go through the same painful experience, I can not recommend the game. There are very many other tower defense games available that simply do better than 'Alien Robot Monsters'. But if you feel like Superman or like playing single maps for hours again and again, go ahead and try. You have been warned.","February 1","false","38.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"
