Some comments in the comment section may not add up to things written here, now that I actually finished playing through the steam port.\n\nWith that said,  Let us begin and keep this short because english isn't my native language and the grammar mistakes become more apparent if I keep going on any longer. This is my final impression after playing through this on the regular difficulty.\n\nLike I said before, this game originally came out on Nintendo's handheld the 3DS and was followed by a sequel a couple of months after. This game is an action-rpg that puts high emphasis on a tower-defense-, arcade-like feeling and stage progression. It was a nice little game that worked they way it was intended to be, but didn't really stood out and was good for short sessions... on a handheld!\n\n--------------------------------\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\n+ Colorful 8-bit graphic for characters\n+ Minor changes in graphics and animation\n+ Instead of two screens you get one with everything\n+ The use of both sticks for each character instead of the shoulder buttons\n+ Controlling two characters works fine and isn't confusing for hands and eyes\n+ Arcade-like RPG with stage progression\n+ Time attack and survival mode after playing through the game once\n+ A game for short sessions in between\n+ Easy to get into\n+ The cheat codes from the 3DS still work on this version\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n- The use of 8-bit character sprites doesn't fit in some parts with the 16-bit backgrounds of the stages\n- Stage backgrounds really look like they came straight out of RPG-Maker\n- Minor changes in graphics and animation, which doesn't amount to anything\n- You can control two characters, but you don't have to. Just set the witch on wind magic and you don't have to aim at all and got one hand free for other stuff\n- The final and only true boss battle has become insultingly easy after a certain change in the port\n- Despite the arcade-like nature of the game, you will get bored after a short while\n- No reward in playing through the game and that "unlockable function" was not worth it\n- Time attack and survival mode should feel like rewards, but they don't...\n- The "cheat codes" unless they added new ones, are actually the friggin' difficult settings of the game\n- It gets really repetitive after a while, but that was a also a problem of the handheld version\n- The (to me) useless update for the screen size to be changed through Alt+Enter, despite the fact that the size could already be changed through pressing F1 on the keyboard. Unfortunaly the instructions for this are almost completely obscured by the english title on the title screen and only become visible after changing the language to either japanese or chinese! Seriously, WHY!?\n- Barebones option menu that only allows you to change either language or which stick should be used for either of the two characters\n- The game sound cannot be changed from within the game itself\n\n--------------------------------\n\nOVERALL:\n\nWell, that final impression turned out to be mor negative than my initial first impression of the steam port. And yet it still gets the thumbs up from me. Why? Because I still enjoyed the game for what it was even though some flaws became more apparent on the bigger screen. The game really works as a nice little distraction for a few minutes and just like on the 3DS, everything works the way it was intended to be. It's just a shame that the game feels like it has less to offer on the big screen than on two tiny ones.\n\nIf you already own the original and the sequel on 3DS, then there is no reason to buy the steam port. Those who don't own any of the two games, should really consider if there isn't any better alternative to this.","April 22","true","3.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","3"

If you do not expect much more than that, this action-rpg may be enjoyable.\n\nI loved to grind some stages on the 3DS being on the move. Unfortunately it does not feel the same on the PC screen. The controls are okay on the stages, but somehow inaccurate inside the shop. There are no relevant ingame settings, just a quick resolution change was added.\n\nSadly the Game appears to not support proper keyboard input. You'd be stuck in the title screen searching for the "start button". My wireless 360 controller does work, if turned on before starting the game.","April 25","true","2.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
