"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyoob/recommended/278970/","kyoob","Mr. Blue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyoob/","59 products in account","This game looks like a d!ck. Literally. On every server, wherever it is located (although most servers are located in Russia), there are always tons of d!cks around the map.\n\nNow for the actual review. When I first played this game, I was like "WUT" for the first 37 minutes.\n1. You have to pay:\na) for blocks\nb) for block shapes\nc) for how long this item is to stay in your inventory (seriously?)\n2. You can't mine, you can only build (d!cks) and destroy.\n3. The only option for map size available is "Small". A funkin' countryhouse is bigger than this map.\n4. 6-year old players (yes, really).\n5. If you try to use your microphone, it will tell you to allow access in the next window. Dang it, that's a port of a browser game. In Steam. Robin, I'm disappoint.\n6. Character models look funked.\n7. Actually, everything looks funked.\n8. Don't try to play this "game" after watching its trailer. Really, just don't.\n9. Oh, good old "УХАДИ" jokes. Shouted outloud by 9 year olds.\n10. Also, about 9 year olds: they mostly use foul language. Just tell one of these that you heard their Mom return in the background of their voice, and they'll shut up for a moment. It works.\n11. You can't place blocks underneath yourself.\n12. Don't attempt to build a house - it WILL be destroyed no matter how nice it looks.\n13. Trying to ban a person that has destroyed your house if you host a server turns into a pretty bad idea on a server with many people. Just because you can't see nicknames.\n14. Don't try to kill a player. Nothing will happen.\n15. Mine dirt with a pickaxe. Just because it's great.\n\nSo these are my impressions on this game so far. Dear Gabe Newell, please delete this piece of poop.","June 7, 2015","false","0.7"," 816 of 858 people (95%) found this review helpful 278 people found this review funny","95","816","858","278","16"

But this is a large piece of ♥♥♥♥. It's a Minecraft clone made by russian who opened Unity at first time and then put his fat drunkn butt over his keyboard and made some poo. So, finaly, we have what we have - a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone of a good game.\n\nPros\n- russian spirit\n- The game has no attitude to rotten West, is completely ortodoxal / communist / putinistic (how their religion is called now?)\n\nCons\n- Microtransaction for every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ item. In Minecraft you can get item by crafting or digging it. And here blocks just... disappear. Of course you have some building bricks and they are endless, so...\n\n- Hollowness. This game is all about making ♥♥♥♥♥ of wood. I'm sorry but it happens on every server. Hundreds of them are everywhere. Why? Because there is nothing to do. But when you pay money... well, then you will be the worst man ever, having supported these crapmakers for an extra voxel.\n\n- Tiny worlds. In Minecraft the world is huge with numerous places to explore. And here we are given quite enough space for typical russian activity - making ♥♥♥♥♥. 100 sq. m. It isn't enough even for a normal castle (it's impossible to build one, at first because of microtransactions)\n\n- That stupid design made by drunkn, mentall ill, handless russian (i've mentioned how). Proportions of characters are like of a baby (sometimes looks creepy). And these psychodelic edgy models... Give me 3dMax and I'll make something better.\n\n- That unique society of russian 9 year old kids. I've spent some time to translate what they're shouting all the time... so here we have top 7 of words spoken by them:\n1. Ebat' - ♥♥♥♥\n2. Hui - ♥♥♥♥\n3. Idi na hui - f*** you / go away\n4. svali ili uebu - go away or i'll kill you\n5. azazaz - lol\n6. uhadi - go away\n7. uhadi ili ban - go away or i'll ban you. (The speaker knows only that ban is a very harmful thing and nothing more)\n\nAfter 15 minutes of hearing this I want a nuke and some changes in russian education. 80% of words spoken by 9-10 year old kids are foul language or referenced with sex. Is it OK?\n\n- English translation. It's made in Google Translate. Or sometimes not made at all.\n\n- Hatred to european players (schoolboys shouting "♥♥♥♥ America", "western gay", *untranslatible words in russian* and so on).\n\nI can rate it only -10/10. What can I say in conclusion? I have to get refund for 11 hours of learning russian instead of sleeping (Or, to say truth, sleeping while the game was launched. I had to write this wall of text). And for psychic damage too. I must do a virusscan. Better play Minecraft. And finaly, Steam, remove this crap.","June 3, 2015","false","11.5"," 159 of 187 people (85%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","85","159","187","72","26"

Well I got the crosshair no viewmodel and I couldn't shoot, so I just gave up.\n\nThis game is bad, just get minecraft and if your too poor then go play Growtopia or Cubic Castles or just crack Minecraft,\n\nThis game is BAD, like not even good I give this game a F for eFFort. ( They probably didn't put any effort into it but still. )\n\nEDIT 1: I actually found out you had to get the gun at the store to use it, thats stupid, they didn't give me any warning? Did they think I was like, huh picked my name, LETS BUY A GUN, my mindset was on building stuff, and this game is on Facebook where the casuals are at, this is a bad design decision.\n\nEDIT 2: This game is paid now, absolutely awful desgin decision ( game was free before ) maybe you could've bought the "paid game" inside the game and get a free experience? But nope, now even less people are going to play this game and if you got the game free before its locked, good job, now this game isn't even worth getting for a laugh, just get a better game.","June 12, 2015","false","0.1"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","57","65","12","26"

There are many better games to spend 10 dollars on, avoid this one at all costs.\n\nReview\nThis game is bad. Really bad. And I'm going to tell you why.\n\nFirst off, the game is just slow. Not just in-game during matches, but in the menus as well. Some buttons take multiple clicks to work or don't work at all. During matches, the characters move incredibly slow. The controls feel extremely sluggish; aside from mouse control. There is no sprint, so you're stuck walking everywhere at a snail's pace with every step feeling awkward.\n\nThis game is the very definition of pay-to-win. You start off with a Luger pistol and that's the only weapon available to you at the start ( aside from the Pickaxe ) that you don't have to buy. You go into the shop and notice all of the more interesting and fun weapons are either locked or are too expensive. In order to buy anything worthwhile in the store, you'd have to spend hours upon hours playing this arduous and monotonous game. Gold and experience takes ages to obtain. Not even kidding, for every kill you get, the game awards you 0.5 gold and 1 experience point.\n\n0.5 gold.\n\nMy first and only match of this game I played, I earned a total of 9 gold. I was not at the bottom of the leaderboard, mind you, no I topped my team's leaderboard and I was rewarded with 9 gold. Weapons that cost up to the hundreds and thousands in gold currency and I get 9 gold. The game gives you the option of paying  REAL  money for it's premium currency to get these weapons faster, but ♥♥♥♥ that. Who in the right mind would spend actual money into this filth?\n\nThe game modes are nothing special. You have your build mode, which is like the mode in Brick For- Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is Brick Force. Well, a much less polished Brick Force, but a Brick Force nonetheless. Anyways, there's Hide and Seek, Team Match, which is your run of the mill team deathmatch ( which I played ), and all the other game modes you've come to enjoy in much better games.\n\nIf you value your time, don't waste it playing this game. It's boring, slow, and is yet another attempt to try rob you of your hard-earned cash. If you want a similar free-to-play game that's much better and not pay-to-win, try out Brick Force. It's right here on Steam, if I'm not mistaken, and it's what this game tried to copy, so it must be something decent if Russians are copying it.","June 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","27","30","5","0"

This was exuseable when the game was free. But, it's currently 10 dollars. This game is not worth any of that.\n1: The entire game is in pretty much russian. Any and all servers you go to will have russian players. You will have no clue what they're even saying. Which hurts a english speaker such as myself.\n2: Minecraft clone, It's not even a medicore Minecraft Clone such as Block Story.\n3: The game is way to confusing for new players. All the help you will recive is in Russian. Meaning if you can't read russian, your going to have to play the game to figure out this game's controls.\n4: Getting into a server with your friends is impossiable. This game doesn't have Steam invites or Steam joining. Which also means no VAC. Which means hackers.\n5: The free to play mechinics. Need I say more?\n\nAll in all, this game isn't worth 10 dollars. Heck, H1Z1 will give more play time than this piece of broken programming. So, DO NOT SPEND 10 DOLLARS ON THIS GAME. Save it.

This wouldn't bother me if I hadn't told the game to start in English through steam\n- Even after changing language, a lot is still in Russian or poor english\n- I don't have weeks to grind to unlock a single building block "forever"\n- I can unlock things for a day or a week, awesome\n- The vote kick system for "cheating" is broken. Don't do well in your games or you're likely to get vote kicked\n- Making money is extremely tedious considering how expensive everything is\n- The fighting is a super boring and unbalanced, I can run around with my "knife" and do better than a machine gun\n- "Oh!

I normally would say hey its free so it cant hurt to try it but this game hurts. It feels as if it should be in early access but it's not.. You can go play minecraft with mods or plugins and have a much smoother and better time. It has ideas that could be good but are done in  all the wrong ways. There are parts even after you change the language to english that are still not translated and incorrectly done so at times. Yes it starts in another language and you have to navigate and find the language setting. (Its not too hard, its the gear icon and there is only like 7 settings and only 2 of them could be it). Oh and the spawn camp it real... The team deathmatch or team battle takes way too long to finish. Guns are expensive and not easy to get and anyone who has one will always beat you. The building mode is very boring and basic and has no point until you get money to buy blocks. They have other modes but honestly i was done at this point. Tried there hunger games and well... go play minecraft its just much better.","June 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think this is what it was suposed to do. It is taged as a horror game. Also the players do not react to certan text. Also when I change it to english people speak russian, when I change it to russian it becomes english. This leads me to beleive they are just AI's so if that was his goal I reccomend this game, if not YOU FAILED! And I do not reccomend this game. Nothing else to say besides that not even a score, just me going insane.

I embraced the russians and their language, I even learnt some things from them. I will sure use this in CS:GO.  I spent 10% of the time in a lobby of DiggerOnline and it felt like I was the only one in the world playing it at that time "Online". 50% of the time was spent on loading screens. That is not much compared to the titles which came out in 2015. And the last 40% were spent in google translator while I was trying to change the main language. And somehow I failed and was left with half-russian, half-english язык.\n\nI think it is time to wrap this review up as I spent more time writing it that playing the game.\nPros:\nLong loading screen,thus you can beat yourself in that time\nYou can use this game as a secondary source for learning different languages\nYelling the name out loud 10 times will make you the best digger online.Cons:\nI was looking for a minecraft clone, but I ended up with a game which I was not expecting.\nI was looking for a COD clone, but I ended up with a game which I was not expecting.\nNo kung fu fighting techniqueAll in all, the game was not bad in 1 minute playtime, therefore i recommend it.

Also, many of those block types have to be bought with in-game money, along with skins, weapons, and decorative items. Ultimately, this game has a lot less freedom of customization than minecraft. Additionally, this game seems to be a frankenstein-esque  merging of survival and creative mode, adding unlimited building, but still having to slowly chop through trees and climb, block by block, if you would want to go someplace high off the ground. Finally, this game has a community with so many griefers and trolls, I had to set my world so that no one else could edit blocks. If you want a free block world game, I'd suggest Cubic Castles.","June 17, 2015","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(This can be changed)\n2: Even on the english setting the instructions are in russian\n3: It's hard to build anything due to a lack of "Nerd Poleing"\n\nConclusion...\nIt is a good game for a New gamer who has limited funds or is new to the P.C however is limited due to microtransactions for items and the menus being in russian at heart. This would be a great game with the following proposals:\n1: Translate the instructions and place them under a controls tab.\n2: Add more variation to the starter blocks and make the blocks you have to pay for free but hard to aquire\n3: I am unsure if the feature was in place at the time of my review but perhaps add a free flying ability\n4: Something to set it apart from the other block placing games like customizable vehicles or even a more exploration based theme.\nI know that game development is hard, especially in small groups but I believe that with some fine tuning this game could be a winner. The only improvement I can suggest that I truly hope makes it, eventually, into the game is that it takes a step away from minecraft and loses the blocky charm in favour of a more rounded theme just to give it some edge over the competition. Overall it is a fun game with only a few small issues and is fun to play alone or with friends.\nI give it a 2.5/5 so your half way there. Keep up the hard work and I hope you take my reconmendations on board,\nNuke_Dwarf_","June 2, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(This can be changed)\n2: Even on the english setting the instructions are in russian\n3: It's hard to build anything due to a lack of "Nerd Poleing"\n\nConclusion...\nIt is a good game for a New gamer who has limited funds or is new to the P.C however is limited due to microtransactions for items and the menus being in russian at heart. This would be a great game with the following proposals:\n1: Translate the instructions and place them under a controls tab.\n2: Add more variation to the starter blocks and make the blocks you have to pay for free but hard to aquire\n3: I am unsure if the feature was in place at the time of my review but perhaps add a free flying ability\n4: Something to set it apart from the other block placing games like customizable vehicles or even a more exploration based theme.\nI know that game development is hard, especially in small groups but I believe that with some fine tuning this game could be a winner. The only improvement I can suggest that I truly hope makes it, eventually, into the game is that it takes a step away from minecraft and loses the blocky charm in favour of a more rounded theme just to give it some edge over the competition. Overall it is a fun game with only a few small issues and is fun to play alone or with friends.\nI give it a 2.5/5 so your half way there. Keep up the hard work and I hope you take my reconmendations on board,\nNuke_Dwarf_","June 2, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's okay but, it is a glitchy game. Here is one they need to fix. If you take a cheeseburger or a turkey and keep putting under you, then you fly. That's a weird glitch. By the way, Diamonds are hard to get, and most cost diamonds. Also, you need to buy blocks with coins and if you don't have coins, you have to wait a day or you can buy it with real money. These are the reasons I don't like this game.\n\n\n-Lucky","July 5, 2015","false","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
