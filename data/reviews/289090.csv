Not quite as difficult as other hand simulator games like it, but also not fun at all.  Swiping the arm quickly across the table and knocking everything off in a fit of rage is probably the most fun thing to do.  Also, very buggy.  Your arm will randomly go all the way through items and then get stuck in them, and other game breaking weirdness with the hand.

The first thing you are greeted with after launching the game is a poorly textured language selection screen, after which you are thrown into a room as a prosthetic hand, and tasked with making tea according to the instructions. This clearly looks like YouTube bait and/or an engine test.\n\nComparisons may be drawn to Surgeon Simulator. It involves the same idea where you control each digit of the hand with a separate key and are tasked with fulfilling a task requiring very precise control. The difference however, is that Surgeon Simulator looks and feels more competent, more streamlined graphics, physics, sound and control-wise while also offering a ton of more content than Ampu-Tea.\n\nI sadly cannot recommend this title. It first struck me as being incompetent, but what pushed the limit was one nasty achievement involving launching the game 500 times. I am most certainly not exaggerating. The reason why I have a full 2 hours of gameplay on this title is because it took just an hour for my botting script to execute the game another 499 times.","February 9, 2015","false","2.0"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","26","36","6","0"

Let's start with running the game, first you get greeted with video/graphics settings then when you hit "play game" or whatever it says, the screen is blank with a white banner for some, but for others, you see language options nd the actual intro which is like 5 seconds and the sounds are loud as ♥♥♥♥. After that, you sit there for like 30 minutes waiting for it to verify that the game is an actual copy, so you can't play offline. After that, the game starts instantly and you are shown a blueprint of the controls, and you notice how limited your movement is (You can only move up and down, or rotate your hand and you can only open and close your hand, but two of the fingers are the same key) and that the controls are real ♥♥♥♥. Once you play, it seems fine until you try and grab a mug where you have two possibilities the entire shelf falls off and you have to reset the game, or if you manage to grab a mug, your fingers will clip right through the handle or stick to you. If you manage to get the mug on the table, you have to put in a teabag and water before anything else, or that will be all you need to do sometimes. Trying to get the teabag in your hand is tough because with your limited movement and bugginess of the game, it will keep slipping through your hands (I once got it in my hands, but the game bugged out and everything on my table either fell off or tipped over) then you have to get your mug under the water dispenser, which has a sign tht prevents you from ever being able to put the mug in the right spot for the water.

Superman 64 was more enjoyable (I own it). I even have Day one Garry's Incident and that game was more playable than this piece of trash. The camera angle is so awkward and bad, It needs to be a first person perspective, not a sideview of a robot arm. I wasted so much time trying to grab stuff with the awful robot hand, only to constantly knock everything over when i grab it or break the robot hand. It has a bunch of terrible memes in it to like *Epic Fail* which describes this game just fine.

Where Surgeon Simulator 2013 is hard to control, this one adds another obstacle - bugs. I have, for example, literally turned my hand into an endlessly spinning propeller by trying to turn it. While this may at first sound mildly amusing, it unfortunately isn't, since the graphics craps out as well.\n\nOh, yes - the graphics. Not only does it look really poor, even if you crank the settings to max, but it lags and stutters so much most of the time, that it would have been unplayable, had there been any play to be had. And mind you, I'm running it on a Core i7 4820K running at 4.6GHz, with 16GB RAM and an AMD R9-290 GPU. I'd hate to try it out on a less powerful system.\n\nSo my only advice is to stay away.

Environment looks nice.\n\nCONS: Amputees struggling in rehabilitation may not be the most tasteful punchline a game could be based off of. More importantly however, the game controls awfully. One might say it was meant to be this way, however games like Octodad and Surgeon Simulator control well... Just clunky to the point of humor. Movement in Ampu-Tea however, is sluggish and often unresponsive. Reeling in fingers to grip is so slow that your fingers will push the item out of grasp. Items will also stick to the hand. Physics move the room about even if you're afk. Sometimes you're notified when you fail immediately, sometimes it waits to notify you at the very end.\n\nOVERALL: This game may stave off boredom for 15 minutes or so, but is not worth full-price by a long-shot.

It's at times like these that I wish Steam had the option for a neutral review.\n\nPaying homage to fan favourite and viral classic Surgeon Simulator 2013, Ampu-Tea (LOL VERY PUNNY) is a tea-making simulator. Like SS2013, you need to use both your hands to control a solitary left arm. (Which, in this case, is robotic, and unlike SS2013, it can be VERY fragile. Don't hit it too much on stuff or it will break and you will have to restart the level.) The control schemes for both games are roughly very similar, and this review will be littered with a lot of comparisons between the two games.\n\nUnfortunately, while SS2013's controls, though awkward, still had reasonable control, this game practically throws all semblance of control out of the window. You'll be in for a torrid time if you try to grab anything with your hand's fingers. I've tried quite a lot of times and I have to say that I've NEVER, in my 2.5 hours of playing this, successfully gripped or picked up the cup. Or anything else for that matter. I've had to resort to pushing the cup around with my arm then pushing the tea ingredients into/near the cup.\n\nAlso unlike SS2013, you can only do one thing in this game, and that is to make tea. This makes the game potentially frightfully short, depending on how skilled or lucky you are. All you can change is whether or not you add milk or sugar. There are 2 achievements where you need to add milk and sugar, but after those are done, there's not much point to playing on the harder difficulties.\n\nWhy did I give this game a barely passing grade though? Because, like SS2013, there is this sense of hilarious illogicality, only this time, it's more subtle. Remember what I said about pushing the cup and the ingredients into each other, with the cup on its side? Well, it turns out that you can complete the game this way if you can really find no way to lift the cup and ingredients properly. Just imagine: your hot water and cold milk exist as orbs. You nudge the cup along and miraculously the liquid orbs somehow land up in your cup. And when you imagine that if this was an actual tea simulator, the tea would have long spilt by now! Oh well, glad to see that it's at least forgiving in that regard.\n\nAnd, unlike SS2013, you can flip the whole damn table if you screw up your tea in epic fashion.\n(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)\n\nIt's enough for me, at least, to overlook its massive shortcomings. But only barely so.\n\nWhen to buy: I'd recommend picking this up as part of a bundle. Depending on your tolerance, skill and/or luck, this game will either have you ragequit after the first hour, or finish it within 2 and a half (like I did), which means very short gameplay time on average.\nActually, scratch that. I'd recommend picking up SS2013 instead. You'll have a lot less frustration (and a lot more laughs).\n\n5.5/10\n\nLike indie games?

You could call it an arm simulator because really that's all it is; a strange tea-making arm simulator. It's got quite the learning curve as well, it's very difficult to begin with a takes a bit to master. Depending on how quickly you learn proper control or if you've played a similar game (Surgeon Simulator anyone?) you'll find that even after gaining control over the arm the game will sometimes decide you've broken it. Combined with the utter lack of a story, other than making a stinking cup of tea with about three variations to it infinitely or until the game decides to break your arm whilst simply pushing the button for water or milk. The game overall has a simple look, nothing special but not overly boring. The music and sounds are pretty dull and lackluster, not really fun to listen to or a joy to hear. I would say that the game is quite the ridiculous oddity, but at the same time I'd say you could pass the game up and not miss much. Overall the game is not long, it only took about 2 hours to complete all of the achievements as well as multiple cups of tea. I still find it frustrating after finally being able to make the cup of tea you're completely unable to enjoy it. Buy the game when it's on sale if you really think you have to play it, there are plenty of other games you should pay full price for.\n\n☆☆★★★ Overall  ☆☆★★★ Gameplay  ☆☆☆☆★ Story  ☆☆★★★ Graphics  ☆☆☆★★ Sounds  ★★★★★ Oddity  ☆☆☆☆★ Length","September 1, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The premise seems like great fun. But the harsh reality is, this game belongs in the trash.\n\nAs soon as you launch, you're greeted by a nice splash screen with the controls, and a diagram of the robotic hand. That's very nice, and all. I approve of that.\n\nOn closer inspection, the controls are about as ergonomic as one of those cheap silicone keyboards. F1 to F5 are various menu things, like restarting the game, and changing difficulty. I'm not particularly fond of this, as using QWER for the hand doesn't make much sense, when Surgeon Sim is more ergonomic, and makes more sense.\n\nDifficulty is changed simply by adding one more step to making your tea, which makes sense. I can't complain there.\n\nThe graphics feel cheap, and misplaced. Some are fantastic, some are blurry, and look like they're in low-res.\n\nI'll also like to note that the noises your hand makes are so annoying, I just up and muted the game from volume mixer.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to note that I grabbed a cup, and my hand clipped through the mug, threw it into the air, and my hand continued to spin for 10 minutes, until it fell off.\n\n19/10.

It's a Surgeon-Simulator clone and a poor one at that. I do not know wether it is bugs or intentional, but when I played this game the "hand" was VERY prone to bug out, it would suddenly spin totally out of control without any buttons being pressed and at times would completely ignore button presses. At other times the "hand" simply clipped or got stuck and would then throw the object across the room, which is VERY agrivating when you were just about to place the cup on the tray in order to serve the tea, completely wasting what ever time and luck you had used prior. What should be a challenge turns into pure frustration, even in "easy" mode.  In my opinion the money would be better spent on Surgeon Simulator, which is far more responsive and is way less frustrating, though a challenge.\nThe only time I would recomend this game would be if it was 90% off and you had already done everything in Surgeon Simulator.\n\nAlso currently there seem to be bugs with graphical settings, which makes this game look very poorly. The game experience I had was no where near what is displayed in the screenshots. I know my computer is not top of the line, but I can run Surgeon Simulator smoothly and run some of the more demanding games on low settings.\n\nThis game needs a lot work and in my opinion should probably be in early access. It is not fun at all and any time spent in game will be to get trading cards, which I would suggest to idle, or to purposely frustrate yourself.\n\nMaybe this is meant as Pewdie-bait, it's certainly not for ordinary gamers.","June 3, 2014","false","4.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

The fingers on the hand will also phase through objects randomly, so you're never able to reliably use them. It's all but impossible to place something in a tea cup if you're unsure whether the laws of physics will work this time around. I'm also frustrated by how random the "damage" system is. Sometimes you can pick up a cup with no trouble, other times just brushing it lightly will shatter it.\n\nFinally, for an actual design choice, it suffers from a forced perspective, which makes no sense and adds nothing to the challenge save for frustration. If you bump a cup to the wrong angle, it will take you ages to get the handle aligned to something you can pick up and use. That's not fun, and there's no good reason I can't just step slightly to the side so that I can actually line up on the handle. (Edit: There actually is an alternate camera view. It doesn't work most of the time, but if you push the button enough then it will change your perspective. This does not change the angle of the arm though, so it's of limited use. It is handy if you need to see behind something, but it doesn't work 90% of the time when the button is pushed so it's hard to make any real use of it.)\n\nAll told, if they ever patch it so that it actually works then I'd recommend it, but as it is there's simply too much randomness to the laws of reality to be fun. If you pretend that you're a poltergeist learning to use its powers though then it does make it a bit more bearable.","July 30, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Yet another 'joke' simulator that fails horribly at being a joke at all. I know it's supposed to be frustrating, but it's not a good kind like Surgeon Simulator, and it's because of the controls. When you want to rotate the hand, it's very unsensitive; it takes about 5 seconds to get it sideways. Speaking of things taking forever, the fingers grab WAY too slowly. There's not even much to the game anyways, you just make tea. The amount of gameplay you get in this is as much as what a demo would give you. FOR £3.99. Well there's trading cards and achievements, but that's about it. The only reason this got popular is because of PewDiePie; there are some really stupid fanboys who'll just buy crap like this without even thinking about what they're actually getting. Again, incase you forgot, this was 90% off at the time, 39p. Don't buy this crap.","January 13","false","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is acctually so emersive that i sometimes trip over as i think i am acctually making tea in real life its so good ; such a mind ♥♥♥♥. I think i might want to remove my left arm as it looks so cool who would of thought that having a fake arm would give you so much power! You can litraly make as many cups of tea as you want! As well as having a left arm as strong as an ox!  But honestly this game is being amazing. Its on a whole different planet. i think i might die from over dose on tea now i even drink more than posh josh and oscar rooney!\n\nBut honestly i think i am AMPU-TEA CRAZY!!!!!!!\n\n","October 23, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/recommended/289090/","TiffanyAK","TiffanyAK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/","1800 products in account","To start with, I would like to say that this is not a bad game exactly. Really, the main problem is that there is not much to it. As of now, I have earned 100% of the achievements, and the absurd one for launching the game 500 times easily accounted for the bulk of the time involved. The one really good part is that it's my first perfect game. All that is left to do at this point as far as the game is concerned is to endlessly try my hand at making cups of tea in the tea cups using any combo of milk and sugar along with the teabags and hot water. There are no other levels, tasks, or challenges. You're only given the one set-up to work with, with various levels of difficulty only coming into play via the complexity of the cup of tea being requested.\n\nLike other games of the sort, every movement required to actually achieve a task is absolutely painstaking, which is where the fine line between fun and frustration comes into play. Unfortunately, the glitches within the game do make things weigh slightly in favor of frustration, as the arm has a habit of going through things and getting stuck, plus other issues, along with the other intended quirks common in games like this, where it refuses to truly grab things, instead often flipping, dropping, or even breaking them.\n\nHaving gotten the game in a bundle, I certainly wouldn't complain, as there is definitely some amount of fun to be had here. Nor would I dismiss the possibility of getting future games from the creators in the future, especially if they do something a bit bigger in scope. Yet, still, for what it currently is I cannot recommend buying it, unless you find it in a bundle with other games you want.","June 25, 2014","false","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Have you ever considered relearning how to move?  If so, Ampu-Tea will be your cup of tea  **snickers**.  I found myself getting frustrated with games like Surgeon Sim in the past, but this one only seems to bring joy, even in failure.  I found myself tensing up over the smallest tasks while trying to not spill the perfect tea I had just finished preparing, only to end up doing something absurd, like sweeping my newly acquired prosthesis across the table to get something out of my way.  This game is hilarious and fun as all hell, because every time you fail, it is your own fault for not knowing the ins and outs of your fake hand.  The ironic "Keep Calm and Carry On" flags and mugs everywhere remind me of how hard I had to focus to perform such a simple task.  I like to pack my tea full of teabags and see how many sugar cubes I can pick up in a single handful.  Long story short, This simple and frustrating game is a blast, especially for the price!","December 2, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls don't feel like you are controlling a robotic arm, more like a broken drop claw game. Items are not coded correctly to be grab-able, instead fingers on arm clip through most everything and there isn't any "grip" to the hand. The objective is obviously to make tea, but there are items on the table that have an unclear function in the tea making process (black candy bits?). It has promise if the gameplay is fixed, mostly fixing the robotic arm to actually feel like a hand. The gameplay is so broken it isn't worth the purchase as is without major updates, even as a time waster.","June 22, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gimmicky, yet buggy gameplay.  Not worth ANY money.  This is a very brief tech demo and nothing more.  Kudos to the devs for the thought, but this is not the type of thing pouple should be charged for.  After just a few moments, the only acheivement remaining is to launch the game 500 times.  Even exiting the game is a feature that appears to be left out of development.  If you find this "game" in a bundle, you can get a couple of achievements and some trading cards for a small fee... otherwise this isn't worth your time or money.\n\nEdit:\nPatch 1.1 finally added the ability to close the game.  This is the first game I have ever played that needed a patch for that feature.  It also added a few more achievements.  Instead of fixing where the arm gets stuck and ends the game, they added an achievement for it.

Multiple times while grabbing or holding items, they would go through the solid portion of the robotic hand, or through other solid objects - attempting to grab tea cups that would then push through the back of the precariously positioned tea rack instead of knocking the rack over, bags of tea being in hand one moment and shooting up through the top of the hand the next, etc. At one point while playing, after 'pressing' the hot water button several times with no response, the water began to suddenly pop out (I would guess a 20 second or so lapse). I was tabbed out of the game in windowed mode while this was happening, and watched the hot water jug topple backwards. The hand was stationary well away from the table itself, panned out enough to see the table in its entirety while this was going on.

It would be alright except for the fact that if something says "No sugar" or anything to that effect about skipping a step with your teamaking, the game has no way of detecting 0 so it remains stuck on that step and you can't move on. If it asks for 1 sugar and you put a cube of sugar in the cup before adding a teabag and water, then the game will not progress at the sugar stage. If you try to put it another sugar cube at that point though, it'll fial you for adding too much sugar. I successfully managed to make it to the milk stage and got no feedback on what "a dash of milk" was until the 8th glob of milk goes in and I lose because that's too much milk, even though globs 1-7 did nothing to trigger moving on to the next step.\n\nThese bugs make the game almost impossible to complete unless you reset over and over until you get a mode that has you performing at least one of each item in order and somehow having it properly detect what you're doing.\n\nThis game should be early access, not a full sale.

Multiple times while grabbing or holding items, they would go through the solid portion of the robotic hand, or through other solid objects - attempting to grab tea cups that would then push through the back of the precariously positioned tea rack instead of knocking the rack over, bags of tea being in hand one moment and shooting up through the top of the hand the next, etc. At one point while playing, after 'pressing' the hot water button several times with no response, the water began to suddenly pop out (I would guess a 20 second or so lapse). I was tabbed out of the game in windowed mode while this was happening, and watched the hot water jug topple backwards. The hand was stationary well away from the table itself, panned out enough to see the table in its entirety while this was going on. All in all, the game could have some potential if it were polished and these errors were fixed.

However, as shown in game, you cannot make a cup of tea correctly, spilling milk and dropping sugar everywhere, as well as your collection of grand cups.\n\nX finally snaps, the only true way to quench his thirst, is by drinking the blood of the innocent and he will do so by disemboweling them with his perverse, blue robot hand.

In Ampu Tea you play as an amputea and he has a robotic arm and you try to make a cup of tea. So how is this game ? Its quite bad honestly. Now its just like surgeon simulator so ill try to compare them as less as possible but its quite hard. The Game has an interesting premise and thats about it thats all the good i could tell about it. But theres a lot of bad. The game is tough to control. I know that the idea was to make a rage game. But when the controls dont work you know you did something wrong. The game is also quite buggy. The arm can get stuck in the table and it breaks randomly. There isnt a whole lot to say about this mess than just stay away as far as possible. Just get Surgeon Simulator which is a better game in general. Buggy broken game where the controls barely work. Only get it super cheap like in a bundle or other wise stay away.

If I took anything from this game, it was sympathy for those who have prosthetics. Beyond controlling the hand, there are several different randomly-generated recipes. The problem is the randomly-generated scenarios don't change the flow of gameplay at all - once you've done one recipe, you've basically done them all.\n\nAchievement-wise, all but one can be comfortably achieved within the first hour of gameplay. The last one is opening the game 500 times, something that I think is overkill compared to the rest of the achievements.\n\nI think this game would have had more potential if it incorporated multiple elements: maybe using the hand to draw, to make toast, to change an infant... really anything beyond just making tea.","December 23, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing is that you can only get about 30-60 minutes out of it until you are bored.\n\nThe Good:\nSure, at start it seems magnificent and it quite rightly is. Like the Surgeon Simulator only for making tea. Everything is throwable, smashable. You can fling the whole table if your angry and that gives you some nice satisfications. Achievements popping up when you complete the basics and even for flipping the table. And when you finally manage to put the tea bag into the cup, it is just so emotionally fulfilling. Also the hand glitches out sometimes which is friggin fun\n\nThe Bad:\nSome of the mechanics don't work. When you put the tea bag into the cup, it lights green, that you have completed the action but when  you add sugar, it doesn't say anything and the same for milk. It ruined my game many times because it said that i got diabeetus but i just didn't know when to stop adding sugar. Also the hand gliches out sometimes which pretty much ruins the game. After you make your first cup of tea, there isn't a lot left. You can make it a couple of times but thats the end. It just gets dull after that.\n\nIf you can get it for a dollar or two then it's worth it. It is fun and rewarding but only for the first hour. It doesn't have that much replayability and gets boring quick.","June 27, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe $1 or $2, but not $5.\n\nThe game is just using the principle from Surgeon Simulator: you have specific control over a hand, and you must perform a task while trying to get a hold of the odd control method. Except in Ampu-tea, the goal is to just make a cup of tea rather than performing various surgeries.\n\nOne of the problems with Ampu-tea is that the (supposedly prosthetic) hand isn't attached to anything. You can just make it fly around the room like some sort of... I dunno. Helicopter? Flying Insect? Anyway, the game doesn't have any proper limits on where the arm can be moved.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of any sort of menu. You have a text box in the top right corner of the screen telling what certain keybings are (changing difficulty, disabling music, etc.), and a menu that pops up when you first start the game asking what language you want. Other than that there are no menus, and even then, the language select menu doesn't have mouse control, and is operated through pressing keys such as F1, F2, F3, and so on and so forth. There are also no performance options, you can't even change the screen resolution, leaving you with some pre-determined resolution rather than what your monitor actually uses. Another thing: people are saying that the translations are terrible for the different languages. I only speak english, so I can't tell for sure..\n\nThe game assets are weird too. There's a bunch of stuff on the table that has no reason to be there that could harm game performance on slower machines. Examples of these things are: random cloth rags with the words 'keep calm and make tea' on them, an 'out of order' tea kettle, and one of those horse head masks that are so popular on the internet (seriously? putting in an irrelevant internet meme just for a giggle? It's not even funny in this context.). Also, the devs supposedly had to increase the gravity in the game just because everything in the game wasn't scaled properly (as in, everything is smaller than it should be).\n\nThe scenery consists of a terribly-made room with bad texturing (seriously, just look at that fridge. The texture used on the front is used on the side, too!) and way more free space than you need.\n\nThe overall game lacks content and isn't executed very well. This shouldn't be on steam, this should be on a website like kongregate or something. It's just not worth spending money.","June 30, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh god dancing around your desk (I hope you keep your computer on a desk) is halarious. I spent quite some time trying to make just one cup of tea then doing so I spilt my own tea on my lap, screamed out in pain and daced around. My girlfriend was so confused what I had acomplished, grabbed me by the shoulders shaking me screaming "You did not just do anything you should not have on the computer!?" I just looked and smiled and said I just made tea. I never seen someone look at me so oddly. This is not CoD or CS:GO this is Ampu-tea.

If you want an exciting shoot-'em-up gaming experience, then Ampu-Tea is not for you - walk away now! That's right, get out of here, non-nerd, and don't come back!\n\nNow that the neanderthal troglodytes have gone, let's get back to the review.\n\nThe aim of the game is to make a nice mug of tea, using a robotic arm.\nThere are a number of different instructions given to you, in order to make several mugs of tea.\nHowever, the basic tasks are to get a mug off a shelf and then add a tea bag, some sugar, and boiling water - and then serve on a tray (there are several variations of these tasks).\n\nTo start the game, push "F1" for English (assuming that is the language you want, of course) - I mention that because I have had the start screen come up looking blurred once, and couldn't read the instruction in the top left corner to press F1.\nPress "H" to show or hide the help screen - very useful for learning the controls.\n\nDon't be surprised if you knock the entire shelf of mugs off the table - I was knocking everything over before I got used to how the robotic arm worked.\nTry to manoeuvre the mug into place in front of the tea-maker, before adding any tea or sugar, as it is easier to do everything with the mug already in place.\nPicking up the sugar cubes can be a real pain. Be prepared to drop them many times.\nHint: Put the tray in its place first (in front of the tea-maker), so you can serve the tea on it later (otherwise you can make your mug of tea and then spill it when trying to put it onto a tray).\n\nThe controls can take a bit of getting used to, but then it's much easier after that.\n\nA good experience for children who might have a talent for robotics.\nThis game is for nerds only - it is recommended on that basis.","February 20","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I absolutely love Surgeon Simulator as it is both challenging and hillarious. This is challenging, but only because of the bugs (which, unlike Goat Simulator, aren't hilarous to watch), but that is about it. My robot arm keeps going through the mugs and the slightest knock seems to make everything go flying.... at least that got me a few acheivements! Maybe this game is better for those who have masses of patience for practiice, or for those who aren't British and find the whole idea of making tea in tacky "Keep Calm and..." mugs with the Union flag everywhere is charming. I think I got it from another site for very liittle money though, so I'm not disappointed to own it. Maybe I'll return to it one day and magically find I like it. I guess it could be a very good stress relief if you like to yell "SMASHY SMASHY" at your computer? DESTROY ALL THE THINGS! Maybe it's not fair to compare it to SS, as making tea is very different to botched surgery, but they do make reference to it on one of the mugs by thanking them for the idea...

But since there's not I guess I can't recommend this game. All of this game's enjoyment is out of the frustration and the OH SO WONKY physics engine. In the story you're an amputee who lost his "arm" He actually lost his entire body and is a sentient arm now and is forced to make some tea for some unknown deity  'Cause he sure as hell can't drink it. Then I guess he goes insane because due to the OH SO WONKY physics engine YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT. Does it make you laugh? Yes, at first. Then after screwing around for a bit you get serious. You grab a cup, set it down, and then it does a flip and is upside-down so you have to do a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arm movements to get it back. And then it goes behind the water thing, and that's impossible to get out without using your magical powers of broken physics to effortlessly move the water thing. And then you make a jolted movement and your hand comes off. That's a game over, which is kinda funny at first. One time, I even went through the map and that was good for a laugh. But it starts to get annoying. Really quick. Honestly it's youtube bait at the core. The only thing it's good for is to gather a few friends and play it for a short laugh. If you want a youtube bait game that's hard, has an OH SO WONKY physics engine, is actually FUN, and is what this game is based off of, grab Surgeon Simulator. You won't be laughing horrendously hard at it but at least there's GAMEPLAY.\n\nOverall 5/10 I thought being British was supposed to be fun","July 4, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, it looks a lot like Surgeon Simulator (and is completely aware of this, shown by a message on one of the mugs), but it has it's own humorous theme to it. The game is not very serious at all, and is filled with jokes about how British people like drinking tea, and well, that's about it. The controls can be frustrating at times, as some objects refused to be picked up, but other than that, I had an enjoyable hour or two exploring the game, getting the simple and easy achievements, and making a cup of tea with my finicky robotic arm (after maybe 30 retries). If you play around with all the features you will have at least some fun, unless you are a person that gets bored/frustrated easily.

But since there's not I guess I can't recommend this game. All of this game's enjoyment is out of the frustration and the OH SO WONKY physics engine. In the story you're an amputee who lost his "arm" He actually lost his entire body and is a sentient arm now and is forced to make some tea for some unknown deity  'Cause he sure as hell can't drink it. Then I guess he goes insane because due to the OH SO WONKY physics engine YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT. Does it make you laugh? Yes, at first. Then after screwing around for a bit you get serious. You grab a cup, set it down, and then it does a flip and is upside-down so you have to do a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arm movements to get it back. And then it goes behind the water thing, and that's impossible to get out without using your magical powers of broken physics to effortlessly move the water thing. And then you make a jolted movement and your hand comes off. That's a game over, which is kinda funny at first. One time, I even went through the map and that was good for a laugh. But it starts to get annoying. Really quick. Honestly it's youtube bait at the core. The only thing it's good for is to gather a few friends and play it for a short laugh. If you want a youtube bait game that's hard, has an OH SO WONKY physics engine, is actually FUN, and is what this game is based off of, grab Surgeon Simulator. You won't be laughing horrendously hard at it but at least there's GAMEPLAY.\n\nOverall 5/10 I thought being British was supposed to be fun","July 4, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is tea-dious, frustra-tea-ing, and lacks quali-tea.\n\nWHAT IT'S ABOUT Ampu-Tea is a Surgeon Simulator inspired game where you are an amputee fitted with a robotic arm and are tasked with making a cup of tea. In the style of SS, you control your robo-hand to attempt assembling different kinds of teas with the mouse and keyboard. The silly control style provides a challenge to this otherwise simple task and it will test your patience and eventually lead to some chaos.\n\nMY EXPERIENCE PLAYING THIS GAME Honestly, this game was a disappointment, and I wasn't even expecting anything from it. My experience playing this game was mostly frustration, thanks to the awful controls and mechanics.\n\nThere is no grip to pick up anything, so I had to rely on pushing things across the table with the hand and trying to balance cup handles around the fingers. Speaking of the fingers, grabbing with them is incredibly slow and insensitive, along with the hand rotation. It took me half an hour of messing around just to make one cup of tea because of how fragile the mugs are, how easy it is to knock the shelf off the table, the painful journey of moving the cup from each station, and how easy it is to break the arm itself.\n\nThere is little variety in what types of drinks you can make, and no story or real motivation to make them except for a sticky note. The game description mentions being the son of an Earl, but I found no connection to that in the game. The achievements are (despite the shocking controls) fairly easy to get, minus the one for opening the game 500 times which I did not have the patience for. There are trading cards, but I uninstalled the game before I had enough game time to collect them.\n\nThe only highlight I managed to draw from this game was being able to flip the table in rage. That's about it. I wish I had more to say.\n\nSUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION In short, Ampu-Tea relies on the 'joke game' factor and being a silly game for YouTubers to play. There are no outstanding features in this game besides being pointlessly difficult and having more 'Keep Calm's and 'EPIC FAIL's than is socially acceptable. It is not worth the $4.99 price tag, but if you really want to play it, wait for it to hit 90% off  on a sale at $0.49.\n\nI personally did not enjoy this game and I would not recommend it.","May 17","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can\'t remember how much I even paid for it but I certainly didn\'t pay more that 40p I assume. Some games however aren\'t even worth the time you spend playing them. Is that true for Ampu-Tea? I wouldn\'t say so. The game is an arm simulator much like surgeon simulator but very bare bones in which the objective of the game is to make a cup of tea using the janky controlled, robotic arm you have. Being British this seemed like it wouldn\'t be much of a challenge. I was wrong. This is the only game mode but I can\'t say I was begging for more once I\'d beat it as the game plays pretty boringly and I wouldn\'t recommend it if it wasn\'t for it\'s short length and mentionable humour. The game pokes at British stereotypes fairly well and the concept is a laugh overall. It only took me 2 hours to beat this game completely and doing little things like flipping the table and watching the destruction ensue was fun and once I was done I didn\'t feel like my time was wasted.\n\nOverall it\'s nothing special, but like I say you can probably find this game in a bundle or for ridiculously cheap and it\'s no time waster. A fun game to play in those moments where you can\'t be bothered for a mass scale adventure so you just make a cup of tea instead.\n\nHowever achievement hunters be warned this game has one of \"those\" achievements to boot the game so many times. There are some workarounds but as an achievement collector myself I found this really annoying.","June 1","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/289090/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","590 products in account","Clearly inspired by 2013's Surgeon Simulator 2013 (which the developer at least have the decency to acknowledge), this game has the quirkiness and tongue-in-cheek playfulness of that title, but with none of the personality, finese or fun. Robotic limbs are pretty damn bad*ss (one day I really hope we'll see some robotic *sses, too! Maybe I'll even get one myself if I'm real lucky), and I guess tea is pretty decent as well, but here, they really don't blend very well at all.\n\nControlling the robotic arm of a recovering amputee (because they're classy with their set-up like that), you must fulfill the order required to make a satisfactory cup of tea and try your best not to completely wreck the gaff in the process. The arm itself is somewhat unwieldy and very unintuitive to direct, with the motions of the fingers being a particular bugbear. In Surgeon Simulator the controls were laid out in a way that made sense and soon felt pretty natural to use, and the solid, slightly stubby fingers meant picking up items was mostly quick and straightforward. Here, however, an awkward control scheme mixed with long, gangly, slow-moving digits that don't even close properly makes for the majority of the challenge as you struggle massively with picking up anything and wrestling with pretty much every single object you try to interact with.\n\nThere isn't really much more to the game other than grabbing a cup, putting some items into it, moving the cup around, adding some liquids then placing the cup on a platter. And after you've done that once, you've essentially seen all the game has to offer. You can always smash everything up or flip the table (possibly breaking the arm as you do), but other than that, nada. Depending on how quickly the controls click with you or how lucky you get, you could probably finish this in anything from 10 to 40 minutes (I think I completed every achievement bar one in half an hour), and after that you've no real reason to revisit it since there's nothing else on offer except to retry the task with slightly different orders or quantities of ingredients.\n\nMore frustrating and annoying than bad, given how little content there is here, and how not particularly fun it is, there's no way I could recommend it at full price, and, if anything, fives euros seems like a bit of a p*ss take if you ask me. If controlling the thing wasn't so unneccesarily cumbersome, or there was more content beyond a single "quest" to complete, I'd likely endorse it, but as it stands, it's probably worth something closer to 50c. Though there could be an argument made for it being free. If it's on sale and you just have to see what the fuss is about, maybe it's worth briefly investigating. But in any other circumstances, there's really so many other, better things you could be wasting your time and money on than this.","June 6","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
