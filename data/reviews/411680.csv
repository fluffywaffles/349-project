"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmmmw/recommended/411680/","mmmmw","S°I","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmmmw/","63 products in account","Cute game but unfortunaly i'm just not their target demographic.\n\nLoot Hound is a casual scavenger game (emphasize on casual) which revolves around a man who collects seemingly useless trinkets, no 'loot' here.  You start of with Marley, a cute labrador who you take for walks in the park. You guide Marley by tugging on it's leash and let her explore by giving the leash slack. Simple mechanics which only require you to use WASD to move and Shift and Crtl to give slack or tug on the leash. The starting stages are incredibly easy with no obstacles except for a few distractions which don't let Marley focus on digging. You can easily circumvent this by upgrading stats to gain things like better concentration, better digging, better finding, more stamina, and better luck. Each loot hunt only lasts as long as your dog's stamina or until you get caught by the park guards. There is a total of 10 stages, each with their unique challenges and loot to find. By the third stage you will need Wifi, a small chihuahua who has the special ability of fitting into tight spaces to find loot. You will also unlock Mr.Anderson by stage 5 and he will bark at any animal that stands in your way of digging. There are a few secret areas within each level but the overall variety and scenery seems a tad boring with the most interesting moments finding weird trinkets or running from the few guards that roam the perimeter. At this point you maybe wondering why you're going through all the trouble of finding these useless trinkets...well i don't have a good answer for it other than to unlock more stages. When you find a trinket you gain three things: money to upgrade your dogs' stats, gets you closer to unlocking a new stage, and at your apartment you can read a little excerpt that alludes to the main character's background and story while pushing a few silly puns and jokes into the mix. Unfortunately the descriptions don't give you much information and there is no storyline outside of what you read from the trinkets. So what's the point of all this??? I'm not sure yet, i've unlocked 7 out of the 10 stages and all the game has done is made me enamored with the dogs and the cutesy art style. There is not much substance here. It's an interesting concept but it needs to have a bit more depth to keep me interested. The description on steam has a final point that says :"What's landed in the Buxton Wheat Field?" I'm hoping it's something interesting. Overall i think this game is targeted towards young children and feels more of a tablet game than a pc game. The screen resolution is even limited to 1920x1200 which is a shame since 1440p and higher res displays are becoming more common place but that's just a small thing to nitpick at.\n\nArt: 8.5/10\nSound:6.5/10\nDesign: 7/10\nGame play: 6/10\nStory: 4/10\nReplay value: 4/10\nCharm: 9/10\n\nVerdict: a passable casual title that leaves something to be desired when it comes to gameplay and story. Casual shouldn't mean watered down story and lackluster game play, you can make things interesting without loosing the appeal of an easy game. I would recommend this for younger audiences and those who just love dogs.\n\nI will update this review in case the game becomes interesting.","November 17, 2015","true","1.8"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/recommended/411680/","GetOutNowDontStayLeave","Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/","608 products in account","Loot Hound is a very casual indie game. It's a calm, relaxing little game. Now, I don't mean it's little because this game seems to have quite a bit too it. I think it'd be best if I started with the general story of this game. You play as a man who has a pet dog. Your first dogs name is Marley, and you can eventually end up with three dogs in total. You and your dog decide to go on an adventure to find the best loot in all of the land. And is it easy? Well, that's where our first point begins...\n\nThis game isn't simple at all. It's not a hard game, but that doesn't mean that the game isn't complicated in more than a few ways. Okay, I'm not explaining this in the best way so let me sum this part up on what I like about the difficulty and how it's well balanced.\n-Having to upgrade your dogs with the points from the loot you find is an extrememly nice touch, it makes it so that the loot has a reason to be collected and not as if you're just doing it for a goal.\n-Having different dogs being good at different things is a REALLY good concept. A smaller dog for small gaps in the hedge, a large dog for scaring away critters with a fierce bark and Marley, the dog that can dig through stone.\n\nI think the next place I should focus on is the actual gameplay itself. How the game controls and how it feels to be played. The controls in this game are very tight and feel very well polished. The game uses some very basic controls. You use WASD to move and Ctrl and Shift to pull in the lead or extend the lead. Overall controlling of the game is very well done and is an obvious sign that the devs have put a lot of time into trying to make the game feel as polished as possible.\n\nThe art of this game is very, very neat and really fits the overall charm of the game very well. This game radiates the vibrant, happy feeling that it wants you to feel. When the dog of your choice digs up the ground, the hole animations are very neat and confined to being so neat and tidy. The loot sprites are something that this game does insanely well. With the game containing well over 300 sprites of different and unique little items of loot. The loot which you collect is also accompanied by a very British and enthusiastic narrator. This narrator will also talk to you at the start of the level and never at one time have I ever felt like the voice is being shoved down my throat.\n\nEach level in this game is very different from the other, some may require all dogs to beat the level and some may require a single dog. The levels in this game are so well made that I've never found myself being lost or cursing the game for not being clear enough in how I'm supposed to do something or where I'm supposed to go. Some levels may have a Dog Patrol Officer. He will act as the main enemy in this game, but he's not exactly impossible or unfair. If he catches you, you will be sent back to your home and will be forced to start the level again. BUT, what made me increasingly happy is that the loot you've already found will stay collected, meaning you don't have to redo the whole level. Each level also has a timer, when this timer runs out it will say that your dog is exhausted. I love the fact that it's the dog being exhausted and not just "Time up!" It's a unique idea that I've never seen done before, so that's certainly a very unique thing.\n\nOverall this game is great, I wouldn't call it my game of the year or even one of my favourite games of all time. I would call this game a hidden gem which deserves every possible buyer to get. The main factor in this game for me was the dogs, but I soon realised that I would be loving this game for much more than just the dogs. I recommend this to everyone who wants a casual game which will help them to calm down or just have an enjoyable experience in a game.\n\nEnjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator!

There is lots of different loot to find and you are still rewarded for finding doubles. You upgrade your dogs skills to overcome different obstacles, for example squirrels will distract your dog, but you can avoid this by upgrading you dogs concentration skill.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/411680/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Review in Tribute of Charlie Fitzsimons:\n\nFrom time to time you get to play games that make you think of happy memories. It’s one of the real joys of gaming. In the case of Loot Hounds it made me think of Ainslie’s recently deceased dog, Charlie. Charlie was the first dog that she had after moving out of her parents house and into her own. It was me that put her onto Charlie. I posted an ad on Gumtree looking for a hypoallergenic dog because she was desperately seeking a canine companion and is very much a dog oriented person yet she is allergic to most breed. Someone from a suburb a few over from ours saw our ad and responded to me telling me that she had a dog that she was going to be forced to surrender as she had broken up with her partner and the rental property she was taking would not allow dogs and her ex was not fond of Charlie or dogs for that matter.\n\nUpon first meeting Charlie Ainslie fell immediately in love. He was a excited little ball of fluff who had a heart full of love – and a tongue full of licks and kisses. He was already 7 when she got him so sadly we missed the first half of his life. He was a real little ferret. He’d get into things and get up to all sorts of mischief. He could be a real little ♥♥♥♥ but he was Ainslie’s real little ♥♥♥♥ and deep down we loved him for it. He had a lot of quirks and would make you frustrated but that was Charlie. He’d pounce on anything and be a real scavenger. He absolutely loved his toys especially his squeaky ho ho (Christmas toy that had ho ho ho! written on it) but most of all he loved his food. Neither of us have ever seen such a food obsessed dog. Given the skill points food gives you in Loot Hounds we’ve finally found our answer as to why. Little dude just wanted to skill up and be better than all of the other dogs! Atta boy! Most of all he just wanted to love. If either Ainslie or I were sitting with him on the couch while watching television or anything you’d have to tell him to stop licking you several times. He’d then look up at you with a real look of mischievousness in his eyes and then he’d lick or kiss you once or twice more before stopping – for a minute.\n\nCharlie had a rough life. We believe that he was a puppy farm dog. He’d react with great fright any time there was a light or a reflection on the ceiling or if somebody had anything with a light in it (for example the light up swords and sabers, torches, etc.). His limbs were already fairly weakened when we got him. He suffered a couple of broken legs when we had him – running around the yard or doing something but he was always a quick healer. We hope that we gave him the best life possible.\n\nThe point of this is that Loot Hound reminded me of just how amazing Charlie was and how much I miss him. He passed away on October 15, 6 days after Ainslie’s birthday. He’d been suffering from prolonged heart failure and fought a long and hard fight. But his very last act was after going outside for a nightly toilet stop he saw a cane toad and in typical Charlie fashion he pounced on the poisonous frog and bit it. Of course, the toad as they are notorious for doing in self defence (though sometimes in attack) sprayed its poison into Charlie’s mouth. Ainslie got him inside and we got the poison out of him. We rushed him to the vet who advised us that he hadn’t had enough of the poison to kill him but his heart failure was killing him. If anything the toad’s poison allowed him to reach a state of drunkenness – a happy high if you so choose. He wasn’t in any pain but that due to the heart he wasn’t responding to their efforts to help him. We had the choice of giving him another month at tops of a miserable existence where he wouldn’t be himself or we could end him on that ‘happy high.’  The decision to euthanize Charlie was one of the saddest ones that Ainslie and I have had to make but it was the right one.\n\nIf you’re a dog lover and want to enjoy a casual video game in which you can reminisce and remember your favorite memories with your dogs – living or deceased – then Loot Hounds will deliver in spades. It’s a cute game that plays intelligently and is very much worth a few hours of your time.\n\nR.I.P. Charlie. We miss you more and more every day. Gone but never ever forgotten. A void in our lives forever.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 14","true","10.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I love how it was made and how it looks! I enjoy the voice acting. The names of the items found can be a bit silly, but sometimes they are kind of funny. I find it funny when one of my dogs decide they want to pee all over something. Successfully running away from the park patrol gives me a great deal of accomplishment. My dogs likes to bark a lot. Sometimes my dogs like to run from me and then I gotta chase him down or my dogs like to get caught around a tree or rock, it is so funny. Collecting loot and completing my collections are so much fun and extremely addicting!\n\nWhat I think needs to be fixed: When your dog detects something and starts to search for it, but then they just stop and look at you funny. I'm guessing this is an error? Also there is a problem with dogs starting to search for something and when they don't have enough stats for it, they stop. When you come back to it, your dog won't detect it. I believe I am having this issue for one of the parks I cannot complete. I see the spot, but the dog won't do anything.\n\nWhat I look forward to: More dogs, more collections, and more parks!! Also it would be pretty cool if we could somehow change the way our character looks or something.\n\nOverall I give it a 8.5/10","February 2","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
