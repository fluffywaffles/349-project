An Xbox controller is also highly recommended, but not required as the controls are fully customizable.\n\nDefinitely give it a go, and play it with friends.

It's a brilliant and frantic arena fighter that borrows mechanics and aesthetics from Final Fantasy Tactics, Bomberman, and Link to the Past. Yes, that's right. It has a job-mixing system. *swoon*\n\nRight now, it's local MP only, but it does have AI if you can't get anyone to play this with you. But, if you have anyone at ALL around you, just make them pick up a controller and play. It features that beautiful balance that makes it obvious and simple to pick up while still being deep enough to reward a lot of play.\n\nThere's the tactical level of learning how to parry and maneuever and use your abilities well. Then, there is the strategic layer of trying to adjust your job choices to what your opponents are using. Give it a shot. It's nearly impossible not to have some fun with it.\n\n\n\n","February 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Each round you progress up your class tree. Your new class will have one default ability, and you can select any previous class abilities you have used as your second ability.\n\nThe classes are basically melee, archer, and magic (which can split into healing or damage paths). The skills are reasonably diverse and there are many combinations you can employ each round. Needless to say this can create balancing issues - however the GCM2 team has it reasonably under control. On top of this they have a player based balancing feedback system.\n\nThe combat starts out reasonably simple. All class have the same basic attacks, a slash, which has a wider parry radius, and a charge, which sends the character forward with a low parry radius. Magic classes get many options for different kinds of attacks. Melee have more passive options, some attack skills, and some passives that augment basic attacks. Ranged classes get a variety of circumstantial speed/damage boosts as well as a good selection of different arrows.\n\nScoring options can be tampered with which can help to make different playstyles better. (for example the last man standing may get 2 points, most damage inflicted 1, most damage received 1).\n\nThe maps are procedurally generated and the camera pans infinately. The camera panning is quite complicated - and after several tweaks from the development team it works exceedingly well.\n\nThere were many planned features in the development stage that have yet to be realised. These include a "way of the dark" class tree, of equal size to the current ("way of the light") path tree. Some of the planned skills were very interesting - including some necromancing elements. There was a parry shield planned, that prevented too many consecutive parries. And each class type (mage, melee and archer) had planned different charge attacks. Unfortunately none of these things have been realised as of yet - as far as I am awae they have been shelved to reconsider at a later date.\n\nThe price tag is a tad on the high side for current content - but this is generally speaking the case for early access games. This game is certainly conceptually sound, fun and original - and therefor worth the buy.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/\n\nCheck out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM","April 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This game is fun and fast paced and is totally worth the 9.99 I paid for it however I do have one specific issues with it right now. That is a time commitment. The full experience, which is so worth it, is a time commitment that other fighting games don't have and I think people need to be prepared for that. the game plays in sets of 8 rounds. You go through and pick one of the starting classes and go up a very deep and intesne class tree. This is not  a casual game that you and 10 of your friends can all sit and get the full experience of like smash bros. This is a casual game that is a lot of fun and I would totally recommend it but it is not a party game. I urge you to download the demo before buying its free and gives you in my opinion a great feel for the game. This game is so worth 9.99.\n\nEDIT: An update was released and I was notified by the developer that it should remember my audio video settings and it does.","June 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"
