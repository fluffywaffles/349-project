"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sammarkovic/recommended/223670/","sammarkovic","The Very Ugly Caterpillar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sammarkovic/","251 products in account","After having clocked up a fair old number of hours, I think that I've reached the point that I can write a reasonable and considered review, but before launching into it, I'd like to make the point that I've never played F1 2012. As such, I can't make a comparison, and a feeling that has been concurrent amongst many previous reviews, that it's not worth the purchase if you have the last iteration, is one that I can't make a comment on. Now onto the review.\n\nFirst of all, I've enjoyed pretty much every single of the 370 hours (at the time of writing) that I've played. That's quite an achievement - even the ultimate in open world RPGs, Skyrim, has only got 280 hours on my account. And that's across three playthroughs. There are negatives - of course there are, what game doesn't have them? But they are on the whole overshadowed by the numerous pros.\n\nSingleplayer\nI got my wheel at the same time as the game, and it took me quite some time to readjust. Thus, Singleplayer played a large part in my experience of the game - and it's pretty good. The Career, I'll be honest, is uninspiring - just five seasons around the same 19 tracks against all the same drivers in all the same cars - but when you consider that this is an F1 game, that's not surprising. I'm still only up to Spa in Season 1 - that's Race 11, I believe, after having some difficulty with Corrupt Save Files, and I'm not really eating up the miles in the same way as I used to.\nAdmittedly, to begin with, it's addictive - intoxicating, to an extent. Especially with a wheel, it's a very engaging game, and once you begin fiddling with the strategy, and the setups, even with a very average AI, it's great. I managed to clock the equivalent of a full 100% season before I started tiring of it.\nAnd then after that, Codemasters have done a very decent job of fleshing it out with some excellent stand-alone features. There's the stock standard Time Trial, and Time Attack (For which you are awarded medals based on how fast you go), in addition to the Scenario Mode feature, which is good fun - placing you in a range of - you guessed it - scenarios, and then assigning you a score based on your performance. Throughout all this are the leaderboards, which is a nice touch, especially when competing with friends (I'm in a battle around Brands Hatch currently), and the only slightly saddening touch is that there are some people out there who aren't racing honestly, and ruining the very top of the leaderboard.\nAll in all, the singleplayer section is initially exciting, but this fades with time. Nevertheless, it was worth the £8 I payed on Amazon all by itself.\n\nMultiplayer\nThe Multiplayer aspect of the game is the one that I now live for, and play pretty much exclusively. It's also very contrevsial.\nI suppose I should probably start by adressing the really major problem, and that is the strength and consistency of the connections. I race in a competetive league (link at the bottom), yet each race, of the 12-16 player grid, around 2-6 players lose connection - even those with a strong internet service. This is irritating, but it doesn't happen all that often, and it's easy enough to work around on a small scale.\nNow onto the praise. It's great. I mean really great. True, in terms of variety, it's not fantastic. You can only do races. But again, that's what F1 is about - racing. So no complaints there. But if you can find friends who play - or better, make friends out of like minded players - and you have some way of communicating with them during the race (e.g. Teamspeak, Evolve or Skype), then it's fantasic, more so if you're equally matched, because you can really relate. I won't delve into all the good things about multiplayer gaming, but it's a wonderful escape from reality.\nQuite possibly the best thing about the Multiplayer is the number of Racing Leagues out there. While the quick race lobbies are usually scarcely populated, and frequented by intentionally dangerous drivers, the community aspect of a small league is very attractive, and it means that you can race regularly against player of a similar ability to you in an attempt to improve. Again, I won't wax eloquent about the merits of Race Leagues - but they are fantastic fun.\n\nClassics\nI'll be honest, the Classics section does feel like somewhat of an afterthought. There are a small selection of cars, with a slightly less small collection of Legendary drivers, which you can race as, but it's definitely not a game in it's own right - there is no career, the addition tracks are beautifully done but there are only four of them (two without the DLC), and though the cars look and sound gorgeous, the small selection and obvious performance gap means that it's hard to have a really decent race. A novelty, but a nice one, and it serves to refresh your enthusiasm for the game occasionally by doing away with the repetition that is running round a track like China 50-odd times.\n\nAs a Sim\nIf you're looking for a Sim, then sorry, you're in completly the wrong place. Though harsh, F1 2013 falls probably half way between Grid 2 (Ultra Arcade) and Race 07 (Total Sim).  The tyre wear feels scripted. There are limited setup options, and most of them don't really make a difference to the way the car feels, or drives. Even without any assists, with a soft suspension you can absolutely floor the throttle mid way through a corner, and be on your way without any drama, even around a low grip circuit like Hungaroring. It's not a sim. It doesn't feel even remotely feel like one, and if a Sim is what you want, then go buy Assetto Corsa or Race 07. That said, it's good for a casual gamer looking for an experience that's more Simmy than normal.\n\nThe AI\nOne of my few major complaints about the game, the AI are average at best, and for a premium title that suggests an Intel i7  is the way to go, average disappoints me. They're overly aggressive, and yet they struggle to overtake. They are also poor at defending - you can dive it up the inside of pretty much any corner in the calender, and they'll leave you room. On the lower difficulty levels, they're little more than fodder, though admittedly, it takes some time to get up to speed.\nHowever.\nSimilarly to F1, overtaking isn't a massive aspect. It's more about flawless consistency and excellent pace - and in those category, the AI shine. There are few enough races that I notice the AI in gravel traps or barriers (Monaco being the one exception), and even after 370 hours, in the Sauber, I'm only just fast enough to win on Expert (level 4 out of 5). So while not engaging in terms of their racecraft, they do what they're meant to, and the do it well, and it doesn't spoil the game in the same way that the first half of this section suggests it might.\n\nNoticable Absences\n\n-Free Practice Sessions 1 and 2. It only allows you an hour per race before qualifying to do setup and R&D work.\n-Formation Lap\n-Cool Down Lap\n-In race settings. You can't adjust, for instance, you're diff while on track, and even Brakes and Fuel only have three settings.\n-Variety of in game clips. Even if you win a world championship, you only get to see your typical 'I've one a race' fistpump shot.\n\nConclusion\nBuy it.\n\n\n\nIt's a very good game. It's solid all the way through, enjoyable to the core, and if you put the time in, rewarding. You will see yourself improve. Trust me on this. If you're a fan of racing games, it's a must. If you're a fan of F1, it's a must. If you're a fan of both, I don't know why you even bothered coming here and reading this. But even if you're not, it's still fun, and it's the best way I've found (Except for reading) of passing two hours. Best of luck in your racing endeavours.","June 1, 2014","true","512.3"," 74 of 77 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","74","77","0","2"

A lot of early bugs were patched, but there still remains some issues with audio which cuts out at times.  The Classic content was of no interest to me when announced, but it turns out to be one of the more enjoyable parts of the game, as the car models, engine sounds, and handing are all magnificantly done.  That's not to say there is a sim element to the handling yet, with the classics or the 2013 cars.  Sadly, there isn't a sim element to any facet of the game, and in addition to the arcadey handling, the setups are dumbed down, the physics are unrealistic, and the tracks have no life to them.  Laser scanning the tracks though, is not likely within the budget or time available to CM with their yearly release schedule.  As always, the PC version is a bit held back because of the outdated technology in the PS3 and 360, but expect bit things from F1 2014 as we move to PS4 and Xbox One.  For now, this is a good improvement for the series, and the best to date.","November 29, 2013","true","298.7"," 116 of 142 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","116","142","0","3"

In fact, I didn't follow any motorsports at all.  But I decided to try this due to the lack of "sports" games on PC. There aren't too many sports games on PC where I can get my competitive fix in a single player environment so I'm enjoying learning F1. F1 reminds me of golf quite a lot. You're racing yourself more than anybody else. Trying to shave seconds off each lap or even each section of a lap. You can have a very intense lap in a race or qualifying without ever seeing another car. It can also become a feat of endurance piling 30 or more laps on top of one another while maintaining pace. Mix in some tire degradation, minimal fuel management, DRS/KERS, etc. And you got a little bit of strategy to work with and think about too. It really is fun once your learn everything.\n\nThen I'm also not a racing "arcade" or racing "sim" aficionado in general so I can't speak to what this game is or isn't in those regards. But I've been enjoying the racing immensely. I started as a very beginning beginner with all sorts of braking assists and low difficulty settings. Since, I have been gradually working my way up and learning and getting better. Assists are going down or off, I'm doing full practice and qualifying, racing longer races, penalties are all on now, etc. There's a learning curve for a complete newbie but its entirely doable. And quite a good challenge if you keep changing the settings with your progression (if it gets easy, punish yourself and change a setting!).\n\nI'm just playing with a 360 controller, so no fancy wheel or anything, and it feels fine.\n\nThe asking price is a little questionable being 2013, but I got it on a sale of course. I'm happy with my purchase and have gotten my money's worth. Heck, I even started watching actual F1 this season. My purchase was fairly close to season start and I've found myself watching replays of every single race. Even made time to watch the Canadian Gran Prix live on TV a few weeks back being in the right time zone.\n\nLike I said, I can't speak to the experts and addicts of racing games, but to the newer racers out there looking to try something new at a little cheaper price than the newest racing games; Give it a whirl! I recommend it.\n\nUpdate: Six months later now and I bought a wheel (G27). Yup. I'm hooked on racing games now. And this one is still my favorite. Another whole experience and challenge playing with a wheel. Fun times.","June 19, 2015","true","129.7"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","44","46","0","0"

At last the AI makes sense and has had some work put into it... no more will you be getting pole and the win in your Marussia car! You need to put in some performances and get noticed by the bigger teams until they sign you before you can start challenging for podiums and wins. The tyre wear is every bit as problematic as it has been in the real 2013 season, so you have to balance speed, cornering and overtaking aggression with tyre maintenance... something i am terrible at!\n\nAnd of course there is the additional content... The 1980's and 1990's classic cars. For me, the inclusion of the 1980's cars, the great turbo era, makes this game an essential purchase. The difference in acceleration, top speed and handling of the 80's gems compared to the 2013 cars is staggering, giving you a whole new challenge. Hopefully there will be more 1980's and 1990's cars coming in the guise of DLC's (Benetton 189!!!), as well as some more classic circuits (Mexico City and Adelaide please!!). What there is, is fantastic, and there is the promise of more...","October 4, 2013","true","11.3"," 78 of 102 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","78","102","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsturbotime/recommended/223670/","itsturbotime","ItsTurboTime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsturbotime/","131 products in account","Although Codemasters has somewhat fixed a few of the glaring issues with the previous f1 game, mainly the awful understeering and the overly aggresive AI, there still are quite a few issues that have yet to be resolved.\n\nOne of those annoying unresolved issues is with wheel support. I have used both my Logitech Driving Force GT and my Fanatec CSR wheels with f1 2013, and just like the previous game, it still requires a lengthy setup process to get the steering linearity, force feedback, and brake settings just right. Even after the settings are set properly, there's just too many bugs with using the wheel, and sometimes the game just flat out forgets my wheel settings altogether.\n\nSome issues i've found with racing wheels include: understeer using my Fanatec wheel (the Logitech wheel seems to remedy this issue); force feedback completely turns off when you don't plug in the wheel BEFORE starting the game, forcing you to quit and restart the game; force feedback turns off momentarily during cornering, causing the wheel do go "dead" for a couple of seconds; wheel settings being lost; overly sensitive brake settings (Fanatec CSR pedals with a load cell brake pedal seems to help alleviate this issue). In other words, no matter which wheel I use I will have to put up with one issue or another. This is frustrating and could have been easily avoidable had Codemasters actually took notice of the many forum threads started by users having the SAME EXACT issues in the 2012 release. That's just lazy development/programming if you ask me.\n\nOther noticeable annoyances include the penalty system, which although has been improved a bit from the last game, still will award you penalties that you didn't deserve, while giving AI players a pass. The game also suffers from some very poor optimization compared to the last game. In f1 2012, I was able to run the game at the highest graphics settings while still maintaining good fps and with almost no lag. In f1 2013, I have to play the game with medium to low settings, and even then I still get lag and my fps drops well below 30fps whether im on an online or offline race. I wish this were an exaggeration but it's not.\n\nOverall, despite some bug fixes, there's just way too many issues and nuisances with playing this game that the overall experience suffers greatly. In addition, there are not nearly enough improvements to f1 2013 to warrant someone to play this version over the previous f1 2012. The career mode and online modes are still all too familiar. If you found yourself frustrated with the previous game like I did, skip this version as well. There's no reason to support a game dev company that refuses to fix blatant ongoing issues with their games.","January 26, 2014","false","9.3"," 101 of 154 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","101","154","0","5"

After the Young Drivers' Test you'll have your first ever race weekend in F1 2013. The Practice Session is really helpful to get used to the track and the handling of the car etc. It really takes some time to get used to the handling, the oversteer, the understeer, the track and I recommend to use the full practice season, or even restart it when you're running out of time. The driving assists really help and allow you to focus on the track and its hardest corners. I spent about 7 hours on the Melbourne circuit to get used to the car and the track itself. Once you got used to the handling, oversteer, understeer etc. it won't take that long to get used to the following tracks. If you really want to participate in leagues later on, you have to put a high amount of effort and time into it, but you will get rewarded with some epic battles afterwards ;)\n\nAll in all, the game is a worthy F1 racing game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in Formula 1. I also recommend buying a steering wheel if you don't have one already.\n\nAll important features are included, but of course there always are some things that would be nice to have, but you can't have everything.

Let the pit crew take care of your car so that it may be the most fast and agile car on the track or sometimes you get stuck with a pit crew that will seem to hold you up from time to time depending on what kind of traffic is in the pit. I'll never forget my 12.8 second pitstop on Legend mode all because I didn't go one more lap. There were too many cars in the pit.  Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't. You really have to take the time to plan out when you and your team mate will pit or mistakes will be more often and someone is going to get screwed over. There may even be a few Fbombs dropped depending on how high strung you both are. But, You can still be friends.\n\nOther than that, what can I say? 19 tracks to learn and you should be willing to study up on how to race.  I go to http://www.torquecars.com/articles/motorsports for that and there are some articles on proper shifting and cornering.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great game. Before you waste money on 2014 get this one. The problem I have with 2014 is that it does tend to baby you and you really can't feel the full racing experience. That was also when they switched to V6 turbos which is nothing like F1 2013 where you can race with V12's V10's and V8's all in different eras of course. 2013 has a great career mode for whatever you want to do.

If you don't enjoy going around 20 tracks over and over again for hours then this game is probably not for you. On the other hand if racing around famous tracks such as Monaco at high speed, fighting against some of the best drivers in the world for position and avoiding (or not) huge crashes then I'm pretty confident you'll enjoy this game.\n\nThe main attractions for me is to do with perfecting my racing line, braking points and generally putting in faster lap times again and again. I have also enjoyed modding the game - which isn't intergrated but is relatively straight forward. Mods can do many things to the experience of this game such as increase the damage taken from even the most gentle touch of another car, to increasing the logic of the AI to make them perform better. The final thing I have enjoyed most is the wheel to wheel battles with other cars.\n\nMy Friend, ABigPurpleGoose, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the co-op chanpionship and are currently on our second playthrough fo it.\n\nThe AI can be very quick and you'll notice this especially when they are supposed to be on worn tires with you. They seem to have reduced tire wear or at the least some form of traction control to help them as I'm sure they would not be able to handle driving without one of them. As previously mentioned, mods can improve they're logic. For example, if they are next to another car and they're coming up to a corner, the car on the outside will always win except in a couple of corners like the hairpin at Monaco. The mod can help to remove this significant flaw which certainly spoils the enjoyment. Their very basic logic is the only gripe I have with the game.\n\nFinally, don't buy this game on PC expecting loads of people to be playing online, I have tried many, many times and never raced another human outside of the co-op championship.","April 8, 2015","true","377.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Do you review it as an individual game, irrespectful of it's predecessor or judge it as what it is. So here it goes:\nIndividual Game Well it's a great game with good quality game-play. Driving a F1 car is great fun and F1 '13 has captured it greatly. There's a huge verity of game-modes to chose from. Don't want to do a complete career, then do season challenge. There's quite a verity to choose from. The graphics are good, but not amazing. It also runs at a good frame-rate. The car models look good, and the tracks look like their real life counterparts, which all adds to the immersion. Overall it's a solid game, if you're a fan of F1 it's  must have.\nAs A Sequel Well, it certainly doesn't add much to '12. The only thing is Classic Cars, but as half of it's DLC it does feel quite cheap by Code-masters to do this. So it falls down when compared to '12. If you have it, just pick up a mod that changes the cars, and save yourself a load of money.\n","November 3, 2014","true","405.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The sensitivity and deadzones can be altered when using a gamepad.\nGameplay and driving physics are very solid, although it can sometimes feel very 'on rails' at times as the car doesn't move around much vertically under normal load. However you can still definitely feel the balance of the car and how it moves and slides, and setup changes make a meaningful difference.\nAI is extremely good in single player, like racing a real driver, and they do not cause many incidents which disrupt the race. The level of pace they race at can be changed and on legendary mode they are pretty formidable. However when overlapping them things can get a bit hairy as when you are approaching them and they receive the blue flag, they move over to the opposite side of the track to you. This can cause problems such as when you take a wide line to enter a corner the AI moves to the apex as they think this will get them out of the way, but as you take the racing line to overtake them and cut back to the apex they will be obstructing you.\nLots of single player game modes which are fun, but in the shortened 'season challenge' mode the hardest AI difficulty makes them about 2 seconds a lap slower than the legendary AI, which for some like myself just isnt competitive enough.\nThe full career mode is very in depth and focuses on you beating your team mate, which is what will earn you contract offers. This is very good because you are both given the same car with the same technology, and it comes down to driving skill in the end.\nOverall it is a very solid racer and very fun to play. If you just enjoy getting the feel for cars like me the game can be very fun. 9/10","July 6, 2014","true","132.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

Among 2012's major flaws was an issue where the car was virtually impossible to control at any slip angle. Get sideways, and your only option was cranking the wheel hard over and locking the wheels to stop the car. In 2013, it is possible to save slides much more realistically and retain your speed. This alone is a major fix, greatly helping the racing as you're no longer afraid to push your abilities to the max.

Now.\n\nVery easily one of the most rewarding, and absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing infuriating, games I've played, at least in career mode (where most of my time has been spent). If you're looking for a quick way to drive cars around and have a ball, look elsewhere. Turn off those driver assists and pick up a wheel. You have to be absolutely focused every single moment you're playing this game. One wrong steering, throttle, or gas input and that lap you've worked up to all qualifying session, or that race you've spent 30 minutes to a hour and a half working your way up the grid, or keeping warding off the guys behind, will be all for naught. The emotional highs and lows this game can  generate simply from time investment is amazing. Gameplay is pretty good as long as you can dial in your wheel settings. The AI can go from grandma to F1 star levels of difficulty, so you've actually gotta work for the win or pole position.\n\nThis game will challange you in ways you never thought about. Setting up a car for a certain track is an art in and of its self. Do yourself a favor, tweak your setup a bit, give up, and go google it. It'll save you time and frustration. Or just go with your custom one if you enjoy it more. Faster doesn't always mean a better feeling car, and it'll be your choice as to how you want to go about it.\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game aside from minor grips with compatibility with Windows 10. But this is simply due to my computer and not the game.

My enjoyment of the game could be mostly attirbuted to my online multiplayer experiences, especially league racing. My one issue with this game is the unchallenging AI. Initially, I felt as if the AI was way overpowered, as I was struggling to keep up with even the easiest setting. However, as I've developed my driving style and got a better feel for the handling of the cars, I've found even legendary difficulty a breeze. I hope that this issue can be fixed in F1 2014. That being said, I would still recommend that a first time player of F1 games at least try F1 2013, especially since it will be significantly cheaper than F1 2014, which comes out later this month. 8/10","October 15, 2014","true","157.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend this game or F1 2012 for one main reason. If you are into force feedback from a steering wheel then I would suggest checking to make sure your steering wheel might not have issues with this game. My Logitech one has issues and makes the game very difficult to play properly because of it.\n\n-- Solution -- If you have this issue, you might want to go into the control panel, game controller area... and set all force feedback options to 100%. Then go to the game reduce deadzone down to 1.25% and everything seems to work then.\n\nI find the AI even on easy mode to be hard at times, especially given that I'm not 100% into F1 racing. So, this game I would only recommend to those that are looking for a challenge or just for something to change up from driving the same games in their collection.","September 6, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Took me a while to adjust handling sensitivity but once I hit a sweet-spot for my wheel the experience was nice and challenging enough. Tested with traction control and aids disabled, aside from auto-gears. Wouldn't buy this if only for keyboard or game-pad.\nCareer: ability to swap teams in-season if you have good results; teammate challenges;\nDifficulty is scaling well.\n3-phase qualifying is entertaining and well-captured. Remember that if you get to Q3 you will start the race with the tires you set your fastest lap in that phase (F1 2013 rule)! Cons:\nCar setups don't seem to be so reactive or realistic. Seem to adjust more to driving style than to need per-track adjustments.\nTire management can get too problematic - but this seems to emulate reality closely. It looks like the computer controlled cars are doing a near-perfect job at keeping their tire condition and making their gums last longer - and they never have problems if staying out for too long or destroying them by driving to aggressively - that would have added to the immersion and realism.\nI am pretty satisfied with this title, enough that I resisted trying the newer incarnations, as reviews convinced me this is the way to go if you want to try Codemasters' series. F1 2014 brings too little over this, and F1 2015 has catastrophic reviews.","March 30","true","60.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's still playable with keyboard with correct settings. Brake distrubution is a little bit apart from reality as the minimum braking distance is possible with only front biased braking instead of equal distrubution.

Well, this is exactly what I love about it. When you are new, at first you struggle to drive the car and finish in the top 10 on amateur difficulty. It's almost like the game is telling you: You're not worth anything, try harder! And that urges me to do better and improve.\nI'm really happy that Codemasters put classic cars and tracks in the game. It's just such a pity that we don't race at Brands Hatch anymore.\nThe career mode is more engaging than in F1 2012 and Codemasters are starting to get the "Be the driver, live the life" effect.\nI won't go on to say all the things I like about F1 2013 because they are countless but i will say what I don't like.\nThe AWFUL online servers.\nI don't know if it is just me, but when I go into a quick online race, it can't find any lobbies. It's so annoying that I stopped playing online. And believe me, on F1 2012 I used to play a lot.\nYou can't use Niki Lauda's Ferrari in any mode exept time trial.\nIn a 25% race, you get a 10second time penalty if you cause a crash. I mean, seriously. You're doing 14 laps and they choose to give you a 10 second time penalty and not a drive through?\nThere are a few other things that bug me, but I'm the kind of person who looks at the details. So it's small things like the colour of the kerbs, or in career mode if it says your name on your overalls or if you can have it say Vodafone or Red Bull on your helmet that I really appreciate.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience what F1 is about. The game keeps improving each year (the first game I played was F1 2009) and I think this is the best F1 game Codemasters have released so far.\n\n\n\n","December 11, 2013","true","208.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

furthermore its perfectly ok for the AI to run you off the track\nduring a race but if i do that PENALTY and if you haven't figured it out yet the penalty system\nis COMPLETELY BROKEN in F1 2013 often you will get penalties for stuff that in many cases were\nthe fault of the shoddy or overly aggressive AI drivers and the game will not penalize them or\neven warn them.\n\nthe young driver test was expanded but not in a good way some of the newer tests are just ridiculously hard although i have to say i personally do not like the abu dahbi track they use but still that said some of the tests are just brutal especially with the issuses of braking not working correctly even with full assist turned-on and the accelerator acting like its bi-polar and when it comes to certain tests UNFAIR time expectations for the test like complete this section of corners(section 3 of the abu dahbi track) in 50 seconds for bronze 48 for silver and 46 seconds for gold...it took me 6 attempts just to get a bronze on that test or /shudder the wet driving conditions test i ALMOST broke my controller because that test was so difficult(yes i know driving on water is hard but still.....)\n\nalso i have to be frank IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST F1 GAME YOU MADE A VERY BAD CHOICE; THIS GAME IS NOT NEWBIE FRIENDLY. the learning curve is just way too STEEP and part of the problem is that the game assumes from the first loading screen that you have played the other F1 games and it shoe-horns you into a tutorial that is for the most part HORRENDOUS especially when i'm doing what the game is telling me to do but it doesn't accept/register it until you do it perfectly or the game feels like it wants to acknowlegde it i often had to do the tutorial and young driver tests 5, 6, 7, 8 times before the game would let me go to the next stage or test.\n\nat this point i feel the need to call out the LAZINESS on the part of codemasters in the cut scenes and the look of the pit crew no matter what team you are on your pit crew is the SAME for EVERY team in F1 2013 the only thing they change is the outfits they wear otherwise its the same guys for every team and also no matter what position you finish in if you don't place in the top three its the SAME cut-scene EVERY time even if you finish 4th you get the exact same cut-scene at race end as you do for finishing 12th or 14th or 20th or any other place that isn't 1st 2nd or 3rd even if you finish "in the points"\n\nanother thing to call out the developers on is this WHY IS THERE NO STEAMWORKSHOP SUPPORT????? and on top of that is it that hard to program in a simple mod checker so people with mods can play online against other people using mods and people not using mods can play against other people not using mods? or if you go to play online all mods are disabled. codemasters solution to modding the game is this: IF YOU USE MODS YOU FORFEIT ONLINE MODE.\nand the only way i've heard of to get online mode back is that you have to remove all of your mods\nand then uninstall the game then re install the game without the mods so you can play online.\nthats a pretty s----y modding policy there codemasters.\n\nhere is my overall impression:\nthe penalty system is broken\nthe AI WHEN it works presents a decent challenge\nhowever you will often find that the game feels like its\nworking against you not with you.\nthe game is not designed around a new player "friendly" experience\nsome of the new/expanded modes are just terrible and unfairly difficult\nwhen it comes to animations and cutscenes it feels like codemasters "took a nap"\nand finally the mod policy is complete and total s--t\n\nBottomline:\nif you already have F1 2011 or F1 2012\nDO NOT BUY F1 2013\nits essentially F1 2012 with a "fresh coat" of paint\ni did not have any fun playing this game\ngrade D+","June 27, 2014","false","4.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

Exactly here the engineering thought closely intertwines with skill of driving. The aspiration provokes to win against creation of the new inventions which are often used further in serial cars. Therefore can't but please that Codemasters put on a stream and every year lets out F1 simulators, with the indication of year in the name. F1 2013 - a simulator, with exact calculation of all parameters and nuances. Therefore to the person who has come here from any GRID 2, from the same studio, it is necessary to study everything literally from scratch. The most important that it is necessary to acquire – formula 1 race cars rear-wheel and with ease gather speed in 300 km/h. To pilot such race car it is similar to art. In race it is impossible to make a uniform mistake, after all the account goes on fractions of a second and, having lost a place, to receive it very difficult back. At once it is worth forgetting about braking, crashing sides into walls, and also about gas cave-in in a floor on turns. The slightest congress from the route will strongly slow down a race car, and the small peregazovka will develop it on a beautiful arch. In races a formula 1 always there were strict rules therefore from all possible lotions, for short time increasing speed, the KERS system and a rear wing are available to the player. The first accumulates energy when braking and allows to use it when overtakings. The provision of a rear wing allows to regulate force pressing a race car to the earth that is very useful on long direct sites of the route. The main pleasure for fans of a formula 1 here, of course, is opportunity to support a favorite team, against real-life pilots. It is especially pleasant to become part of young Russian Marussia Team. This team quite recently in a formula 1 and it is obvious not in favourites therefore to lead it to a victory twice difficult. For beginners game contains very good training mode presented in the form of tests of young pilots. Here will train in all subtleties of piloting of race cars, since the elements. Will explain and will show how the weather phenomena influence the controllability, what trajectory it is better to choose and at what moments to make overtaking. Successfully performing tasks in training, we open teams in which it is possible to begin career. Having passed entrance tests, it is possible to adjoin, at last, to pleasant which not only will provide a race car of own production, but also will give full information support, like strategy for each arrival. However, the pilot isn't attached to the chosen command tightly. Directly in a break between races the invitation from competitors can come. Whether to throw yesterday's friends, having coveted opportunities of the tempter, - to solve already to you. Letters with threats to the traitor all the same won't follow. In comparison with the predecessor from last year, F1 2013 considerably I got prettier visually. Certainly, there is no GRID 2 luster, but is extremely clear that for a simulator it isn't so critical. Nevertheless, here it is necessary to pilot race cars, having concentrated on tactics, instead of to drive, collecting all chippers, on the mountains on very expensive Bugattis Veyron. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).","March 15, 2014","true","8.5"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","26","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyprdrv/recommended/223670/","hyprdrv","hyprdrv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyprdrv/","41 products in account","The title may say "F1" but this is a great racing game in general which focuses on both the technical and strategic aspects of racing not only a F1 car, but any racing car. Using a wheel or a gamepad doesn't matter in this game, since the huge difference between controller and wheel users isn't that great. This version of the game introduced something which is both annoying and realistic - tyre scaling. It really adds simulation and strategy into the game, something which I think a lot of racing games lack.\n\nYou don't need to be a F1 engineer to play this game. Any F1/racing fan can pick up this game and go. If you're not a avid F1 fan you can chose to turn simulation off and it drives much like a regular arcade racing game, but if you're more experienced in F1 and know the ins and outs, you can turn on full simulation in which the gameplay is much more strategic.\n\nF1 2013 was the perfect game to buy, and at the right time, too. At the time when the whole "loud, noisy, gas guzzling engines" era has ended, I know I could pick this game up again in a few years and like the nostalgia of the loud F1 engine noises, as well as drive some of the classic cars, driven by racing legends all over the world in previous F1 years on some historic, and well known modern tracks.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who asked me about it. Sure there's some glitches and problems, but that happens in every game, eh?","July 12, 2014","true","214.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Waste of time to have to enter the session only to find out 14min 59secs remain.\n- penalty system works most of the time but throws some funky decisions in too.\n- on the xbox controller I can use the vibration function to feel for loss of traction. Easing of throttle regains control of car. No such luxury for wheel users who have to rely on visual and audio clues.","September 26, 2014","true","369.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The high reving sounds are awesome. Not to mention you get the chance to play some of the vintage f1 cars. Takes a while to get used to how the cars handle, especially with no assists, but once you get the hang of the car it's a blast to drive on the edge.\n\nGraphics are awesome, clear and detailed with lots of eye candy. FPS is solid and never bogs down.\nLots of features to keep you comming back like dynamic weather, garage customization, scenarios and more.\n\nThe handling of the cars feel great to me. Mind you I've never driven an F1 car in real life to say, but the cars feel responsive yet different in a wide variety of situations from tire temp and wear, track temp, weather, carsetup, fuel load / mix, brake pressure etc.\n\nAll around a solid racing series I think any race fan should try!","September 6, 2015","true","76.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Driving mechanics make you feel like you are in the cockpit really driving a race with masters.  It takes a lot practise to beat AI on highest difficulty without driving assist, but I don't think that it's impossible.\nIn my opinion pros are\n-Graphics\n-Driving mechanics\n-Replayability\n\nI think that there are few cons though.\nFirstly, AI players won't try to defend when you are overtaking. They make it a little too easy.\nSecondly, I think that AI should have more variety on pitstop strategies. Everyone are stopping during 2 laps. In my opinion there should be like few surprisers with a whole different tactic.\n\nAltogether. I really recommend this game despite those few cons. Also, I know that 2014 version is out, but as Codemasters has said it won't bring that much difference compared to 2013 version. Just buy this one and get a mod that puts drivers to correct teams in 2014 season.

The sense of speed is there, and the handling model, though not a simluation by any means, is good enough to keep the game fun while leaving room for better racers to shine. The retro mode is a little shallow but a nice addition regardless. The biggest negative present is the A.I. is extremely scared to make almost any move on you, so a five or six man train is common between slow computer drivers and players alike.","June 23, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can feel how the guys from codemaster were supe ambitious to make a real controller game with super fast paced formula 1 combined. And they nailed it.\n\nThis review is made after I paused playing it for 1 1/2 years. I played nearly everything what you can do in this game. With super setups from professional AOR Drivers, with fun setups against legends bots, with classics cars, season challenge or carreer. And it's perfect in itself.\n\nSure you may miss things from previous or later versions. Like the interview stuff in the carreer from 2012 or the aggressive AI from 2015. Even there are some improvements with the steering in 2015. But nothing you would really miss if you dont know.\n\nWhen the game was released I played over 160h, now I played 30h since last month. And as you can read I am totally hyped again.\n\nThx for reading the review. As a sign of my graceness here are some advice:\n\n- to solve the tyre wear: drive on the racing line, dont get off track, here the feedback of your controller\n\n- set off all assists and learn to drive without them. before you will not have the fun you could have.\n\n- watch youtube TRLLimitless and TRLFlo these guys are really fast\n\n-if you have trouble with anything: add me :D","August 23, 2014","true","207.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's one of the most accurate F1 games I have ever played, Put the power down at the wrong place and you spin, simple as that.. get hit, you spin. Anything that happens that isn't right you spin, apart from when you crash into the wall... All the cars are to 2013 performance spec (as you would expect) which means that the McLarens are abismally slow and the red bulls are just too quick for everyone else. All the drivers are and will always stay in their 2013 teams. For 2014 it would be cool if they could swap\n\n\nGraphics:\nThis game is beautiful, it looks amazing from all angles and the detail in the cockpit makes you WANT to play in cockpit cam, you can see the legs move as you accellerate and brake. Plus, this game is super easy to run, my GT 640 handles this at 1080p on ultra.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQMgDfAwWgk - Here is a link of the banchmark test on ultra settings so you can see how good it looks.\n\nSound:\nThis is something that no F1 game has got quite right yet. However, if I was going to give the award to any game for the closest sound, I would give it to this. It sounds almost right, the McLaren has a lower tone to every other car just makes it feel so real.\n\nConclusion:\nBuy the game, it's so real but at the same time keeping it so fun. The online part is so funny with all the noobs just diving down your inside, even if they crash you out its still hilarious (mainly because you can rage at them during the race!)\n\n6/5\nWould barrier again.","April 9, 2014","true","69.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

THEY SUCK SO BADLY AT LAP 1... this is a common issue with all Codemasters games... the AI is fast when its alone but SUCKS LIKE HELL when anyone is near it, so resultingly you get into 1st-5th from that 18th place start... then of course the ones infront of you fly away and all the guys behind you just line up behind you because they are actually faster than you, they do show some promise in their overtaking skills (the one thing codemasters did better than gran turismo: the real traffic simulator) but then retaking them is EASY AS ALL HELL because they suck so bad when they are near anyone...\nThis just makes the whole race seem utterly pointless, you cant keep up with them but then you finish in first anyway... oh wait but you don't! why not? having 90% of the field behind you they naturally.. CRASH INTO YOU AND END YOUR RACE...\n\nWhat i will say is i think they at least did a good job on the physics, this is not to say that its a simulator, it misses out on a lot but the game does seem to fully meet its aims that codemasters always tell us ("we want to make a game that can have realism when the player sets it to but focuses mainly on having physics that allow casual racing fans to join in") [not an actual quote but y'know] The thing i would say is that locking up brakes and spinning tires doesn't feel right, i cant explain it but in other racing games when i lock my tires i sortof know its happening, in this im never sure if my tires have grip or not.\nA problem related to physics i would mention... when you use a wheel make sure to set the option for controller override type to wheel, i spent a few hours driving without that set and the cars just feel horrible then (it would be nice if it could just detect "oh this guy has a G27 connected, i think ill set the controller type to wheel for him"...\n\nSo the conclusion.. Codemasters... i know you will be working a lot on graphics for the "next gen" version but please make the AI more consistent...","March 20, 2014","false","13.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I started off in Amateur level with all assists ON in Career mode, struggled to get decent times . With each passing race weekend , I practised over 20 laps on Practise Day, making me more faster, and by also removing one assist and improving the AI difficulty each race.\nCurrently at 'Expert', one short of 'Legend' difficulty.\n\nThe game experience is amazing with stability control OFF, gives a true Formula 1 car drive feel due to lack of grip in lower gears. Tire Wear is amazing in F1 2013 and one can control this to get 1-2 more laps in a tyre. Fuel control is another option that can we used to improve lap times and save fuel in the latter stages. AI gets pretty aggressive with improving difficulty and also defends its line well . Graphics is great as well,espectially in heavy rain conditions\n\nA great game for a F1 fanatic  !\n\nRating : 7/10 ( Good )","June 22, 2015","true","131.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Again as wiht most games, buy it on the sales or when it has a reduced price.

Over all the game play is solid and there are a good amount of game modes to chose from. Classic mode is one of my favorites, the feeling you get when driving one of the 1980's F1 cars is pretty great. The game has alot to offer a racing fan but it is possible to get bored pretty fast. There is not a "huge" amount of content but if you like mastering the same tracks and what not that could be a plus. Try F1 2013 it's obviously better than any of those "free" racing games, and its arguably better than most of the other F1 games.

The cars perform as they should in the 2013 roster with the RedBulls winning the majority of the races behind the Mercedes. The AI is a little hard to play against in timed laps but very easy in races.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are simply amazing, being on PC they look magnificent with AntiAliasing. I've played the Console counter-part and the graphics look pitifully bad, Jaggies everwhere. This game looks sensational on PC.\n\nDLC:\nThe two dlc packs available are rather, decent. They include a few new tracks from the golden years of F1 Racing. The cars are fun to drive and the tracks are interesting to play on. However, it may seem that the DLC's are a little bit expensive for what they're but that's expected with a licensed game for a premium sport.\n\nMultiplayer:\nMultiplayer in this game is a little...iffy. It doesn't seem to connect all the time with friends which is usually port issues and can be fixed with 3rd party programs. However, when the Multiplayer does work it is very fun and has many settings for all your racing needs.\n\nExtra:\nThere is a few customizability options - You can fully tweak your performance of your car which is great if you're a racing nut and want the best times possible. You can also choose from over 50 different helmets. But that's about it. In F1 2013 there is also RaceNet which hosts weekly events where you may drive a specific track and win points if you get good enough times.\n\n\n","January 8, 2014","true","58.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Whether you want to drive with full assists and a racing line or with zero assists and your favorite wheel and pedal combo, you've got hours of racing fun in front of you which is perfect as we're about to enter the F1 off-season. The career mode is challenging, both from the perspective of learning the tracks during the practice stints and in terms of the intra-team competition between drivers.\n\nWhile I've faithfully played through the first season of career mode, I can say that languishing on a middling F1 team can be frustrating. Your car will struggle for grip as you try to eek out extra 10ths that won't get you on any podium. Some of the top tier teams might smoke you on the straights, but that doesn't mean you can't throw an elbow into Vettel and then immediately burn a replay.\n\nFortunately, you can expedite the process of being on a "great" team or finishing on the podium early on via a few different methods: play against "amateur" level AI, or play in the season challenge, challenge another driver and win a ride on their team. The first time you drive for a top-tier team (redbull / mercedes / ferrari) you'll find the difference in car handling and performance to be staggering.\n\nThe game offers quite a bit of replayability and is a must own for any F1 fan / fan of racing games.","November 26, 2013","true","44.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

In terms of a game, there's a somewhat serious underlying element on offer which might make it a little less open to newcomers, but that said, with practice and learning, the rewards for success are worthwhile.  As the only F1 game available at present, Codemasters have proved that they can offer a comprehensive racing experience that ticks all the right boxes but doesn't rest on its laurels. If you're an F1 fan, then this is a must buy, if you're an owner of last year's game, then this is an improvement but might not be the fresh journey it could be.  In terms of value, there's a lot of content under the hood, and therefore comes recommended for gamers looking to experience the thrills of F1 racing at home.\n\n\n\nScore 8.5/10 - Review by Robert Cram","November 26, 2013","true","14.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JesterHead/recommended/223670/","JesterHead","JesterHead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JesterHead/","538 products in account","I went from F1 2012 on Xbox 360 to just picking 2013 up here on Steam's Fall sale, and I have to say that it's a REALLY good update to last year's F1 game. I wasn't sure how they could spice up the series, even with the classic mode added in, but the tweaks Codemasters did to the gameplay, game engine, and other aspects like that make it feel like a pretty big step up.\n\nThe very first thing I noticed from last year's game was sound tweaks. The cars sound much more real to life than in 2012, the little sounds of wind blowing against parts, the sounds of the car scraping the ground or the different materials your car runs over. The car's engine also seems to behave much more realistically, such as when you're digging out of 1st gear from the race start...the car will either hit the rev limiter spinning tires, or it will suddenly grip up and you'll hear the engine groan as it gets up to speed.\n\nI don't think I will compare the visuals, as Xbox graphics vs. PC graphics are two different animals. But I will say that the graphics, lighting, effects, and textures in 2013 look AMAZING on my system.\n\nAs for the car handling, I immediately felt a difference in the handling doing the Young Driver's Test. I started out with ABS and Traction Control on just to get a feel for it, then took them off after a while. In 2012, it felt like the steering response was immediate, while 2013 you really feel like you're driving a car with a human driver, and not a robot with instant steering. It took a little getting used to, but it honestly feels better and much more immersive. And speaking of traction control, it seems that it was toned down a bit in 2013 so that you actually have to put more effort into driving instead of just gassing, braking, and steering, and expecting the traction control and ABS to handle everything else. Even if you aren't into hardcore, realistic racing sims, it still feels a lot better once you get a grasp on handling the car through the corners smoothly without spinning out. Other smaller things like changing fuel/brake/tire settings with the directional pad (Xbox controller) feels MUCH smoother and a whole lot less distracting than in 2012. This is one minor gripe I had in 2012- navigating the quick menus on the fly felt laggy and too animated. Button presses and changes are quick, letting you worry about cornering and not playing with your steering wheel while racing.\n\nThe classic mode is a lot of fun, but I tend to jump into career mode first thing in games like this. It's an entirely different world from modern F1 cars, but they are still a blast to learn. Again, the sound design popped out to me when I fired up the Classics mode. The engine sounds from different era cars aren't recycled or slightly modified for each car, they are their own sound.\n\nAll in all, great step forward for a series that basically doesn't change from year to year (following real life). But from the responseiveness of the cars, to the improved sound, to the visuals, to the added modes, I don't regret the purchase at all and see myself spending a ton of time in this :D","November 28, 2013","true","35.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Even if you haven't bought Classic Edition you still have 1980s cars and both Brands Hatch and Jerez to race around.

A real F1 have both.\n\nDespite of all the cons above mentioned, I must say: beautiful graphics, really\n\nMaybe this game is a little pretentious,.\n\nTo those who want fun without "compromise" with reality, I can recommend this Simcade (at the best).\nTo those who seek a more realistic car behaviour, there's Assetto Corsa he in Steam, or you could try any of the Simulations above mentioned.\n\nThat's it.","March 14, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You spend a small fraction of your time on the track, with most of the game devoted to loading, listening to instructions, and watching cut scenes. I don't mind a laid-back, relaxing game pace; I love Banished, for example.

In terms of a game, there's a somewhat serious underlying element on offer which might make it a little less open to newcomers, but that said, with practice and learning, the rewards for success are worthwhile.  As the only F1 game available at present, Codemasters have proved that they can offer a comprehensive racing experience that ticks all the right boxes but doesn't rest on its laurels. If you're an F1 fan, then this is a must buy, if you're an owner of last year's game, then this is an improvement but might not be the fresh journey it could be.  In terms of value, there's a lot of content under the hood, and therefore comes recommended for gamers looking to experience the thrills of F1 racing at home.\n\n\n\nScore 8.5/10 - Review by Robert Cram","November 26, 2013","true","14.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Classic content should be included in the default price though!\n\nThe control system is this game was really well placed, I did enjoy it very much. I would still say this game is better than the 2015 version, even just due to the classic content. I played much more of classic on this game than I did the 2013 season, so my rating is more on that than anything else. But don't get me wrong, from what I did get through on 2013 it was stunning.\n\nIt's still worth a buy now for £10, maybe £15 with the classic, but still think that should be the base game.","June 28, 2014","true","242.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On the other hand i have to give it more of a thumbs down due to the fact that it is hardly a new player friendly game. Even on the easiest difficulty settings your being thrown in to what feels like an expert race even after completeing the young driver tests. If you go to play just Grand Prix, its the same outcome. Its not easy to stay within the top 10 out of 16 or 22 car races. I see potential of learning this game but the sheer complexity of the game for new players is just a little too much in my book.","December 4, 2013","false","7.0"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

With my experience of the game I had some massive bugs that was either an error of steam's installation or just bugs in the game. First off the 2013 cars did not work at all. The engineer would often deny the oppurtunity for me to be out on track, if I actually made it out on track an error would appear and the game would close. Secondly, the only cars that I was consistently able to drive without a game bug were the classics, when using these there were also some bugs with the HUD not functioning at all with the speedometer, rev-counter and gear indicator sticking to 0 or neutral. all the rest of the HUD had no text and were just coloured rectangles. I understand this is probably a good game, I loved F1 2012, but with my experience I am sorry to say I cannot recommend this game knowing these bugs can occur.","March 14, 2014","false","44.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","3"

For example, if you ALT+TAB at any point, you can't get back to fullscreen, so you have to play windowed which is just distracting. The graphics are pretty shiny for a license game, but as a non-fan, I expected something a bit better from a brand as well recognised as F1.\n\nThe "young driver" challenges are easy and very generic, even by racing game standards and don't really teach you much about the game apart from "engineers have annoying voices".\n\nFor anything more than a fiver, this game is rubbish; I would be surprised if anyone, even F1 fans would want to play this...","March 16, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's a significant step forward from 2012, with new physics, tyre wear scaling, AI and of course, the classic content.\n\nThere still are some drawbacks - FP1 and FP2 are still missing, one could complain about recycling of cutscenes and music, and the penalty system that remain unreliable, to say the least.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LGBR/recommended/223670/","LGBR","LaserGuidedBunnyRabbit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LGBR/","88 products in account","This... this game is a troll. It hates you, and it doesn't want you to play it. Let's start with the first glaring flaw of the game:\nFullscreen mode is going to break and fail during your first attempt to alt-tab to check something, and will thus require you to alter the games XML file to send it back to fullscreen mode. There is no option for fullscreen in the game. In fact, when you hit Escape->Options there are no video options whatsoever. You instead must go through a seperate menu from the main menu to change the graphic options (where fullscreen as an option does not exist). Which begs the question: What year is this? And, Codemasters should seriously upgrade to the Intel 486DX so they can start programming features that most games have been comfortable in providing for over a decade.\n\nSo, nitpicking aside, let's get to the meat of the game. Oh wait, you can't. Because you have to do the tutorial day. Well, I guess I can deal with that. STEP ONE: Drive in a straight line. Uh... okay... STEP TWO: Watch a video. You're kidding me right? And it only gets better when in the second driving tutorial, it introduces you to an "unexpected" hitch by blowing out your tire and forcing you to use it's atrocious rewind system to correct it without really explaining why it's even there or how to use it effectively.\n\nIf you haven't uninstalled already, you're probably saying "Okay, enough with this garbage, let me just run a single race so I can see ACTUAL GAMEPLAY." So you begin clicking around menus, sitting through unendingly long and painful narrations that are happy to explain to you the most basic possible concepts such as "using your eyes" and "reading what things are." Surely there must be an option to run a race after sitting through a guy explaning what a menu is!  But no, no no no, you silly, silly F1 Enthusiast! This is North Korean F1 Simulator 1994 and completion of the tutorial is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY. So, begrudgingly, you return to finish out the tutorial mission when you're presented with a wonderful mission to utilize your KERS and DRS systems to overtake an NPC who is casually driving in a straight line. I ran this tutorial multiple times. Like, more than three times. Every time, even though I executed every manuever flawlessly and properly utlized both systems when prompted to, it repeatedly failed me.\n\nThis is where I'm uninstalling the game.\n\nRacing games are a simple formula. You drive fast, you don't crash, and you get first place. The fun is very easily obtainable. You don't need a million customization options or RPG elements - of which the game does pretty well at avoiding. However, in order to enjoy a racing game, there should be some actual racing involved. Racing that doesn't involve sitting through a four-hour lecture that unintentionally changes your opinion on wanting to get involved in racing to begin with. This is an extremely easy idea to follow, and it's extremely difficult to mess it up this horribly - which implies that Codemasters actually went out of their way to make this game as inaccessable as possible. I'm sure that somewhere in there, there's a competent, well-polished, fun racing game, but I must repeat that this should in fact be a game first and foremost, not a true simulator - of which this game actually fails pretty handily at that also. In closing, I highly recommend avoiding this cancerous program at all costs, including selling your PC if you ever consider buying this.","March 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I don't know why someone would play a racing game at this setting.\n\nWant to change the settings? Too bad.\n\n1st, you need to sit through an unskippable promo video. I get it, F1 is awesome, that's why I bought the F1 game.\n\nThen it's a series of reasonable questions about your name and location. Those were fine. Still impossible to get to settings.\n\nThen you make a choice between Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren. They don't say what that choice means, but in the following minute you're racing for the team you selected before -- so it's a minor mistake instead of an egregious one. Still no way to access settings.\n\nNext, the tutorial has you click every button.\n\nYou learn to shift, even if you're going to play with automatic.\nYou learn to use the brake and gas -- while parked.\nYou are learning everything right now, outside of actual gameplay, which is a sure way to forget everything you "learned."\n\nBut at least you can finally get to the main menu and adjust settings.\n\nI still don't know how to get the game out of windowed mode.\n\nHopefully the meat of the gameplay is more carefully crafted than an intro which ignores at least a decade worth of game design knowledge -- get out of the user's way, teach things gradually and let them apply learnings before moving on to next concept, don't launch a triple-AAA PC title in windowed mode, etc. -- but after that sad experience, I'm pessimistic.","May 31, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FegelMobil/recommended/223670/","FegelMobil","Phil Rye the Narcotics Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FegelMobil/","38 products in account","First off, You may view my review as biased, as it is clearly mine. I do intend to be as objective as possible.\n\nF1 2013 a game created in correspondence to the F1 2013 season, a mix of Simulation Racing and Arcade F1.\nEssentially, it's a rather difficult game to master, as you have to know the circuits in and out, on top of which the AI, even though their cornering speeds are horrible, will have faster cars than you in the career mode. This of course means that teams like Caterham or Marussia will be slower than Ferrari or McLaren, common sense as in real life it's the same situation. It's a nice challange nonetheless.\nAll in all the game feels solid, when you turn off all Assists, which most of I do, this game simulates tire spin, loss of traction, over- and understeer quite nicely. Although my wheel does not simulate every bump un the road, I do feel it when I make a mistake, I'd prefer something more realistic, such as the wheel giving feedback from just uneven straights. Yet all in all it makes the game much more accessible to newcomers. The track selection is nice with the 19 2013 tracks plus Brands Hatch and Jerez.\nNow some people want the 'real' F1 experience, and this gets pretty close, or at least close enough to be loads of fun. Yet, the destruction engine on realistic setting is all but on par with what you'd expect. It feels weak and forgiving, the game won't mind a small nudge or wall strafe. This of course makes the game a lot more accessible but at the price of realism, also I believe CM could have implemented a hardcore destruction engine. Aside from that there are a few bugs I'd like to point out.\nThe game may not be very compatible with 'Alt+Tab', and may go into windowed mode. You can fix this by pressing 'Win+R' and typing in the opened window {wordpad "%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\FormulaOne2013\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml} and on the eight line changing 'fullscreen:false' to 'fullscreen:true', your resolution may resent after this, so you have to change that in-game again.\n\nAside that, the AI seems a little stupid but that's fine, thy may still provide a nice challange if you choose a slower car. What I do recommend is finding a friend as co-op is much more enjoyable than playing alone.\nAlso one short notice; the game never told me that after Q3 you have to start with the tires you set the fastest lap with, so I recommend using them for one timed lap.\n\nThus far I haven't noticed any other 'real' problems that may affect gameplay, but be aware that there may be some I cannot report about, this goes for every game though. You should not feel discouraged to buy this product because of that.\n\nAll in all it's a nice addition to any gaming library, if you like racing games. The only problem is the official Steam price, I'd recommend getting a disk-copy from amazon.co.uk for 10 pounds, compared to the standard EU price of 30-50€.\n\nThat being said, I hope this review helped you make a decision.","March 14, 2014","true","211.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unlike most of you, I love Driving tests. In fact, I won't buy a racing game that doesn't include them. Anyway, Brake assist is probably making the Tests harder than they should be. Turn it off. It will basically negate drifting if it's too high and become unpredictable if it's set too low.\n\nRight now it's the best Sim racer on PC.  I'll keep a watchful eye on Asseto Corsa because It will have racing other than F1.\n\nGrats Codemasters on earning my money!\n\n\nEdit* Just want to confirm that all test can be completed on a Gamepad.

Destroying your tyres early doesn't mean the end, with a couple of pitstops to go. Getting new tyres and handling fuel mixture to climb the ladder of positions on a multy stop GP is absolutely breathtaking and precisely what it should be. Little mistakes means a lot on high difficulties, strategies have their heavyweigh just like the real thing.\n\nSome bugs might occour, some animations clearly seems really unpolished, but the atmosphere is there, the competition against a decent AI seems to get this Grand Prix 3 and 4 player through where he has been on those classic games and enjoyed every second. You cannot ask for a Grand Prix Legends or Nascar 2003 level of realism on handling and traction, even damage (with mods you can), but this codemaster's franchise is the finest recreation of Formula one the market has ever seen.\n\nCarreer is amazing, minigames such scenario is not really my thing, as being invested in carreer already gives you a lot of scenarios and challenges to overcome after those precious points.\n\nPros: Atmosphere,  Easy to Advanced handling from simers to casuals, Great Graphics, Performance is great, Decent AI (not perfect), Amazing out of the box value, Tons of potential hours, Can be taken as a simulator.\n\nCons: Ocasional rules glitches, some laped AI can be a pain or even get you out of the race, car setups are too gamey with abstract values and not real measures (ie: Angle of wings are displayed in 0 to 11 and not in degrees), some tracks are a little off from the real life with wrong turn banking and elevations missing/present (reference of great track mapping/coding: Grand Prix series)\n\nAbout F1 2013 in especial: worth every penny if you're offline racer (didn't tested multiplayer but it is functional)\n\nWill buy 2014. (Not Released Yet)\n\nF1 2013 - 9/10.","June 9, 2014","true","113.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game involves tight turns and narrow lanes, it is easy to start and fun. Graphics are supreeme and smooth, the cars and people are bassed on real people and time eras etc(the track pack and 1980s cars). It is a game for people who have alot of time for things like grand prix, in witch you may race up to 40 minutes in a single game, or test day witch also takes up time too. If you have a gamepad for your pc use it!!!!!! this game is not friendly to keybords and i can only use my left hand to play so my right hand is useless in this game unless i want to shift down in witch i just set it to auto-shift. I like the game and have been a big fan of it on console, butt if your the same and think its going to be a breeze, just leave. This game will take a liitle time to get ok at the ai's are smart and will overtake you at every chance, the controlls are weird for people like me who only use awsd cause it uses for example on the mac the arrow buttons. So in conclusion this is a game for people with time and gamepads and to understand how the cars work and how to tune them, it will push the limits and challenge the best racers.

The handling is snappy, and there is enough scope to suit different driving styles. The Classic Pack is good but underwhelming - only vintage Williams and Ferrari cars, with a Lotus here and there. I would have liked to see some Tyrell classic cars in there (like the 8 wheeled version).\n\nThe tyre wear is broken - so head over to Race Department and download a tyre wear mod. Also get the realistic damage mod, because the Codemasters default is laughably bad. In addition, forget about completing the achievements for this game also, because online is dead.\n\nI recently purchased F1 2014, and that was a huge mistake - seriously bad understeering, and incorrect liveries for the cars (ie the Mclaren) and the steering wheels are wrong.  If looking for a good F1 racer, then it is the 2013 version to recommend. There is a lot of content, challenges and scope to last quite a while - I think my 200+ hours is proof of that.","January 28, 2015","true","311.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At least this year they have included some classic cars and tracks which is refreshing.\n\nThe Co-op championship feature is a highlight and suprisingly rare in today's racing games.\n\nMultiplayer races can be enjoyable if you play with friendly and equally skilled drivers along with appropriate settings. However the online community is small and 'hardcore', so new and casual players are in for a rough time. Being rammed/wrecked early on is also to be expected in such competitive (egotistical and ruthless) yet unmanaged racing.\n\nUnfortunately the online lobby is "region locked" as well, so you may have to change the preferred download region in your Steam settings to find any matches (e.g. to 'UK - London'). Codemasters should address this issue as it's likely the reason there are so few players shortly after the game's release.","December 21, 2013","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't imagine how I ever lived before now with this game NOT in my steam library! It is pricey, I'll tell you that. I just got F1 on sale, with both DLC's, for a whomping $22.06. On a 66% Off sale! Wowza, thats almost Kerbal Space Program at full price, I tell ya. Is it worth $50? With DLC's $64.99? No. Definately not worth full price. It is fun though, better than any car vroom vroom game i've played in a while, but not worth those XTREME prices. But I saw it on sale and said, this is F1 Dammit, and bought it.\n\nEnough ranting about the price, lets get into the juicy details of the game, shall we?\n\nI bought this game finally because my friend buddermandoesmc had it, and said it was really awh-mazing. So I purchaced it, as I said on sale, and tried this one out. And what do you know? It was pretty cool. You start out in what the game calls it "Young Driver Courses" and then you go onto the real racetracks. Is it worth it to dish out the extra 15 bucks for the DLC packs? No, unless you "GOTTA HAVE IT NOW NOW NOW", they only add extra cars and tracks. But I will say that this game is pretty neat-o.\n\nGet this game for anyone that wants a break from COD or CS or TF2, and wants a nice, clean, racing game.\n\n[I would just note, try to get it on sale unless you wanna dish our $50+]","September 5, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There needs to be more of an interaction with this game where you can do more. Also, when you join a team in career mode, it asks you to input your name. But the driver's names that you replace in career mode (Alonso, Vettel, etc etc.) stay on your driver's jumpsuit and on the car. Kinda cheap, when something like that could easily be implemented.

I did like it back then and I have to admit still like it today. The 2001 version was a little dull with regards to driving. I could always floor the car out and I don't remember that it ever spun out. with the 2013 release, this has changed and a lot more driving skills are asked for. Although, I have driven only in "NOVICE" mode, I can tell even with driving assist, it does feel much more realistic than back in 2001, go figure. Technologies have changed and the PC's have become more powerful. I have it running on a AMD Quad Core with an Radion HD7950 and can't complain a bit about the Graphics etc. Absolutely fantastic. The game itself seems to very stable and I have yet to crash it, if I can. The game sequence is as realistic as it can be, at this time I guess. The only thing thhat I am missing is, I guess it will never be possible with simulator, is the contact to the track. On the other hand if I want this, I might as well go on the track with a real car, if I had the money, ha, ha. I like the narrow and tight corners of Monaco the best, one can almost feel the heart pounding, although I am old enough to never forget that it is a simullator.\nConcluding, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone that loves to race around a track and doesn't have the mula for the real thing.\nGreat experience and wonderful job done by the makers!","September 11, 2014","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't feel you need to use the classic car and track pack then F1 2012 will suit you just fine. I, however, really enjoy the midsession save and it is the main plus for me.

Destroying your tyres early doesn't mean the end, with a couple of pitstops to go. Getting new tyres and handling fuel mixture to climb the ladder of positions on a multy stop GP is absolutely breathtaking and precisely what it should be. Little mistakes means a lot on high difficulties, strategies have their heavyweigh just like the real thing.\n\nSome bugs might occour, some animations clearly seems really unpolished, but the atmosphere is there, the competition against a decent AI seems to get this Grand Prix 3 and 4 player through where he has been on those classic games and enjoyed every second. You cannot ask for a Grand Prix Legends or Nascar 2003 level of realism on handling and traction, even damage (with mods you can), but this codemaster's franchise is the finest recreation of Formula one the market has ever seen.\n\nCarreer is amazing, minigames such scenario is not really my thing, as being invested in carreer already gives you a lot of scenarios and challenges to overcome after those precious points.\n\nPros: Atmosphere,  Easy to Advanced handling from simers to casuals, Great Graphics, Performance is great, Decent AI (not perfect), Amazing out of the box value, Tons of potential hours, Can be taken as a simulator.\n\nCons: Ocasional rules glitches, some laped AI can be a pain or even get you out of the race, car setups are too gamey with abstract values and not real measures (ie: Angle of wings are displayed in 0 to 11 and not in degrees), some tracks are a little off from the real life with wrong turn banking and elevations missing/present (reference of great track mapping/coding: Grand Prix series)\n\nAbout F1 2013 in especial: worth every penny if you're offline racer (didn't tested multiplayer but it is functional)\n\nWill buy 2014.

The AI is very competitive especially as you progress. If your someone like me that doesnt know really about F1, and likes racing games and thinks it looks real fun you are in for a wake up call. The game has some confusing mechanics at first until you learn the game more and progress like i said. Before you jump into your carreer you have to go through a "young drivers test" Its basically where the game teaches you the basic controls. After a few tests you do some harder tests. Some of them can be quite diffucult for a gamer who doesnt wanna spend 2 hours trying to do one thing that doesnt even apply to your main carreer. You have to pass all of the tests to move on and if you arent able to hit every apex of the corners, meet a certain time, or dont follow the race line as good as the game wants you to you'll find yourself frusterated and wanting to quit. I HIGHLY suggest using a controller while playing this game as it makes it quite easier. After you hopefully pass the young drivers test after the endless tests it seems to give you the game can be a good experince and fun. The graphics are great, and the engine sounds are amazing. In my opinion the game is not worth what they are asking for it. I got it off the steam sale for a discount around 20 dollars, so for 20 its worth it but not 50.

New aspect of challenges adds something new to this great game. I recommend this for any F1 fans, the new ones and old, especially considering the new Legends mode, this is great for all old fans to play around with.\n\nThe only reason I won't give this game a 9 or 10 is because the career mode still seems to be lacking, only 5 seasons, no real interactivity with the player other than the racing and still no game changing aspects such as a GP2/GP3 series ( I know this isn't possible due to copyright, but made change it to Codemaster series 2) to give career mode something more than just, young driver test and then F1.

So start with people I do recommend this game to and to whom I do not.\n\nI don't recommend this game to people, who:\n- are seeking for a real driving simulator (like iRacing, rFactor, GPL etc.)\n- or even expect a game like Gran Turismo or Forza\n- played F1 Challenge 99-02 or the GP Series and seek for an appropriate successor\n\nI recommend this game to people who:\n- like beginner friendly racing games but also like challenges on arcade (not sim) level\n- like to play a F1 game (maybe due to lack of alternatives, too) and doesn't care about driving physics\n- had fun with titles like F1 World Grand Prix on the N64 or those Formula 1 games by Sony on the PS2 back then\n- have any predecessor from Codemasters\n\nIf one of the "recommended points" suits to you, carry on with reading. Otherwise you should definitely NOT buy this game, believe me! You will get disappointed.\n\n(for negative points scroll to the next to last passage)\n\nF1 2013 does almost everything better than F1 2012. Handling was improved so was the sound effects (a lot!), little improvements on the graphics and a huge improvement on AI (more retirements, yellow flags and safety cars), less ridiculous penalties for you due AI's fault. Unfinished and unpolished game modes like time attack or the unloving "scenario" mode from 2012 were improved and are now really enjoyable. And the Grand Prix mode ist back that was removed in 2012 for no reason (they were probably high as they designed F1 2012) They also added classic content. But you should see it literally as "content". Do NOT expect a full grid of any year between 1980 and 2000 or full season like the 1967's in the simulation Grand Prix Legends (to be fair, that specific one wasn't correct either, in GPL you drive in France, Rouen, whereas the real GP was held at the Bugatti Circuit, some drivers and engine were also incorrect). You have a small but cool selection of historical cars and legendary driver one can choose and you race in a roughly 11 cars grid. And, if you play in english, you'll hear Murray Walker. (how awesome is that?) A very cool detail is that the track does really "rubber in" and gets faster. Mentioned by your race engineer in previous title it wasn't implemented (or too subtle), now you really see the difference on track and in lap times.\n\nSo F1 2013 brings you really close to the whole Formula 1 circus but there is also room for improvement and bad design decisions are still present. 2013 lacks on options those were available in F1 2011, e.g. the race distance. 2011 offered you race distances with 3 laps, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (available in Grand Prix AND carreer!). Now you have these but missing the 75% in Grand Prix mode and even less in carreer mode (25% is the shortest, you have little time but want the full race calendar and not that half hearted season challenge? Bad for you!). The safety car is only available from the third difficulty level (hard). If you not that good or just don't want to be challenged you won't see the safety car. Those are some minor design decisions which makes me scratch my head. But the POOREST decision was to take out Practice 1 and 2. You even have the two tyres for those days on your practice run but they're greyed out. I never understand their logic: Most people didn't run them, so we removed P1 & P2. So what? People could ALWAYS have skipped those practice sessons. And leaving options in there is not a big deal as adding and developing new features for a small amount of people. Very poor Codemasters.\n\nBut still F1 2013 is a very fun game as long as you stay on track and don't think about what it could have been. CM could learn a lot from Sony (F1 Championship Edition on PS3, anyone? With formation lap, podium sequences and proper car damage). I hope they will for the next title but until that you will have still a lot of fun with this title.","December 26, 2013","true","96.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of the game will seem very similar to F1 2012, but much improved. The AI-controlled cars definitely got a good update, they make better decisions overall and it feels more like you're racing them rather than just trying to avoid them. As a racing wheel user (g27), I personally feel like they've definitely done good things this time around with tyre wear and grip levels. It seems much more realistic and not so prone to wheel spin every time you get on the throttle.  If you enjoyed F1 2012, or are a big fan of Formula 1 looking to get a good simulation game, this is the one for you. I've owned F1 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, and I would definitely say that F1 2013 is the best of the series, by far.","December 26, 2013","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not many major changes other than the handling system has been tweaked to provide more of a challenge. Vehicle and enviroment details are gorgeous to look at, wet weather effects are also a sight to behold. The additions of Classic content provides players with cars and tracks from the 80's and 90's. With voicing from Murry Walker. ( You have to buy extra content as a dlc, the base game comes with a limited amount. ) The addition of mid race saves encourages people to race the full 100% race distance, a great feature. I'd only reccomend this game to true F1 fans ( like me :P ) since it's a more under the bonnet tweaked version of 2012.","October 11, 2013","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game involves tight turns and narrow lanes, it is easy to start and fun. Graphics are supreeme and smooth, the cars and people are bassed on real people and time eras etc(the track pack and 1980s cars). It is a game for people who have alot of time for things like grand prix, in witch you may race up to 40 minutes in a single game, or test day witch also takes up time too. If you have a gamepad for your pc use it!!!!!! this game is not friendly to keybords and i can only use my left hand to play so my right hand is useless in this game unless i want to shift down in witch i just set it to auto-shift. I like the game and have been a big fan of it on console, butt if your the same and think its going to be a breeze, just leave. This game will take a liitle time to get ok at the ai's are smart and will overtake you at every chance, the controlls are weird for people like me who only use awsd cause it uses for example on the mac the arrow buttons. So in conclusion this is a game for people with time and gamepads and to understand how the cars work and how to tune them, it will push the limits and challenge the best racers.

The hardware advantage of owning a PC should give developers more tools to work with to make the PC version the standout. Everything from the consoles is here in the PC version of F1 2013. It's also got DX11 advantages but thats not enough. Wheel and pedalset options are limited and the feeling with them is not very good. It was a game designed for controllers and therefore puts wheel/pedal drivers in the back seat most of the time. The visuals are brilliant and the tracks look alive but I can't adjust the FOV and am stuck in an uncomfortable cockpit position. You feel too far back in the cockpit view and because of this with a wheel there is a disorienting feeling seeing the onscreen wheel move out of sync with your own wheel. Once again a game designed around controllers where the visualization of the wheel would be prefable.\n\nOther than that really the game is designed very well and if your an F1 fan you should own a copy.

I knew I needed an upgrade.  I first tested the game on a free weekend steam was having, leting anybody play f1 2013 for free for the weekend.  After playing it for the weekend, I like it so much more than my more than 7 year old f1 game that I bought it for the $9.99 sale steam was also having along with the free weekend.\n\nI like the new f1 2013 a lot, not only the new cars and tracks, but also excellent graphics aswell.  It has good steering wheel support aswell, from the top notch wheels to a gamepad.\n\nEven though I'm already an experienced f1 sim driver, i did do the  f1 young drivers test, which actually helped me a lot since there were new things to learn from drs and kers to lots of other things that f1 from 10 years ago didn't have.\n\nHowever, if I could rate it, I would only rate this three stars.  Because it has so many issues, enough issues that I think it is ridiculous to sell this game for 50$.  Here are a couple of problems, one huge one is that your f1 game file can get corrupted real easily, meaning that if you do career mode, that will all get deleted because the file got corrupted (I had this happen to me THREE TIMES in TWO WEEKS at one point).  Another is the absolutely terrible online gaming, first off, it's peep to peer networking, meaning that there will be a ton more lag than a dedicated server.  Even worse, this brings peeps the ability to use cheats in online, since there are no dedicated servers with anti-cheat systems.\n\nAnyways, I would still recommend this game because it is the best f1 game you will find on the market.","May 4, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing F1 games since pole position on the atari 2600 (1982!) and this is without doubt the best incarnation yet IMO. Surpasses recent 2010, 11 and 12 too.\n\nThe noticeable differences are the brilliant AI. It's spot on. Penalties for going off road or cutting corners are much more fair and won't penalize you for going wide, which was a past frustration with earlier versions. Menus are not too frustrating and it's not millions of button clicks before you can play the game.\n\nI must admit though what clinched it for me is the addition of the classic F1 cars. The 80's cars are so much fun to drive! They seem really authentic and in the sense of sounds and handling, correcting the car and slides on nearly every corner like a real 80's F1 car. Very satisfying drive. The 90's cars are also cool especially with the addition of the FW18. The sound from the car gave me the shivers instantly when it wailed. it sounds so authentic and took me back to 1996 in a flash and of course... it's just beautiful to drive.\n\nOnline multiplayer I've not tried yet, as that doesn't really interest me.\n\nCodemasters needs to add more classic tracks and 70's F1 cars too !!!!\n\n\n","March 22, 2014","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I own GTR2,Assetto Corsa,Dirt 3, Race 07 series, GSC2013, RBR and I would have to say that this is the most unfun driving game I have bought off steam, even at 16.00 dollars for the Classic edition. THe graphics are nice and I thought maybe this would be a fun, cheap online unrealistic game racing game, but unfortunately, nobody is playing and the physics are just so unintuitive, that I don't even enjoy driving any of the vehicles. When going around corners, you stick like glue and the forcefeedback on a g27 just doesn't feel right. Dirt 3 is unrealistic but fun and GTR2 is old, but with mods drives incredible. I uninstalled it in under a hour so don't waste your money unless you have to have the latest F1 game and like driving on rails.\nI wanted to add, if you want a IMHO realistic F1 experience that includes kart racing,Brazilian Stock Car, Mini and Camaro just for starters, immediately buy, GSC2013. It also has great MODS like, Porsche, BMW, Lexus, GT and DTM with a lot of downloadable tracks. Assetto Corsa also has a wide variety of realistic cars and with mods and will be online at the end of March. GTR2 and Race 07 with mods are also good, but I prefer GTR2 for the handling. Or for off road, go Richard Burns Rally. I think my preferences right now , until Assetto Corsa is complete are, GSC2013, Assetto Crosa, RBR, GTR2 and then RACE07 with all packs.

I knew I needed an upgrade.  I first tested the game on a free weekend steam was having, leting anybody play f1 2013 for free for the weekend.  After playing it for the weekend, I like it so much more than my more than 7 year old f1 game that I bought it for the $9.99 sale steam was also having along with the free weekend.\n\nI like the new f1 2013 a lot, not only the new cars and tracks, but also excellent graphics aswell.  It has good steering wheel support aswell, from the top notch wheels to a gamepad.\n\nEven though I'm already an experienced f1 sim driver, i did do the  f1 young drivers test, which actually helped me a lot since there were new things to learn from drs and kers to lots of other things that f1 from 10 years ago didn't have.\n\nHowever, if I could rate it, I would only rate this three stars.  Because it has so many issues, enough issues that I think it is ridiculous to sell this game for 50$.  Here are a couple of problems, one huge one is that your f1 game file can get corrupted real easily, meaning that if you do career mode, that will all get deleted because the file got corrupted (I had this happen to me THREE TIMES in TWO WEEKS at one point).  Another is the absolutely terrible online gaming, first off, it's peep to peer networking, meaning that there will be a ton more lag than a dedicated server.  Even worse, this brings peeps the ability to use cheats in online, since there are no dedicated servers with anti-cheat systems.\n\nAnyways, I would still recommend this game because it is the best f1 game you will find on the market.","May 4, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing F1 games since pole position on the atari 2600 (1982!) and this is without doubt the best incarnation yet IMO. Surpasses recent 2010, 11 and 12 too.\n\nThe noticeable differences are the brilliant AI. It's spot on. Penalties for going off road or cutting corners are much more fair and won't penalize you for going wide, which was a past frustration with earlier versions. Menus are not too frustrating and it's not millions of button clicks before you can play the game.\n\nI must admit though what clinched it for me is the addition of the classic F1 cars. The 80's cars are so much fun to drive! They seem really authentic and in the sense of sounds and handling, correcting the car and slides on nearly every corner like a real 80's F1 car. Very satisfying drive. The 90's cars are also cool especially with the addition of the FW18. The sound from the car gave me the shivers instantly when it wailed. it sounds so authentic and took me back to 1996 in a flash and of course... it's just beautiful to drive.\n\nOnline multiplayer I've not tried yet, as that doesn't really interest me.\n\nCodemasters needs to add more classic tracks and 70's F1 cars too !!!!\n\n\n","March 22, 2014","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is great and can be very challenging, however there are features that have been left out that were present in preious versions of the game. The loss of controll over the car as it enters the pits is dissapointing and doesnt add to the true "simulation" of driving a real F1 car.

That being said, however, remember that this is not completely a sim racer.\n\nThere is tire degradation, and every lap becomes harder and harder to keep it going, requiring you to brake earlier and be more careful on the throttle. Tire temperature also plays a role, and you can tell when they're at the optimum place or they're getting too cool.\n\nThere is some fuel management, though it's rather simplified. You will feel the effects of fuel throughout the race (you become lighter, thus faster, but your tires degrade also so you have to manage that.) There's 3 settings of fuel management that basically mean you save fuel, use what you planned, or use more. There's a setting on your info panel to see how you're doing in this respect and it's fairly simple: no matter how you're driving, if you do it in the average setting you will always be "on-target" for your race.\n\nPrevious to a race you can modify a lot of settings to try to find the right balance for your car, or you can use an easy quick setup (don't) to sidestep this.\n\nThe AI is usually good, though I've had quite a few situations in qualifying where it should let me through (I'm on a flying lap and they're coming out of the pits, for example) and they just won't.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that requires you dedicate yourself to it to learn everything there is about your car (did I mention that it's completely different to drive a Force India than a Red Bull?) and the tracks that are included. The sprint 3 laps races don't do this game justice, you need to do the 25%, 50% races, or even go full throttle and do a 100% race.\n\nGive it a shot, drive around in time trials for a couple of days before going into the career mode, and get used to one of the most amazing events there are.","June 25, 2014","true","76.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I knew I needed an upgrade.  I first tested the game on a free weekend steam was having, leting anybody play f1 2013 for free for the weekend.  After playing it for the weekend, I like it so much more than my more than 7 year old f1 game that I bought it for the $9.99 sale steam was also having along with the free weekend.\n\nI like the new f1 2013 a lot, not only the new cars and tracks, but also excellent graphics aswell.  It has good steering wheel support aswell, from the top notch wheels to a gamepad.\n\nEven though I'm already an experienced f1 sim driver, i did do the  f1 young drivers test, which actually helped me a lot since there were new things to learn from drs and kers to lots of other things that f1 from 10 years ago didn't have.\n\nHowever, if I could rate it, I would only rate this three stars.  Because it has so many issues, enough issues that I think it is ridiculous to sell this game for 50$.  Here are a couple of problems, one huge one is that your f1 game file can get corrupted real easily, meaning that if you do career mode, that will all get deleted because the file got corrupted (I had this happen to me THREE TIMES in TWO WEEKS at one point).  Another is the absolutely terrible online gaming, first off, it's peep to peer networking, meaning that there will be a ton more lag than a dedicated server.  Even worse, this brings peeps the ability to use cheats in online, since there are no dedicated servers with anti-cheat systems.\n\nAnyways, I would still recommend this game because it is the best f1 game you will find on the market.","May 4, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI is very competitive especially as you progress. If your someone like me that doesnt know really about F1, and likes racing games and thinks it looks real fun you are in for a wake up call. The game has some confusing mechanics at first until you learn the game more and progress like i said. Before you jump into your carreer you have to go through a "young drivers test" Its basically where the game teaches you the basic controls. After a few tests you do some harder tests. Some of them can be quite diffucult for a gamer who doesnt wanna spend 2 hours trying to do one thing that doesnt even apply to your main carreer. You have to pass all of the tests to move on and if you arent able to hit every apex of the corners, meet a certain time, or dont follow the race line as good as the game wants you to you'll find yourself frusterated and wanting to quit. I HIGHLY suggest using a controller while playing this game as it makes it quite easier. After you hopefully pass the young drivers test after the endless tests it seems to give you the game can be a good experince and fun. The graphics are great, and the engine sounds are amazing. In my opinion the game is not worth what they are asking for it. I got it off the steam sale for a discount around 20 dollars, so for 20 its worth it but not 50. Still i recommend it.","January 7, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a person who likes their F1, or are just a fan of racing games or racing in general, I highly reccomend this game. It teaches you a lot about how to race, and can be quite exiting at times. It relies on your ability as a driver to make an exiting race, and with many AI difficulties, there will always be an exiting grand prix for you to play. As for the multiplayer, when you find a game, its great fun, but that happens very rarely these days. If you are a fan of multiplayer racing, give league racing a try. Overall, definaltely give it 8.5/10, and I would reccomend this to anyone who loves their racing. The classic content is also amazing. This allows you to recreate moments in history, like brands hatch in classic cars, or you can even mix it up, maybe playing classic cars in Abu Dhabi, or the infamous 'Brands Hatch in Under 1 Minute' challenge, in which you race a modern car around the classic brands hatch, in the hopes of grasping the less than 1 minute time. with classic content i give this game a 9/10","May 16, 2014","true","64.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hardware advantage of owning a PC should give developers more tools to work with to make the PC version the standout. Everything from the consoles is here in the PC version of F1 2013. It's also got DX11 advantages but thats not enough. Wheel and pedalset options are limited and the feeling with them is not very good. It was a game designed for controllers and therefore puts wheel/pedal drivers in the back seat most of the time. The visuals are brilliant and the tracks look alive but I can't adjust the FOV and am stuck in an uncomfortable cockpit position. You feel too far back in the cockpit view and because of this with a wheel there is a disorienting feeling seeing the onscreen wheel move out of sync with your own wheel. Once again a game designed around controllers where the visualization of the wheel would be prefable.\n\nOther than that really the game is designed very well and if your an F1 fan you should own a copy.

I would highly suggest getting yourself a steering wheel if you want to enjoy the game properly. The game can offer challenging races and without assists and higher difficulty, it certainly offers fun and action. The game is not easy. Even on Amature during the first year I struggled to win many races. I would suggest checking out other sites for cheaper prices, given that F1 2014 should come out fairly soon (I believe at the end of the season) It will probably be on a discount later on steam...\n\nYou can read my full review on hubpages ;) <3\nhttp://dominikh.hubpages.com/hub/Game-Review-F1-2013","April 21, 2014","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would of been a great game if the cars didn't under/over steer no matter what the car setup. Like the pit setup with being able to watch a video of the course. I played it on easy because that's where you see the most faults, but turned out to be wrong. However the racing on easy I should be finishing in first (well in theory) but finished in the middle of the pack. Is it a game to buy? Yes! Give the makers credit for the effort from the last F1 because it's a huge improvement.","March 19, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ilike that way you start from the pit and how one of the mechanics gives you the thums up sign then engin start. On the track the details are very impressive, i started to look at the grand stands to see if there was any people there. The carackteristics of the F1 car and how it behaves on the track i like, you can see that some one has put in a lot of time and effort to get the phisics and the technical side write with the car and how it drives on the race track. Over all it look like a good game witch will keep avide F1 fanes glued and inthrouled for weeks if not months. The price is a bit steep (Clasic Edition), i  did only have the in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tion part of the game so i can not give any negative points to it or its over all game play. But even though the price for some parts are a bit high i would buy it.","March 20, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would seem anytime you do anything but drive in circles you get disqualified and the race ends. this option cannot be turned off and I completely regret buying this game. I personally wouldn't play it if it were free. But if you want to race seriously I'm sure this would probably be a great game.","March 20, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are beautiful on max, especially in wet conditions. Driving is an improvement on the general formula of 2012, and considering the lack of rule changes between these years it makes sense. AI is quite good, not too aggressive but very challenging at high difficulties. Wet weather racing without traction control is a lot more rewarding than in 2012. All around, greatly improved game. 9/10.","March 24, 2014","true","90.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
