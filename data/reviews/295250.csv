You walk around and interact with what you can, which means finding 3 or so temples before entering a final room where.. the game ends? The credits rolled and the game closed. So yes, my first playthrough confused me, but then as I started it up a second time, I noticed things were different.\n\nI could play through a second time with the NPC's being in different locations doing different things, but besides that, the level layout was exactly the same and it just meant me walking from tile to tile to go to all the temples again, which took way longer than necessary due to the extremely slow and awkward movement.\n\nI get the feeling the message is the strong point here, seeing as the aesthetic and music is simple, the dialogue is non-existent and the gameplay is.. well.. a walking simulator. I just don't get it. Something must have whooshed, but I don't see the appeal behind this at all.","May 20, 2014","false","2.5"," 307 of 350 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","307","350","0","5"

This reminded me of 'em and so I got it on the cheap since I've also got Proteus and Waking Mars.\n\nThis is more like Proteus than Waking Mars; it's about wandering, having no real point or distinct rhyme or reason. Everything is presented without explanation; you're stranded on a planet with no background and get to walk (slowly) through alien vistas to visit robotic temples without explanation. The artwork is nice, yes, as is the music, but none of it is groundbreaking, /especially/ if you're over a certain age and remember EGA and VGA adventure games of the late 1980s and early 1990s at all.\n\nThe problem here isn't so much the lack of explanation. This is definitely aiming towards minimalist 'art' and encouraging user interpretation (though I once had an argument with a collage artist that, since art is a form of communication, /something/ must be intended by all artistic design choices--if the artist completely abrogates the work of interpretation to the observer, then the artist is not communicating and could be doing absolutely /anything/).\n\nThe problem is the pacing.\n\nThis is quite possibly intentional.\n\nYour little astronaut walks slowly. All the screens have to be backtracked. In one playthrough, there just isn't that much to see. In my playthrough, I wandered through all the available screens three times over to be rewarded with... well... let's just say a game over that had as little explanation as anything else, though in hindsight it was a good game over since it illuminated just a little bit more of the world the developers created.\n\nAre there different endings? I don't know, and that's where the problem comes in. The manual encourages leaving the game alone and waiting for things to happen; something about how actions are static but the world is dynamic or something. That's fine, but even then the amount of time it takes for your character to walk from one side of the screen to the other is an investment that doesn't have much payoff. Is there any guarantee that if you leave it running for an hour and then come back and wait the one or two minutes it takes to change screens that you'll get something different? No.\n\nI don't want to sound like an anti-art game philistine, so I have to compare this to other works. Proteus, which is equivalently aimless, rewards running around and backtracking by being immediately interactive. Starseed Pilgrim encourages exploration by hiding the backstory in rhyme. The Swapper gives you new things to look at, backstory, and moral dilemma without relying on kinetics or speed. The Endless Forest at the very least interacts with you, and its artistic bent is /anti-kinetic/. The Graveyard had you moving very slowly, but every step added to the story (and it didn't suggest that there was replay value in an attempt to become a time sink).\n\nStranded offers none of these things, and certainly does nothing to suggest that it has more to it. It almost seems to be given away by the tagline: "Do you know what it is to die alone, and so far from home?"\n\nSeems like it is to shuffle around a bit and then, well, die alone in a godless universe and out of shake-n'-vac.","May 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 140 of 162 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","140","162","0","2"

Extremely so. The one hour of playtime I've clocked in? That's two playthroughs. My first one, with plenty of roaming about and exploration, took 45 minutes. The remaining 15 minutes was poking around trying to see if there were other endings.\n\nI'd like to recommend this game, I really would. The atmosphere and the visuals are wonderful, and remind me of the old LucasArts adventure game, The Dig. I would have loved to explore the world more, see if it had more to offer, but there's so little of it here.\n\nThat said, I do not regret the time spent on the game. If you enjoy the sort of visuals that Dig might have to offer and find this one at a steep discount, it's worth at least a quick look, provided you don't come without much in the way of expectations.

I believe the point was to make your character feel small and the environment vast, but instead it leaves you feeling frustrated.\n\nThe game clearly wants to be art, and there is a mildly interesting twist to the end, but ultimately I feel the game didn't work as well as was intended. Firstly, the game would only launch in windowed mode for me (there could be a fix for this, I didn't take the time to look), which I felt this dimished the 'art' aspect from the beginning. I'm not immersed in the game if I can see my recycle bin and windows start bar, personally, and I wanted to be enjoying the games art, not getting distracted by the windows UI.\n\nAlso, by being a 'point and click adventure', I went in with expectations that the game falls short on. Now, this is partly my fault for wanting puzzles and such (and they're certainly not required, I love games like Dear Esther, which have no puzzles), but also this game sets up the expectation of puzzles. One room you get to early on has a large rune on a giant orb that dominates the centre of the screen. You then reach a room with many runes marked on the floor, including this giant orb rune. I spent a good ten minutes trying to click on it, drag it, get my character to acknowledge it in some way, then went back to the orb room to see if I could interact there. Nothing. The game doesn't expect you to interact, other than to walk into all the rooms over the course of the game and return to your ship to sleep imbetween. But there's an implication of a puzzle there, and I found that exceptionally frustrating.\n\nAs for symbolism and content of the game, I initially thought there may be a religious aspect to the game, visiting temples and paying respects, the ending certainly could support or challenge that, but I'm not certain the game has any particular deep meaning other than the mild twist ending. Loneliness is certainly a clear theme, but I feel that some level of interaction or design could have communicated this better and deepend the impact, as it stands it feels like a game that doesn't let you do much, rather than a poignant exploration of isolation.\n\nThe music is well done, and does add a great degree of atmosphere, the art is beautiful and minimal, the sound effects add to the feeling of being trapped and lonely... unfortunately it just doesn't really come together as a complete package very well, and I was left wanting.","December 31, 2014","false","0.8"," 54 of 56 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","54","56","0","0"

It feels like I bought a music album instead of a game. But the game does NOT come with a soundtrack. The OST costs $6 when really it should be included.\n\nAs per the walking part, it's really annoying to have to wait till the animation is finished. But that's to be expected for a Ren'Py game.\n\nI really wish more things were done with this game. It's an amazing concept, very atmospheric. But there's nothing to do beyond walking. To call this Point & Click is far too accurate. You point, click, and you look. If you're looking for something with a similar atmosophere and more gameplay, check out The Swapper.\n\nI spent exactly 36 minutes playing this game and have exhuasted it of all content.

There doesn’t seem to be any dialogue involved at all. Everything you need to know is in the landscape.\n\nCons: There apparently is no menu. I couldn’t find one. No settings to change at all. You can resize the small window to take your whole screen, but the ‘maximize window’ button is greyed out. Where’s the logic in that?\nThe animation is very slow. You better like watching the little guy walk around, because he is taking his sweet, sweet time. And if you clicked somewhere to walk to, you have to wait until he’s done walking before you can click elsewhere.\nThere is a lot of excess clicking involved. There is at least 2 clicks required per screen. If you click the exit at the other side of the screen, your little hero is going to walk near there... then stops. Then you have to click again to actually exit the screen. Combine this with the aforementioned slow walking and it’ll be pretty yawn-worthy.\nThere are many useless filler screens. It is easy to imagine being stuck in a Walking Simulator 2015. Wish there was more to see or something to interact with.\nWhat the heck is going on? I still have no clue what the story-line is even on about. Nothing can be interacted with. All you do is visiting locations to ‘trigger’ events of some sort. Events that until now still remain a mystery to me.\nIt is extremely short. The game lasts for around a half an hour. The only reason why it even lasted this long is because of the slow walking, otherwise it might not have lasted 10 minutes.\nZero replay value. If you finish the game, that’s probably it. No reason to put yourself through this excruciatingly slow experience again. Did I mention yet that the game is slow?\nPros: The landscapes are pretty. If it would have been a real adventure game a la Space Quest, it would have been extremely nifty. Graphics-wise this game’s beautiful if you don’t mind the pixel art. The animations add that something little extra.\nConclusion:If you were hoping for an adventure game you will be sorely disappointed. It is more like a walking simulator with frustratingly slow animation and needless clicking. “Visit those locations to trigger things that you don’t know about and then watch the ending that is abrupt” would have been a more apt description. The idea was nice, the execution not so.\n\nFor 7 euro this game is sorely lacking and way too short. If you can manage to get it somewhere for below one buck, it might maybe be worth a try. Otherwise I’d say: Save your money.","February 5, 2015","false","0.9"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","49","55","5","0"

Each time, however, the only thing this game left me with, was one wish: the wish somebody would turn this piece of software into a real *GAME*, into a point & click adventure. I absolutely ADORE the gorgeous pixel art, the animation and the atmosphere. It reminds me of some mystical places you could visit on Mars in "Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders" or on the planet Cocytus in "The Dig".\n\nHowever, this is NOT a point & click adventure in the classical sense, even though it might look the part!\n\nIt is merely a game in which you go from one screen to the next – and not in a fluid motion either; the protagonist can stand in up to 6 places in each screen and you really have to wait a lot until he/she actually moves – and try to interact with something. I write "try to interact" because it really is that! Most of the time, your clicking doesn't achieve anything. There are so many interesting objects and characters(?) on screen but there's just nothing you can do with them.\n\nAll in all, more than anything else, Stranded feels like some sort of experiment.\n\nWhich is a shame.

The setting is incredibly mysterious, and you're thrown into an unknown world with little to no explanations. As you leave your marooned ship you'll slowly discover the secrets of your surrounding, and watch them change as the days and nights pass by. This feels more akin to an art project than a video game, and I love it.\n\nThe game itself is very slow paced, which feels necessary for the story being told and the tense atmosphere being created as you travel further away from your base. This deliberate pacing only serves the creeping feeling of lostness and wonder, allowing you to take in your surroundings and focus on the sound of every breath you take.\n\nThe soundtrack is a masterpiece and serves as much more than your standard background music as it evolves with every action you take, building up and changing as you visit different temples or advance between night and day. The dynamic soundtrack reminded me of Proteus, and is my favorite aspect of these games.\n\nIn the end Stranded is a short but sweet experience that most people looking for a "gaming" session will be disappointed with, but those of you with a serious appreciation for lovingly detailed art, sound design, and storytelling will find a very memorable experience that is more than your money's worth.","May 21, 2014","true","1.5"," 114 of 176 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","114","176","0","5"

I had read a preview on RPS, which was quite great, quoting nostalgia, Lucas Arts and The Dig. But The Dig was a much longer experiment. And it had story. And it had gameplay. And it even had humour.\nThere, as you wander in the deserted landscapes of Stranded, you have none. No story, no riddles, no gameplay, no humour. Just an excrucciating pain in the butt when the end is triggered.\n7$? Really?\nI was intrigued, so I sent an e-mail to the creator. I wanted to share with him my disappointment and try to have his side of the story.\nHe didn't accept any of my arguments (and I tried quoting others sci-fi point&click adventures), discarding them with a poor "I'm sorry you didn't like [...] This was exactly the game I wanted to create, and was highly experimental (as you'll find detailed in the game's Steam description, if you care to read it)". But I read the steam description, and it was never written nor said it was a 30mn experimental software.\nI tried understanding the 7$ price setting, again using comparison with other one-man-job-game (Antichamber is a good example I used, has Alexander Bruce charged for his game 150$ because he spent 7 years making it? No, it was around 15$, and they're the best 15$ I ever spent in a videogame). Stranded creator's answer was "I can charge whatever I like for [my work]".\nHe seems to be in a Proteus allegiance, but doesn't seem to notice how Proteus is a far wider experiment to try. Proteus has a lot more variations in its landscapes, far more tricks to make the player explore its changing island(s). If Proteus was in 2D, it would have proposed more than 10 martian-like backgrounds.\nThere's no point trying to compare Walking Mars, Proteus or The Dig to Stranded. Stranded is merely a 30mn game demo which aspires to big as big as his iconic elder but without doing the work needed to.\nPeter Moorhead (Stranded creator) wrote me "No one made you buy the game, and no one tried to pretend it was something it isn't." This sentence definitely showed me there wasn't any dialog available, and with this kind of answers, I feel definitely robbed, scammed, almost abused.

You want to cross this empty room (of which there are several and backtracking is absolutely required)? Then you wait for your "walk onscreen: animation to finish, click the other side of the room, wait for your "walk across the screen" animation to finish, then click AGAIN to play your "walk offscreen" animation.\n\nThere is literally no interaction with anything beyond going to sleep and walking through doors. It LOOKS like there's a puzzle involving symbols in ancient temples and a floor covered in similar symbols, but in fact it's not a puzzle at all, merely dressed like one.\n\nSave your seven bucks and buy yourself a coffee. It'll be more entertaining and last longer too.","May 20, 2014","false","0.7"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

Drawn in a early 90's VGA style you play a stranded astronaut on an alien planet. This game is about exploration and the only thing you have are your legs. Walking will slowly unfold a story, so the game can be ended which will take you within the hour. For a game this is really short. But because it is niche it could deliver you a good experience in that amount of time. Unfortunately it does not.\n\nYou walk around, and walk around, and walk around and almost nothing happens. So in the end you get bored and run through the 20 or so screens to get to the end. In my opinion the game tries to give you an experience, but it is a really empty one. Perhaps this is intentional, but in the end it just annoyed me.\n\nWhat really stands out though is the music and sound design. This is just great. The soundtrack consists of around 6 or 7 ambient tracks that are really strong soundscapes and towards the end some really good sound effects are mixed in that add to the atmosphere. Kudo's for that! But it doesn't save the game.","July 22, 2014","false","1.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Even as a new release $8 is way to much for the experience offered, even $2 would be pushing it. Theres about 3 minutes of actual gameplay and the rest is just mindless wandering using a terribly clunky interface. As it stands you would be better off taking your money and spending $5 on "The Dig" by Lucas arts. Hours of gameplay, just as visually and audably pleasing and a much deeper more moving story. As for Stranded if you want to try it wait until it's in a humble bundle or something.\n\nSee I want to appriciate this game for what it is... But I can't shake the feeling that "what it is" is someone with higher aspirations deciding it was too much work and just cropping it and selling it as is to make money off the time they already invested. The art is great and the soundtrack is nice but that's all it has going for it... And for context if you look at the screenshots and gameplay video above you've seen about 70% of the art and nearly all of the soundtrack. The map consist of about 15 scenes, there is no interaction with any of them... All you can do is walk between them which is a painful experience as the controls are frequently unresponsive and for someone looking for a way to surivive before time runs out your character strolls a long like they have all the time in the world.\n\nTo their credit the scenes aren't static. NPC's wander around, theres a day/night cycle of sorts (relevent to the progression of the shallow plot... Yes even ignoring the slow walking the uninteractive game length is unnecassirly padded out by having to backtrack to your pod and trigger night fall several times). There are also a few events to witness which sum up as watching an NPC do something when you enter a scene at certain times of day/night progression (you can't interact with them)... That's all there is to the game. Wander about painfully slowly. See all the locations. Leave the game running to see if anything different happens (it doesn't really). Slowly wander around to all the locations again to see what events you can spot... Rince and repeat until the third day at which point the credits will roll and the game is over.\n\nI just want to clarify, I do in fact get it. I see what the game is trying to convey... Is it art? Arguably. See what defines a succesful art piece is if it succesfully conveys what the artist is trying to communicate. For example some artist do ironic intentionally garbage peices with intent of conveying that the piece of art they have created is a piece of crap. If I look at that art piece and say to myself "that's a piece of crap garbage" it's a succesful art piece. That's not necassarily a worthy accomplishment in and of itself though.\n\nSee theres a few things this game tries to convey in sort of a sureal fashion. A sense of isolation, desperation (it fails on a couple of levels there) and questioning of value of life/survival. Now that sounds interesting in theory and the presentation they've come up with for it looks and sounds pretty but overall it falls flat as there is no depth to it. They've deliberately stretched out the pacing of the game to attempt to add value to it and all they've done is make it boring and pointless.\n\nThere's no deeper insight to be gained by standing around or slowly trudging between the same backdrops you've seen multiple times already. They tout exploration is what's on offer but theres nothing to really explore. It's a short liniar experience and like I said at the begining, everything there is to see and experience you could do so in 3 minutes without the padding... And what is conveyed in those 3 minutes isn't worth a $2 compared to other deeper more compelling titles in same genre and setting which are actually cheaper then this cash grab...\n\nWhich sadly seems to be the only way to look at this release. They say it's a love letter... But it's not even really a post card. It's a hallmark card they didn't even bother to write a personal message in. I say it's sad because you can kind of see where they wanted to go with it. Theres a solid idea there but it looks like they made the concious decision to not actually flesh it out or even do any quality assurance work on it to make it a smooth play experience (theres not screen size options, controls are clunky, no save feature which admitadly it shouldn't need but given the amount of standing around and waiting you need to do it kind of does). It's sort of the equivelent of a film student making a 5 minute experimental film and selling it on DVD for $30 a pop on the premise that it's indie art and that somehow justifies it. Which saddens me because it devalues other artisitic works of merit in it's medium.\n\nNow in fareness making videogames is hard work. Can be expensive work too. If you are not willing to commit to put in the hard yards that's fine but don't expect renumeration for it. Now to be clear I do like this game. It's nice, and without the padding it would be a pleasant and even interesting little aside. As it stands though I've played flash games the author has put more work into making a deeper more moving and certainly more compelling experience out of and they didn't see fit to charge me anything to share that expression of their creativity, they knew the market value for what they were offering didn't justify it. That is why I can't recomend this title. The scope of the game does not justify the price at all. Even as a donation to the artist $8 a pop is beyond generous. What makes writing this review difficult is I do want to encourage indie artist to make more games in this ilk... What I don't want to do is encourage this sort of blatant capitalism from them after they make a cursory token effort.","May 22, 2014","false","1.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

For a game that supposedly focuses on exploration there isn't much exploring to do. You start in a space ship, explore maybe 15 different screens (Most of them being duplicates with different colors) with NOTHING to click at all. You just walk from screen to screen. There is no discernable story at all, not one that makes sense at least.\n\nNot to mention the game is only 15-30minutes long. And it has NO replay value.\n\nI am generally a fan of small Indie Sci-Fi games and i absolutely adore point and click adventures, games like Machinarium, Deponia and Resonance are just some of the good ones. All great games and all of them bring unique twists to the Point and Click genre.\n\nStranded however seems in my oppinion to try to hard to be something it is not. They say "It is both a love letter to classic point & click adventures, and an experiment with the fundamentals of the genre." Sure i can believe it is a love letter, but i wouldn't call it an experiement with the genre. It is just a Point and Click stripped of everything that makes a Point and Click so good.\n\nIt's basically a point and click railroad experience where you in 20-30 minutes of boredom, are forced to repeat the exact same steps 3 times over and over with a character that walks SO slowly that you will mummify before the game is over.\n\nSo if you came here looking for a Sci-Fi experience, Point and Click or an Exploration game, even just a good game. Don't bother even touching it, you WILL be dissapointed to the point of just wishing you could get your money back.\n\nIf you absolutely want to spend $7 on something, you are better of going to your local supermarked and buying yourself the softest most expensive toilet paper available, at least that will give you some comfort and joy, and it will last longer than this game as well.","May 21, 2014","false","1.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Before I say what pisses me off the most, let me point out the other issues.\n\n>Terribly boring. In between the important areas, your character walks incredibly slowly through an empty screen. Why not add some small things like animals or something?\n\n>No variations of the normal "move" function. I came into this game expecting a Sierra-type experience. What I got was a monotonous series of mouse clicks. No smell option, no examine option, nothing.\n\n>Boring sounds. The music was nice, but the lack of actual sounds besides breathing is annoying. Why not a voice over? Why not have the sounds of wildlife? Nothing is there.\n\n>A stupid ending. It doesn't make you think about your actions, it doesn't leave you feeling satisfied after a hard boss fight, all it does is try to seem deep, when really it just feels forced.\n\nAnd here is the reason I hate it the most.\n\n>It's literally 20 minutes long.

Usually I would say "no, but..."\nNot this time.\n\nAside from some art that looks neat at first, but even that begins to get irritating when you're forced to look at it reppeatedly through repeated backtracking.\n\nNot only does the character walk VERY slowly, but you're forced to click your destination repeatedly to get them across the screen. This doesn't make sense. If there was something you could do differently at the various points, some sense of agency or reasoning to this break, it could be forgiven. But there's not. You just need to cross half a dozen screens, and it takes a minimum of 2 clicks each to do it. The walking would at least be tolerably if you didn't have to click, wait for the slow character to move to the EDGE of the screen... and then click again to walk that last 10% of the distance.\n\nThe storyline is so scant it's virtually nonexistant, and I wager while many would try to argue their interpretation of the events, the truth seems to be that either there's nothing going on here that isn't readily apparent (spoiler: not a lot going on), or -if there's more to it- you'll have to read what the author SAYS is the deeper story somewhere outside the game because the game doesn't do it.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying this, even on sale. And I'm a pretty forgiving player, even for shorter games (so long as the content I experienced was enjoyable). This just gets a right out...\n\n"Nope, don't buy it.

The setting is incredibly mysterious, and you're thrown into an unknown world with little to no explanations. As you leave your marooned ship you'll slowly discover the secrets of your surrounding, and watch them change as the days and nights pass by. This feels more akin to an art project than a video game, and I love it.\n\nThe game itself is very slow paced, which feels necessary for the story being told and the tense atmosphere being created as you travel further away from your base. This deliberate pacing only serves the creeping feeling of lostness and wonder, allowing you to take in your surroundings and focus on the sound of every breath you take.\n\nThe soundtrack is a masterpiece and serves as much more than your standard background music as it evolves with every action you take, building up and changing as you visit different temples or advance between night and day. The dynamic soundtrack reminded me of Proteus, and is my favorite aspect of these games.\n\nIn the end Stranded is a short but sweet experience that most people looking for a "gaming" session will be disappointed with, but those of you with a serious appreciation for lovingly detailed art, sound design, and storytelling will find a very memorable experience that is more than your money's worth.","April 10","true","9.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","9","11","6","0"

By definition, games are an interactive medium. Thing is, this game loses nothing if you just watch a no-commentary Youtube play-through. Being in the driver's seat changes nothing in my opinion. You click around for a while, then it ends with the player having had no substantive part in the game other than getting the character from beginning to end. The "game" part of the game is slow and egregious, using a point-to-point movement system that is dated even by early AGI point and click games. The reason I bring it up is that it is the first thing you are presented with is the painfully slow game-play and it drags so much that even if there was a promise of an interesting story (which, in my opinion, there isn't) I found it impossible to connect with the game in any way because the constant busy work of clicking around the world pulled me out the experience.\n\nThe sound design, art and music are all fantastic. Truly outstanding for a game of this caliber, but it doesn't remotely excuse what a hollow experience this game is overall. Also, an eight dollar price-tag for this game is downright criminal consider the quality of the overall experience. I have no problem with a game being short as long as it's good but this game is not. In the face of simplistic, arduous game-play, the game's last possible sell was being interesting and I just didn't find that was the case. Maybe the story, mystery, and/or adventure will make/have made this a positive experience for you but it just didn't happen for me. I don't even think an involving story can't emerge in as minimalistic of a game as this is however I just found that, in this instance, there was nothing here for me; which is a shame considering how good all of the aesthetic parts of the game are.","April 4, 2015","false","1.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You have to explore the area and discover anything that might help you survive. This is the description on the game page on Steam. Now I'm not to judge, there have been many a short minimalist game that have been well done. Music, characters, atmosphere that can illicit emotional response, these are the ideas that come to mind whenever I think of "minimalist".\n\nAt first glance Stranded looks promising. You eagerly leave your ship and enter the desolate outer space area searching for either other signs of live or at least something that might pique your fancy. At this point you're in the category of a hopeful explorer. As you search your unfamiliar surroundings you follow admire and wonder about the animated automatons if they might be the only inhabitants of your new home away from home. Sure they don't seem to be able to communicate but you're hopeful that there are intelligent beings of some kind if there's a bunch of stone machines walking around. Surely someone had to have made them. Even more so you soon find temples, which is great! Nothing screams LIFE more than finding places of worship. After you've exhausted your search the music fades and you head back to your ship because well there's nothing left to do.\n\nYou're then given the option to come back out at night. And why not, many places come alive when the sun goes down and this planet was no different. Not only does the terrain develop this luminous glow you've got an upbeat soundtrack to go with your renewed search effort. After you light up a bunch of temples you go back to your ship and wait for morning.... then do the same thing again.\n\nOkay, now I feel a bit suckered. Here I was thinking this game might have turned out to be a cross between Don't Starve and Waking Mars. Both decent games in their own right. But I spent about 30 minutes on this game only to come to quite a depressing end but all I felt was a twinge of resentment for getting my hopes up. Even more so when the game asks if I wanted to start over at the end only for me to waste another 20 minutes hoping there might have been a different ending the second time around.\n\nUnfortunately the music was the only thing I liked about this game. The atmosphere was a bit of a let down as there wasn't much to interact with or explore. Heck you couldn't even choose how you decided to end it. If I paid full price for this game I would have felt cheated.","February 15, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's not a game. It's not an adventure game. I do not know what is it, It could be an interactive story, if there would be any story. It's just couple of 8bit backgrounds and kind of a nice soundtrack. Yes, you can move around, that's pretty much all you can do, and the "game" is VERY bad even at that. Character is moving too slow, and controls in general feels odd. It's hard to imagine someone can produce, and have a courage to sell such half-baked product.\n\nI wouldn't be angry if a game would be offered as what it is. But to mention Stanley Kubrick and a minimalist adventure game, for something that basically feels like very much unfinished, non-even-a-tech-demo of a game, it's just offensive. I have feeling something went very wrong at a very early stage of development and someone said: "can't we use just what we have and brand it as some fabulous Zen, minimalistic adventure game?" Sure, why not. It's not a question of money (I've paid something like 5eur + got it as a part of one bundle), it's a question of honesty.

Even the measured, steady pace of the astronaut is calculated to create tension, as is the breathing that takes its place when you stop walking.

YES? Well, Stranded is just the game experience you have been waiting for!\n\nNow, don't get me wrong - I do like me some artsy games. I enjoyed Proteus and Dear Esther and had a lot of fun with Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery. But Stranded somehow rubs me the wrong way. I think it's the "so minimalistic we were almost going to not allow the maincharacter to walk"-approach this game has got going. Which maybe could have worked out if the game was in any way thought-provoking/had something to say or provided good atmosphere.\n\nThe reality is, you have some nicely pixeled art, some good music that goes along with it - but there is nothing that captures my imagination in Stranded. I am not invested in this world, I don't care about my little astronaut and I am not buying the "wonders" of this barren, alien planet.\n\nThe game failed to connect with me - and thanks to the clunky controls and the slow speed of my character it had no chance to grow on me either. I guess they made it deliberately slow and awkward to control - but I don't get the point of a point & click system if there is nothing to point and click at. All you can do is leave the screen in one of four directions (slowly. Very slowly!) - everything else happens automatically (and by everything else I mean a bunch of animations). There is almost no feedback from the world, very little reaction to your presence and what little there is, is in no way satisfying.\n\nI am very disappointed in this to be honest - because I do like the basic idea of discovering the workings of an alien planet, but it turns out that a video of somebody else playing Stranded is a much more relaxing way of enjoying the art and avoiding the horrible interface/control. A conclusion which, even for an experimental game, I would consider a failure.

It has also given birth to a multitude of talentless hacks, who possess neither craftmanship nor originality, but who claim that people who do not appreciate their works just don't understand them.\n\nI am sorry, but I have to share Stranded amongst the products of talentless hacks.\n\nIt is not that it is worthless. But it is definitely not worth the asking price. There is nothing in the game that makes its value rise above a couple of dimes.\n\nI do appreciate that people try to progress the art of games, by steering away from the standard fare and trying to insert something original. An original story, original visuals, original use of sound, original gameplay, original ideas. And I am not the only one who appreciates that: it looks like gamers are generally willing to support such attempts at originality, and buy experimental games in droves.\n\nExperimental games are often commercial successes. I am not surprised that therefore we now get people trying to create games with little work and try to sell them off as "idea games" that "the masses cannot understand" but that you really should buy because they are "high art".\n\nStranded is minimalistic. It is based on pixel art. It has only about a dozen screens, a great many of which are rehashes of other screens in the same game. It has minimalistic music which gets boring after half a minute. It has virtually no gameplay - the only thing you can do is move a tiny astronaut around, and that is at such a slow pace that it becomes a chore really quickly. And even with that slowly moving astronaut, you play this "game" to the ending in less than 45 minutes. Because there is nothing to do, only moving, and once you have moved to the right places in the right order, the ending automatically plays. You can hardly call this a "game". It could easily have been just a short movie, or a series of paintings, as the player really doesn't do anything.\n\nThe only reason to make this a game is to let the player identify with the character that he or she controls, but that doesn't happen here. The player has no reason to empathize with the tiny astronaut or get immersed in the game.\n\n"But," the game's supporters will say, "this is not about the gameplay! It is about the atmosphere! It is about a feeling of wonder and loneliness!" Yeah, right. I hardly felt wonder, apart from wondering what the hooplah was all about. And I definitely did not feel lonely. I felt ripped off.\n\nStranded has been compared to The Dig. And indeed, The Dig provides a feeling of wonder when the protagonists enter an alien world, filled with weird contraptions they cannot understand, but which seem to have an inherent logic to them. It also provides a feeling of loneliness as the protagonists seem to have no means of escape and have to rely only on themselves. The Dig is not perfect as a game, but it brought original elements to the table which rarely had been seen before.\n\nStranded gives me the impression that the author has tried to create the same kind of atmosphere as The Dig provided, but was unwilling to put in the required work. He could have created a series of paintings, but pixel art is easier, and games sell better than paintings.\n\nI believe that the creation of originality in games should be encouraged. But the creation of games that try to get sold on the notion that they are "original" while they are actually a cheaply-produced attempt at a quick commercial success should be discouraged.\n\nRather than buy Stranded, see that you get a copy of The Dig. It provides what Stranded unsuccessfully tried to do, and much, much more.","August 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Atmosphere. Decent animation.\n\nCons: Artificially lengthened by slow walking speed and being unable to move directly from one side of the screen to another. You have to click multiple times, and you always stop at every waypoint. Probably from animation/engine difficulties. The trailer's a clue to the game play - half of the scenes have the player standing in the exact same position on every screen.\n\nThere are around five things that you can click on in the game that aren't just room transitions, and there's no feedback on what's clickable. You'd think that a point-and-click lets you interact more, but you quickly stop that. Because if you click in the wrong direction, you have to sit there and wait for the character to move. There's a little over a dozen screens, most of them being non-interactive - you just walk through them, half a minute each. If it wasn't for the interactions taking so frustratingly long, and having to do everything in the exact special order, this game could be finished in 5 minutes.\n\nVerdict: Don't bother. It's over-hyped and over-priced. There's no dialog, and not enough interaction to justify that. No plot, no gameplay - just setting. I'm annoyed that they wasted my time to inflate the game length. It seems there was a grand vision involved to justify the "Adventure" tag that was promptly sent through the wood-chipper. Makes me feel bad because it had potential.

Gameplay is also simple; click on a part of the screen to slowly walk there, and click on the edge of the screen to slowly move to the next area.

People complain that it's short, but I think the length works in the games favour - it's a short, lovely look at an beautiful alien world, and anything longer would have lost those element of mystery and wonder that the game captures so well. The walking animation is a little too slow, or else the distances you walk across are a little too large, and since you'll be walking back and forth a lot it does get a little frustrating at times (especially with the slight wonkiness of how the game moves your character in response to a mouse-click).

Honestly.  It has some good atmosphere to it and a decent enough setting.  It kind of felt a little like The Dig in the first couple of minutes.  Then my awe and wonderment quickly gave way to annoyance at discovering the only thing you can do is slowly walk back and forth along a very small game world.  There's no inventory system of any kind as you don't interact with anything at all aside from walking into an area and sometimes seeing colored lights flash or a stone golem guy stand around.  The map system seems completely pointless since the game world is small enough that you have no chance of getting lost.  The ending seemed very artsy-fartsy too.  Considering it took roughly 30 minutes to 100% complete the game, $7.99 seems horrendously pricey.  I got it on sale and I still feel a bit ripped off.  Watching a Youtube video of this game would be the same as playing it yourself, minus the disappointment of having spent money on it.

You can walk, and you can check a very vague map. It takes about 35 minutes to play through the game, and it is very slow. It's much more of an arthouse feature- and a good one at that, mind you. The music and visuals are wonderful, and the story is certainly mysterious in a way I might think on for a bit- but that's about it.\n\nIt isn't worth 8$.\n\nIf you want it, buy it during a sale for 2$. And you will only really want this game under a specific set of cirucmstances: if you REALLY love the whole "games are art" bend of gaming, or if you yourself are looking to get into the indie gaming scene yourself- this little sequence is a wonderful bit of inspiration in regards to presentation. It's interesting to try out a very polished, bare-bones example of what a small time game can be. I happened to fall into the latter, so I went and bought it for the 2$ anyway despite pouring over reviews.\n\nI personally don't regret it.

There are no puzzles. There is no way to lose. The only method for interaction is walking somewhere (slowly). If there's some sort of backstory, it's either about a sentence's worth or I've somehow missed it completely.\n\nAside from that, it's not bad? Art and music are very nice. There's just not enough for it to hang on to make it feel rewarding to me. Would have loved to find out more about the world or have some way of communicating.

NOT full price.\n\nThe music is amazing and compliments the atomsphere of the game beautifully. The retro graphics are a style I happen to like quite a lot, so a 10/10 there. The controls are, as stated by practically every other reviwer, clunky and time consuming but ultimately something I managed to get used to fairly quickly, and the little map is, while useless, kind of cool. It's actually abstract enough that it took me a while to realize I was clicking on a map and not a menu option.\n\nHowever--and this is kind of a big 'however'--this game feels like an introduction or prologue to a longer and more interesting store. The concept they have is really neat, and I'd like to play out the story to some kind of explanation or resolution. I'm not hard to please when it comes to games; give me a bare bones plot with some vague attempt at a resolution, and I'll make up the difference. But ultimately, this game disappointed and frustrated. I can't remember if I bought it at full price, but it's my sincere hope that I didn't.

While I consider this game to be good, it is very short. It is a visual and auditory delight but there isn't really too much to do but be stranded. There won't be any choices or very much interactivity involved as you SLOWLY make your way around the small environment. You'll feel bored and confused the majority of the time but I think that was the developer's intent. The game does a good job of creating an atmosphere, with its sparse (but intiguing) environment and hollow sound design (the music is great). You'll feel stranded and so events near the end may leave you feeling a bit unsettled.

Long story short, Stranded is a wasted opportunity. A promising game sunken by many avoidable flaws. Do I recommend this game at its current price? Nope. Despite my love for it, It's a bit overpriced. So why did I end up recommending it anyway? Despite its flaws, I truly enjoyed my (little) time spent playing it. It came as a part of a 2€ bundle, so it was definitely a deal. If you can get it on a heavy discount or in a bundle, then you should really give it a try.\nSo, what's Stranded about? Stranded is a point and click exploration game, without dialogues or texts. You are a lone astronaut, woken up from your cryostasis on an unknown world. Your ship is heavily damaged and you have to find a way to survive before its imminent destruction.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful pixel arts, if you're a fan of retro graphics you'll love it for sure.\n-The landscapes are very bright and colorful, I enjoyed taking my time just exploring the planet.\n-Outstanding soundtrack, very fitting and immersive. I really really loved it.\n-I personally liked the ending, it totally caught me by surprise.\n-Immersive atmosfere.\n\nCons:\n-The game is pretty short. I usually don't care about games length, as long as the game itself provides meaningful contents. So in this case I'm not really bothered about it. I completed Stranded in 1 hour, but I took my sweet time wandering around and taking screenshots, so it probably can be finished in half and hour or so, I guess.\n-There's no real interaction with your surroundings. During the first minutes I tried to click on everything, hoping there would have been some kind of reaction, but nothing happened.\n-You basically have to explore the world and walk a lot. Not necessarily a con, I personally like exploration games. Too bad your character walks really slow, so if you're not into "walking simulator" games, you should probably skip this one as well.\n-The point and click can be really frustrating: you have to click somewhere on the screen to move your character, but you have to wait till she's done walking before moving again. The fact that she walks that slow doesn't help at all, so better not click the wrong way.\n\n\nTimes like these I wish there were a "maybe" recommendation option. I personally loved this game and don't regret playing it at all, but at the same time I'm aware this is not a game for everyone.\nIn the end, I really wish this game could be improved. It has a lot of potential, and I feel bad about the negative reviews it gets (although I fully understand why). Nonetheless, I'm sure many people will enjoy it anyway despite its weak points.","May 11, 2015","true","1.1"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","11","24","2","0"

You get thrown into the game as an astronaut, that is "stranded" on a foreign planet, with a ship that probably can't fly anymore. Do not expect a plot worth of oscar, it's not that miraculously deep. But expect a game that will get you in for a bit, that will reward you with subtle changing music resonating as the emotions of the game change. You will be rewarded with a beautiful visual style. The game it self takes everything it can from the aspect of humanity - curiousness. Are you curious? This game is for you. Explore perhaps a randomly generated (each start) environment of a foreign planet and uncover altars, sceneries and mysterious robots. Is it long? It depends on your luck (random generation).\n\nBut don't be fooled, this is not a game that you should buy because it will keep you entertained for your whole summer, this is a game that you should buy if you like art. Because that's what it is in the end. Art. An art piece. So do not question price, or anything else, if you like art, appreciate it and you do wanna extend your steam library with a game that certainly is full of art = go for it.\n\nPlayintosh out","May 26, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It's short, but very streamlined and adding more might have worked against the feeling of immediacy and purpose. It does feel like a deliberate move to keep the core as slim as possible.\n\nWether a predetirmined idea of what the game should be like justifies having 30 minutes of gameplay, I'll leave to up you.\nIf you're someone who likes to get a measurable bang for their buck, this probably isn't for you, maybe if the concept of this game only allowed so much gameplay, the original concept was too narrow and needed adjustment.\n\nOr, you could say perfecting a game's atmosphere is more important, even at the cost of gameplay in hours, in which case this game defintely won't disappoint, since it's got that to a tee.\n\nI personally tend to lean towards the latter category, I see this game as a really cool proof of concept, which really caught my attention, and really appealed to my taste. The only reason I don't really go to deep into it here is because I think the trailer conveys it perfectly.\n\n$7 might be a bit too high of a pricepoint though, so maybe try to catch it at reduced price.","May 27, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Very short game, only elongated by the slow and tedious walk cycle and the unnecessary need to explore every parts to proceed to the next time of the day. Klunky controls, it's rather annoying to have to click up to three times just to make the character walk from one side of the screen to the other.\n\nI finished the game in about 20 minutes, a very short game to say the least.

Yes, the interaction is very limited, and the slow walking speed and somewhat clunky controls would definitely cripple it as a game, but I don't feel like that's how you should be approaching Stranded. It's an ambient, somewhat meditative experience, backed by a soundtrack that nicely plays off of and back into the environment; even the walking adds to the ambiance. If you try to get more than that out of it, you will be disappointed, but if you're letting it be what it is, Stranded can probably give you a very enjoyable hour or so.\n\nFinally, is it worth getting? Maybe not quite at the full $8. But I had the 20% voucher, and I feel like, at that price, I did get my money's worth.

It’s only 30 minutes long and even those 30 minutes are only 30 minutes because of the slow walking.\n\nA lot of people accuse Stranded of not being a game at all and I can totally see where they’re coming from but I don’t share that view. It reminds me a lot of the old science fiction stories from the 50s and 60s. The ones with barely any action, characters or narrative, you know. The stories that were a lot about painting a strange, alien world and showing it to the reader and not so much about people caught in some distress that they have to fight out of. It’s a game in which you have to pay attention to details and interpret what you see.\n\nAs such, I enjoyed it. And as such it suffers from being too vague, too minimalistic, too bare, too small and too short. Well, maybe it suffers from that. To me it did not, to a lot of other people it does, going by the forums.\n\nIs it worth the 30-40 minutes?

Slowly walk around the small game world, rest at your ship, repeat a couple times, and end the game.  The first part of that is probably where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from, as the small world has few points to explore and the slow movement quickly degrades any sense of wonder into sheer tedium.

The artwork is beyond gorgeous, the soundtrack is phenomenal (the music responds dynamically to your location and does a fantastic job of amplifying the mood at all the critical points in the story) and, while there is no text or speech in the game, the (very minimalistic) story was surprisingly emotive and involving.\n\nThere are a lot of downsides to this game.

I'm hearing rumors that opening it a second time, the game is different, but I haven't tried it yet, so it's possible there is more play time than that.  However, the slow pacing and short play time do conspire to build a lot of suspense, and also allow you to play through the whole story in one sitting, which increases the emotional impact.  A more serious complaint is the ample reuse of generic scenery (rocks and plants) in a completely scenery oriented game.  Several of the intermediate screens are basically identical.\n\nI would also have appreciated a tiny bit more interaction with the world.  Particularly, I found it very bizarre to stand next to these crazy incredible stone giants, that are clearly breathing and walking around, and to be unable to interact with them in any way.  Like, being able to poke them or have them make a sound when you click on them or something would have made them feel more present I think.\n\nHowever, all things considered, I think this game is worth the cost and the time to play it, as a unique and moving piece of art.  (What do we call this?  "Audiovisual experience" seems to be the hot word right now.  I would not really call this a game, nor is it exactly an interactive movie, although that is a bit closer.  I might call it a poem)","May 24, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, like Proteus, the game is an interesting experiment in how a- and I somewhat hesitate using this term to describe both- game can evoke feelings in a player. There is an undercurrent of mystery, of secrets that lie hidden, and the beauty and wonder of the world you're on elicits a sense of exploration and awe.

The artwork offers a compelling snapshot of an alien planet, set to a beautiful, ambient soundtrack that makes the silent and lonely setting all the more striking. The overall effect is pensive and haunting, more than compensating for the game's small size and short duration: Stranded can be completed within 30 minutes. Likewise, the player uses a short list of controls--"S" for screenshot, "F" for fullscreen, and left-clicking for movement and environment interaction.

Play through the twenty-odd (29, in my case) minutes of clicking your way through the same half-dozen (very pretty!) scenes in both night-and-day renditions of pixel-art (most of which is spent waiting for your oxygen-and-characterization-deprived little figure to tromp across each scene) and you might understand why.\n\nIndividually, the accents and development of the pixel-art are superb, if a bit cartoony. In fact, if you pay much attention to any part of it, it's ludicrously simpleminded (RGB temple colours, anyone?). But buried beneath that, in the particular way the water is colour-coded to show motion in one temple's backdrop, to the pseudo-depth of the mushroom cave, are quite a few clever tricks that make this game thing at least legitimate as an art-buy. If you can enjoy those minor elements and some of the atmosphere (ha-ha, space puns.), despite the endless undulations on every 'living' thing that is what seems to pass for a 'breathing cycle' in pixel-art everywhere, the inscrutable plot, character development, and contextualization, events, and sub-P&C-intensity-gameplay, then maybe you're the intended audience. That or like twelve, and think robots that all look like the Iron Giant took a mud-bath are super cool.\n\nI personally got this game for under a dollar during a publisher sale, and I can vouch for the fact that the Dev (whatever their admittedly repugnant attitude about consumer freedom) does improve both their presentation and overall content in later 'games', though most will still peg them as 'not-games' and '2D walking simulators'. Do NOT pay the full asking price for this, or probably any of the other games here. $7.99, or weirdly enough $4.99 for two, is a simply outrageous price for the amount of product here. This sort of 'experiential' development makes more sense as a mass-model dollar-entertainment than relying on those willing to fork up extortianate amounts for what outside of Steam would be freeware (and anyone who does will probably, to the Dev's evident chagrin, want their money back).","February 29","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You want to hear and see more about this character and their fate.\n\nIf there is one disappointment is that there isn't, but what's there is definitely very memorable.\n\nBuy the bundle that comes with Murder. In a Steam sale if possible.","March 26","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wretched mechanics and occasionally bordering on being original or interesting. At no point was I actually enjoying the experience. It's not worth the space on your harddrive let alone money.","May 13","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
