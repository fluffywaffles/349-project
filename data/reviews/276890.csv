I remember playing the original FATE as a child, so I thought I'd rev up the nostalgia train by getting the sequel to the game.  The game is simple and addicting.  The game has a classic RPG feel to it that reminds me of D&D, but with a single-player twist.  A must for any gamer who enjoys a straightforward, dungeon delving, RPG.","April 20, 2014","true","8.7"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","58","63","0","0"

You and your awesome transformable pet try to regain your power and fame, you against the world for the cause of a hero is with you. But seriously, I love the game, even though it's a slow start at a low level(you can cheat), once you get past a certain level you are met with real challenges(unless you cheated), and the game actually takes concentration and strategy. And once you finish the game, you can choose one object and it becomes a relic for your ancestor, who you playthrough 2 as!

But it should be of special interest to anybody who happens to be a fan of both Diablo II and Torchlight.  FATE is like the missing link that came between those two games.\n\nSadly, the only reason for my thumbs-down here is to help purchasors beware it's become impossible for most users to play any of the FATE games anymore under Windows 10.\n\nSo I'd just hold onto your wallets for now:  Don't  assume that since your other games are still running smoothly after you upgraded to Windows 10 that any of the FATE series will.  It won't!\n\nFATE unfortunately just has critical compatibility issues now with Windows 10; can't get any further than the first menu or so for most users without a crash to desktop no matter what tips they try.\n\nIt's a shame to lose being able to play such a classic as FATE.

The story is a pretty boring one aswell,the narrator is abit wooden if you ask me,i quickly just ignored the story and focused on the game's mechanics instead.\nWhen it comes to a very important part of an Hack & Slash,Fate just fails to entertain me with good and unique items,it's your typical 4% extra damage and +15 fire damage,nothing interesting,the game also has no active skills aside from magic,no melee or ranged skills that you can activate,no talents or very indepth specialization like you have in Diablo 2,all you do is increase Strength and put 2 points in Spear skill when you level up and that was fine in 2005 but in 2015 it's been done so much that quite frankly,i'm sick of it.\nThe combat is also pretty straightfoward,just hit the enemy with your sword,walk back as the enemy begins attacking then hit the enemy again,and because of the fact that the combat isn't very satisfying,it's tedious.And this becomes even more apparent in the abhorrent Hardcore mode which increases enemy damage and health to an unfair level while giving you nothing,and it locks to permadeath(which i'd be fine with if it weren't for the artifical and BS difficulty)\n\nBut,i have to stress that my experience is somewhat spoiled because of the fact i played Torchlight 2 before i played Fate,so if you never played TL2 or any Hack and Slash,Fate is actually a very good and basic choice to get into the genre,it's straightfoward and decent at what it does,it does have a helpful amount of tips in the loading menus,there are no complex systems like the charge system in Torchlight and there isn't a very big amount of strategy required to be good at the game.\nSo while i appreciate and respect what Fate meant for the Hack and Slash genre,and while it brings a loooot of good and sensible mechanics into the genre like pets and such,Torchlight 2 just does it so much better that i can't recommend it in this day and age.\nAnd that's a shame because Fate is a pretty significant game when you see what it inspired and i had a decent time with,it just doesn't hold up against TL2 in any way shape or form.","January 9, 2015","false","19.2"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

As a new character you're bound to get frustrated by dungeon levels giving enemies 10 levels extra, while you're lucky for 1-2. Even combining the 2 dungeons the game is rich, that means max 4 levels per 10 level increment.\nIt is not unlikely to get a starter-quest at dungeon level 2, being level 2 where you have to defeat a lvl 8 alter (not that bad right) defended by 3 lvl 14's who can 3-shot you. Good thing there are 3. If through massive potion use and much much cheesing you defeat one, it will just be respawned by the altar... great fun! (NOT)\nAnd this just one example of many more.\n\nIt seems intended for characters who finished FATE, but what fun would be going lvl 10 again with your powered up FATE character. Not to mention between the game balance gets completely lost since  a lvl-up in 1 means 4 skillpoints, in 2 it's only 2. Just to screw over new characters even more?\n\nWhat is the result of all this abonimable game design you ask? A terrible unfun game.

Moreover, there's nothing to distinguish them from the more recent Torchlight (not surprising, given that the Runic Games team includes ex-WildTangent devs), except Torchlight is better in every respect: better graphics, better combat, and better performance (despite being developed for Pentium systems, the FATE games still manage to overheat my Core 2 Duo gaming laptop even while running at 800x640 with minimal graphics quality).  Want to play a dungeon crawler?  Play Torchlight.  Already played Torchlight?  You're still probably better off replaying it, or playing its sequel (disclaimer: I have not).  If you really insist on getting a FATE game, I suggest starting with Cursed King, since it at least adds a little more character customization and a much-needed button to quickly swap weapon loadouts.","January 29","false","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I used to play the first FATE. One of the cool things is: You start, buy a fishing rod. You then start fishing, after while you get a hat made of cheese.... Next thing you know... you have so much money to spend that you are OverPowered. The strength of this game is that is a hell of a lot of fun even when you are OP.\n\nThis game has almost infinite replayability, because you can build a character any way you want....

Not sure if this is just my comp/settings or what, but by the third time it happened it just made me want to go play Torchlight.  VERY similar mechanics.  Like, there is no "one was inspired by the other" to it:  this is straight up the same system (pets, fishing, loot types, etc.) with a different UI skin.\n\nI played Torchlight first and I liked it better, because it was just a little more polished in a lot of categories:  better graphics, slightly better controls, slightly better loot, etc.  It all translated to "slightly more fun".  Combined with the bugs, Fate just wasn't enough to keep my interest when there are very similar games that do the same thing better.","February 19","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have always loved it and still do! Who wouldn't want to transform their pet into a giant spider, a gryphon or a venomous wyvern? Or summon venomous wyverns of your own? Mystical swords floating around you guarding you? Casting a meteor spell upon your enemies? Equipping a giant scythe or crossbow, games like these have so many wonderful options.\n\nI wish there was a remake of this game. It looked so different and fun when I was a child. Now as an adult it's mere nostalgia, but I can still enjoy the game, just not as much as I did years ago. The Torchlight series (at least II) feels different in a lot of ways, too different for comfort. That's why I'd prefer a remake.","May 15","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially, the game doesn't create its own (long, complex) configuration file, so you have to do it manually or the game will crash before it even gets started.\n\nOnce in game things seem to work basically correctly. Gameplay is similar to Diablo or Torchlight (very much like Torchlight, complete with the "feed your pet fish to change it" mechanic). You're in an isometric-view dungeon, various NPCs give you quests to destroy this or kill that, and you go do it. Disconcertingly, your character appears to be about 10 years old, and there's no character class -- all you choose at the start is name, gender, appearance, and whether you have a dog or a cat. There's enough randomness that the difficulty curve is questionable, but it's a serviceable game of its type.\n\nJust ... don't try to run it in fullscreen, don't try to open the minimap ... and there's apparently a host of other gamebreaking bugs that I didn't personally encounter listed in the Discussions.\n\nIt's unlikely the publisher is ever going to come back and fix this mess with a patch for Win10 compatibility, so I'd recommend just sticking with Torchlight. It's essentially the same game with better graphics.","June 4","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
