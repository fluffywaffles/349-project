The game intro states you found a secret entrance to a base that seems full of the diseased monsters and, in true hero fashion, you assault it alone after calling in its location.\nWhat follows is a very simple game where you face hordes of infected one after the other while trying to find the exit of each level: dull gameplay, a few perplexing design decisions and a couple of bugs make this a forgettable experience at best.\n\nPROS:\n\n-the graphics are modest but work well enough\n\n-good amount of weapons\n\n-decent gore and dismembering\n\n-the monsters you'll be facing have enough variety to not become too boring\n\nCONS:\n\n-dull level design made worse by rooms and corridors that all look the same\n\n-basic, unimpressive gameplay\n\n-horrible enemy spawn system\n\n-bad AI, melee enemies can't jump or climb so if you can reach, say, a tall box you'll be safe from them\n\n-weapon sounds are tinny and weak\n\n-some enemy animations, like jumps and dodge rolls, are clearly missing some frames\n\n-basically no story or objectives whatsoever\n\n-a few lingering bugs, one also makes the last boss almost unbeatable unless you read about it in the forums\n\n-has a reload button but weapons have bottomless clips, in fact you can't reload at all\n\n-very short, 1 hour and a half at most\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=509746690\n\nPutrefaction claims to be inspired by the FPS games of old like Doom, well I'm sad to say they have little in common qualitywise: those old games were simple, sure, but had good levels with places to explore and secrets to uncover, nice enemies, challenging boss fights and at least some item hunting to switch things around a bit.\n\nLet's start with the story, I'm not expecting much since it's a shooter after all but there's nothing after the intro text,nothing at all apart from a small text note at the end...why are people mutating so much that they resemble full blown aliens? Why is there an huge boss? What's up with the base itself? Why can infected spawn out of thin air like ghosts? And why do the infected disappear and their place is taken by some sort of glowing spirits in the last levels? No idea whatsoever.\n\nBut story isn't an important part of a simple shooter after all, sadly the gameplay is just as uninspired and boils down to moving towards the exit slaughtering waves of infected/spirits whenever a locked door/light barrier stops you, rinse and repeat. There are no objectives, no keys to find, no computers or switches to activate, nothing. It gets dull fast to be honest as you walk yet another nondescript corridor/room waiting for the next ambush.\n\nAll this is made worse by the nonsensical spawn system, infected can spawn anywhere, even right behind you or out of thin air one foot in front of you: this not only looks surreal and silly but also makes the game hard in an unfair way. You have no dodge or sprint moves and having a melee enemy spawning right behind you can be a disaster: it actually gets even sillier when such spawning tactics are employed by suicidal exploding enemies that will take 1/3 of your health each...when faced with them my only tactic was to put myself into a corner to make sure none'd spawn too close, but having to cheat the game this way to make it playable shows how bad this design choice is. There's also a few instances where enemies will spawn a bit far from the area you're in or refuse to leave a certain room forcing you to look for them to be able to progress.\n\nLast but not least even a month after release there's still a few bugs the worse being one making the final boss not being affected by your weapons for about 20/30 seconds after each time you destroy its shield. I had to look it up on the forums after trying twice and wasting all my ammo only to die in return.\n\nTo sum things up no story, bland levels, simple gameplay, horrible and unfair spawning system, some nasty bugs and generally low production values make this a game I simply can't recommend: if you're looking for an old school FPS fix please look elsewhere.","August 31, 2015","false","3.2"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","43","55","2","2"

This game has a variety of weapons you can scavenge for, allowing you to add a personal flair to the beautiful art of massacre. The weapons show some clear influence from Doom in their appearance-- which isn't a bad thing, of course. You can also snag melee weapons to dish out devastating damage to the daunting demonic nightmares and put them back in their place! Even with mediocre graphics and (relatively) poor controls, this game will have you constantly on edge due to the massive hords filled with different kinds of enemies-- all with their own methods of menacing you.\n\nPros & Cons\n++  Pros\n+ Fast paced\n+ Chaotic fun\n+ Weapon choice\n+ (Somewhat) Decent graphics\n+ Dismembering enemies (Always a plus in my book -Editorial Drone)\n\n-- Cons\n- Poor sound quality\n- Repetitive monster designs\n- Pretty bad controls\n- Can't edit options on the fly\n- Animations are a bit wonky\n\nSummary     Make your way through hallways, buildings, and other such locations, fending off deadly zombie-esque critters while finding health packs to patch yourself up and some ammo for your guns. Pick up a rocket launcher and, with a few strategically placed shots, clear entire rooms full of grisly creatures, prompting a sudden downpour of blood and various sundry organs.\n\nPersonal Opinion     I didn't like this game much at first, but, after I got to a higher level and found more guns, I started to survive longer, and the intensity started to, well, intensify! The hordes are relentless and get exponentially stronger, which forced me to be constantly aware of my surroundings, scanning for health pickups and ammo drops to ensure my survival.\n\nFinal recommendation: I give this game  7/10 ! This game is well thought out--good ideas that are clearly inspired by old school classics--but the execution is mediocre at best and the game doesn't have much polish. It clearly had a lot more potential than what we see now.\n\nEdited by Frey Cloudseer\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!","September 22, 2015","true","5.2"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","28","41","3","3"

You are a member of one elite squad and your goal is to find a central place of this virus and destroy it.\n\nThe gameplay is enough easy too, this is very old school, just go and kill, kill and again kill. Anyway this can be enough enjoyable, because here you will found a lot of different weapons, enemies and bosses too.

The game is well crafted, great visuals and a multitude of horrors come your way. Early in the game you pick up an axe as a weapon and I had a hell of a time switching back to my gun but I eventually figured it out. The hallways and corridors can get to be a bit repetative after awhile but you are generally too busy fighting off the hordes to notice. The boss battles so far have been unique and challenging but not insurmountable.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet but I sense I am close given where I am so far and from what I have read in other reviews that the game is relatively short.\n\nI don't know that this is a game I will play again after the first go around although I would be more inclined to try it again on Normal mode if controller support were added. I think this is a decent entry in the FPS genre... kind of a poor man's Doom but well worth the price.","February 22","true","4.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsieur_owly/recommended/378270/","monsieur_owly","Monsieur-Owly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsieur_owly/","860 products in account","Comparing this game to old-school FPS such as Doom, Quake, Serious Sam, Painkiller or even the more recent Killing Floor is kinda insulting for longtime pc gamers like me!\n\nThe player's movements are kinda slow. The enemies are poorly animated and always spawn in dead angles. The weapons lack punches and are badly designed. The level design is very linear unlike Doom, Quake and Serious Sam where levels were built like mazes that feature sometimes open spaces. If only it had good background music during exploration and combat.\n\nThe only enjoyable thing about the game is the gore effect which is not bad for an indie game. (+1) Also, it features lots of different enemy types and some boss fights. (+1) And at least, it's not a broken game which means I never had any crashing (+1) or clipping issues (+1).\n\nOverall, the game feels tedious and very generic. Another typical indie FPS powered by the (unoptimized) Unity engine. In fact, the game has more in common with Slaughtering Grounds, Devils Share, Into the Dark, Prisoners of Power, Country Justice Revenge of the Redneck, Liquidator, Dark Vampires and Dracula The Days of Gore.\n\nThe title "Putrefaction" says everything about the game. You can smell it from your computer screen.\n\nBefore the indie dev and its fanboys dislike or delete my review avoid the game at all cost! I wish the actual reviews on the store page could have more common sense.\n\nRating :\n4.0","August 12, 2015","false","2.6"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","0"

That's one run of the single player campaign,and one round of the survival mode. I paid £2 so I am happy because I will play it again.\n\nPutrifaction gets a lot of flack, and the main criticism is it's a sad Doom take-off. Such stereotyping. On its own merit, Putrifaction is the start of a good game. OK some of the guns either look or sound a little basic, as do some of the sets. However the writers-developers seem to have looked at all the successful old style single players, and mixed them here.\n\nI particularly liked the stonework settings, and I liked some of the guns. Most of all though, I liked playing it. I swear, I got my money's worth in the first room where monsters attacked. After that room I joked to myself, "yup, if it crashes now I got my value already". It wasn't even a spectacular room. It was the way I felt.\n\nI know I might sound like a paid reviewer, but I am not. If it was pityful, I would say that and leave it there. My only real grumble was the last boss. If I had not looked it up on youtube it could have taken me ages. Anyway, the short of it is, I will be looking out for a sequel. I rate it 4/5 stars. Loosing a star for last boss and being only 2.25 hours campaign. I wanted more. If a sequel developed upgraded looks and sounds, we'd have a brilliant game.

I've played through Putrefaction on "normal" once, dabbled in survival and have a game on the "hard" setting started.  The game is enjoyable enough but not wholly recommendable either.  On the other hand, it was pretty fun while it lasted.  Unlike a game I really, really enjoy and am encouraged to come back and play all of the difficulties, Putrefaction feels like a chore already to start over.\n\nIn the game you play as an unnamed operative who is sent in to clean up a monster-creating infection in some underground stronghold beneath a mountain.  That is as much story as you're going to get.  This game probably has less story/atmosphere than Doom I, Quake I and the first Serious Sam.  In this game you get equipped with a fun selection of various guns and blast your way through levels crammed with ugly baddies.  There's no voice-acting or other distractions to keep you from the task at hand.  This game makes even Doom and Quake seem complicated as there are no secrets to be found, keycards or otherwise.  As much as I love a back to basics game, this one feels like a totally dry piece of toast with no jam or butter added for flavor.\n\nThe shooting is fine for the most part.  Sometimes things will hiccup graphically but overall I had very little trouble there.  The guns are cool, satisfying to use and do some Soldier of Fortune-esque gore damage to the monsters.  Monster A.I. on the other hand is dumber than dirt for the most part.  You can jump on top of a box if you're having any trouble (and it wasn't very difficult on normal overall), and just pick off ranged enemies while the landlubbers dumbly run up against it...trying to nail you yet being too stupid to figure out how.  At least those classic games had beasties that each had their own way of making their demise a pain in the butt.  Thankfully some small enemies, ones with guns, a type that rolls, a self-destructor, etc. shake things up slightly from all of the goons that run straight at you (and they are plentiful).   There's a pair of boss fights to further spice things up and they were fun enough to fight if rather unoriginal.\n\nSound is unremarkable, the shooting is alright although the monster sounds are rather laughable and shouldn't scare anyone under the age of 10.  Control is a little loose, not enough to cause alot of cheap deaths, but don't be surprised if one or two occur.  When you need to dodge out of the way of anything, you'll find that you have to plan your movements because Mr. Unnamed Operative skipped the space marine diet/exercise regimen.  Jumping is wonky which really isn't a problem as there isn't really any pesky platforming segments.  You just shoot, blast, shoot, blast, rinse, repeat.  I would say I got more enjoyment out of Dead Effect in recent times than this.  Simplicity in gaming is a beautiful thing and I"m always down try these new school takes on old school gaming.  The problem here is that it's so very linear.  With no secrets to find, no overly challenging or memorable battles, respsawning monsters that block your progression and such point A to B gameplay, it becomes very mundane very quickly.  Throwback games are fun, but there has to be some salt, pepper or touch of seasoning to make sure you don't end up "boring" instead of "old school."  That's the biggest problem here.\n\nI'll break it down into some pros and cons...\n\nPros\n\n-Simple, mostly fun old school shooting\n-Plenty of monsters to fight\n-Solid selection of guns and most are fun to use\n-The way guns gore the monsters is entertaining\n-Boss fights were decent\n\nCons\n-No secrets, little variety, very plain, bland levels, etc.\n-Ho-hum graphics (but good enough for what it is)\n-Unremarkable sound\n-Controls slightly wonky\n-Pretty short\n-Doesn't encourage much replay even with a survival mode and different difficulties\n-Almost zero of its own personality as a game\n\nOverall, depending on how much you are into first person shooters or not will determine if you need to play this.  I'm glad I did but I'm not sure I'll get much past my 6/10 achievements and a normal completion.  Most every game I own I play through more than once.  For whatever reason, it's a struggle to want to progress on hard with absolutely nothing to find because the game is so bare bones.  I'm impressed what a single person was able to develop here and Oleg shows lots of potential for future gaming projects but I don't think he's quite found his whole groove yet.  I'm going to have to say this one is a pass unless it pops up for less than $5.\n\nRating:  5.0/10\n\nUPDATE:  I did find some glitches on hard.  I fell through the first level no less than 2 times near the end right when I was about to finish.  I dropped the score and uninstalled the game.  Yeah, this one is a definite pass unless you got extra cash sitting around.","October 26, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is a Serious Sam like.  In other term, don't expect moving freely in an entire level being pursued by hordes of monsters while trying to solve some puzzles to make it to the next level... In this game (like in Serious Sam), you are trapped in a subsection of a level, have to kill every monsters that appear and then will be granted right to go to the next level subsection.  This is quite a difference of gameplay and it is probably why I never like Serious Sam and still believe that Doom 1 and 2 are the best FPS ever made (with L4D).\n\nThe control are poor or not implemented in the usual FPS way.  The left shift key does nothing which is extremely frustrating because you will expect to be able to run for your life with it.  The interaction with the surrounding is null... simply opening door and picking up ammo and life, nothing else.  The sound is average especially for detecting monsters on your back which appears out of thin air.\n\nAll of these make the game strongly outdated and still fall short from the comparison with Doom and other major old-school shooters.  I might sound a little harsh especially since Putrefaction seems to be  a one man project but the price tag of $5  is quite high for a game I would probably never play again.\n","August 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has the bare foundations of an old school shooter but misses the mark on many things.\n\nMy main gripe with this game is that when the player dies, there is no death animation or anything. It just brings up a screen saying you died which to me feels like kind of a cop-out. One minute you are in an intense gun fight then this screen pops up out of nowhere telling you that you died... Hmmm... I mean even Wolf3d and Doom had death animations.\n\nSecondly, the maps tend to feel and look the same. It is easy to get lost because there is no map... Even without the mini map the maps should be given features that differentiate one area from the next.\n\nAnyways, it's not a bad FPS but it could be much better with more polish.","October 30, 2015","false","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unfortunately they were quite right.\n\nThe AI is basically complete rubbish, even on the highest difficulty level. If you find a higher spot you can jump up to, or some boxes to jump behind, the melee guys got nothing on you (save for the first boss which has an impressive reach on his swing). Ranged units feel cheap. I've had them not even try to find me at times, then shoot me the instant they can see me, including through walls at times. And many of the baddies can run faster than you. Considerably faster. And when it comes to the exploding baddies, that really sucks.\n\nThe level design is both nice and leaves a lot to be desired. In my short time playing through the game, I fell through the map at least five different times. One of the times it wasn't even an instant death, I just saw the game world float out of existance and needed to manually reload the save. I also saw the baddies fall through the world a number of times. The levels themselves felt reasonably well built in terms of layout and lighting, though they also felt fairly empty too. And a others said, it's a very linear game. You go into a room, some silly looking energy field goes up (though not always), and swarms of baddies come at out. The spawning sucks. I went into a room to have some cover from one of the waves and found that it was one of their spawning locations for that wave. On the plus side, you always know when a new wave is about to start because the game always saves just before go far enough into a room to trigger it. And after a wave it over you generally can find enough medpacks to get you back up or close to full health.\n\nOh, and don't even bother trying to rebind your keys, cause you can't. I ended up going into my keyboards settings to set the keys to what I wanted. And there is no point to the reload bind, as there is no reload for any of the guns...\n\nI can't recommend this game. It just wasn't fun for me. If the AI wasn't so lame/cheap and if the levels didn't have so many holes for me to fall through so often, I probably would have had a lot more fun. If you must get it, do so on sale.","February 3","false","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Aside from the constant drops to 30 FPS anytime there's any action going on (despite my computer surpassing the reccomended specs) there are other issues as well like enemies literally spawning out of thin air, sometimes on top of you, or you not hitting an enemy when they're right in front of you (I suspect it's the character being close enough to the enemy that the bullets end up spawning behind them).  Enemies have really bad movement animations and don't really respond to anything you do.\n\nI'm also not sure why people are comparing this to something like Doom or Quake.  One of the defining features of those games is the sheer speed with which you move.  Here you move about as fast as you do in Doom 3 (maybe even a bit slower).  It's not really anything like those games.\n\ne: As an addendum, from doing a bit of research it seems like all the assets this game uses are stock Unity ones.  So that's another ♥♥♥♥ on the ever-building pile.  I can safely say this game is not worth $5.  I don't think I'd enjoy this if it were free, it's just a waste of time.","August 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","1"

For a game that is cheap and simple, Putrefaction is a lot of fun!\n\nIt is simple and effective. The gun-play was satisfying, weapons really feel like they have a kick. The gore, like I said, feels like KF 2 Alpha would look like, nice to see enemy heads and limbs split into smaller bits as you shoot them. As for the story, I don't really think it would interfere with you trying to enjoy blasting a horde of mutant to piles of red goo. The overall experience feels similar to Quake + Unreal + Serious Sam and sprinkled with a slightly inferior gore system than what KF 2 has.\n\nThere are some laughs to be had with the unusual sound effects and enemy animations, but that wont disrupt the fun experience this game has to offer. Also, I have to say that the HUD and menu interface looks kinda lame.\n\nIf you casually enjoy playing FPS, get it while it is on sale.

At least the enemies are grotesque enough to make you want to shred them to bits with the minigun,\n\n• Gameplay: 4\nJust shoot everything that moves. Oh and there's no sprint option even though some enemies can walk faster than you.\n\n• Story: 2\nThere was an introduction text at the start of the first level which led me to believe at least the game would be told from found documents and logs by the protagonist but there was only silence for the rest of the game\n\n• Presentation: 6\nThe game only saves by checkpoint which in this case isn't pretty bad considering you only move from one "arena" to another, there's not much to explore and no collectables to risk your *** getting into potentially enemy infested areas. The menu has some basic options, fortunately it has a FOV slider because the default FOV is set to 60. I also fell "out" of the game map 40 minutes into the game.\n\nVerdict: only buy it if you really like shooters and want some target practice and don't pay more than a couple bucks.","November 28, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

No game I have ever seen of id from its early days does this. Also the soundtrack, sounds too much like it was from the FEAR series.

But it certainly isn't very good.\n\nLet's start with what I like: Most of this game is just kill some enemies to advance. That's fine, it's fun to shoot stuff in this game. The shooing is fast and fairly tight. it's very doom esque in encounters, enemies are fast, come flying out of rooms and walls screaming at you, and you need to react quickly to gun them down. This is where the game shines. The action is fast paced and fun.\n\nHowever, this is where it all falls apart. The problem is you don't spend most of your time doing this. For the most part you only spend about a minute or two in an engagment, then you can move forward through a now unlocked path. This wouldn't be so bad, if the entire game didn't look exactly the same. Rooms are pretty boring and un-furnished, the halls are all very bland. You have a difficult time remembering where you are / came from, let alone where you need to head next. This really kills the flow of the game.\n\nAnother problem is the guns. You get a pretty decent amount of guns, however, they're basically all useless in comparison to your shotgun. The guns need to be reworked to make them all more usefull. You could try giving the player less ammo for any one gun, and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of weapons. It's insane how the shotgun is fast, has a ton of knock-back, has extreme firepower, has basically infinite ammo, has a huge range, and can hit more then one enemy at a time.\n\nThe aliens don't stand a chance. It's like a toddler trying to fight Thor, except that Thor has an overpowered shotgun and infinite ammo.\n\nNow, I'm not saying nerf the hell out of it, but maybe lower the range and tighten the spray a bit? Try giving your "big n' heavy" weapons some more firepower. Make your lighter guns the most common ammo pick-up.\n\nAlso, this game really didn't need google .png jumpscares. Especially not ones that repeat everytime you walk back torwards them. I get that you wanted a "horror" aspect going on, but just having good enemy placement and lower ammo would do that, and be less cringey.\n\nOne more thing. Why are there ghosts that tackle and one-shot you in a tiny area in a game that has no evasion options? Come to think of it, why did you throw quarterback ghosts in a game at all?\n\n3/10","April 4","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

It is not the best game.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it is a simple unity engine game. You can get some laughs and such from this game, and the awkwardness of aiming takes a bit to get used to. The enimies come in certain wave horde things, and all chase you at once. They are very quick and in large packs can do damage. This is the game on easy. You actually have to jump on top of objects and pick off the enemies from there, even then you still get a couple of hits on you.\n\nIt is ok for what it is, and is worth the sale price. Don't get this game at full price under any circumstances.\n\nPro tips:\n1: Stand on nearby objects to avoid the ♥♥♥♥ ton of enimies and pick them off\n2: The axe is great for fighting hordes directly, in which it is most useful for\n3: If you hear "RAWR" somewhere in the distance, haul ♥♥♥ and find a good place to stand\n4: The gun is good for picking the zombies off while on top of an object\n5: Use the right mouse feature for the gun if zombies are attacking you while on an object\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","5","18","2","0"

I'll organize my thoughts in a list.\n\n-Gunplay and combat is alright.  The secondary fire for the shotgun (which shoots a type of rocket) will explode as soon as you fire it if you are also moving forward, luckily it doesn't damage you.  Also contrary to the storepage there are no pistols that I saw (more of a nitpick).\n\n-Level designs are bland for me and has wonky decisions made for them.  A couple times I had to backtrack to kill a couple enemies that spawned in later so I can magically unlock a previously-locked door.\n\n-Enemy spawns are horrible.  Not only do they spawn in in the weirdest and absurd places (that can catch you by surprise) but there is absolutely no warning for their spawn-ins.  A particular level I got to the end of a twisting hall to spawncamp as they popped in from thin air.\n\n-Enemy variety is decent enough and the two bosses you face are okay.\n\n-The game bugged out on me several times.  A few times was due to an enemy not pathing to me beyond a forcefield for me to kill them.  I could climb ontop of an invisible wall (but not escape the map itself).  A couple times an enemy got stuck in the level geometry and prevent me from shooting it.\n\nOverall I would recommend this (on sale) if you want to kill an hour or so instead of blowing it on fastfood (this is calorie-free).

Feels like a new developer's proof-of-concept game, not something that should be sold.\n\nTo give credit to the dev, the art style is good and the level design is decent.","May 10","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
