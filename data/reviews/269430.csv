The first vehicles are kinda slow, and it's difficult at first to make money, or buy any cool gear. Then you get the buggy.. That's when the game goes bad;\n\nYou can fly so high, your car will bump into the sky and fall down. Or hit a pylon at the wrong angle, and your flying off.. in the opposite direction you where going. It becomes basically a surfer game.. with a car.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad, but the physics haven't been fixed. So it's easy to accidently fly off the course track. Unlike the AI, you do not get a respawn. Instead. You hit escape to see the menu, and quit the game at last place. My other gripes are the following;\n-No Multiplayer\n-Not enough tracks (You do 3 different tracks that I know of.. that are inverted, or slightly changed to make the 16 race challenge)\n-Not enough vehicles/weapons\n-Expensive for a 2 hour game.\n-Some aspects of game not balanced (Lv 3 Nitro = Insta Win, Lv 5 Shotgun = Insta Kill, Mines are tough at lower level, but once your in the dune buggy.. completely underpowered.. useless!)\n\nSuggestion to customers;\nA game called "RC Cars" is alot more developed, and was kind of what I was expecting when I purchased this game.. Might be better to try that out before playing this game.\n\nSuggestion to devs;\nTake a look at the Road Rash series with how they did upgrades, included plot lines, actual characters with weapons midgame. (Reboot Title: "Road Redemption")\nAnother one is called Skithin, which was similarly pretty awesome game to play. (Had a storyline as well.)\nThe last one that was pretty cool, was called Renegade Ops. They used voice overs, and comic stills to create the storyline between each mission.","April 1, 2014","false","3.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

However (and this is a BIG however) On hard (as there are only two dificulty levels) The game become pretty much unplayable. The games so-called realistic car physics make the game unplayable. Steering is lousy and unresposive at the best of times and this becomes more of a problem given that your vehicle gets hung up on every sudden change in the course. If you get turned around (and you will be a lot) You'll most likely of lost whatwver lead you had by the time you start to face the right direction.\nI actually had to drive backwards for 3/4 of a lap just to come in 3rd. If you get knocked off the track (durring a pile up on a corner most of the time) you wont be able to get back on it. and killing yourself with your own mines won't help either. you can drive until you fall off the map entirly (which wont kill you by the way) the only way to get back to the game is to quit. There is no retry on hard so you'll automatically get 4th for that race. If you are looking for a casual racing game I'm sure you can find a better game elsewere. or at least one that dosen't feel like a like self abuse.\nBut like I said before. On Easy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/269430/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Burning Cars is a barely average top-down arcade racing game in the vein of Micro-Machines.  The game consists of playing through a 16 race campaign in either easy or hard modes against 3 other a.i controlled racers in order to win championship points and gain money to upgrading your vehicle.\n\nProbably the best element of gameplay is the marketplace where you canupgrade your vehicle, engine, paintjob and install nitro boosters, armor, weapons and defences.  As the tournament progresses better versions become available to be fitted in the garage screen.\n\nUnfortunately  the actual racing is not great.  Gameplay controls are pretty bad and making a mistake is unforgiving especially on the bends and in tunnels.  At least with keyboard and mouse.  Whats more the vehicles behave wildly when trying to right them to face the correct way.  This is compounded by issues with some walls not being completely smooth causing your car to jerk out of position without an apparent reason, causing you to lose places and most likely the race.  Even if you have nitro boosters present.\n\nLimited combat takes place during the race with any car being able to equip itself with machineguns, shotguns and mines.  Though these only have limited charges unless refils found across the tracks are picked up.  Other refils include: health, nitro, ammo, armor and temporary speed boosts can also be found as you drive.  If the combat had been gratifying then perhaps the game could have seemed better than it otherwise is.\n\nGame duration is also incredibly short.  Both campaigned completed and 100%d achievements in 2 or so hours.  Thankfully the game was purchased on a massive discount.  Otherwise I would have wondered why I had bothered at all with it.  There are much better games of its type out there.  I suggest you try those.  Ultimiately Burning Cars just provides more agony that ecstacy.\n\nHowever to be fair to the developers if you can look past the games faults bear in mind that the game took five years to get released you could buy it on a massive discount sale.   It does have some nice moments 'when' you manage to keep control of the car and manage to destroy your opponents.  I wouldnt recommend this game but... if you want an easy 100% completion, there are not so many games that can be completed in such a short amount of time.\n\n- First Non-recommendation.  :(  It had to happen!","January 28, 2015","false","2.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/269430/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","At least you get what's on the tin: you will see a few burning cars. But how's the game? Unfortunately, not great.\n\nBurning Cars is a simple racing game: you drive trucks and buggies around a racing course. To spice it up you can equip the cars with machine guns, land mines and nitro boosters. The race course is quite literally littered with caustic waste and trash but also some helpful power-ups.\n\nThe game has two difficulty settings for the championship: Easy and Hard. It emerges that the two difficulties are very different from each other because of the very different car physics. Too bad that in effect there's only one championship, unless you count taking the same championship again (after losing it) with fully upgraded opponents.\n\nI delude myself being a hardcore gamer, so I of course chose the Hard setting for my first championship. The first thing I noticed was that the car physics was outrageously, punishingly stiff (because of the difficulty level): the car simply does not want to turn. If you happen to turn the wrong way (fairly common occurrence), it is extremely hard to turn back the right way, and it takes aeons to do so. Combined with the issue that the interfering opponents can easily push you and turn you the wrong way, your race could be doomed early on. Yes, it is hard but not in a satisfying way.\n\nNext thing I noticed that there are no brakes, i.e. you can't brake manually. Nor can you change the controls, so e.g. I was stuck with 'F' for boost, even though for me Shift would have been way more convenient.\n\nFunnily and thankfully enough, the bad physics affects the opponents too. They get stuck and drive the wrong way as much as you do. Often you can still win an apparently losing race because the AI opponents are derping in a difficult corner where they simply can't get out because of the physics.\n\nI mentioned weapons and corrosive wastes: unfortunately, they are rarely that useful or hurtful, because the opponents (and you too) will respawn almost immediately after dying. You will even retain some of your speed and will face the right way, thus making dying often a helpful occurrence. Yet you can't respawn on the map yourself: if you get stuck outside the course (happened to me several times) or fly completely off the map (also several times), you have essentially lost the race. If you happen to die out there, you simply respawn at that spot again, which to me is a huge oversight.\n\nBecause of the championship mode (it's the only mode but nevertheless a redeeming factor of the game), between races you get money and can buy upgrades to your car. These include better armor, weapons and paint for that extra touch.\n\nYou can also buy more expensive cars, which might be better than your previous one or perhaps not. On Hard mode the buggy was basically unusable for me because its turning was even clunkier than for the truck. It would get stuck driving towards a wall, unable to turn to either direction. Quirky enough, it would turn right more easily than left (maybe the equipment affected physics but I'm uncertain of this), making some turns impossible. While faster than truck, maneuverability was more important anyway with the clunky controls. This also meant that the AI buggies would often get stuck somewhere together and I would then win the race with little effort.\n\nEasy mode was more like what I was expecting. Turning was reasonably easy for both types of cars and for a while it was very easy to win the races. However, on Easy mode the buggies were OP when compared to trucks. They were extremely fast and even trucks with nitros couldn't catch them, so I bought one as well and afterwards everything was easy again, except for the fact that too much speed would (hilariously enough) fly me off the map a few times, losing a couple of races.\n\nDisappointing, Burning Cars is just good for an easy 100%: it only took a couple of hours to grab all achievements. Frankly, the original Micro Machines and Death Rally games are much better breed of the genre. Only get this if it's on an extreme discount or in a bundle. Even then I'd only recommend it if you wanted some easy achievements or really, really like top-down racing games.","May 8, 2015","false","2.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

At least, achievements are all working OK, good job about that\n- Steam cards, which is the only thing interesting in the game\n\nThis game is probably the worst of the genre, where the first Death Rally, released back in '96 is still a reference.\nEven the most recent Death Rally, out in 2012, which was quiet bad, looks good compared to Burning Cars.\n\nFirst, the story : there is none. Just read the "story" on steam page, that's it. So its a championship taking place in an open-air sewer island, with radioactive waste. You get to drive a trash truck against 3 other drunk bums, shooting and ramming on each other to get first place, get money and points for the 16 rounds of the championship. Now the weird part, the game is called Burning Cars, buts it's not really about cars, only trash trucks and flying buggies.\n\nThose vehicles are armed with various stuff from shotguns to mines dispensers, and nitro, and upgrades. That's for the "Burning" part of the game, you'll often catch on fire driving in those green slimes and from opponents attacks.\n\nAbout the racing aspect, it's the most tedious and masochist part of the game. Driving those things feels like there is no steering wheel, its a pain to take a turn, like if the tires got glues on the concrete. No handbrake or brake at all to take some drifts in the tight turns. You're lucky if you don't hit a barrier that will throw you into the sky or in reverse direction, especially with those buggies. The walls are also glued, because if you come too close from them, good luck to get off it. Easy tournament let you restart a race, so hopefully you can make it first place, as the opponents are sometimes dumb as hell and got stuck in a wall. Nothing more to add about the gameplay, it's just horrible. Take a careful look at the trailer video on Steam store, it'll show you all the pain you will get about the no-steering and flying on wall thing.\n\nThankfully, the achievements are quit easy to accomplish, the most frustrating is the hard tournament which will accept no failure, because you can't restart the race when it turns bad, or you go above a barrier or even out of the map, falling in the black void forever... There is steam cards too, but it's only to grab some money they won't make from selling the game itself.\n\nIts a real shame because graphics are ok, of only physics was good, with more environment variety, and a multiplayer mode.\nDon't get this game, unless you get it in a bundle, its pure pain and frustration for a masochist price. You've been warned.","September 29, 2014","false","2.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Do not even try to win games against the buggy with the truck, but it can happen if the AI gets stuck again.\n\nIn the last race I was thrown outside the track and drove off and fell into the endless dark void. Yeah, that happened.\n\nGodd things are the cards - but it takes longer for them to drop than to finish the game (at least on 'Easy').\n\nP.S.: If you want to play a top-down racing game, try out Mini Motor Racing EVO.","February 22, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The courses are not too bad either, and the variety of powerups and obstacles is reasonable, if fairly standard fare for this sort of game. But the physics are a bad joke, seeing your vehicle (of which there are really only two: a truck or a buggy) bouncing around ridiculously, hanging in the air, rebounding with seemingly more force than it hit, and being unable to turn (especially in hard mode) at any sort of speed.\n\nEven the upgrades and weapons are disappointing, with the different models of truck only differing from each other in minor ways, and only a very limited number of different weapons available.\n\nIt's sad, because from reading the brief credits and messages, it sounds as though the indie developers of Burning Cars really put in a lot of effort over five years to bring this game to completion. It was a really nice idea, and I wish I could recommend it, but the fun and replayability is just not there.\n","September 28, 2015","false","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The area that really stands out for me is the sheer amount of equipment available for purchase: multiple tiers of different weapons, engines, chassis, nitros, armour. I generally don't play racing games unless they have a resource management aspect, so this game really hits the spot for me.\n\nMy main quibble so far is that bullets are quite limited (but they are replenished at every lap) so I don't get to do as much shooting as I like. I'm guessing that you can increase ammo capacity as you get access to more equipment, but some more ammo would be nice. I'd also recommend playing in easy, which seems to make the vehicles easier to handle.\n\nOverall, recommended for car-combat fans, especially if you get a kick out of upgrading your vehicle.","February 24, 2014","true","0.5"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","16","33","3","2"
