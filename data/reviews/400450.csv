You pick one of three classes, and throughout the game you can equip hardware.  The weapons are all very creative and variable, and always feel unique.  At the end of each level, you choose your next environment.  There are boss battles and many crazy enemies.  The theme and atmosphere is amazing here.  I can also guarantee that this is one of the best soundtracks in a game I've played.\nThere isn't actually all that much to the game as a whole.\nOn the negative end, the game sometimes feels long and tedious.  considering you can die on any moment's notice, the levels sometimes feel frustratingly drawn out.  Also, there is little "feel" to when you are about to die.  This game is very difficult, yes, but if I die thinking my health was fine (there is a health bar, but very little "impact" when you are hit, and the health bar is easy to ignore).\nIn its current state, I'm on the fence as to what review to give it.  The game is very fun and EXTREMELY cool, but a lot of the game can feel like a frustrating pain in the @$$.\nHere is what I consider a deal-maker though: The developers, Flying Oak Games, are amazing.  They update the game almost weekly, and every single update feels extremely productive.  When I bought this game a few months ago, I hated it.  It felt bland and lots of the content felt arbitrary.  Now, almost all of my previous gripes are gone.  There is even an in-game option to send the developers feedback.\nYou could argue that I'm saying the game "has potential," but I'd say it's different- I'm extremel confident that this game will someday be a shining gem amongst a sea of turds.  And that being said, the game isn't even bad.  It's still a lot of fun in its current state.\nI'd say that if the trailer appeals to you, and the 10$ price isn't unnattractive, then you should go for it.","March 31","true","1.9"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","1"

Just go for the fortress and slap some beefy rocket-launcher and railguns on there.\nBetter wanna go "Melee"? Yes, melee is a thing in this game. Lightsaber swinging nimble robots with invulnerability frames/time to dodge enemy fire? Go for it!\n\nThe Game is still Early Access but the Devs are very active in the forums, looking for bugreports, listen to feedback (there is even a dedicated button in-game for feedback/reports)\n\nMusic is just on point! Nothing to add here. Watch the trailer!!!\n\nGraphic, hard topic. I like it and it fits the gamestyle. for some it will be to minimalistic.\ni like the minimal style and the colors mixed with the effects.\n\nPerformance even on a rig with a outdated GPU like mine atm is totally stable and no problems at all.\n\nThe downsides:\nThe Game is brutal (is that really a downside?) waves of enemies just swarming you if you run in and try to survive. YOU WILL DIE! A LOT!\n\nTill now there is just local coop but Devs wanna get it online coop later down the line but (i really hope it's gonna happen)\n\nLike in every games in this genre you need time and need to learn how it works so this can be a test of will.\n\nbiggest downside for me, if you have a controller plugged in this will be the main input (hope they will add an option to change it)\n\nFinal Words:\nBig Suprises often come from small packages.\nAgain an Indie Dev proofs that it doesn't take much to drop a Game that can impact that hard.","April 5","true","1.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/factwarp/recommended/400450/","factwarp","Factwarp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/factwarp/","208 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game is addicting as hell - reason being is that it offers you diverse ways to kill your enemies by playing with customizable robots using different parts and weapons obtained via pick-ups from enemies you kill throughout the levels.\n\nIt's a rouguelike/permadeath game too, which keeps you on your toes and forces you to make wise decisions on what parts and weapons to use on each run.\n\nAs in FTL, scrap metal (gained by killing enemies) will be used up when repairs are made to your robot, thus careless play can also screw you over financially. At the same time though, selling unwanted and unused parts you've collected will result in more scrap to use on robot repairs or to boost parts and weapons equiped to your robot.\n\nFor the price it's worth it, considering that it's only in EA I feel like the value is totally there.

Also, the developers are amazing and listen people feed back, and that is what is all about, gamers who develop a game for gamers :)\n\nThe only thing that is "maybe" getting me in my mood, is the HUGE level spike between a Hard difficult stage overwhelmed by robots and proyectiles (that I enjoy a lot), and the GOD-MIGHTY BOSSES... Bosses are right now INSANLY HARD. But it will be polish (or so I hope).\n\nMy Last words are:\n10 Bucks for this BETA is WORTH IT, just give it a try!\nMayor updates every week, incredible devs, Incredible fun game with local co-op.\n\nI won´t give any score yet, because I lack of playing time, it will be unfair, but it is a master piece in work :)","March 31","true","13.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haasva/recommended/400450/","haasva","Haasva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haasva/","167 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt is a twin-stick shooter really like Nuclear Throne, but with RPG elements: you can loot many items, customize your armors, upgrade weapons and stuff. Stats (such as speed, HP, regen...) are visible and countable.\nThere is the EP system : every moves (shoot, dash, melee attack, etc) cost EP point which regen fasts but once all gone, you have to wait to recharge your system. This thing prevents blind spamming. The terrain is also a game changer with different things like ice & conveyor belt which influence your movements : it is good.\n\nThe game is really fast paced with the presence of skills like dash, the speed of bullets, the celerity of melee attacks, the responding animation... You can choose between 3 classes with their own unique ability and 20+ skills to begin with (passive or active). Pixel art is very nice and music too.\n\nThe problem is see with this game is the so-so break at the end of every level, when you have to analyse your loot, recycle, upgrade, etc. It is pleasing but it breaks the pace and during that phase, the controls are tedious imo.\n\nIt is less "jump in & play" than Nuclear Throne, games lasts longer I believe, and I think that's the weak spot of the game. I'm interested to see how the game will become in the future.\n\nAnother problem is the loot : it is very cool, we loot many items, but in-game we pick up things but we don't really know what it is, and at the end of the level I feel flooded with so many items. But this feeling is only something of the singleplayer, because in multiplayer you spend time to trade/share items. And btw, I think the real game begins when you play in co-op.","March 31","true","2.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also remember this game is not complete and will be added onto in time.\n\npick this one up, help these guys create something that will become in my opinion a solid rogue-like franchise!\n\n","April 3","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The combats great, the music is awsome, and it works perfectly(despite being a Early Access game). While this game is in EA don't let that scare you away since the devs are very active.\n\nThis game does depart from the conventions of the roguelite genre. Instead of having prebuilt items they made guns and apparel procedurally generated like in borderlands. Also you have more control over what you get in this roguelite. This game makes you feel more in control of what character you want to build sinc you can choose from 3 different classes and some abilities. Not only that but levels usually will give you tons of weapons and apparel to choose from. You can also buy more weapons and apparel with scrap or boost weapons and apparel. This is very refreshing and a departure from what we usually get in roguelites.\n\nThe goal for each level is to destroy a certain number of generators to progress. Idk if this changes after the first boss but so far thats what you do in the first section of the game. After every 4 levels you get a boss which are extremly difficult. You also get to decide where you want to go after each level. Each level have three different characteristics size, difficulty, loot. Loot deterimines how much loot you'll get, size will make the level bigger, difficulty makes the enemies harder but they also drop better loot. Depending on the situation you're in the characteristics of these levels can be really crucial to how you'll progress in the game.\n\nThe game also has coop mode but its only local at the moment. The devs are thinking about making the game online. I haven't tried out multiplayer yet but Im assuming its awesome from what I 've experienced in singleplayer. Multiplayer isn't mandatory but hopefully we'll see online coop in the future maybe even with a matchmaking system.\n\nOverall this game is really fun and if you're a fan of rogue lites or twin stick shooters you'll enjoy this game.","April 5","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I understand that it is early access, but the developers should have released a windows only version if they knew in advance that mac computer controls were completley broken.  I hate to leave a negative review on early access.  If the game was simply crashing, or had other asthetic defects, that would be alright.  No controlls = no go.  Perhaps just a simple message for mac users? "Note: Mac users must use the keyboard during this version.  I'm just dissippointed.","April 16","false","0.4"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","2","17","0","0"

Which are definitely outliers at the current time of review. (Beta 26).\n* There is no save system. At all. This is being added. but it's not in yet.\n* The difficulty curve is more like a brick wall. Easy. Easy. Moderate boss. Easy. Easy. WTF BOSS. This is also being addressed.\n* Only local multiplayer without even LAN.\n\nBut now that is out of the way, the game is amazing! Fantastic soundtrack. Interesting visuals. Loot system has depth but not so much that you spend more time in your inventory than playing.\n\nThe weapon types are varied enough to be interesting without being too confusing. I wish the AI was a bit smarter but that's on the roadmap as well. There is still enough variance to keep you on your toes. (Being zerg rushed by 60 tiny melee bots vs being sniped vs hit by barrage of missiles vs bullethell style plasma balls, etc.)\n\nThe game is a bit rough around the edges, but the core gameplay is really well done and is being updated at a great pace. If you want to wait a few weeks to pick this up, that's fine. I did not regret the purchase one bit. But definitely keep an eye out for it! Going to be amazing when it's closer to being done.","April 19","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
