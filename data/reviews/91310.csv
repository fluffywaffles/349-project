Lets check out the Pros and Cons!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=157767747\nPros:+Lengthy Story that will take you hours to complete.\n+The HUD interface is actually quite easy to understand and get used to.\n+Most Achievements are fun to get... But not all (eg. "Swing em Sticks" was a real B*tch to get)\n+A Vast and surprisingly Complex (Behind the curtains) Weapons system shows the player certain benefits and compromises for each class (Eg. Katana's are fast and Cut well when they can, but have very low durability and make the character tired after a short ammount of time.)\n+Items placements are normally realistic (For example it'll be much harder to find Weapon Ammo in the Resort than in a Jungle hideout)\n+Main Characters are Likeable, and provide 4 different play-styles and Overall benefits compared to the next. (Eg. Xian is Knives Expert, Purna is Guns expert, Logan is throwables Expert, and Sam is Blunt Expert. This also means that Sam.B will never have as much Throwing range as Logan because he Logan prides himself in this. Also Logan will not have as much Stamina while handling Heavy Blunt weapons just like Sam. But these many Differences shouldn't change the game in a noticable way, unless you want to pick a character specially because of their Base Benefits, etc.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=432925245\nCons:-So many Glitches, So So So many lets just say that getting out of the map wont be a problem on at least act 3 (Jungle)\n-Just Save you're Testosterone Fuelled Parkour Spirit for Dying light, Please.\n-The Dialogue sounds really dumb and not thought out at times of the game, voice acting is mainly alright though. (Especially during side quests when you meet wacky Characters.)\n-Drowning is just a blurry, watery screen that slowly saps your health, DONT try it.\n-Car mechanics is another story\n-You don't really need a strategy if you have Shotguns, Machine-guns, Grenades, etc. Long time players will understand...\n-Ammo is the REAL currency in this game.\nNPC's are Stupid and have unrealistic actions when facing a Zed, this is especially bad when guiding them!\n-Fetch quests, really?........Escort Quests, REALLY.\n-Irritating Clipping Issues during cutscenes as well as close combat.\n-Arena is a great feature for farming kills, XP, Various rarities of weapons, and general experience of the game... BUT after a few matches You get easily bored of the Combat options and the system feels very inferior overall to the FPS+RPG games that are designed today.\n-Graphics is reasonable for the time it was made, but the clipping issues along with the Reflective Surfaces (Skins especially!) really makes it difficult to judge the appearance of the Game as a whole.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=430986742\nFinal Thoughts:Story YES (long and fresh, just like those Bananas I bought Yesterday)\nCombat System- YES (Except after long Periods of time in the Arena or Grinding kills for a mission) The freedom of just killing zombies and Bandits in your way is execellent... Because Yes, It is Sparta!\nGraphics NO (Glossy/ shiny  as F*ck, This is a Game! not a new Make-up product!)\nBonus Content YES (Ryder-White Campaign Gives you much more info to the Story, As it is a Prequel. Also Arena is an efficient way of Gaining Kills, Weapons and Experience both in-game and overall appreciation of the eventually unforgiving Combat System. It's kind of a Win-lose situation here to put it Simply, Trust me Guys.\nLevel/Map Design NO (Boring, Repetitive, slow but NOT linear by any margin)\nThe majority of the maps concepts are impressive, but the way that you see them is not very interesting, Metaphorically speaking, its like making a Skyscraper out of bacon xD\nBecause Many parts are repeated but at the same time it adds continuation and at least it doesnt pull you out of that certain environment. (like the view atop the Lighthouse] Its difficult to Give an Even opinion on this one this paying attention to the map/ natural features isnt a priority for many.\nBest advice, go experience the layout of the map(s) for yourself! so if the placement of a specific hut in the jungle or the length of the...(Dare I say) Sewer Segments\n\nOverall I give this Open-world Zombie-Slasher an 8/10\nInnovative for the time, zombie game devs could take some lessons from here, but also learn from its mistakes! I tried to give out as much balanced and simple (Hopefully) Relatable info as i could in One sitting.\nLeave any comments below with any questions as usual- and check out my Review for the sequel to this game DI:Riptide...\nGoodbye...and thanks Techland for putting exploding zombies within tight hallways and behind corners\n-Kyle","June 29, 2015","true","305.0"," 259 of 280 people (93%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","93","259","280","47","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atisz2/recommended/91310/","atisz2","Atisz2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atisz2/","54 products in account","Dead Island's trailer (shown in 2011) was probably the most watched one in video game history, showing a family's desperate fight with a group of zombies in a reversed narrative. The final product itself became a bit different of what the trailer suggested: a less emotional, albeit dramatic, co-operative action game with RPG elements and zombies... lots of them.\n\nThe game takes place in a wonderful tropical setting in a fairly large open-world environment, on a fictive island of Banoi, near Papua New Guinea. The best location is indisputably the visually striking Royal Palms Resort area, with the beautiful beach that almost comes off the screen and makes you want to jump into the ocean. In contrast, the character models don't look nearly as good as the environment, some of them are pretty plain looking, even though the main characters look better. There are many exciting locations to explore on the island and lots of quests to complete. Throughout the island we can help many NPCs with all the zombie apocalypse themed cliché (getting food, retrieving keys, escorting survivors) but they are surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nMany people criticize the story, but I liked it. It's actually very good compared to other zombie themed games/movies and successfully keeps you thrilled with enough drama towards the end (plus there is a good twist if you pay attention and play the Ryder White DLC which comes bundled within the GOTY edtion). You can play it in single player mode (recommended for the full exploration experience, altough it can get repetitive playing alone) but it's much more enjoyable in the 4 person co-operative mode (with all 4 being different characters). The 4 heroes are distinctive enough and it's worth to try all 4 of them out. They have different strengths and background stories. You earn experience by doing quests and killing zombies (you get extra for killing them in special ways) and thus learn different skills for each playable character. For beginners and for single player game the best is probably Sam B (health regeneration, blunt weapon mastery, knockdown), but on higher levels the most effective is the beautiful Xian Mei, due to her high damage bladed weapons proficiency and instant kill chance (just pay attention to her fragility, she has very low health). She is also the most sympathetic character (she may be an undercover Chinese communist agent, but - as shown in the intro, where she is trying to help an injured woman - she is good hearted and friendly towards everyone throughout the game.\n\nCombat is pretty good in Dead Island despite its simplicity (it's better with a controller, where you can manually adjust the direction of your blows, but the overall movement is more effective with the keyboard + mouse combination), just like Condemned: Criminal Origins, it focuses heavily on melee combat. Unfortunately you can't really dodge or block, but it's somewhat compensated by the fast movement. Observing the zombies' attack animations is the key to success, jumping away and swinging your weapon from the optimal distance is necessary to overcome the hordes of the walking dead. Your attacks can be interrupted (smaller weapons are faster) and if you run out of stamina, you will become defenseless and be likely knocked down. Different weapons have different attributes (there are also rare weapons with better values), make sure to use the ones your character is good with. Weapons (at least melee ones) deteriorate very fast, so you are going to be on a constant lookout for workbenches, where you can repair them. Also you can upgrade and modify your weapons provided you have the necessary blueprints (some of them are crazy and very unrealistic), with which you can cause additional damage, bleeding, shock and poison. Guns only provide short-term alternatives, since you can only carry a very limited amount of ammunition and you can't get any from fallen zombies.\nYou can also kick your enemies (very fast attack speed, can't be interrupted and uses minimal stamina) for small amounts of damage and if you use is it in mid-air (while jumping or falling) you can knock down your opponent. Also later on you can stomp on the head of you opponent, allowing quicker dispose of knocked down enemies.\n\nIf you die (and you will occasionally) you will only lose a bit of money and will respawn near the location of your death. Just make sure not to throw your weapon in a tight situation, because you can lose it this way (permanently). The game uses hubs and will respawn enemies if you leave an area (it can be frustrating when your weapons are about to break, you're low on health and trying to get back to complete a quest). In these situations running (and luring your enemies one by one) is the best solution. Also make sure to use your rage (a special ability that multiplies the damage you do and slows down time) in critical moments, it can really make a difference.\n\nWhile the game's strongest part is the co-op mode, it's also fun to explore every little detail. For example you can find the family seen in the trailer, adjacent to the room from where you start off. Or a well known character from a famous horror/slasher movie in the jungle area and a really powerful unique weapon nearby :)\nThe game is a perfect co-operative zombie killing adventure, probably better than Left 4 Dead (storyline) and Dying Light (you can drive cars in Dead Island without having to buy additional DLCs :P), so if you decide to try a game with zombies in it, Dead Island would be an ideal choice.\nAlso the Game of the Year Edition is a polished version of the game (it still crashes rarely) with collector's edition bonuses and an extra story, the Ryder White DLC (which I haven't played through unfortunately, but it's really worth it as it sheds light on the events at the end, on things that are not as simple as they look).\n\nPROS\n+ open world zombie apocalypse with a good story\n+ beautiful tropical environment\n+ enjoyable co-operative gameplay\n+ lots of weapons\n+ DLC lets you experience the story from another point of view\n\nCONS\n- can crash to desktop from time to time\n- some character models don't look good\n\nRATING\n9/10","April 25","true","150.3"," 47 of 48 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","47","48","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/91310/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account",""Why won't you just die?” I cried, plunging a cleaver into a zombie's skull. Car totalled, I was stuck on the side of a mountain, fending off the undead. Having blunted my weapons on his friends, this last one was proving hard to dispatch. A few more frantic swings, a terrible splat, and it died. I stood breathless. The zombie's severed head rolled off the edge of the cliff.\n\nScary, horrible, hilarious. Three traits of the best zombie fiction, which developers Techland have successfully infected their openworld zombie apocalypse sim with.\n\nThe setup is simple. You wake in a hotel on the beautiful holiday resort of Banoi Island. A mysterious man on the other end of a distant radio system is promising escape. You need to contact him, but there's a more pressing concern. Almost everyone is dead. And walking.\n\nA brief prologue, and you're shoved out of the door of a beach hut, armed with an oar, and instructed to clear out the nearby lifeguard tower. Dead Island's story is centred around a series of safehouses scattered about the open world, and its primary missions send you deeper into the island as you move from one group of survivors to the next.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the blood. When a zombie left its desiccated meal and lumbered towards me, I smacked it with the oar so hard its ribs flew out of its body and span away, spilling red stuff from its torso in all directions. The zombie groaned a little, then tried to get back up. I whacked it on the back until it expired. The gore was spectacular. The violence of Dead Island remains remarkable throughout the game.\n\nHalf an hour later, the lifeguard tower was secure and the survivors in the beach hut are free to move in and start building a stronghold. Once your comrades are established, you can wander around chatting to them, taking on more tasks to help them out. There's always a main quest objective to follow, but it's often more satisfying to complete the dozens of sidequests that you pick up from survivors. If you're willing to risk your neck finding lost loved ones and medicine, they'll reward you with cash and weapons.\n\nSo I found myself heading into the surrounding bars and swimming pools, to find food, water and booze. In this order: food, water and booze.\n\nMissions sent me all over the island. I travelled to the coast to get flares from a downed helicopter, drove out to a gas station to secure some vital orange juice, and braved the resort's hotel basements to rescue radio equipment. You spend a lot of time in Dead Island on fetch quests, but they're enlivened by the constant threat of zombie attack.\n\nIt helps that the island is a beautiful, convoluted place to explore. Small wooden stairways coil around little pools and holiday huts, each area encircled by tropical fauna. It's a careful layout that encourages exploration and puts you in close quarters with the lingering undead.\n\nAs I completed more missions, I gained experience and levelled up. There are four characters to choose from, and each has three skill trees from which you can unlock new combat moves and general buffs to make you and your weapons more resilient. I played as Xian Mei, mistress of sharp things. As well as the ability to deal hideous damage with edged weapons, I would eventually gain bonuses for backstabs and flying stabs. She's fragile, but her limb-severing talents make her the most effective of the bunch.\n\nThe other three characters can gain more ludicrous abilities. Rap star Sam B, master of blunt objects, has a rage mode that eventually causes his punches to send zombies flying through the air. It's funny and brutally effective. Master of throwing tat, Logan, has an ability that causes tossed objects to return to his grasp. They don't fly back to him, they teleport to his hand and BOOMERANG! appears in big red letters on the screen. It makes no sense, but is tremendously satisfying to inflict, and can wipe out a small horde in seconds. Finally, Puma is master of Dead Island's rare but largely ineffectual firearms. You don't encounter guns until a third of the way into the game, and when you do, they're pathetic. It makes Puma easily the weakest character, though her group buffs are useful in co-op.\n\nIn some ways, it's a better game as a singleplayer experience. The sense of unease as you wander the deserted island is more powerful, and the zombies a greater threat. But with friends, it becomes pure slapstick. Like the time Tom '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' Hatfield and I took on a Thug and an army of zombies in a parking lot.\n\nI was dedicated blunt close-combat specialist Sam B. Tom was ranged ninja Logan. With barely any plan in mind I charged in and launched a flying kick at a zombie. It connected with a bloody crunch, and then everything exploded. Tom, targeting the same zombie, had thrown a plank of wood just a moment after my kick flattened his prey. His auto-aim cursor shifted to the explosive canister positioned just behind that zombie. Hollywood physics did the rest, and I died horribly in the flames. It took a full minute for Tom's laughter to stop.\n\nOne of the benefits of rolling with friends is the ability to swap items. Dead Island's weapons start out as flimsy, breakable tools that wear out after a few swipes. There's always some debris to hand that'll get the job done, but as time passes you gain skills that increase the durability of your items, and you start spending money on upgrades. You'll find recipes that will let you craft mods for weapons, adding explosive, electrical and venomous effects. By the time I got beyond the tropical beachfronts, I had a favourite murder weapon that I kept in tiptop condition: an electrified sickle that I could never quite bring myself to chuck, unless it was at a zombie's head. I called her 'Old Zappy.' Her critical hits could reduce a zombie to a fizzing electric puddle. She never let me down.\n\nBeyond the holiday resort lies the game's best-kept secret: a vast inland city. It's a warren of baked brown slums covered in litter and streaks of blood. The streets are lined with burnt-out cars. and the shattered shopfronts have been looted bare by gangs. This is Dead Island in survivalist mode. Pockets of humanity have scratched out safehouses here and there, while other areas have been taken over by bandits who will shoot you on sight. You have to pick your way through the rubble, avoid large groups of zombies and constantly assess the best route to your objective. Is it safer to take to the rooftops, battle through the alleyways or brave the open streets? It feels like a war zone, with a tightly packed geography that makes it a fascinating place to explore. It's inhabited by some memorable characters, too, not least the nun who sends you on a quest for booze and rewards you with a mace. Aside from some tedious sewer sections, each location feels busy and new. Later, you'll travel further afield, but I don't want to spoil to much of what lies ahead.\n\nDead Island does have problems: it can occasionally feel clumsy. The skippable cutscenes seemed determined to make me hate my character, the minigame for smashing through doors is abysmal, and unless you want your zombies to bleed XP numbers as well as blood, you'll want to turn off that counter, and the zombie health bars, immediately. Niggles such as the slow mouse cursor in menus and the lack of drag and drop on the inventory screen contribute to a sense that Dead Island is a little rough around the edges, but it never breaks the experience.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, aside from the pants-but-rarely-used guns, getting up close with the undead has rarely been so grotesque and satisfying.\n\nAnd the game is huge. Dead Island lacks the geographical sprawl of Far Cry 2 or Just Cause 2, but the island is so varied and packed with detail that navigating it feels much more interesting. Even when blasting through the main quest line and ignoring the many, many side quests, it's easy to rack up 25-30 hours.","April 10","true","7.1"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","85","64","75","15","2"

You can choose between four characters:\nSam B: He is the blunt weapons expert. He serves as the tank of the group. He is able to absorb a lot of damage whilst fighting off enemies. His fury skill is punching enemies with increased strength and knockback.\nXian Mei:  She is the blade expert. The assassin of the group she can use edged weapons with amazing speed and stamina. Her fury skill enables her to attack enemies with a short knife in a fury of short stabs and slashes. She has the lowest health of all four which makes her the hardest one to use.\nLogan Carter: This guy is the jack of all trades. He is a throwing weapons expert. His fury skill allows him to throw an infinite amount of knives at nearby enemies. Levelled up enough he can retrieve his throwing knives from enemies and make him more effective with blunt and edged weapons alike. He also gains a bonus from using alcohol.\nPurna: She is the support specialist and a firearms expert. Her fury skill allows her to use a revolver with unlimited ammo. Whilst guns are scarce in DI, when you find one, Purna is amazing in her sharp shooting ability.\n\nThe game itself is split into acts. When proceeding to the last act, make sure you have done all you can in the other acts as you cannot return once you go to the prison. I enjoy the varying scenary throughout the game. The NPCs will have various sidequests such as retrieving herbs for medicine and canned food for survivors. Vendors are littered around so you can buy and sell items. The only quests that drove me mad were the escort quests. The NPCs were often glitchy and didn't follow or they just ran head on into hordes of zombies with nothing but a pipe to help them!! Terrible idea Deep Silver!!\n\nWeapons were taken to a whole new level in this game. You can find blueprints for mods which you can then apply to weapons. Searching cupboards, boxes and everything else will give you items to help you make these mods. Vendors will also have several items available to buy such as batteries or bleach. There are various mods to apply. You can use batteries and wires to add an electrical charge to a blade or how about a mod for adding a flame to your sword? You will find it in DI. Some mods are acquired through side quests. Most mods however are littered about. Make sure to search everywhere.\n\nThe story was interesting, a mix of infected and humans to kill. Varied but got a bit predictable after awhile. However the story itself kept me entertained right to the end. It is how I imagine a apocalypse to be. Human against human aswell as against the infected!!\n\nIn closing I give this game 9/10. If you enjoy an immersive story with fun game play and a lot of fire blades then this is the game for you!!","May 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","54","64","4","2"

For me that was quite fresh experience. I'm a big RPG fan so I expected something familiar to me. This is different than typical RPG games. Of course there are RPG elements like leveling and quests, but it's more action game in constantly respawning open world. So you may expect a lot of zombies, dynamic fights and blood. Lot of blood. Fight are mainly in close distance, but you can use a lot of weapons and other items, some of them you craft by yourself.\nWorld is maybe not very big but it's very diverse and you can meet something on every step. Fortunately you can use vehicles which helps on longer distances.\nSummarizing, this is just very good, polished and well designed piece of code.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're a fan of zombies or RPG or just good games, try this game and you won't regret.\nIf you're a fan of Teletubbies, this game will be too scary for you.\n\nLike this review?

I won't stress too much on the rest of the game as it's basically Zombie Cry 3 (With new and improved extra ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics),  but I will focus on how cool it is to control a muscle bound freak who apparently is only good for throwing ♥♥♥♥.   Find a sweet lamp? Killer! Throw it at something!  Stumble upon a solid coat rack? Well maybe it's high time you should chuck that at the first thing that moves! Find a broken down car on the side of the road? Too bad... He can't throw those (- 1 star).\n\nBasically, he is a big wuss who for some reason has dedicated his late night workout sessions to strictly building up exclusive body parts that aid only in throwing stuff.  Don't try punching.  He can't do that very well... And the 80 pound chick has better right hook with a battle axe.\n\nBUT NOW.... LET'S SAY THEY WERE GOING TO THROW THE BATTLE AXE...\n\nYOU GUESSED IT! THE THROWER WOULD DOMINATE ALL THE WAY!\n\nThis game also includes things like, zombies, and trendy stuff, and more zombies, and trendy zombies.\n\nAll in all, I had a really fun time playing the game.  Mainly because I'd get to engage in conversations with random people on multiplayer and redundantly spam "I'M A THROWER, WANNA THROW?" until they stopped believing that I was joking around and defaulted on the possibility that I may have severe brain damage.\n\nAlso... For extra fun... Stand there punching... And watch the shadows.\n\nHands down.... The most abstract depiction of physics I've ever had the privilege of seeing.  Some of these physics belong in an art museum.\n\nSo yeah... Get the game and get ready to....... THROW DOWN!

This game has been out for more then 4 years now, but I have only recently started my adventure with it, and man... what an adventure it is :D\n\nTHE PLOT\nFirst of all, this game was largely misunderstooded when it came out, most of the critic was coming from people who were expecting an 'emotional ascpect' in the game, they thought this would be a dead serious drama with rivers of tears. It is understandable as the trailers did create such impression and it was harmful for the game itself. This game is mainly about survival and carnage, and having loads of wild fun killing zombies. There is an emotional aspect in this game, YES THERE IS! The sidequest are located all around the map of the game, you get most of them from people gathered at the hideout but some you must find by youreslf on the map. For example you are passing a bridge and you see a women hiding under a crashed car, zombies swarming around her, she is screaming to you for help, but you can just drive by and dont give a sh*t about it. Or you can give a sh*t and help people you come across, like a women who is trapped in her house with zombies, she is screaming for help from the balcony when she notices you. You go in there and save her. and there are many other situations like this which is awesome cause it gives you a reason to explore the whole map. And lets be honest games like Contagion, No more room in hell dont even have a plot, they are just an zombie apocalypse happend and we must escape, so does Left 4 Dead but it got a strong character story (at least the first part, when you read the comic) and you dont play it for plot. Same is here, you shouldnt play this game for plot, although it HAS ONE! Yes it has a plot and it is in a serious tone, even emotional if you get attached to some characters. There are matters like, naive ideology, taking advantage of the crisis, putting men of wealth before the rest of society, even kiddnaping and  ♥♥♥♥ (not said straight in the game but a grown up inteligent person can read between the lines and from the situation).\n\nGameplay\nThis game is an action RPG, a hack'n'slash would also be a suitable name for it. The gameplay is taken almost completely from Borderlands, with some new elements of course. So if you have played that game you will feel like home, as many things are almost identical, which for me is great as I love Borderlands gameplay style. So you can play coop with up to 4 players and you pick up items and weapons in a 'loot system', you have inventory with limited space when it comes to weapons and medkits, and unlimited when it comes to items which are used mainly to craft weapon upgrades or are used in side quests or have a high cash value (like diamonds). So you will find many places where there is a box that has weapons inisde. Also as in Borderlands, the world resets every time you change location, meaning that enemies respawn as well as items and boxes contain weapons again, it is completely normal to any hack'n'slash player I assume. Similar to Borderlands also, characters gain experience and level up to unlock and master new abilites. All i all this type of gameplay is really fun but understandably some people might be drew off by it. I personaly found it awesome as I love to collect weapons, craft better ones and gain experience to make my character better. It is a great motivator to keep playing the game, sth I miss in L4D, Contagion and NMRIH.\n\n\nZOMBIES\nWell what is most important in every zombie game... is of course ZOMBIES!!! :D\nAnd well I must admit that Dead Island.... has one of the best zombies you can find in gaming industry. They are gruesome and macabre looking. Pound of flesh missing, chewed of meat, bare bones in the open. Everything we love about zombies is here. I am a big fan of Contagion, No more room in hell and Left 4 Dead but the zombies there were just not gory and messed up for my taste, they are usualy pale looking humans with ketchup smeared all over their face and clothes. And here it is a complete different story, zombies are very variated in terms of damaged body and also clothing. When you are on the Hotel and beach part of the game you see zombies dressed in bikini and swimming pants, with cameras on their neck, so mostly you can guess these are (were) turists, later when you are in the city you see zombies that are (were) locals, later on in the jungle you see also more variatons like local tribesmen zombies or zombies in laboratory suits. The variety is pure awesomenes that I never encountered in any other zombie game. And it is also extremely pleasing that there are zombies who can run fast twoard you like Danny Boyle's '28 days later' zombies and some that can only walk twoards you like the old 'classic' Romero's zombies.\n\nSPECIAL ZOMBIES\nThere are also special zombies to keep the fight interesting (sadly the have only 1 model, exception being the Thug which comes in different variations) and diverse. The first special zombie is the Thug, a big muscle men you might say, a bit higher then normal zombies, he is much more harder to kill as he has more health and can knock you out with every punch he makes which deals a significat amount of damage, they cannot run, can only walk slowly. There is also a 'sucidial bomb' zombie, much like the Boomer in L4D but this one is only about doing damage, he explodes when he is near you. There is a 'raging zombie' a very very big fellow locked in saftey suit (like the ones in mental hospitals) and a Hannibal Lecter like mask on his face, he is similar to Charger in L4D2, he is running twoards you when he sees you to knock you over, his only vulnerable point is the head. You also have a 'drowned zombie' a big fat fellow who spent too much time in water, he spits hazardous 'vomit' out of him to damage you. And there is also the Butcher, who is very fast and can dogde your attacks (melee attacks ar least), his face is chewed of so that you can see the skull and his hands are alos eaten and he stabs you with the bones he has left instead of hands. So yeah there is a great variety to kill here :)\n\nHUMAN ENEMIES\nSomething that I find most awesome is that not only do you fight zombies but also, bandits (couldnt find a better word for them). This is something that you cannot find in many zombie games and escpecialy not in L4D, Contagion and NMRIH. They are very often armed with firearms, but sometimes they use melee as well.\n\nWEAPONS\nThey are one of the biggest elements in the game, much much bigger then in any other zombie game I have played. They come with statistics and can be upgraded as well as special features can be added to them. You mostly use melee weapons in the game but of course firearms are also present in the game. But first the melee babies :)\nEvery melee weapon has a durability stat which is very important because some weapons get broken much quicker then others. When a weapon durability reaches zero, you can still use it but it is very very very much weaker then it was. Of course weapons can be repaired in the game when you use the workshop table... yeah it is unfortunate there is a table and not a guy who does that, cause repairs and uses up money and paying to a table sounds really ridicolous which was a subject of jokes in many press reviews. But once you accept that fact and get used to it, it doesnt bother at all the immersion. This workshop table also plays a very important role in the game as it can also upgrade your weapons to have better stats and also here you can craft 'special weapons' which is made from combining melee weapon with items which creates for example a machete that can electrocute zombies, or a baseball bat with a saw that can cut off heads and arms and legs.","January 24","true","109.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","5"

I had heard a lot of bad reviews about this game and its all about personal perception. Does it have bugs? Oh yes, a few, but nothing that destroys the experience of gameplay in the least.  I have very much enjoyed (still enjoying) playing this game and the co-op has been flawless for my friends and I.\n\nControls and a little "clunky" but you can switch up the key bindings to suit your needs.  Driving is a bit tricky but we laugh more than anything at how bad we wreak our vehicles.  Can be a bit repetitive with the quest runs but if you want a bit more challenge out of your zombie head bashing experiences you will not be disappointed.  The weapon upgrades and crafting mods are crazy and outstanding.  Scenery and graphics were wonderful.\n\nDon't know that i would pay full price but well worth buying on sale!  To those who have had tech issues i don't know what to say except that it has never crashed for me in single or co-op.

(I had overheating issues, but not with much newer games)\n\nIf you're into zombies, you'll like this game.  It's still one of the best zombie games out there, even with some minor flaws.  The zombie apocolypse is protrayed convincingly here.  As you try to survive, you'll help friendly groups searching for a way off the island, scavenge for more and better weapons, and try to avoid the ever-present dangers of zombies and hostile survivors.  Different types of enemies require you to change up your combat strategies on the fly.  You'll find yourself constantly looking over your shoulder to make sure you don't get swarmed.\n\nEach of the 4 selectable characters has a different weapon specialization and unique skill trees.  It's worth trying them all since the combat and strategies will change.  Single player is great, but it's even more fun with coop partners.  Survive a zombie-infested island with several friends working together?  Sign me up.  Drop in /drop out mutliplayer works seamlessly.  (be aware, there are some griefers out there that team kill)\n\nBeyond escaping the island, the story is forgettable.  But in a game like this, the journey really is the best part.  Dead Island is a solid action first person game with RPG elements.  The controls are sluggish and a little imprecise, but overall the game is a blast to play.  If you like zombies, you'll love this game.  If you don't like zombies, it'll be hit or miss.","November 11, 2014","true","78.7"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","35","48","6","0"

I drank just about every bottle of booze that I've come across and im feeling pretty good. The leader of the survivor group  has given me a mission to travel to a hotel to find help.\n\nJournal Entry 2\n\nIn order to travel to the hotel I take a small pickup truck, the steering wheel is on the opposite side of the truck which makes driving slightly confusing at first. Luckily the roads are littered with corpses...living and dead.... There are also fiery wrecks and obstacles so my driving skills won't be judged by anyone nor will I fear a ticket for my reckless steering.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nAs I drive down the abandoned road im greeted frequently by screaming groups of undead that charge my vehicle. I speed up and bounce them off to the side or crush them under my wheels. I'm not sure what kinda insurance this truck has but I'm guessing my premium is gonna be rough after today.\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nI have arrived at the outer parking lot of the hotel, I exit the vehicle and can see many bodies filling the pathway before me... I carefully move forward.. out of every 4 bodies 2 of them usually stand up and attack me. I see another one waking up, I wait patiently as the corpse of a young women grunts and screeches. It slowly begins to lift itself to a standing position... but before it can get the that position I run up in a sprint then jump and boot her back down.. I grab my hand crafted snarly looking mace and smash her head in....Groovy\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nAfter moving along the parking lot and killing a number of zombie foes im now at the base of the hotel, I am finding lots of abandoned luggage so naturally I dig through every bag and take anything of value. I don't know why we are still trading items for cash as currency during this time of crisis.... but hey money buys me weapons which is "happiness" so the saying still stands.\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nWhile digging I heard a very deep and rumbly roar coming from a stair well that leads to the lower base of the hotel. I crept over to investigate, It appears to be a large line backer sized zombie wandering around the entrance to the hotel. I decide to take him on to clear the way.\n\nJournal Entry 7\n\nI attempted to do a running kick on the zombie which failed miserably... the kick hardly shook the zombie and left me standing off balance beside him. He looked down from his towering stance and gave me a smack so hard that I was sent flying backwards into a trolley of suit cases.... ok... time to get technical.. The zombie is very slow and very stupid but getting close is where he has the advantage. I toss one of my diving knives at him, it flies through the air and gets stuck in the side of his shoulder... some damage but nothing that will make a difference. I pull out my mace and do quick touch and go attacks, during which I smash one of his arms so hard that it breaks. The zombie now only has one active arm, I quickly dodge his attacks a couple more times and CRUNCH! I break his other arm... The zombie then attempts to use a headbutt for an attack... TIZ BUT A SCRATCH!.... I am easily able to get close and after a flurry of repeated headshots with the mace he falls like a tree.\n\nJournal Entry 8\n\nI find lots of money on the big zombies corpse, I continue to search bags for awhile then head into the hotel....","June 19, 2014","true","22.0"," 86 of 142 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","86","142","0","0"

Great atmosphere. Visceral melee combat.\n\nBut there's also a lot of awful. The graphics are dated, and the facial models remind me of the lumpy potato faces in Oblivion. Every NPC looks like they're modeling the dangers of skin cancer, all lumpy and burnt. And please explain to me why this tropical resort has such mannish women? You'd expect the beach babes would be hot. But no; it's more like Tranny Island.\n\nThe missions outside the main storyline are uninspired time-wasters. The zombies' strength levels up with you; every combat encounter feels exactly the same as the last, at level 1 or level 20.\n\nBuilding new weapons from blueprints is fun, but spending 15 minutes of each hour repairing equipment is not.\n\nPlaying alone is terribly lonely in this game. It's definitely better with a friend.\n\nAll told, if you’re looking for a solo experience, take a pass on Dead Island.

In one hand, it sucks in almost every way: it's armed to the ♥♥♥♥ing teeth with never-ending bugs and glitches that after a while are just funny to watch, it's got mundane grinding quests, quirky movement, gloriously stupid AI, gloriously stupid UI, a badly designed skill tree, a badly designed currency system, a badly designed durability system, an OK crafting system, ♥♥♥♥ed up driving animations,  ♥♥♥♥ed up shooting animations, a horrible ammunition inventory, a horrible 'Fury' skill... need I go on?\n\nOne might say that the Bad greatly outweighs the Good, but let me tell what lies in the other hand: it has great replayability, it is very atmospheric, has a *decent* story, and there are zero connection problems in multiplayer. Oh, and hacking at zombies is really fun, but very, very frustating. Which is why I say buy two copies, or even 3 or 4, 'cause multiplayer is where the heart of this game lies. Playing in singleplayer feels like reluctant grinding, but when you're playing with more people, the game seems less infuriating. I beat the game with my friends in about 25 hours, doing a great majority of side quests, but the sidequests are so boring that I REALLY didn't want to go through them all.\n\nSo yeah, I would have to say that this game, while being probably one of the worst games ever, is definitely worth $5 on a sale, because it is unbelievably entertaining with friends. So grab a couple copies, put on your british underwear, and start writing down the most unbelievable glitches you can find (once I despawned because of leaving the game area and started floating in mid-air when I spawned).

With that being said, the glitches are possibly one of the driving points for this game, because some of them are actually kind of funny. If you like to see bugs almost every 5 minutes, this is definitely for you.\n\nThe game play is a little rough, but not too infuriating. Throughout the story, you will find a lot of weapons, mods and enemies.

Not only that, but weapons also have a durability to them, meaning after a certain amount of hits (not swings and misses or hitting walls or floors, but actually hitting zombie flesh, be it still walking or completely dead on the ground), the weapon will break or will complete nullify all of its base statistics until it's repaired. This may seem like a pain in the rear, but it's not all too bad due to the fact that you will often always have multiple weapons on you, even when you don't expect too. That does make inventory management a pain, however. Plus, medkits and molotovs are considered inventory spaces rather than sub slots, which can also be a major pain when trying to pick up weapons.\n\nAs with mods, there are tons of them. You can make a knife do toxic damage, or a baseball bat do fire damage, or a gun do shock damage. You can also make a weapon heavier for more damage, give it some extra firepower, or make some explosives at your will. All of these mods require items, however, which can be achieved by scrounging about trash cans, luggage, cabinets, and so on. Call it a loot and shoot if you wish, but the looting is far from the best part about the game. Again, though, some of mods are actually pretty damn cool and are a blast to use. This is something Dead Island did right.\n\nAs for missions, it's a much different story. There's a lot of cool weapons you can make and skills that can help improve the experience, but you'll often be grinding the same areas just to try and get these parts and xp, let alone for missions. There are certain missions called "Continuous Quests". There are almost 10 of these. About 3 of them are for molotovs that require more ingredients then what you actually need to make them yourself. This seems like an act of laziness on the developer part in order to give more unnecessary content for the game. Plus, some of the actual side quests seem to take out huge chunks of time just to get some decent weapon or mod that you can't use until 2 hours later when you're done grinding for the parts to make the mod. One of the worst parts about finishing the quests is that you have to go to the quest giver to get the item. This is almost hellish for multiplayer, because if everyone wants the quest item, they all have to go back and grab it when they could just instantly receive it should the developers had thought of implementing it.\n\nHave you ever seen an exploding zombie? Well, play this and you will. A lot. Dead Island has a wide variety of enemies that can be fun to kill while (somewhat) challenging at the side, not just due to their massive numbers. Walkers, the average or normal type of enemies in the game, are scattered about every playing field and will often be seen staring into the sky waiting for you to come by and eat. Sometimes, however, they could lying on the ground completely still, giving them a good chance to jump scare you. If you're not paranoid enough to kick everybody you see, then this game will make you. Another interesting fact about these enemies is that when walkers charge towards you, they will wind up their swings. This will cause you to have to time your attacks and dodges to avoid getting hit and being swarmed. There also Infected, which will yell and run at you at high speeds, Thugs that are huge and burly and will knock you down in one hit, Suiciders that explode, and more interesting zombies as well as Human Punks. Don't fret about where these special zombies might show up, dear survivors, because they also come with global yells, signifying their presence in the world.\n\nAs for the final part of this review, the survivors. There are tons of survivor NPCs in the game, but you get to play 1/4 survivors that are immune to the virus epidemic, Logan, Xian, Sam B, and Purna. Each character has their weapon strengths and weaknesses as well as their own skill trees. At least, 1.5/3 of these skill trees are original. The 1.5 of the trees pertain to the type of weapon that character uses, while the other 1.5 is just for survival. As concerned to the story line (as nonexistent as it is), these characters are actually pretty forgettable. The only reason they are main characters is because of their immunity and that's it. There's no real bond these characters or the NPCs, which is surprising for a survival horror like game. But hey, at least you don't have to choose someone you don't want in multiplayer.\n\nIn conclusion (mainly because this is super long and took almost an hour to write), this game has ginormous amount of shortcomings and let downs for what it should have and could have been. Even so, it's not the complete worse game. For what it's worth, it's still pretty fun to cut and hack and smash zombies to bits, especially with friends. The game does have its nifty quirks that keep the game play entertaining, but it's no $20 worth of game play. If you can, buy the game when it's on sale, and make sure to get your best friends a copy of it too, because once they do, they'll see why you bought it.\n\nIf there's anything I should include that you would like me to put in or any comments/complaints/experiences you'd like to share, then do not hesitate to put it in the comments and I will put it into this review should you wish for it.\n\nHappy hunting!\n","May 17, 2015","true","34.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","12","14","6","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soldat_SWN/recommended/91310/","Soldat_SWN","KarantanskiOdpornik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soldat_SWN/","86 products in account","Dead Island is one of best zombie games out there. Every zombie fan and enthusiast should try it. Personally,I was very sceptic before buying this game - some people were talking a lot of things,for example - game runs bad,is bad optimized,no1 plays it anymore, it's not worth the money, game have a lot of bugs and lags...But on other side,people said that is great game,it have amazing co-op, it looks good...\nI decided to add it to my wishlist and patientlly wait for next major discount - and boom,here it is ! It was first day of Steam summer sale 2014. There was nise 75% off franchise pack ( Dead Island + Dead Island Riptide + ALL dlcs ! ) ! It costed only around 7€.\n\nSo far I played 18 hours of this game and I must say that is epic !\nIt is definitely worth buying. Let me start with most important thing,and this is ( for me ) AWESOME co-op experience. First of all,I was thinking that this game have similar co-op system joining like Left 4 Dead 2 or maybe CoD zombies,but I was wrong.\nWhen you are playing certain mission/chapter and there is some other player worldwide,playing this game right now ( same chapter & location ),you see little "warning sign" in corner and you can simply press J and join his game ( it doesn't take too much to load,usually you are in his game pretty fast. And most important,the progress that you do with friends counts towards your progress. 2nd thing that surprised me ( positive thing ofkors :D ) was voice chat. You do not need to press any button on your keyboard, you can speak and you co-op teammate will hear you,same is of course when he speaks and you hear it. I think that there is similar feater in L4D2 too,so it's not completely new,but still,it is pretty nice feature.\n\nThe overall story is nice. There are main and side mission. Max level in game is 60. I suggest you to do some main missions and than side missions. With side missions you can get more experience points and you are leveling up faster.\n\nI was surprised by the fact that you can simply pick up and "save" in your inventory a lot of thing. I suggest you to pick up everything that you find,it can help you later by modifying and creating your custom weapons. You can also reapir and upgrade your standard weapons.\n\nWhen you play you need to play smart. You can loose money when you die, and this thing sometimes drive me really crazy in this game. Also,when zombie kicks you you get great animation on your screen, that also makes me crazy :D You have feel like you can not do anything,that you are just useless peace of **** that doesn't deserve to play this video games.\n\nWhen you finish story you can simply continue or choose that you try all way over from start - but you keep all your weapons and level progress. This is really cool feature. Higher level you are,more fun you have with killing zombies. Also, when you find some nice assault rifles make sure that you do not sell or change to anyone - they can be very useful later when you are higher level. But overall,shooting in this game is not the best.\n\nNice thing is also driving car with other 3 co-op partners. You can even shoot from vehicle,which is another great thing in this game. You also gain more experience when you drive in horde of zombies and kill them.\nEven tho that this game was released some years ago,it still looks pretty good and nice.\n\nThose were good,positive things about game. Of course, game could have much better things,there is still a lot of things to improve.\n\nBtw., I also tried 2nd game of Dead Island franchise,Dead Island Riptide and first game is much better ( for me,this doesn't mean that you will have some feel about it ).\nAs you probably know,there is another Dead Island game already announced,release will be somewhere in 2015. It will be called Dead Island 2.\n\nAt the end,Dead Island is fun and enjoyable game to play with 3 other friends.\n\n9/10","July 25, 2014","true","20.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I have yet to see a better first person zombie fighting game. Almost every weapon you find is melee which forces you to get uncomfortably close to the zombie hordes and your weapons do degrade and eventually break. This combat system forces you to carefully consider a situation before jumping in. You do not always have to fight, if you are quiet and lucky you can sneak by.\n\nGreat multiplayer setup as well. You can jump into other peoples games who are nearby and close in level or they can join yours without disrupting gameplay. Fairly long story that is kind of interesting but mostly just moves the game along. Various character classes with different weapon styles allows for some variations between playthroughs as well.\n\nThere are a plethora of sidequests to keep you entertained with this title as well and in my opinion the graphics still look damn good. Definitely pick this game up.\n\nJust to sooth any concerns about my knowledge of this game with so few hours logged I have owned this title since launch on console.","October 8, 2014","true","14.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

It's a lazy console-to-PC port that crashes about every 10 to 20 minutes, with no option to save manually. Effectively a broken PC game. Wait until it hits the bargain-bin (<$10 steam sale), or wait until ALL of the crash bugs have been figured out. I'm uninstalling. As far as gameplay goes: it's basically L4D meets Fallout 3 - in both good and bad ways. It's a semi-open-world sandbox zombie thriller with lots to do, and Fallout-3-like quests sprinkled throughout; however weapon durability is rediculously poor (I hope that gets patched), just like Fallout 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneAndOnlyNaught/recommended/91310/","TheOneAndOnlyNaught","Naught","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneAndOnlyNaught/","119 products in account","On a small island off the coast of Papua New Guinea, the dead walk. The story didn't set my hair on fire, but everything else makes up for it. When you sit down to play, you'll choose one of four characters and for the next 20 to 30-some hours roam massive maps, take on interesting side quests, and chop the heads off hundreds of ghouls.\n\nBut Dead Island doesn't succeed because of its gore (though I liked the dismemberment). Dead Island's strength is in the world it creates. I crept into and through each environment I came to, from beaches to sewers to jail cells. I listened for the screams of the infected or the roar of a damage sponge known as a "Thug." From that perspective, I was on the island; not my character. In the beginning, I'd slaughter every zombie I saw, but by the time I got to the city and found tight alleyways overrun with monsters, I began to just run from objective to objective. No longer was I playing a game -- I was focusing on survival as if I were the one running from Point A to Point B.\n\nObjectively speaking -- like, right now from my keyboard and not playing the actual game -- that's a stupid thing to say. Dead Island doesn't really punish you for dying. If you croak, you wait five seconds and respawn with less money. Any damage you inflicted before heading to the great beyond remains. But I say that using hindsight. When I sprinted away from a zombie and heard its growls directly behind me, my heart pounded in my chest. I didn't think "Oh, I'll just let him get me and restart back there."\n\nYou rarely feel safe in Dead Island, and that's how a zombie game should be. You have a limited stamina bar, so you can't run or swing your weapon forever. Med kits were few and far between in my experience, so scavenging for energy drinks and fruit -- which have to be used at that moment and can't be stored -- became part of the experience. Weapons degrade as you use them, so finding a "legendary" weapon was exciting, but not as exciting as finding a workbench to keep weapons in tip-top shape.\n\nDead Island made me my character. I chose the weapons, the enemies to attack, and the side quests to take. When I leveled up, I chose in which skill tree to invest my new point in -- so even if you joined my game as the same knives expert I play as, we wouldn't necessarily have the same abilities\n\nThankfully, joining games is easy. When you're playing, a pop-up message will notify you if a player is close to you and joinable. If I see you sign on, I can invite you in. Of course, experience levels play into this. Players can only join the games of people who are equal or lesser levels. I can't be level 31 and about to win the game and have a level 1 player join me. It might sound depressing, but there are tons of character slots, so having a character for different sessions shouldn't be too tough. Plus, you can always switch your game to single-player if you just want to be left alone. Sadly, there is no local co-op.\n\nAll in all Dead Island is an amazing experience well worth the price. Wether it is on sale or full price it should not be missed out on.

I've been playing this game for a while here and on the console, and every time I play it I find something not seen before.\n\nGreat weapon system, they get damaged after a while of use, so you'll need to repair them if you want them to be good to use. You can also upgrade weapons and combine them with other stuff   you find using blueprints which are either mission rewards or found somewhere in the game's world to make weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSame old story questwise, go there, retrieve that/kill that, come back. So many missions and sidemissions, I can honestly say you'll never finish all the sidemissions.\n\nGuns do appear later but they're not as cool as a high voltage katana slicing everything in sight.\n\n60 levels in total for each character, and 3 skill trees, each focusing on either character special skill called "fury", combat and survival.\n\nCoop is great in this game, though most of the community playing will leave as soon as you join them for whatever reason, so grab some buddies and dive into zombie slaying paradise.\n\nThere is a very high number of annoying glitches of course, like, on escort missions where you need to kill zombies, those zombies tend to run off the map, making it almost impossible to kill them, if you attempt to kill some zombies during a mission with a car, and if you run some of them into a building they will glitch into it and yet again making it impossible to pass. There's many more of those, and I'm sure you'll see them for yourself.\n\nNPC's in this game are laughable, so poorly designed and optimized, during some escort missions, they will either run into a wall and keep running or they're just gonna be downright suicidal and run into a pack of zombies waiting to die, oh and if you decide you want to clear some zombies from your way by throwing a molotov while escorting an NPC, zombies will die, but the fire will not be put down and NPC will run into it until he burns to death. Also again, during escort missions(did I mention I ♥♥♥♥ing hate those) NPC's will be a drag, moving very slow yet telling you to hurry up..\n\nOh and the last thing, if you don't like some mechanics of this game, like the loot system, there's plenty of ways to mod it out there so you can fully optimize your experience.\n\nAll in all, I really like this game, buy it when it's on sale though. 1-10, I'd give it a solid 7.","April 27","true","58.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Amazing graphics, really great sounds and music, very good and atmospheric locations -- the abandoned police station, and the hotel, and even the whole town... You can physically feel the zombie apocalypse in this one -- even though it's not as dramatic, as in DayZ, or in H1Z1, or even in games like Deadlight.\n\nThe weakest side of the game is AI -- even though you don't expect much from the zombies, sometimes they're just acting... let's say, weird. Another weak side of the game is the script -- god, the screenplay in this one's just awful. I mean, one can only expect as much of a zombie game, of course, but still -- there are good examples of a good script, like Resident Evil, for example.\n\nGame has a lot of similarities with Dead Rising. For example, one can find strong resemblance in finding and crafting stuff, though DI is a lot more atmospheric than DR. Fortunately enough, developers put no bad puns and awkward jokes in the script -- unlike the DR, stuff hapenning in DI world isn't considered as something comical.\n\nTo sum it up, even though it's 2015 now and there's Dying Light coming real soon, this is a pretty good game to spend a few days on a tropical island, surrounded by zombies.\n\nI'd rate this game 7.5 out of 10.0\n\nPS If you'll enjoy this game, be sure to check out it's sequel -- Riptide.

E depois que saiu, o jogo recebeu várias críticas pesadas por conta disso. O jogo não é ruim, mas o problema é que as pessoas esperaram demais e acabaram se decepcionando no final. Eu achei que o jogo foi bem injustiçado nesse ponto. Um outro exemplo totalmente idêntico à este foi o que também aconteceu com o jogo da Ubisoft, Watch_Dogs. O Hype era tão grande que fez com muitos se decepcionassem. Isso não significa que ambos os jogos sejam ruins, mas enfim..\n\nPara mim, este foi um dos poucos jogos de zumbi que lhe passa a real sensação de ser um sobrevivente de verdade! Lute contra várias ordas de zumbi's sedentos por sangue e carne humana em um cenário totalmente tropical. Uma linda ilha, cuja beleza permanece mesmo com o enorme banho de sangue que ela recebeu com essa epidemia. Dead Island possui também uma bela jogabilidade, gráficos lindos e várias quests para se fazer in-game. Eu cheguei a ter mais horas jogadas na versão piratex, conheci várias pessoas jogando que hoje são grandes amigos para mim e decidi adquirir o jogo na Steam por estar em um preço super camarada em época de Promoção. Centenas de horas de jogo lhe esperam!! ;D\n\n------------------------------\n~ NOTA: 9,4\n------------------------------","August 4, 2013","true","262.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/91310/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Is Dead Island better than Dying Light? Depends what you are looking for. None the less, this game does provide a good amount of zombie bashing multiplayer fun. Dead Island is essentially an open world RPG zombie horror survival game where you can craft and pick up materials and weapons along the way.\n\nI'm conflicted as Dead Island offers vehicles where Dying Light doesn't. Dying Light offers parkour abilities whereas Dead Island doesn't. The map layout for each game is quite different as Dyling Light forces you to move in all three dimensions. Dead Island you are essentially stuck on the ground, but expect a few leaps of faith to progress you further into the level.\n\nOverall, the game play is pretty good. Weapons are available for pickup throughout the game and some weapons can be crafted if the player has picked up enough materials to make something new of it. Weapons can also be repaired and upgraded (visually upgraded too not just some BS stat point). When the weapons are beat up or used, it can be visually seen that they are wearing out. Some of the characters have different stats and prefer either blunt, sharp, or throw able objects. There is also a lady in game who prefers guns over any hand held weapon. They organize neatly for you quests, side quests, and continuous quests. The interface was done absolutely right as well as the map. It's tough to get lost in a quest as it will show you which way to go. Other quests can be completed/ended while being on a single quest (really appreciate this)! The aiming within the game is automatic and sort of points to the limb you are generally aiming at. Limbs can be broken (so zombies can't hit you with it) and even amputated with a sharp enough knife. Stomping on the zombies head is an acquired skill while kicking in general to distance yourself from zombies is available right from the start.\n\nThe basic movements are there as you can crouch, jump and sort of jump-dodge out of the way. I wish there was a bit more choice given regarding mobility. Every time you kill a zombie or finish a quest, you are given XP. With this XP you can upgrade three basic chains of skills, rage, weapon specialization (blunt, knife, gun etc...), and survival. I've played the game throughout on xbox 360 and haven't managed to get all the skills unlocked. It will definitely take some multiplayer action to acquire it all. Driving is fun, and the controls aren't the greatest but it does feel good going full speed taking tight turns. Problem is though, there is no other view you can choose than first person. This causes a bit of a problem backing because I have no idea where I'm going. Another thing I've noticed with the cars : the mirrors aren't freakin' mirrors! I know it's a minor detail but being a driver I love having all the views necessary. Within the game between quests, you are able to buy and trade with sellers found in safe zones of the game.\n\nDead island is visually appealing at all levels. You are in a tropical island resort which itself makes for a good backdrop, but they did their best to absolutely nail the fact that even though there are zombies there, you may still like to go for a vacation seeing how blue the water is. Sounds are pretty good, especially when you hear a zombie coming but have no idea where it is.\n\nFOR FUTURE DEAD ISLAND GAMES : I'm not joking when I say put this and Dying Light together to have a killer blockbuster game. If some elements from State of Decay was taken (such as building and choosing your own safe house location), these games would both be extremely off the hook.\n\nRATING : 7.45/10\n\nScreenShots :\nQTE (quick time events) happen when zombies get too close to you\n\nOddly satisfying\n\nI'm not sure if one comes with every car\n\nVisual damage appears on the weapon\n\nMy friend thought we hit a deer\n\nYou can drive but there isn't much to choose from\n\nNot all enemies are walkers or infected\n\nWhat sitting on the back of a truck looks like.

It's a definite win for avid zombie fans and is a reminiscence for the good old times. Dead Island has an array of features not only the brain dead zombies per se but also weapon crafting, somewhat open-world experience and at times, mowing down horde of zombies with a rusty car. It's a great game indeed and deserve the accolade as TMoZG. [As if that acronym exist] On the other hand, unlike the console platform, the PC platform does have it's flaws. In hindsight, the game does stutters due to poor optimization even with a GTX 760. But then again, that's about it. Oh, totally not for the weak-hearted.\nCompared to Dead Island Riptide, this stands out. Nothing beats the original that's for sure.

It sounds interesting, a plot that seems to convey the pressure of a threat you need to escape. It, however, is executed badly.\n\nThe game, for starters, is only technically an RPG. It lacks several RPG components and any that are in the game are done poorly. This game feels like it has a story at the calibre of Call of Duty. It's littered with fetch quests and something that should immediately turn you off buying this game- No save option. Reloading a checkpoint doesn't even really work. Why do you reset a checkpoint? You do it because you messed up, but no, the game practically stays the same, nothing is reset except quest progress.\n\nThe game, however is visually stunning. The glare and motion blur seamlessly blend and make for a great visual expirience if your PC can run the game with those settings.\n\nThe gameplay is boring and repetitive and is comprised mostly of basic fetch quests disguised behind a thin veil of interesting back story and the hope the next quest will be interesting. For example, something as interesting as "Please retrieve this key in order to do this thing to advance the plot" sounds like something that could end up being interesting but morphs into killing several easy zombies only to kill a massive one and take the key. Alternatively, it could continue the boring trend by having you fight massive hoards of the undead only to retrieve the key from nothing, no boss, nothing.\n\nThis lack of pacing, interest or even adequete RPG components reluctantly leads me to say that you shouldn't purchase this game.","October 14, 2014","false","32.1"," 112 of 209 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","112","209","0","7"

Load times are excessive which I'd suspect has something to do with a background process used for the game?  One bug that remains is that users playing with a controller are locked out of the keyboard so they cant chat in game to other players.  There are fixes for this, but be wary, this game is VAC enabled and may result in a VAC ban against the account.\n\nThe graphics are pretty amazing, an open world zombie game on a tropical resort.  Perfect for summer gaming, players can get lost in this game just playing it to run around killing zombies in a tropical paradise, the zombie tourists come complete with fanny packs, and awkward tacky bathing suits.  Play as 4 characters and set out on an epic journey.  This game is still active, with people who can drop in to the game anytime or leave anytime which keeps things interesting.  There are tons of sidequests and challenges that thankfully carry over to your following playthroughs, so you can continue working on challenges while playing through the game again and again...  The Ryder White DLC is pretty interesting, not to long, but fills in gaps in the story, I liked playing it after my first playthrough of the game.  The intro for this game is awesome if you never saw it just let the game start and it will autoplay, the game really plays like a zombie movie that your in.\n\n(Even with bugs and no support the game works mostly and is real fun!)\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99","June 16, 2014","true","73.2"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

Thought Process","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980884019/","354 products in account","Those three minutes was reasonably talked-about. A slow-motion trailer in reverse order, showing a family at a hotel on vacation in paradise that is being torn apart by relentless zombies. Not only was the presentation beautifully elegant and sophisticatedly unobtrusive in both frame and sound, but the emotional impact was just as downright stirring. The trailer indicated a promising, gorgeous looking game that combined gory zombie action and emotional commitment to characters and story. Unfortunately, Techland’s sandbox action role-playing game couldn’t actually care less about characters and story.\n\nRather promptly it becomes clear what the game is lacking and most likely will not pay any attention to, namely dialogue, characters and voice-over. Dialogue is flat and incredibly inferior, expressing silliness and stupidity, while wooden animated characters are exclusively one-dimensional and apathetic. Moreover the voice-over component is frequently slack and awkwardly melodramatic, shattering the outcome of any drama occurring, though the occasional scattered tape recordings convey quite the opposite. The simple-minded story basically revolves around you carrying out main and optional side quests provided by a selection of survivors whose common goal is to ultimately escape the infected island. The problem with these quests is it’s easy to detect a repeating pattern that often turns out to be dull and monotonous rather than exciting and involving. The devoid of tension and fateful atmosphere is remarkable during and between the quests that often feel like a one continuous transportation which frankly takes up most of the time, but supposedly that comes with the open world territory.\n\nThe expansive setting of an open world coupled with the visuals, however, is mostly a delightful experience. Unlike the repeating gameplay, the dull quests and the stiffly animated characters, the fictional island of Banoi is anything but. The overall settings feel lifelike and appear varied; the environments of the resort, city and jungle come out as believable and are surprisingly detailed and intriguing enough to explore. Thankfully, vehicles (that can be tough to drive and tends to get stuck) are occasionally accessible which obviously make transportation easier as well as carrying out road kills.\n\nGuilty pleasure gradually becomes fun and play a significant role here, though. Unrestrained portions of gruesome blood and gore as well as satisfying versatility towards melee combat against dynamic injuries are the orientated elements that appear to have received the foremost care. Slicing off a zombie’s limbs, witnessing splashes of blood using an impressively widespread arsenal that shortly break yet can be repaired and also creatively upgraded is morbidly awesome, but guns arrive way too late and the ability of blocking and dodging is not implemented and therefore - given the fairly sluggish controls that tend to induces joy kills - somewhat annoying when encountering hordes of zombies and special infected.\n\nFighting technique is rather easy, energy drinks and bars representing health are scattered pretty much everywhere and looting bodies and all sorts of objects like abandoned suitcases and handbags in order to buy, repair and upgrade your inventory seem endless. Fortunately, the level of difficulty actually increases during the second map, improving the overall purpose of the survival aspect by intensifying enemies; consequently adding fragments of tension. The element of role-playing manifests itself by levelling via talent trees that customise the chosen character. The chance of levelling up is barely a challenge since experience point scores pop out of killing enemies, checkpoints are frequent and respawn factor is quite generous. In addition, killing zombies with friends in a solid online system is a favourable opportunity that actually deserves a bunch of applauds. Oddly enough, if playing alone the other three characters still appear in cut scenes (!), though viewing is optional.\n\nBringing obvious inspiration from a number of characteristic games, including Left 4 Dead, Dead Rising, Far Cry (not ruling out the sequels) and Fallout: New Vegas, Dead Island hardly achieves equivalent quality. Certainly there is plenty of joyful slaughtering that encourages plentiful approaches on a cool tropical island that has lots of ground to cover, but the non-existent originality, the repetitive quests and lack of weight have a permeating impact on the overall experience which cannot possibly be overlooked. If neither story nor characters are good enough, suspense and atmosphere can actually redeem these shortcomings; however, the redeeming qualities are barely there. When all is said and done, looking back at its easily 20-25 hours of mindless yet pretty amusing content, the game is actually incapable of bringing a single good component, because all it succeeds in managing is a tolerable standard and a tolerable standard alone. Besides, that beautifully emotive trailer keeps teasing in the background, reminding what is left out.\n\n6 / 10","March 26, 2014","true","62.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/91310/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Here’s a game many people probably have in their backlogs and just never got around to playing.  Dead Island really suffered from having an awesome announcement trailer before their game came out. It got everyone pumped up to play a game that looked amazing, and instead they got a game that was just “pretty good.”  It turned out that the team that created the trailer had nothing to do with the team that developed the game. It’s great though, you should look the trailer up on Youtube.\n\nThe game doesn’t really have a “main story,” instead it’s about a resort island where a zombie virus breaks out and kills about 95% of the people. The island is actually pretty big and the resort location is just where you start. Other environments include city slums, jungle, and some indoor levels. The game is similar to Borderlands in its multiplayer aspect. People can drop in and out of your games and you can play cooperatively through almost the entire game. Unlike Borderlands though, there is no PvP in Dead Island. I mention the multiplayer here because the game’s cutscenes play as though all 4 of the playable characters are present. For example when people are talking to you they’re talking to your “group.” Your ultimate goal in the story is to escape the infected areas on the island and eventually get off the island itself. By the way, if you have the Game of the Year edition, you should play the Ryder White DLC immediately after the main campaign ends. It really puts a spin on the story and if you wait to play it later, you might forget some of the important plot points.\n\nIf you do play through the game in coop with a friend (you should!) you may notice that the enemies don’t really get harder with more players in the game. Instead, each person playing sees the enemy at their level (you see an enemy’s level over their head). For example you’re having a hard time going through the game at level 5, so you call your buddy to join your game with his level 30 character. Well tough luck, because while you see all the enemies at level 5, he sees the same enemies at level 30. However, your friend probably has some awesome weapons and character skills that give him an advantage. Speaking of skills, Dead Island is an RPG with experience and level ups, but the level ups don’t really come with increased damage or health. Instead, when you level up you get a skill point to put into one of 3 different skill “trees.” There are 4 playable characters each with their own different skill trees, but if you play the different characters, you’ll find that most of the skills are the same no matter who you’re playing. Each character does have a unique “rage skill” kind like a hyper bar in a fighting game. When it fills you can activate your rage to super power up your attacks for a short time. The points you put in your skill trees are almost all “passive.” Something to note about Dead Island is that the fighting is mostly melee. There are guns, but ammunition is relatively limited for long periods of time so mostly you’ll be picking up things like knives and axes to hit zombies with. There are about a dozen kinds of enemies (not all are undead!) and they have various strengths and weaknesses, but a good hand weapon can take down anyone if you know what you’re doing.\n\nSome problems with the game:\nThe side quests can get repetitive. Most of them are “go over here and talk with this guy” type quests and you’ll be running around the island a lot.\nThe weapon selection system is definitely made for console games (weapon wheel). When you have no open weapon slot and pick up some sort of alcoholic drink, it sometimes automatically switches the weapon you’re holding for the drink. So you’re running through a hall and pick up a beer, a zombie shambles out from the corner and you press the attack button to slash him right? Wrong, you drink the beer in your hand and suddenly your vision is blurred and shaky for about 10 seconds.\nIn an earlier version of the game (I played the non-Game of the Year edition a long time back) when you beat the game you can restart with all your inventory and skills. However, even though the enemies are your level, the quest rewards are the same as the first playthrough! So you can go halfway through the game a second time before you get a decent quest reward. The same thing happens if you skip a “side quest” and come back to complete it later. The quest reward doesn’t scale up to your level. They fixed this in Dead Island Riptide.\n\nOverall I’d give Dead Island a “mostly thumbs up.” I think the game is about 7 gigabytes and takes maybe 20 hours to play through (depending on what side quests you do). Factor that into your decision of whether or not to give the game a shot. If you have a friend to play through with you though, definitely play it. The coop is fun and makes the game easier in one key way: you can revive your friend if they’re knocked out (and you have a spare med kit).\n","August 22, 2014","true","74.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

The possibility to mod the weapons is nice but most of the mods are pretty similar to each other (i.e. adds poison, fire or electricity), so the feature loses its appeal in the long run.

The first few hours will task you with going from place-to-place, performing monotonous tasks that really feel like a chore. Act 2 really starts things up in the City of Moresby, which is my favorite location in the game. You're helping people out, killing thieves and hoarders, saving a girl from a Police Station, going to City Hall, and many other things. Had you given up on Dead Island in the Resort, you may feel bummed out that you didn't know about this section of the game.\n\n\n\nThe redeeming quality, in my opinion, is the satisfying melee-combat system. In Dead Island, which, in case you didn't know, showcases Zombies as the main enemy, you have many weapons at your disposal. From Wooden Planks, Paddles, and Pipes, to Hammers, Wrenches, Baseball Bats, and Machetes. What really makes the combat system fun is the ability to slice off limbs (which may be a personal bias), debilitate your opponents, break arms, cut off their arms, and even decapitate your enemies. It's something that makes me keep coming back to Dead Island, despite my low time-played (I originally owned this game on the Xbox 360, with many hours played). Perhaps I'm Trevor Philips' descendant, but I find it really fun in a game such as Dead Island.\n\n\nThe map is a winner for me. While the Resort is more depressing than fun to explore, there's also Moresby; the city, and the Jungle; which is, well, the Jungle. All locations are unique, and are a very interesting setting for a zombie apocalypse.\n\n\nThe missions themselves are repetitive; at least for Act 1. Go here, pick up some juice packs, escort this guy, get this Teddy Bear, kill these Zombies, turn on power generators. It's monotonous, and boring. However, possibly from my fond memories of Co-Op (we'll get to that later) I rather enjoyed the Juice Pack mission.\n\nAct 2 changes things up a bit, but they're still a little boring, but not as much as Act 1. Kill survivors here, save girl from Police Station, go into Sewers (which I found very boring), get supplies.\n\n\nCo-Op  The main thing that makes Dead Island fun is its Co-Op mode. You can play the game in Single-Player, or invite a friend or two. You can have up to 3 other players with you, for a total of 4 players playing the campaign. It's much more fun with friends, whereas playing the game Single-Player might be depressing for some, and scary, tense, and chaotic in the interior sections of the game.\n\n\nAll in all; I recommend Dead Island. It's not perfect, it's definitely not amazing, but it has some redeeming qualities that I feel make it worth the purchase. If you have a strange craving for slicing the limbs off Zombies, or you're a fellow descendant or off-spring of Trevor Philips, then you'll enjoy Dead Island.\n","May 9, 2015","true","56.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/recommended/91310/","liberteer","Fißtechead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/","503 products in account","This game has been sitting in my library for way too long and when I finally got to playing it, I couldn't stop. It's a pretty solid semi-open world FPS zombie game with some RPG elements and co-op game mode. Although there are few bugs around, you can get through it without any problems.\n\nHigh selling points of this game are locations - although it's an open world, it gives you a sense of isolation just like the first Resident Evil game did back in the nineties. This whole tropical-paradise-gone-to-hell setup reminds me a lot of Italian zombie movies and you can't miss with that kind of atmosphere.\n\nMost of the gaming time you'll be swinging and slashing with lot of melee weapons. All of them are customizable and can be upgraded to something more, out of deviant Home-Alone fantasy. Game enemies are hommage to all kind of zombies, from classical Romero-slow to 28-Days-Week-Later fast ones, including different special infected that make your life more miserable. Story is cliched, but fun and you'll wreck through Banoi by cutting, slicing and dicing bunch of enemies. Watch where you aim, cause there's gonna be arms, legs and heads flying all around. And LOT of BLOOD. Better put on your party boots, baby.\n\nIf you're into for some good ol' zombie fun - grab a headphones, make some coffee, pick up Sam B because it's Coolio with Ice Cube face and scream - who do you voodoo, ♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nEDIT: After playing Ryder White campaign which is part of GOTY edition of Dead Island which tells the other part of now pretty awesome story, I'm raising the grade even more. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME.","May 17, 2014","true","20.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

I get that the graphics aren't spectacular and that the physical qualities of the Heroes aren't so great either, but that's not what the game's about. The game is about the gameplay; which on my side is fantastic! The intensity of the ambience just really brings you a whole new mood of fear and adrenaline. Especially with the Infected chasing you down, screaming and clawing at you. The Suicider's also bring an awesome feel to the game, with their helpless "HELP ME!" cries and general noises of agony. It makes you really wonder how much pain he must've been through.\nCONCLUSION TIME!\nGreat game.\nAwesome ambience.\nOriginal zombies.\nOriginal characters.\nAn enjoyable campaign.","May 15, 2015","true","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can choose from 4 characters (there are 2 female and 2 male). And this is a great point for me: to be able to play as a female character. There is a great story behind each character. And through the story, you collect items to survive, you craft your weapons (melee weapons, fire weapons, bombs, and, of course, molotovs - burn zombies, burn), and create your strategy to kill the zombies and don't get killed yourself. The co-op is very fun and it works. The mods are great too. There's one which you have to survive waves of zombies. I find it very fun to test your skills.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The7thOne/recommended/91310/","The7thOne","The7thOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The7thOne/","30 products in account","Dead Island is a somewhat-boring game with a bland narrative that I still enjoy, 2 years later (originally played on the Xbox 360).\n\n\nThe story is bland, and only picks up the pace in Act 2. The first few hours will task you with going from place-to-place, performing monotonous tasks that really feel like a chore. Act 2 really starts things up in the City of Moresby, which is my favorite location in the game. You're helping people out, killing thieves and hoarders, saving a girl from a Police Station, going to City Hall, and many other things. Had you given up on Dead Island in the Resort, you may feel bummed out that you didn't know about this section of the game.\n\n\n\nThe redeeming quality, in my opinion, is the satisfying melee-combat system. In Dead Island, which, in case you didn't know, showcases Zombies as the main enemy, you have many weapons at your disposal. From Wooden Planks, Paddles, and Pipes, to Hammers, Wrenches, Baseball Bats, and Machetes. What really makes the combat system fun is the ability to slice off limbs (which may be a personal bias), debilitate your opponents, break arms, cut off their arms, and even decapitate your enemies. It's something that makes me keep coming back to Dead Island, despite my low time-played (I originally owned this game on the Xbox 360, with many hours played). Perhaps I'm Trevor Philips' descendant, but I find it really fun in a game such as Dead Island.\n\n\nThe map is a winner for me. While the Resort is more depressing than fun to explore, there's also Moresby; the city, and the Jungle; which is, well, the Jungle. All locations are unique, and are a very interesting setting for a zombie apocalypse.\n\n\nThe missions themselves are repetitive; at least for Act 1. Go here, pick up some juice packs, escort this guy, get this Teddy Bear, kill these Zombies, turn on power generators. It's monotonous, and boring. However, possibly from my fond memories of Co-Op (we'll get to that later) I rather enjoyed the Juice Pack mission.\n\nAct 2 changes things up a bit, but they're still a little boring, but not as much as Act 1. Kill survivors here, save girl from Police Station, go into Sewers (which I found very boring), get supplies.\n\n\nCo-Op  The main thing that makes Dead Island fun is its Co-Op mode. You can play the game in Single-Player, or invite a friend or two. You can have up to 3 other players with you, for a total of 4 players playing the campaign. It's much more fun with friends, whereas playing the game Single-Player might be depressing for some, and scary, tense, and chaotic in the interior sections of the game.\n\n\nAll in all; I recommend Dead Island. It's not perfect, it's definitely not amazing, but it has some redeeming qualities that I feel make it worth the purchase. If you have a strange craving for slicing the limbs off Zombies, or you're a fellow descendant or off-spring of Trevor Philips, then you'll enjoy Dead Island.\n","May 9, 2015","true","56.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a great zombie shooter.  The environments are beautiful, I'd vacation there!\n\nI have some gameplay video of Purna solo play here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiEmNJrCe0Q\n\nI had a blast in the single player.  I played all 4 characters.  I would say that Xian was my favorite character, with the Katana.  Purna was my least favorite character because of the shortage of ammo.  My favorite weapon was the Katana.  The controls are such that you can set them to suit whatever configuration you are comfortable with.  The weapons are varied, plentiful and modable.\n\nI replayed the game again in CO-OP with a friend and had a blast as well.  One thing is getting the CO-OP to work was tricky.  What we did was limited our game to 2 players and I set mine to invite only (so a random didn't pop in) then we went into public multiplayer and I looked for his name and invited him.  Not sure why the local CO-OP option didn't work and the "join" game didn't work either from the friends list, but instead of wasting time fiddling with it the work around using the public and finding him and manually inviting him allowed us to just start playing.  I also have some co-op play video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7a3Es1IinE\n\nEven though I have played through all the characters and played a hundred hours or so I still have the arena achievements to get; so even though I bought this game on sale with the DLCs the replay value is great!\n\nAlso it's really nice that if you had developed your character in Dead Island you can import that character into Riptide.","November 28, 2013","true","236.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But there are even "dungeon" like houses, hotels, sewers etc...and a city too\n\nThe maps are quite big and there is a lot of missions and stuff to find. Plus a lot of collectibles, records etc that will help you to understand better what's really happening.\n\nWeapons are customisable and upgradable (with money and materials that you will find all over the map) and this make the game even more fun. You can literally burn or electrify (or other interesting things) zombies. Plus exploring give you the possibility to find stronger or even rare weapons (like the old RPG school teach us: green, blue, purple, yellow and orange items).\n\nScary factor is always there hidden in a corner...sometimes dark places makes you hard tho see where those zombies are...sometimes you never know what can be round that corner.\n\nZombies are not equal too...from the classic ones to the thug ones at the runners and so on. In few words a nice way to make the enemies challenging the more you level up and you start to feel too much "comfy".\n\nSound and music are pretty cool and totally engaging. Changing from situation to situation to hurt the nerves of the most "weak" lol.\n\nAchivements inside the game and outside of it on steam makes this game even more interesting and makes you want to play it again and again until you get all of them.\n\nWith the GOTY edition you have even 3 DLC for having more fun Online!\n\nPlaying this game alone is good and fun but playing this with friends is even better.\n\nOverall:\nGraphic 7,5/10\nSounds 8/10\nGameplay 7,5\nCustomisation 9/10\nLongevity 8,5/10\nFun 7/10 (alone) 10/10 (co-op)\n\nIn few words...you will never regret this game...never...specially if you will play it with some friends!","March 7, 2014","true","95.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There's quite a large variety of weapons and weapon modifications which you can find, and the loot you pick up will go toward crafting these modifications, which makes looting actually useful.\n\nHowever, the game's movement is underdeveloped- it feels extremely clunky and slow, and because the game relies on melee combat so often, the tank-like movement can prove problematic.\nIt also makes the game's pace too slow for such large areas of the map, and it becomes an effort (and slightly boring) to travel even short distances.\nThe game's voice chat system may annoy some people- make sure it's off, or on push-to-talk at least.\n\nIf you are looking for a quick zombie game with more fluid movements, the L4D2 is definitely a better game.\nBut if you are looking for a slower, open world zombie campaign, then this is for you.","March 23, 2014","false","17.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Several times I've found myself in dire need to run away from enemies, use a med kit, and swing back at the zombies again. Problem is usually that for some reason, your character wants to take a swing at the whisky bottle instead, making it a lot harder to do anything useful, since your character has kidneys of sizes of a couple of nuts and will get drunk close to only smelling the whisky.\n\nAnother annoying bug is; you really need to watch out when you use grenades, because limbs of the zombies can hit you and instantly kill you, for some reason.\n\nThe game also has a ton of close to useless side quests, like getting a teddy bear for a grown woman. Yes, that is an actual side quest. "Hi, this is a zombie apocalypse game. Please go and find a teddy bear for this 35 year old woman, she cannot sleep without it." Oh, OK. Yes, please. Let me go out of my way trying to survive a bloody apocalypse, to go and get your teddy bear.\n\nI've had to try to finish this game 3 times, not because it's hard, but because it's so dull and boring. Weapons in itself are close to useless because the only thing that doesn't require stamina is kicking stuff. You can figuratively kick everything to death throughout the whole game.\n\nNot to mention this game's pretty much a weapon-repair simulator when it comes down to it.\n\nBut in the end, if you like zombie apocalypse games, this is in the zone, it's not horrible. It's not even a bad game, it's just... boring. The story's not entertaining enough, there's close to no character development, and the side quests make the game horribly dull. But if you don't care for the essentials in a game and just want to kill zombies, then go ahead. This is your game.","May 14, 2015","false","61.8"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","14","24","7","0"

They give you  4 survivors and try to give them memorable attitudes and personalities. However I would say the game failed one thing badly and that is to really establish a tone. During the story there was a bunch of up’s and down’s and dramatic scenes but i was not really absorbed by them at all. Neither was i really affected by the deaths of characters.\n\nMechanics\nThe looting is pretty good in this game and the benchwork crafting and customization is a more complex system of Dead Rising. Though Dead Rising had a more extreme variety of visual weaponers, this game still does a great job offering a player many ways to improve their current weaponry and future weapons.\n\nZombie Free Roam\nThe free roam in this game is pretty good along with its graphics.

The trailers looked amazing.\nI never buy games at full price. And when I saw this game on sale, I jumped on it. I was extatic that I'd be able to finally play this game. I only wish I had read the reviews beforehand.\n\n<Summary>\npros:\nopen world\namazing trailer\n\ncons:\nopen world\nno real story\nrepetitive\ndriving is awful\nclass specialty and specifications are pretty useless\nmultiplayer is awful (oten disconnects)\n\n<Detailed Review>\nThis game reminded me of Red Faciton Guerilla.\n\nThey tried to allow lots of freedom to the player by creating an open world.\nHowever, they seemed to have forgotten the story.\nYou get a glimpse of the plot here and there, but you soon forget what was happening in the first place.\n\nThe open world is combined with a mission system. You have a base of operations in which people give you missions. With this, you are to venture out into the open world and complete the said tasks. It just becomes a reptitive mess of go to home base go out and get/do something. Of course, you smash a few zombies on the way. There is nothing particulary interesting or different about what you do.\n\nThe driving system is awful in this game. You will need to drive if you're looking to venture far in some safety. Yet, the designers decided that driving was an unimportant feature and created a nightmare of a driving control/physics.\n\nWhen starting the game, you are given 4 characters with specializations. Each are strong at projectile/throwing, guns, sharp objects/something that cuts, or blunt/bashing weapons.\nThe problem here, is that only one is even remotely useful. The blunt/bashing weapons is what any sane person should pick.\nReasoning:\n\nprojectile/throwing (I chose this guy...oops) - Your are given a limited number of slots for weapons to carry. Any object can be thrown as a projecticle. This is great! However, only some objects do any noticeable damage as a projectile. When you throw something, it either lodges into the zombie or falls down. You must retrive it to use it again. There is a perk to increase the chance of items bouncing back at you to catch. So....projectiles like knives stack right? Absolutely not, everything is in its own slot. Recap: limited weapons, some don't do much damage, you have to retrieve in a fight, projectiles don't stack.\n\nGuns - You don't get any gun until you progress a decent amount. And when you do, you have such limited ammo quantity so you want to use it sparingly. Why on earth would I want someone who specializes in guns?\n\nsharp object - Most sharp objects you get are small knives or cleavers. They have a rather short range and would just be better off thrown at a zombie.\n\nWinner: blunt weapons! Most items you find are blunt weapons. The smart choice is to pick this guy.\n\nThis just makes me wonder why the game even offers the 3 other specializations if there is a clear choice in who is superior. Unfortunately, you don't find this flaw out until you've played for your first time.\n\nAll in all, this was an overly hyped game that flopped completely.","June 2, 2014","false","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They give you  4 survivors and try to give them memorable attitudes and personalities. However I would say the game failed one thing badly and that is to really establish a tone. During the story there was a bunch of up’s and down’s and dramatic scenes but i was not really absorbed by them at all. Neither was i really affected by the deaths of characters.\n\nMechanics\nThe looting is pretty good in this game and the benchwork crafting and customization is a more complex system of Dead Rising. Though Dead Rising had a more extreme variety of visual weaponers, this game still does a great job offering a player many ways to improve their current weaponry and future weapons.\n\nZombie Free Roam\nThe free roam in this game is pretty good along with its graphics.

Immersion is great on the Island and city but I struggled to capture that same experience in the Jungle or prison. Very arcadish and combat reflects that since there are a few visual animations that occur (like the amount of damage and xp you get in numbers). Game can feel very repetitive and boring when on single player but if you play with people the entire time (like I did) you will enjoy every second of it whether it's because of the clunky animations, funny characters or the story itself. I played this with a group of people and had probably one of the most fun experiences of my life.\nGame: 7/10\nGood graphics, good story and questionable (at some points) gameplay.","December 26, 2015","true","38.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Dead Island is a fun game that is definitely worth playing. I'll list the pros and cons below.\n\nPros:\n-The graphics are great, even years later in 2014.\n-The combat is fun and interactive, you can feel the results of every action you put into a fight. You can even run for your life and still feel immersed as hell and have so much fun.\n-Awesome wide-spanned crafting system that allows for a ton of fun and even funny ways to create weapons.\n-The questline is funny yet intriguing at the same time. The story is very well-crafted and has many ways to surprise you, made even better by the use of the Ryder White DLC which builds upon the story.\n-Drop in/Drop out coop system makes for an easy-to-use multiplayer experience. And this game is extremely fun when played with friends. Zombies can scale to your level making it fairplay to go back to the beginning with a high-level character to help a friend. You still get an on-par experience.\n-Mixed gameplay elements. You get to melee fight with zombies one minute and then two minutes later pull out your gun and engage\n-Glitches. Yes I put this under pros. When you spin around on a toilet and end up on the fax machine, you'll understand.\n\nCons:\n-The economy makes no sense. Money values are all messed up and there is no consistency.\n-It's a console port, so the rendering distance for objects and terrain can be laughable at points. (IE i was in a house and the cups on the table only spawned when I got within one yard of them)\n-Melee weapons break WAY too easy, and not logically. A wooden bat should break pretty quickly if you spend your day bashing zombie skulls, but it lasts longer than most things. A knife really shouldn't be able to break in ONE fight with a thug, but it does. You'll find yourself kicking zombies to death most of the time once you get through the beginning of the game because kicking is free, weapons are expensive.\n-Ranged weapons are mostly useless against zombies.","September 30, 2014","true","42.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Besides killing zombies, you get to pick your character which specialises in the different weapons that are prevalent throughout the game.\n\nThe field of view was very narrow at first, resulting in a very fast headache for me.  After my SO modded it for me (from 65 to 90), the field of view became very enjoyable as the headache disappeared, although arms do appear like gorillas. There are also techniques to 'sabo' your friends, by luring them to a corner with a suicider lurking around, or baiting a Ram to rush towards them :)\n\nOverall, a very fun game to play with your SO if you pick a ranged character (Purna/Logan) as you can have many tricks, like enjoying the show as your friends are fighting mobs. (Characters will have a blue outline while in rage mode, and Xian Mei moves like a girl high on drugs.) If your friends picked a melee character and get killed in the end, just stand at the back, activate your rage and spam your trigger finger as fast as possible. Afterwards, laugh manically as you stand over their characters and pressing "F" to use a medkit on them at the last second while surrounded by dead zombies.","October 5, 2015","true","58.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The trailers looked amazing.\nI never buy games at full price. And when I saw this game on sale, I jumped on it. I was extatic that I'd be able to finally play this game. I only wish I had read the reviews beforehand.\n\n<Summary>\npros:\nopen world\namazing trailer\n\ncons:\nopen world\nno real story\nrepetitive\ndriving is awful\nclass specialty and specifications are pretty useless\nmultiplayer is awful (oten disconnects)\n\n<Detailed Review>\nThis game reminded me of Red Faciton Guerilla.\n\nThey tried to allow lots of freedom to the player by creating an open world.\nHowever, they seemed to have forgotten the story.\nYou get a glimpse of the plot here and there, but you soon forget what was happening in the first place.\n\nThe open world is combined with a mission system. You have a base of operations in which people give you missions. With this, you are to venture out into the open world and complete the said tasks. It just becomes a reptitive mess of go to home base go out and get/do something. Of course, you smash a few zombies on the way. There is nothing particulary interesting or different about what you do.\n\nThe driving system is awful in this game. You will need to drive if you're looking to venture far in some safety. Yet, the designers decided that driving was an unimportant feature and created a nightmare of a driving control/physics.\n\nWhen starting the game, you are given 4 characters with specializations. Each are strong at projectile/throwing, guns, sharp objects/something that cuts, or blunt/bashing weapons.\nThe problem here, is that only one is even remotely useful. The blunt/bashing weapons is what any sane person should pick.\nReasoning:\n\nprojectile/throwing (I chose this guy...oops) - Your are given a limited number of slots for weapons to carry. Any object can be thrown as a projecticle. This is great! However, only some objects do any noticeable damage as a projectile. When you throw something, it either lodges into the zombie or falls down. You must retrive it to use it again. There is a perk to increase the chance of items bouncing back at you to catch. So....projectiles like knives stack right? Absolutely not, everything is in its own slot. Recap: limited weapons, some don't do much damage, you have to retrieve in a fight, projectiles don't stack.\n\nGuns - You don't get any gun until you progress a decent amount. And when you do, you have such limited ammo quantity so you want to use it sparingly. Why on earth would I want someone who specializes in guns?\n\nsharp object - Most sharp objects you get are small knives or cleavers. They have a rather short range and would just be better off thrown at a zombie.\n\nWinner: blunt weapons! Most items you find are blunt weapons. The smart choice is to pick this guy.\n\nThis just makes me wonder why the game even offers the 3 other specializations if there is a clear choice in who is superior. Unfortunately, you don't find this flaw out until you've played for your first time.\n\nAll in all, this was an overly hyped game that flopped completely.","June 2, 2014","false","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You should play Dead Island.\n\nWhere it's good? The actual combat is really solid, a lot of games with first-person(and hell, even third-person) melee combat make it hard to gauge weapon reach and often make the combat feel like it has no weight, Dead Island largely avoids these issues, making the combat mostly fun. In general, the mechanical part of the game is beyond reproach(except for that one character who doesn't get any of the weapons she's specialized in until halfway through the second chapter of the game, kind of a misstep, that one, and the fact that the boss battles tend to be over quickly and anti-climactically).\n\nWhere it's so bad it's good? Everything related to the storytelling and voice-acting. Do not play this game alone, play it with a friend, play it with two friends, hell, play it with three, point and laugh at every stupid thing they say and do.\n\nIf you don't have a friend to play it with?

But even without it, sounds, immersion and its peculiar gameplay - the gore and killing more exactly - are top notch.\n\nI've played many games and once I do I usualy uninstall. I never uninstalled dead island. That is how good it is, no matter what many say, bugs? maybe, bad story... sure why not. Its a damn good game, and I'am looking forward to Riptide!","September 17, 2015","true","82.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Dead Island is a fun game that is definitely worth playing. I'll list the pros and cons below.\n\nPros:\n-The graphics are great, even years later in 2014.\n-The combat is fun and interactive, you can feel the results of every action you put into a fight. You can even run for your life and still feel immersed as hell and have so much fun.\n-Awesome wide-spanned crafting system that allows for a ton of fun and even funny ways to create weapons.\n-The questline is funny yet intriguing at the same time. The story is very well-crafted and has many ways to surprise you, made even better by the use of the Ryder White DLC which builds upon the story.\n-Drop in/Drop out coop system makes for an easy-to-use multiplayer experience. And this game is extremely fun when played with friends. Zombies can scale to your level making it fairplay to go back to the beginning with a high-level character to help a friend. You still get an on-par experience.\n-Mixed gameplay elements. You get to melee fight with zombies one minute and then two minutes later pull out your gun and engage\n-Glitches. Yes I put this under pros. When you spin around on a toilet and end up on the fax machine, you'll understand.\n\nCons:\n-The economy makes no sense. Money values are all messed up and there is no consistency.\n-It's a console port, so the rendering distance for objects and terrain can be laughable at points. (IE i was in a house and the cups on the table only spawned when I got within one yard of them)\n-Melee weapons break WAY too easy, and not logically. A wooden bat should break pretty quickly if you spend your day bashing zombie skulls, but it lasts longer than most things. A knife really shouldn't be able to break in ONE fight with a thug, but it does. You'll find yourself kicking zombies to death most of the time once you get through the beginning of the game because kicking is free, weapons are expensive.\n-Ranged weapons are mostly useless against zombies.","September 30, 2014","true","42.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First of all, let's not set it in the US, but on an island, curiously populated by people who speak in accents which sound like an uneasy mix of Australian, New Zealander and South African.  Secondly, let's place the emphasis on melee weapons rather than guns, and actually make the guns kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the most part.  And let's more or less rip off just about all of the "special infected" of that famous Valve game, but give them different names and even mix a few of them together, like splicing the fatness of the Boomer with the regurgitation of the Spitter.  Oh, and add more "RPG" elements, like character customisation of skills and open-worldiness and all that cool kinda ♥♥♥♥.  Presto!  Rival game.\n\nIn all fairness, though - and despite being not-quite-as-good as the game it so blatantly pays "homage" to - Dead Island is pretty darned good.  Maybe a bit long and repetitive, and glitch-ridden as a mofo, but overall, it probably couldn't have been much better.  Unless Valve made it (which would probably mean a current 2020 release date, so small mercies and all that jazz).  Oh, and the hilarious lead character animation (especially jumping, and carrying explosive barrels like they've ♥♥♥♥ themselves) is almost worth the price of purchase alone.\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","June 19, 2013","true","102.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","2"

For me, it's even better than Left 4 Dead. Amazing melee combat with zombies, occasional gunfire with human enemies create an intense atmosphere of survival horror. I think that this game has a really well balanced difficulty. Surely you will die sometimes, but not too often depending on your skills. Lots of different guns, collectable items, modifications for your weapons. Graphics are beautiful, the environment looks detailed. Gameplay is really great, it sucks you in and keeps you for hours! Every single enemy is a challenging obstacle and you have to tackle them seriously.

It's a fun game that allows for much replay ability and hours of exploration. Even the single-player is fun, but I'd prefer the co-op. So many quest and so many weapons, it's hard to not want to do and find them all. A major plus is that you can upgrade and customize your weapons so you can have an arsenal of destruction. There is a vast number of blueprints to find along with other hidden treasures. The game is great, bottom line.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/91310/","pointnclickster","Pointnclickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/","315 products in account","Once upon a time there were good zombie games. Resident Evil made sure that zombie games were in the mainstream. As the years went by, the zombie genre was beginning to grow stale. There wasn't a lot of new material and zombie games were usually just co-op. Then along came Dead Island, which breathed new life into the genre....\nThis is how I feel. I know Left 4 Dead had been out before this, but that was a multiplayer game. Now back to Dead Island. Dead Island has great multiplayer, but it aims to be an action RPG, as far as I know, a first in the zombie genre.\nFirst, the negative aspects of the game. This game is a glorified fetch quest. As you make your way through the island trying to survive and help others and escape said zombie infested island, people will constantly be sending you to do stuff and bring stuff back in order to get any further. When you are playing this solo it gets pretty monotonous. As you go and fetch stuff, you get to kill your way through your fetch quest. That to me, is really the only negative. Also, I don't find most of the playable characters really likable. My favorite is Xian Me, a spy who has a sense of justice. The other three are selfish and only looking out for themselves. Those were my only big gripes.\nI saved the positives for last, because there are many. The game is gorgeous to look at. Everything is well detailed. As gorgeous as the island is, that is how gruesome the zombies are. It makes for an interesting clash, as this island paradise is turned into a living hell. The weapon system is a lot of fun, since you get to repair and modify your weapons. There are also shinies! You can look for audio logs and mods to assist you in fighting or in learning more about the story. This is a fun game for multiplayer. When you play it with others, it doesn't have the monotony of playing single player. While I don't particularly care for most of the characters, they have very interesting skill sets, challenging you to not always go around with guns blazing. There is also the RPG aspect. Each character has three skill trees that they use. You can focus on causing damage, being stealthy, or being healthy (medkits heal more etc). Whats really great is that once you beat the game, your character and everything he/she has learned will transfer to Dead Island: Riptide.\nWhile this game can feel monotonous, especially for the single player, the pros really outway the cons. Dead Island really helped the zombie genre and it is definitely worth the playthrough. Get some friends together and have some fun with this one!","February 9, 2015","true","94.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game takes located in one of the four characters that differ in characteristics and the nature of their favorite types of weapons. The game is set on some island where near Papua, New Guinea. We will visit the amazing variety locations such as tourist resort, town or rather slums that are overrun by bandits and jungle in which you will encounter with smugglers and scientists in research complex. In the game you will find different types of weapons such as crushing, slashing, tossed and combustible which is separated into different rarity (white, green, blue, purple and orange). In addition, these weapons can be modified in different ways after the blueprint we've found. In the game, different types of enemies occur, apart from the usual zombies will be mutated creatures which are more challenging. The main storyline is good but the side missions can be boring. The graphics are good although they can sometimes occur graphical bugs. The music is quite pretty. Animations our heroes they look strange, very strange. The game offers us also quite pleasant cooperation mode where at any moment we can attach to one's game. To summarize the game is pretty decent offering fun with your friends in the coop but also plays himself is not so bad.

The initially satisfying melee combat becomes tedious and boring within a few hours due to its lack of complexity, and while I see how they were trying to make fighting zombies a taxing endeavor, it just ultimately adds to the monotonous nature of the game and becomes its most prominent flaw. The RPG elements are extremely shallow, and don't add much needed nuances to combat; every fight ends up being a overly long swing-fest. There aren't enough enemy types to keep the combat fresh, and you don't gain enough abilities from the level up system to feel like you are actually becoming stronger.\n\nEvery other aspect of the game, including the physics, user interface, visuals, sound and writing are so pathetic that its actually humorous. It's very common to see ragdolls working improperly, the vehicles getting stuck on nothing; it took no effort on my part to actually get a chair to levitate. The pause menu is atrocious, and a chore to navigate, which makes leveling up, managing your inventory and upgrading various items and weapons agonizing. In the visual department, the render distance is probably the biggest issue, where objects will appear as close as 10 feet away while driving, and emerge from an uncomfortably close wall of fog. The animations are assanine, nonsensical, some of the worst animations I've seen in years. The textures and skybox both break quite often. Dead Island lacks a memorable score, and has some of the worst voice acting I've heard from modern video games. The story is indescribably bad, which wouldn't really matter if the game didn't sell itself as a dramatic zombie apocalypse story, which is a tired concept that has been milked to death, and most of the time has been executed poorly.\n\nThis game isn't worth 5 dollars, I wouldn't say its worth 3 dollars. Please don't buy this game. If you have any sort of standards in games, or at the very least in what you pay for, don't give the horrible developers of this piece of garbage game your money.","December 1, 2013","false","15.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

From an open, paradisiacal beach, to a cramped, grungy city. The visuals in the game are well put together, and the animations are for the more part fluid. Not to mention a touch of excessive gore (which is fine in my book, we're dealing with zombies here).    Gameplay  7.5  At times Dead Island can feel like a bit of a grind, almost MMO like, with the nature of the quests ("go fetch these parts/get these supplies"). However, Dead Island throws in just enough diversity in the quests to keep you from getting bored. Combat is certainly unique for a zombie game, and fairly well executed. It takes a little bit to get into the combat mindset for the game, but as you progress and unlock new skills your zombie killing ability becomes rather varied and quite entertaining. The voice acting is sub-par. The crafting system is a welcome touch, and the game has a very overall RPG/FPS feel.    Story  5  A pretty much run of the mill zombie story. Zombie outbreak. Survive. That's about the gist of it.    Multiplayer  9  Certainly best enjoyed with friends, Dead Island is a blast to play with your buddies. Laugh as your characters are tossed around like ragdolls by stronger zombies, scream for help as you're rushed by an unexpected horde. With four characters to choose from, each with a unique weapon specialization, you can trade loot and work together to make the best darn zombie extermination squad there is.  A wonderful addition to any gamer's co-operative game library. Be aware though, you need to be at the same part of the story if you want to play together and all get experience for doing a quest.    Replayability  7.5  While some zombie games tend to enthrall you once, Dead Island does a pretty good job of giving you more to come back for, if not only because the zombie killing is so satisfying. Chop off heads, chop off arms, chop off legs, curb-stomp, tackle, you get the idea. With dozens of ways to kill a zombie, there's plenty of reason to enjoy this game over and over with friends.     Overall  7.8/10  There are plenty of laughs and good times to be had here. I hesitated to get Dead Island for a long time, but once I finally picked it up and played it with a friend I had no regrets on buying it. If you enjoy co-operative gaming, or a solid zombie game, don't miss out on Dead Island. It also goes on sale fairly often, so that's nice too!\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games, here:  The Tipster","November 10, 2014","true","8.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

Personally, when I play this, I feel like I'm forcing myself to look for the positive aspects to try and find a reason to keep playing.\n\nI never gave this game too much attention when it was first released, but recently I've been feeling short of things to play and it was recommended to me by a friend, who called it quite similar to a few games that I do like. I'll start by saying the game looks alright on high settings, and I've noticed a couple of neat features like fairly realistic weapon degrading rates with visible damages on the weapon, and the door barging system. However, the game feels probably the most watered down a game has ever felt to me - loot respawns every time you load up your save, you can't repair weapons with similar or identical ones and instead you have to pay to repair them at a workbench, it seems new weapons are set to auto equip if the level requirement for it is higher even if it's a weapon which isn't as effective as your current weapon for your character, and forced lock on messes up what would otherwise be decent melee combat. The worst part is that none of these annoying features can be changed or disabled. The inventory screen also functions quite poorly, and the shadow of your character looks absolutely ridiculous in every sense of the word - I'm astonished that this last issue hasn't been patched as it's completely laughable.\n\nOverall, for me this game is disappointing considering how good it's made it out to be. If you're looking for a game which is immersive and realistic or exciting and rewarding, I strongly advise you to look elsewhere.","May 3, 2015","false","1.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

Take on a harrowing quest to find your lost wife. Enter into the dark world of a devastated tropical paradise now plunged into chaos. It's a place where the word "dead" has an entirely new meaning. Face the nightmare and fight for survival. Explore the secrets hidden in the darkest regions of the island and fight your way through. Survival is your main goal! Dead Island is a non-linear FPP (First Person Perspective) survival horror title. The ultra-realistic combat system will ensure that every confrontation is a thrilling experience. Use anything you find in your surroundings as a weapon. Make decisions that influence the entire world around you. Take advantage of opponent behavior and game physics. Dead Island is a mix of intense action and chilling horror environments in an engaging, strikingly realistic story.\n\n'Dead Island is maybe rough around the edges, has things that could have been better and has some strange solutions to gaming mechanics, but really, who cares? The main thing, close combat with zombies on an open environment, is both exceptionally well done and most importantly, great fun. Even alone. In the land of blindingly pretty, but simplified tubeshooters the ugly zombie game is the king.'\n\n'Ultimately, this isn't just a great zombie game. It's a great open-world game, a great action game, a great RPG, and a great co-operative multiplayer game. Being a masterpiece with a unique appreciation for zombies is just gravy.'\n\n'Dead Island has plenty of reasons to be likeable: a satisfying duration, enough freedom and interactivity to create addiction and enough potential to become a classic. And although it isn't what the elitists would call a mandatory title, I think it's infectious enough for me to pull my friend's sleeve to buy the game too.'\n\n'If you think you'd like killing a LOT of zombies in huge and varied open-world environments, finding boat-loads of randomized loot, customizing your character and weapons RPG-style, or all of the above, you will love Dead Island. Bring some friends along for the ride and you virtually cannot go wrong.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperMSK/recommended/91310/","ViperMSK","Rainbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperMSK/","218 products in account","A couple flying to the vacation of their dreams is torn apart by a violent plane crash. Take on a harrowing quest to find your lost wife. Enter into the dark world of a devastated tropical paradise now plunged into chaos. It's a place where the word "dead" has an entirely new meaning. Face the nightmare and fight for survival. Explore the secrets hidden in the darkest regions of the island and fight your way through. Survival is your main goal! Dead Island is a non-linear FPP (First Person Perspective) survival horror title. The ultra-realistic combat system will ensure that every confrontation is a thrilling experience. Use anything you find in your surroundings as a weapon. Make decisions that influence the entire world around you. Take advantage of opponent behavior and game physics. Dead Island is a mix of intense action and chilling horror environments in an engaging, strikingly realistic story.\n\n'Dead Island is maybe rough around the edges, has things that could have been better and has some strange solutions to gaming mechanics, but really, who cares? The main thing, close combat with zombies on an open environment, is both exceptionally well done and most importantly, great fun. Even alone. In the land of blindingly pretty, but simplified tubeshooters the ugly zombie game is the king.'\n\n'Ultimately, this isn't just a great zombie game. It's a great open-world game, a great action game, a great RPG, and a great co-operative multiplayer game. Being a masterpiece with a unique appreciation for zombies is just gravy.'\n\n'Dead Island has plenty of reasons to be likeable: a satisfying duration, enough freedom and interactivity to create addiction and enough potential to become a classic. And although it isn't what the elitists would call a mandatory title, I think it's infectious enough for me to pull my friend's sleeve to buy the game too.'\n\n'If you think you'd like killing a LOT of zombies in huge and varied open-world environments, finding boat-loads of randomized loot, customizing your character and weapons RPG-style, or all of the above, you will love Dead Island. Bring some friends along for the ride and you virtually cannot go wrong. Just don't expect much in terms of story or quest depth, and be sure to mod the game just the way you like it.'","July 12, 2014","true","57.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The trouble that I found with the game (apart from the bug where it deletes your save game without asking you) was five-fold.\n\n1) There really wasn't much point in levelling up - the zombies (or sick people, whatever) level up too. Levelling up just makes your pride 'n' joy Cutty-Stabber 3000 that you made with batteries and duct tape and the hairs from a unicorn's backside useless after you've levelled up a bit. Meaning that you have to make the weapon again. Making the whole thing a bit repetitive.\n2) The entire game is best summed up in fetch and carry terms - go here, get this, come back, go to the house NEXT DOOR TO WHERE YOU JUST WENT, get another thing, come back... rinse, repeat. It's circular and boring.\n3) Unless you have lots of bullets, or you unleashed your inner Viking and went for the throwy character, prepare to get knocked over a lot and to die a lot. You go down so easily the zombies could strangle you with a cordless phone. (As Pablo Francisco might say if he played the game.) Dying means that...\n4)... You could well lose your precious stuff, and, after searching for it like a demented Hobbit, you'll discover to your shock that it really is gone. Time to start saying the Northman prayer from The 13th Warrior as you rock back and forth. With the loss of your Cutty-Stabber 3000, it'll be a small matter (apologies to those who unaccountably haven't seen The 13th Warrior).\n5) If you do happen to choose the throwy character, prepare to have the game forget your weapons. Yep. Sometimes, they just disappear. Like a one night stand at dawn. You're left with nothing but memories now, and, more pressingly, fewer weapons than you had a second ago.\n\nIn spite of all of that though, the game is still great and it's still worth playing. I would recommend it to anybody that likes beating up on zombies wearing holiday gear - just watch out for those beach balls!\n","February 20, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/recommended/91310/","c00lizz","c00lizz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/","2086 products in account","Dead Island is a game that aimed to capitalize on the recent zombie game craze and while it does attempt to do so a little outside the usual genres it quickly begins to feel very familiar.\n\nDead Island starts you off in your hotel room a small tropical island after one hell of a night. You quickly discover that a zombie plague has swept the island overnight and you must now do what it takes to survive with only a mysterious voice on the radio to guide you.\n\nDead Island is a zombie hack and slash much in the same way as Dead Rising. You find various weapons and items that can be used as weapons and go beat the nearest zombie with it, as you progress you will also find blueprints for combining and improving your weapons. The combat feels very meaty and there is a good deal of satisfaction in hitting a zombie just right, taking off an arm or a leg. Unfortunately this does not scale with the progression very well and once you start to get into the high levels combat becomes increasingly frustrating and predictable.\n\nThe storyline takes you across several large, but not equally populated with content, maps where the mysterious voice guides you towards both escaping the island and finding a cure. Along the way you encounter other survivors that will trade with you and send you on various side-quests.\n\nThis leads to what is perhaps the biggest weak point of Dead Island, the characters. The storyline is not bad by itself, it certainly isn't great either but it's good enough that it won't bother you too much. The characters however are some of the most poorly written ones I have ever encountered in a video game. Although quite a few of them are simply blank slates that exist solely to send you on missions a number of them try to connect with you and it just fails horribly. This is most notably when you get a bit into the game and are starting to get ready to leave the first map when the game introduces a new unplayable sidekick to you and from there on in, every time there is a cut scene or a bit of storyline the game will attempt to make you form an emotional connection with this girl. And it just doesn't work because she is just as big of a blank slate as the rest of the characters. In the end it only serves to make you resent the storyline and to quickly skip past any dialog for fear of vomiting.\n\nDead Island is at it's core a multi-player game. Although it can be played, and completed, single-player the game is setup with a drop-in/drop-out system of multi-player where you can at any time go play with someone of similar progression or have someone come into your game to help you. Although the coop is nice the poorly implemented group questing system as well as the frequent timeouts keep it from being as enjoyable as it should be.\n\nThe graphics has it's ups and downs. While the backgrounds of the scenic tropical resort are gorgeous and the game in general manages to pull off the tropical island look quite well, even in the less tropical parts of the game, the rest just isn't up to spec. The characters, the weapons, the buildings just all seem like they were taken out a game several years old and it hurts what little immersion the storyline didn't manage to kill already.\n\nAll in all, Dead Island is a game that's quite fun for the first 20 levels or so if you can manage to look past the extremely unlikeable characters but whats good about the game tends to disappear towards the endgame and it becomes just another grind towards completion.","January 1, 2013","true","241.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

The trouble that I found with the game (apart from the bug where it deletes your save game without asking you) was five-fold.\n\n1) There really wasn't much point in levelling up - the zombies (or sick people, whatever) level up too. Levelling up just makes your pride 'n' joy Cutty-Stabber 3000 that you made with batteries and duct tape and the hairs from a unicorn's backside useless after you've levelled up a bit. Meaning that you have to make the weapon again. Making the whole thing a bit repetitive.\n2) The entire game is best summed up in fetch and carry terms - go here, get this, come back, go to the house NEXT DOOR TO WHERE YOU JUST WENT, get another thing, come back... rinse, repeat. It's circular and boring.\n3) Unless you have lots of bullets, or you unleashed your inner Viking and went for the throwy character, prepare to get knocked over a lot and to die a lot. You go down so easily the zombies could strangle you with a cordless phone. (As Pablo Francisco might say if he played the game.) Dying means that...\n4)... You could well lose your precious stuff, and, after searching for it like a demented Hobbit, you'll discover to your shock that it really is gone. Time to start saying the Northman prayer from The 13th Warrior as you rock back and forth. With the loss of your Cutty-Stabber 3000, it'll be a small matter (apologies to those who unaccountably haven't seen The 13th Warrior).\n5) If you do happen to choose the throwy character, prepare to have the game forget your weapons. Yep. Sometimes, they just disappear. Like a one night stand at dawn. You're left with nothing but memories now, and, more pressingly, fewer weapons than you had a second ago.\n\nIn spite of all of that though, the game is still great and it's still worth playing. I would recommend it to anybody that likes beating up on zombies wearing holiday gear - just watch out for those beach balls!\n","February 20, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Awesome for getting out daily aggression by jump-kicking them head over heels and then bashing or stomping their squishy heads while they lay stunned on the ground.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is fantastic, with a great combo of tropical vibrancy combined with creepy, dim places where zombies can creep up on you and scare the living crap out of you.\n\nThe controls seem a bit wonky at first, with a bit of a delay on character movement, but to me that makes it feel a bit more realistic than most FPS games do. You can't just strafe back and forth smoothly, changing direction on a dime in real life, after all!\n\nA lot of peoples' complaints are about weapon deterioration and how much they hate it, but I think it's a great game mechanic, forcing you to think before you just wade into a pack of zombies swinging your nice, shiny machete. It adds tension to each encounter, instead of just letting you mindlessly hack your way through the game with zero consequence. Sure, it may not be realistic in terms of how quickly the weapons break down, but that's not really the point of the mechanic. Plus, let's face it, the zombies aren't exactly realistic either, now are they? Seeing as how zombies don't actually exist and all... Seems a bit arbitrary to find fault with one unrealistic thing, but not another.\n\nAnyway, this game is amazing and highly replayable, with a great storyline and enough zombie-killing fun to make even the obnoxious back-and-forth side quests entertaining to do. If you don't own it yet, you're doing yourself a disservice and should really get on it. Especially if you have friends that you game with. 4 player co-op y'all!!!","March 15, 2015","true","107.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So get ready....\n\nDead Island, a game released in late 2011. This game is one of the better zombie survival games with great textures and graphics especially for its time. I'll say this now, the graphics are like Far Cry 4's graphics (kind of). Anywho, what made this game actually a good zombie survival is the multiplayer feature. Because of this multiplayable feature more people got it to play with their friends. Now to get to the actual part of the review.\n\nThis game has a great campaign but what really makes it good is if you have friends to play campaign with you. I guess its kinda bad that your campaign doesn't get updated or progress if your playing on another person's campaign but I guess its okay.  This could really do well if it didn't crash so often. That was one of the downers of the game and still hasn't been fixed yet.\n\nAlso the mods or DLC you can get with this game is amazing! All the blueprints you can make and use against zombies are just so satisfying and one thing this game has is BASIC GAME LOGIC! Anyway i'm just gonna end the review here.\n\n9/10 Ducks","February 23, 2015","true","48.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The physix also adds a lot to the overall gameplay and feeling.\n\nThe world is huge and you will have the chance to explore every corner and do a lot of main and side quests while facing different enemy types.\n\nUnfortunately there are a couple of downsides.\n\nFirst downside is the feeling. Although the game looks great and the atmosphere is cool, it's not something you would expect from a survival game. It's all too cheerful and colored. It make sense since you're on a tropical island but not when you start thinking this is a post apocalyptic game. Sure, when you go indoor, everything changes and it all gets creepy very fast but you are not spending too much time indoors.\n\nSecond downside is the biggest issue. It's good that the game has a huge world but unfortunately it's way too repetitive. It's easier to play with someone but this doesn't change anything.\n\nBoth issues would have been partially solved if you would have been given the opportunity to spend more time indoors and less outdoors.\n\nI really enjoyed the game but I was unable to play for long because of these.\n\n8/10 potatoes from me.","October 17, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The weapon mods and character specialities help give you a bit of variety. Although you don't find guns until about halfway through the game so good luck starting with that guy. I simply call it average because it doesn't offer anything interesting to the zombie outbreak genre. The story is very mediocre and pulls all the cliches, including a nonsensical climax that'd make Umbrella envious. And yes, there is a sewer level. There's always a sewer level. Also it felt like the game hinges on it's co-op to help distract from the (lack of) story pacing and endless fetch quests. Which it did exceptionally well when I was playing with others.\n\nIf you have a group of friends that like to mess around; you'll probably enjoy this game.\n\nIf you want an engaging Walking Dead drama; the cake trailor is a lie.","May 29, 2014","true","47.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The quests are very plain and tedious early on, and the environments arnt much to talk about.  The quest givers and friendly AI characters you meet on your journey ruined this game, the voice acting and movement is terrable.  This games okay to play but if your not obssessed with zombies then you won't play it for long, shame cause this game had so much hype especially after that epic emotional trailer.","June 24, 2012","true","27.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Half of them are hack 'n slash type of games, you just kill them and kill them and... just no sense. Another half is surviving with few ammo in a wasteland, ehh.\n\nDead Island is different, it has a point and a good story. It clearly shows the point what is going on and where you have to go and it's AWESOME adventure. It's one of a kind; adventure + zombies. That's maybe why I like it so much. I see no point to go to play Riptide or any newer first, because this game works absolutely fine.\n-     And this game has perfect amount of challenge. You can choose your difficulty to automatic which generates the enemies based off your success rate. Money is limited, but not too limited, it's perfect. Altough, I found a glitch with my friend that you can give some certain weapons to your friend and it duplicates. But who said you have to use it, eh.\n\nAnd the main point for being one of my favorite games: Co-op campaign. Like, seriously. Who wouldn't want to play HL2 as a coop, for example. Yes, there are mods for them, but they are not automatically part of the game and they are buggy. Dead Island has it inside of it, and it even supports 4 players without problems! And like I did; I firstly completed it   1/3, and then my friend got the game and I played it to the same point. Also I moved my items on this point from my another character to the character I played with my friend. And it was equally fun at both times.

While the game doesn't contain the kind of emotional content depicted in that trailer, Dead Island is definitely no pushover.\nThe game is set on a tropical island called Banoi, where you can choose to play as one of four survivors, all with their different strengths and abilities. Each class is catered to a specific weapon type, so the player is rewarded for using their playing style. You can sprint, kick, and bash zombies whilst running through abandoned resorts, defunct hotels and bloodied swimming pools.  I liked the location and the silly/humorous approach to a zombie game.\nThe trailer made players expect an emotionally rich game with focus on characters. While I did like this game, there is little to no story, and the characters are little more than cardboard cutouts for different abilities. The game plays out like Dead Rising, and the silly yet gratuitous gore is nothing like what you'd expect from the trailer.\nSpeaking of Dead Rising, the game allows you to craft all kinds of weapons; spiked baseball bats, flaming axes, electric knives, electric fisti-cuffs, enhanced assault rifles and much more. There are loads of weapons to make using the game's crafting system, and it was really enjoyable to make/buy new weapons and test them on the zombie horde. There are also different types of zombies to fight, all of which require different tactics and weapons to defeat.\nThe island itself is fairly large, and quests range from tasks such as collecting supplies, wiping out zombies and rescuing survivors. The XP system and rewards bonuses gives the player incentives  to complete missions, and you'll also end up finding a fair emount of loot on missions. The best way to describe this game is Borderlands with zombies.\nThe game is quite solid and is okay visually, but there are fair amount of bugs, especially with AI and quest markers. I've encountered zombies that completely ignore the player or even get stuck in terrain. Quest markers are also quite dodgy, meaning you'll end up going the wrong way and missing your objective completely.\nOverall, Dead Island is a solid and enjoyable title. It provides similar action RPG fun reminiscent of Borderlands, but could be improved with a great story/characters as well as additional work on bugs and glitches. This is definitely worth a playthrough either by yourself, or with a few friends via the great co-op mode. 7.5 / 10","July 31, 2014","true","42.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I enjoyed playing this in Co-op AND in SP, the game itself isn't too expensive for the variety of enemies and weapons it offers. Combat in the game is very cleverly designed to make killing a simple "walker" fun on its own, there were so many times in the game where I wanted to drop my upgraded melee weapon and pick up a hat stand and just throw it! Story mode could have been more interesting...What I didn't like about the game was that I didn't see much of character building, the concept of the storyline on how the 4 brave survivors ended up on the island was interesting, but in the end it didn't matter! I also noticed shortly after starting up Co-op that each character had it's own abilities and upgradeable skills. Another option in the game that I used often was to stay and Fight the Zombies OR just Run through them! After some time the side-quests began to be repeating themselves. The entire island has a lot of areas to offer, so I didn't feel like I'm being put through a bunch of copied areas! The level system was perfect because each time I leveled up the zombies began to be more tough and harder to beat. In the end I kind of expected that if you might call it a "twist ending" which I'm not gonna spoil, so go and play the game yourself and bring your friends with you for a fun time on Dead Island! I rate this game an 8/10 because some of the cons were\n> Glitchy shadows (Act I - Act IV)\n> Dull conversations\n> Areas that you could get stuck in and would need to load the last checkpoint in (Act II - Act III)\n> Rarely Floating bamboo trees (Act III)","December 27, 2013","true","97.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

That has to be a positive right?\n+ Huge variety of weapons to use, including but not limited to: meat cleavers, baseball bats, crowbars, knives, machetes, cudgels, police batons, magnum pistols, shotguns, rifles...the list goes on.\n+ A lot of modifiable weapons, where you can add electronics to electrify enemies or set them alight with fire - that's just the tip of the iceberg!\n+ Awesome, gory, satisfying combat. You can sever the limbs of zombies or decapitate them. It's brutal and it's cool.\n+ Good storyline, I really enjoyed it.\n+ Skills system whereby you gain new abilities each time you level up. These abilities are very helpful in the game. Just some of the unlocks are increased damage output with specific weapons, increased stamina and additional benefits to fury mode (where you can go beserk and hit multiple enemies in slow motion with throwing knives or bullets from a gun, depending on your character's speciality.\n+ Nice graphics, although they could be improved as well.\n+ Co-op mode so you can play with friends or other people you don't know.\n+ 50-60 hours of gameplay (Singleplayer) for completionists who visit all locations and complete every side quest.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- My character seems to walk very slowly for no reason. There is a sprint button, but the default walking is annoying. However, as Dead Island's story progressed and I became engrossed in the gameplay, this bothered me less and less.\n- Mouse sensitivity is bad. If you change it for the gameplay, it affects the menu display. So the in-game sensitivity will be perfect, but the menu will be extremely slow. You'll regularly be checking your inventory to switch weapons or searching through your list of available quests and this sensitivity is irritating. Once again, as I ventured through the game, this problem became less noticeable and didn't bother me, but I must list it as a negative nonetheless.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\nDead Island is a thoroughly enjoyable experience, especially for zombie genre  fans. I definitely recommend it.","January 26, 2014","true","61.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You'll find the typical RPG quests here, however, the action is really what kept me going in this game.  The in your face action is intense.

With fightng the feeble authority of the establishment and offering the uncertain hope of a better future in dire times.\n\nthe narrative advantage of games is fully realised with no equal in the media. The characters are so accustomed to lost, that you se their faces fighting back actual feelings, embracing their facade come from moments as gentle as a watch.\nIt's how the gameplay perfectly integrates in design and tone, that sets the game apart and overcomes the frequent issues with Iincompetance in major releases.\n\nThe player is simmering with range that circumstances, excused by the venire of survival, defines his violent nature and snacks the player up in the moment willing or not.\n\nThe dire noxious tension, that at times envokes dark souls is only relieved by dispatching these living obstacles to the goal of making through one more moment. There's something momentarily releaving and viscerally satisfying, but then gives weight nauseating implications of the act.\n\nTechlands's awareness of the violence and it's unflincing intrusion of the player's psyche, is a necessary recalibration of the role in violence in games, that will undoubtedly be part of the ongoing debate in the media.","December 31, 2014","true","1.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","5"

Now with a new dead island on its way, im excited for it and i dont want it stuck in a development cycle. Go crazy, do what ever you want with it just dont cancel it. Only thing this game is missing is an easier modding system or steam workshop support and then this game will be perfect. (cant even get a mod without running into an ad website so probrebly wont bother there) multiplayer is amazing and worth it just for that. pick it up as soon as possible! every one i play it with agrees too.

During one sidequest you are tasked with finding some large juiceboxes to take back to your group, whom you abandon 5 minutes later. Whenever you talk to your group leader, sad music plays for no reason, which is hilarious.\n\nthe characters that you can play as are also hilariously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. all of them seem as dumb as bricks and say the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ you will hear in your life. also, everyone is a FU CKING australian. even the "jamacian" is obviously another australian who was plucked off the street who sounded sort of african.\n\nas for animation, this game is horrendous (i wouldnt be surprised if aludolu animated this entire game ecks dee!!!!). none of the characters ever make an facial expressions. there isn't much to say about it. moist of the textures in this game are low quality and feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥. the character models are terrible.\n\ngameplay: the gameplay in this game is terrible. dead island is home to the worst gunplay i have ever used in my life. it is completely unsatisfying to kill zombies, both with guns and with melee weapons. the movement in this game is terrible. driving is a nightmare, the cars never go where you want them to. just walking around in general is also annoying - you feel sluggish. the stamina bar in this game is one of the worst peices of ♥♥♥♥ you will ever encounter. it heavily limits what you can do. as for the enemies in this game, there are only about 4 different enemies. anything that isnt a walker is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to deal with, so i just run through them. it is actually so annoying to kill zombies that I would rather just run through all of them, which is both possible and more fun than actually fighting them. the weapon wheel is some of the most annoying ♥♥♥♥ you will ever deal with, and your weapons will keep changing slots whenever youy pick them up again. you can store weapons on jin, whom you encounter close to the beginning of the game and mostly never ever see, but this is really pointless. you can also repair and upgrade guns, but they just make the stats go up a bit. You can find waepon modifications for your weapons, but i found it way to annoying to have a bunch of materials stockpiled for different mods that I just eventually sold all of my misc parts and never modded a weapon, ever. this game also has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quicktime events.\n\nthe locations in this game are a complete joke. the first area you are in seems well constructed and good looking, but every other environment after that is fuc king disgusting. it was like the braindead creative department spent their entire budget jacking off to barbaric australian porn instead of thinking of unique areas. there is a ♥♥♥♥ stain city with nothing cool in it which has one color: brown.\nthe worst environment in the game is the sewers, which also happens to be home of the laziest level design in the word. it is literally just copypasted rooms and hallways. for some reason, around half of the game is probably spent in the sewers, or atleast it feels like it.\n\nthe skill trees in this game are boring and stupid. i dont really know why they are even in the game.\n\nthe menus are so FUC KING Bad. i dont know WHO the fu ckj thought it was a good idea to make ur mnouse sensitivity ingame also work with the menus, but whoever it is needs to kill himself. the menus themselves are  a reason to never play this game. the map is also terrible. the icons on it are sometimes hard to read, the GPS is usually just plain wrong, and it is hard to get the active quest to show up on your map for some reason.\n\nthe quests in this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. sometimes the main quest is literally "do side quests". what genius thought that one up, i wonder. anyways, most of the sidequests are just stupid fetch quests, so i skipped almost all of them, as I really just wanted to finish the game and have the entire experience be done with.\n\nthe sound in this game was mostly bad. im pretty sure the zombies only have around one voice line each, so you will be hearing the same fuc kjing "bleeeghe" for the entire game.\n\ndead island is not fun. there is nothing fun about this game. there is nothing interesting about this game. there is no story worth telling in this game. this game sucks my fuc king feces","September 20, 2015","false","12.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","1"

Luckily, the combat delivers.\n\nI'll make this a short and sloppy review for once.\n\nThe negatives\n\n1. The lip sync of NPCs is nonexistent.\n\n2. No DX10 or very high video settings for the PC version.\n\n3. Not entirely an open-world game, not the first Act at least. The map is shrewdly designed to give the impression that you can go anywhere. The cleverly confined coastal areas and the cleverly confined inland areas (with mountains on each side, ahem ahem Red Faction Guerrilla, ahem ahem, Far Cry 2, ahem ahem Lost Planet 2....) prevent you from going where ever you want. However there are large areas that can be traversed in almost any direction. Also, when you venture too far out it says "You are leaving the playable area" which gives you several seconds to get back before you die, for whatever reason. You also cannot swim so when you go into the deep water you just start walking on the bottom without being able to see anything, chances are, you will die from going too far out instead of dying from drowning.\n\n4. The zombies do not have to die from the blows or trauma to the head. You can just beat them to their second permanent death.\n\n5. The enemy and friendly NPC's are not that numerous.\n\n6. The only dramatic moment in the game is when that family gets slaughtered...in that trailer...for the game.\n\n7. You cannot turn off the cross-hair, so if you plan on playing in 3D that cross-hair will mess up your 3D effect.\n\n8. No save feature. You can't always re-enter the game if you press alt-tab. This will cause you to end the game through the task manager and start from the last checkpoint.\n\n9. The enemy bodies disappear within a minute or so when you turn around.\n\n10. The stamina bar does not pop into the middle of the screen all the time and stay there for a protracted period of time. Just put it on the side.\n\nThe positives:\n\n1. You cast a shadow, you can see your legs and you have a personality. (THANK YOU)\n\n2. The AI. This is one time when no one can complain about the crappy AI. The zombie AI is doing exactly what it is supposed to doing, being zombie. Plus there are some zombies with different social behavior. Some remain dormant only to wake up when you are next to them, some charge, some are hard to kill and some jump at you when you open a door. I wish there were some zombies that were peaceful though, just for fun.\n\n3. Great battle system, reminiscent of The Dark Messiah. You get to kick and you get to slash. Not sure if parrying or blocking the attacks is going to be available for upgrade later. However, you cannot hack and slash all the time, because your stamina runs out. And even though the stamina runs out pretty slowly sometimes you have to time your hits. Greater incentive is also given towards aiming for the head since your weapons will deteriorate with each wasted blow. The auto-aim will do the job for you though. At first I felt insulted that yet another console driven game was shoving auto-aim in my face but I got used to it. Not only that, the auto-aim is enabled even when you stand above a dead zombie. You can still hack their particular body parts to pieces.\n\n4. For the maximum immersion, you can turn off the enemy health pop ups, experience points pop ups, the auto-aim as well as the enemy level indicator.\n\n5. The motion blur is always welcome.\n\n6. Plenty of upgrades for your character your weapons and other miscellaneous things. Unlike in Borderlands, you CAN take on some enemies above your level and manage to kill them.\n\n7. Plenty of scavenging is involved, sometimes you get to find rare items that cost a lot of $.\n\n8. The driving of the rare few vehicles is smooth.\n\n9. Some decent use of environments.\n\n10. The cover system reminiscent of the Killzone franchise is very lovable and realistic.\n\n11. Co-op is fun as advertised.\n\nOn another note, it turns out that the best non-modded melee weapon so far is the cleaver. One slash and the head comes off. What I also liked is that every kill feels like you are actually killing someone or something, unlike in Left4Dead where the simple mowing down of hundreds of zombies in the matter of minutes stays fun but quickly turns generic\n\nThe bottom line is that the game itself does not really play as a survival horror game but as an arcade beat'em up with some new elements. Take that for what it is worth.\n\nThat is all.\n\nUpdated. 9-9-11.\n\nI found myself enjoying the game more by playing alone rather than co-op. Your co-op buddies tend to either lag behind or run too far out ahead. I prefer playing alone at night with the headset on, the immersion and tension is thus amplified.\n","November 27, 2013","true","35.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jojocscs/recommended/91310/","jojocscs","Jelour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jojocscs/","222 products in account","Dead Island is a 2011 action role-playing survival horror video game developed by Polish developer Techland and published by German studio Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is centered on the challenge of surviving a zombie-infested open world island with a major emphasis on melee combat. It was originally announced at E3 2006 but was pushed back to 2011. It was released on 6 September 2011 in North America, 9 September 2011 in the PAL regions and 20 October 2011 in Japan. A stand-alone expansion, Dead Island: Riptide, was released in 2013. A spin-off, Escape Dead Island, was released on 18 November 2014. A sequel, Dead Island 2, is set to be released in 2016.\n\nDead Island features an apparent open world roaming, divided by relatively large areas, and played from a first-person perspective. Most of the gameplay is built around combat and completing quests. Dead Island is an action role-playing game and uses experience-based gameplay. The player earns XP by completing tasks and killing enemies. Upon leveling up, the player gains health and stamina, and can invest one skill point into a skill tree and level up one of their skills.\n\nCombat is carried out through either physical attacks or through the use of melee weapons and firearms. Melee weapons are emphasized[8] to the point that firearms are not available for the first quarter of the game, and consist of blunt and bladed weapons. Melee weapons can also be thrown at targets at any point in the game. Weapons are randomly generated and positioned in predetermined locations as well as found on some enemies; they have unique stats which are generally based on the player's current level. Each weapon can be upgraded three times to increase its stats, and most weapons can be "modded" - customized based on a blueprint to add special features, such as nails or electrified blades, and poison.[8] These weapons will wear out from constant usage and require repairs and careful use.\n\nThere is also a stamina bar, meaning that after a set amount of physical action, such as running, jumping, or swinging a weapon, the character needs to stop to regain his or her stamina bar, meaning that having a fight with a high level zombie will result in you often running out of stamina and getting killed. The game features "special class" zombies, which are more powerful than the standard zombie. Players need to use flashlights in dark areas and during night-time sections, adding suspense.\n\nZombies in the game have different abilities, such as the Walkers being Romero style zombies and the Infected being 28 Days Later style running zombies. There are also other special zombies being Left 4 Dead style.\n\nRate: 11/10","June 23, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is very likely that you will love the game world and want to explore it from the first moment you are able to do so, hoping to find adventure and recover epic gear to increase your characters zombie disposing potential and while you will be able to do so, you are most likely to end up disappointed with what you got compared to with what you would expect from such a big game.\n\nLong story short; I have played this game for 30h and in that time I have done the following:\n- Killed zombies with knives\n- Killed zombies with machetes\n- Killed zombies with swords\n- Killed zombies with bats\n- Killed zombies with poles\n- Killed zombies with axes\n- Killed zombies with chainsaw\n- Killed zombies with sickles\n- Killed zombies with bricks\n- Killed zombies with guns\n- Killed zombies with modified guns\n- Killed zombies with makeshift weapons\n- Killed zombies with fists\n- Killed zombies with brass knuckles\n- Killed zombies by explosions\n- Killed zombies by running over them with a car\n- Killed zombies by drowning them\n- Killed zombies by stomping their heads\n- Killed zombies by jumping on their heads\n- Killed zombies by kicking them(off of a cliff, into the danger or simply persistently kicking them until they die)\n- Killed zombies by Chuck Norising them\n- Killed zombies by burning them\n- Killed zombies by bleeding them dry\n- Killed zombies by electrocuting them\n- Killed zombies by poisoning them(this is still and enigma to me 'cuz I can't quite figure out how is it that I have poisoned the undead)\n- Killed gangsters by shooting them in the head\n- Looted every possible container I every ran into every time I revisited the area\n\nSo, as much as I would like to write more about the game, I really don't know what to write since what I have written above is actually all there is to this game. But, do I recommend it? Now that's a tough one but I am gonna go with a "Not Recommended" since there are much more downsides to it than the good sides which doesn't mean that I still didn't had fun playing it for the most part but its mostly because I have played it with a friend.\n\nSo, unless you have a friend who owns the game or wants to own it, avoid Dead Island like a plague. It's big, it's very beautiful very often, its very detailed and lets you get creative with 101 way to kill the undead, but, more than anything, its repetitive and what you do in the first 10 minutes of the game is what you will be doing till the very end.\n\nP.S. 3/30 hours played were spent on trying to connect to my friends game and constantly being disconnected. The reason for this was wireless connection. If you have wireless internet and want to play Dead Island online in co-op, you better think twice.","January 10","false","30.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","3"

I’ve bought so many game bundles, I can’t remember which one it was in. But in most game bundles there are three kinds of games: the ones you’re buying the bundle for, the ones you might play since you’re getting them in the bundle, and the ones you know you’ll never touch. When I got Dead Island, I thought I’d at least give it a shot some time, but now I kind of wish I hadn’t.\n\nHit zombies. Repeat until bored.\n\nDead Island would’ve disappeared into the bargain bins without a glance if it hadn’t been for its infamously misleading trailer, which turned out to have nothing to do with the actual game. This shouldn’t have surprised anybody, but somehow it meant that Dead Island got a lot more attention on release than it deserved, so it was an effective marketing strategy. If you think games journalists would know better by now, you don’t know anything about games journalism.\n\nIn any case, Dead Island is pretty much worthless garbage. It has an incredibly boring open world, devoid of anything even gesturing at character, and nothing much to do in it but an endless succession of fetch and kill quests. The combat has some interesting ideas, but it doesn’t make up for the lack of any imagination or even ambition in the rest of the game. Even as part of a bundle, Dead Island isn’t just poor value, it’s negative value. I don’t want my money back, I want to be paid for the time I’ve lost playing this game.\n\nhttp://macrotransactions.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/200-games-200-words-10-dead-island/","October 5, 2014","false","2.8"," 36 of 69 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","36","69","0","2"

ME.\nI'm now so freaking scared that this happens when I go.\n\nFirst of all, I was following this game since the first trailer and I couldn't wait it to be released.\nThe story goes in an Island infected by a virus, only 4 survivors are going to team up to escape the Island. It's not the best point of the game but, does Pac Man has a story to run over ghosts ? It's still a fun game to me.\nAnyway, at the time the game got released, the design of the map was just amazingly beautiful, jumping inside waterpools, trying to get on the slides, climbing on a tree for the lol.\nThe game is working almost like a MMORPG, you have a system of levels and skills to learn. It's not really hard to level up if you do the side quests, though some are repeatable. So who says MMORPG says it's mainly coop to be enjoyed.\n\nThe bad parts of this game are, first, the VAC that is completely USELESS, the game itself helps you to cheat by using glitches, the first one was after the 1st update, you could get unlimited money by selling and buying weapons that are above the level max.\nMods created by players of the community are also available to modify the game and that should be considered as a potential cheat since mine is disabling the gravity and the stamina, I can also send zombies to fly with a punch.\n\nAlso, Most of the people here are saying that this game is bad because it's repetitive, has clunky controls, bad graphics.\nMan, aslong the game is not called Battlefield Island: Modern Warfare 98, it's bad.\n\nWhen it's clunky, you should know that you can craft weapons.\nWhen it's repetitive, you should find out side quest to get you guns.\nWhen it has bad graphics, it has a lot of glitches that you can use to make fun with. (Check my screenshots)\nAnd there is 3 maps, I spoil: Island, Town, Jungle. Special zombies come over in the new maps you discover.\nYou have over 100 IDs to find in all the maps, 5 skulls to find to unlock the electric hand to charge the zombies and make them fly as on Bioshock.\n\n- Finally, if you decide to buy this game to play alone, don't take this game.\nIf you are going to play with a friend, you should have fun in a game, if you play Dota and that you think you're unbeatable in any game, zombies in this one will beat your ♥♥♥ up. :3","November 29, 2013","true","178.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

On paper, that sounds like it should make for an amazingly fun title, but the reality doesn't line up.\n\nThis is a bug-infested game that needed a bit more polish.  For example, the cursor on the unnecessarily convoluted UI menus, for example, is horribly sluggish and cannot be adjusted.  If you have more than one monitor, there's a chance the cursor will not be locked down and will float off to another monitor mid-combat, causing the game to lose context and return to the desktop -- meanwhile, the game does not pause, leaving you free to be eaten alive while you scramble to bring the game back into focus.\n\nSerious bugs aside, a fan-created patch to disable weapon degredation and adjust enemy AI is almost required to make it playable.\n\nMost of the enjoyment comes from assaulting the undead with the various weapons and vehicles -- and it IS fun...for a while.","July 15, 2012","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each character has their own unique ability.\n\nThe atmosphere is very dark, depressing and creepy even in broad daylight. I have played a myriad of zombie games but I can say that this one is one of the few that really makes you feel truly alone and surrounded. It is very easy to get too over zealous and then swarmed by zombies.\n\nInitially the co-op suffered greatly with frequent drop outs and connection issues.

Sure people swear--especially in extreme situations, which this is--but the language jars one out of the story rather than immerses. It's unnecessary, juvenile and annoying--not to mention downright disgusting when it comes to the endless curses of the Lord, Jesus Christ.\n\nThat aside, I actually really enjoy this game. It's nice to be back in a situation that actually feels like survival horror again. The rpg element is a great twist that keeps the idea of zombies in a video game--again--quite fresh. There's a ton of content, the graphics are strong, if somewhat repetitive, and the ambient nature of the game goes a long way to setting a really cool tone for a horror game. A bit clunky feeling at times, less than intuitive at others, but worth a look if you've got a friend to explore the island with.","October 4, 2012","true","57.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Techland managed to create the most realistic zombie fighting game I have played in a long time, with the weapon duribility system and stamina system. It's truthfully a masterpiece in the zombie horror catagory that I would reccommend to anyone.\n\nThere is a downside, however. I, personally, felt as though the game started running a bit slowly after the first act. The system of moving around and fighting zombies and doing quests felt a bit tedious, and the plot wasn't all that engaging. It got a bit dry towards the end so much that I felt as if I just needed to rush through the final act. Regardless of that one fault, the game was an enjoyable experience that I'm glad I took the time to do.\n\nAs I am an acheivement hunter, I took a look at that aspect of the game as well. The acheivements for the game are very reasonable and fun. Some are tricky and require skill whereas some are just clever. However, the game hit the bottom of my list when it came to acheivements for two reasons. First, there is one acheivement that requires you to have a X-Box controller to get, which, in my opinion, is quite the slap in the face to someone who is playing via the computer. The second reason, and it may just be me, is that one of the acheivements in the game didn't trigger for me. I ended up without one of the co-op acheivements due to some unknown reason. All in all the acheivements were a disappointment due to these two blunders.","August 1, 2014","true","47.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquishyBiscuit/recommended/91310/","SquishyBiscuit","☢ SquishyBiscuit ☢","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquishyBiscuit/","49 products in account","Firstly i used to have this game on the xbox 360 along with riptide once it came out and had well over my fair share of hours lost on it haha.\nIn all honestly this is by far the best first person zombie horror game out there in my opinion, this game was built for a pad so if you've not used one i would recommend you try it!\nThe analog control setting with the pad is so immersive allowing you to swing your melee weapon in any direction. By using the right analog stick and left trigger you will ready your weapon then cut or bash whichever bodypart you like from breaking bones with blunt weapons to slicing off limbs joint by joint, the blood and gore is very well done and damage effects on the zombies are incredible, giving a wide range of diffrents types from walkers to infected to rammers and suiciders and alot more.\nThe characters themselves feel rather stiff in this first game when attempting the strafe right or left and senstivity could do with being allowed a little faster but i guess you can only turn your head so fast with snapping your neck. This however doesnt make the game unbareable or annyoing.\nYou have a choice of four diffrent playable characters in the Dead Island installment and 6 in Dead Island Riptide. Each has thier own unique skill set tree depending on what you'd rather slay your zombies with, this however doesnt mean just because your a blunt user you only have to use hhammers and baseball bats ect but you wont be as effective with bladed weapons but you can still kill zombies effectively. Again unfortunatly the first game rather under powered most of the firearms  leaving you with putting 6 or so magnum rounds into a zombies head before it dies, this however was changed drmatically in the second installment allowing for firearms to prove more effective with headshots against the living dead.\nWeapons come in a very wide range from crowbars, baseball bats, slegehammers, mauls, batons, hanbos, knuckledustters, machetes, knifes, katanas, tantos, kukris, fireaxes, double blades and much more giving you plenty of variety to try out, each weapon is broken down into several catorgories with damage, force, durability, handling. Damage being for bladed wepaons, force for blunt weapons, the higher the force the more knockback the weapon will have. Handling depends on how many swings  your chracter will get before becoming fatigued, so the higher the handling the more swings you will have. Duriability is pretty straight forward being with the higher the durability the btter condition your wepon will stay after mulitple hits.\nRepair benches are quite common throughout the world giving you a chance to repair your items back to full for a cost, the rarer the weapon the more it willl cost to repair. On that note many weapons can be modded with devastating effects from electricution to sickness effects, each mod is obtained either by finding in the various locations or earing as part of a reward upon completing a quest. You may also choose not to mod anything out of the ordinary like myself and keep it to the more realistic mods like the barbed wired mod or the glazed mod which consist of a gluey rag wrapped around a blunt object,covered in glue then rolled in shards of broken glass for a brutal bleeding effect.\nAnyway thats all from me and my review on dead island and hope any of you that managed to read all the way through then thank you for taking the time to read this. Happy Gaming all.","July 2, 2014","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Surprisingly, this game is different enough to recommend. It has a skill tree and quest structure similar to Borderlands but the focus is on melee combat. I don't think I even found a gun until I had been playing for 5 hours, maybe even longer. This is one of the few games to make melee combat fun. It's a lot more visceral than L4D or Killing Floor and individual enemies are much stronger and more dangerous. The level design of all the different open world areas is pretty impressive as well. I highly recommend playing with friends but solo is OK too. It's not all good news, though... there are quite a few bugs primarily with the quest and inventory interface (probably because of bad console porting). The design is also a bit awkward even it wasn't buggy. But if you can get past the bugs and get used to the controls it's well worth it.","January 30, 2012","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yet I love it. In the case of video games, I greatly value gameplay over plot, and this game has great gameplay. It's fun to turn zombies into mush with a variety of unique and crazy weapons. It's fun to curbstomp a corpse and watch its head splatter. And the whole game is very entertaining with a friend. That can be said about almost any game, but it's especially true for Dead Island. I just finished a playthrough with a friend and not only was it enjoyable to splatter undead together, but it makes the game much easier. If you plan on playing this game through in single player, you might have a bad time. It is very difficult in certain areas.\n\nThis game gets a lot of hate, and while it is deserving of some of it, enjoyment can still be found in this title.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/recommended/91310/","tedizslayer","Insano-Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/","166 products in account","Dead Island is easily one of the strangest games I've played that actively attempts to be a game rather than a spectacle. It does not easily fit into any genre I regularly peruse, and its bizarre list of consolization issues and strengths make it hard to look at from any one angle.\n\nFirst and foremost, Dead Island is about killing zombies. This is nothing short of blatantly obvious. It is in this, however, that its unusually robust, yet succinct tactical depth is present; arms can be broken with blunt weapons or knives, or hacked off with machetes or axes. Enemies thrown to the floor take additional damage from a weapon's force attribute, while some enemies introduced early on have head or body armor. Combined with its (incredibly awkward) first person shooter elements, it makes for a unique experience, to say the least.\n\nThis uniqueness, however, is part of its shortcomings. Aim assist - even for melee weapons! - is permanently active with no option to disable it, making firearms - particularly with the combination of sticky aiming and partial auto-aim - clumsy and borderline painful to use for shooter veterans. RPG mechanics feel practically tacked on, with run-of-the-mill character-specific skills, levelling, and equipment levels rippling the player's awkwardly out-of-place stockpile of money throughout the game. Floaty movement, some unbindable commands, and general sloppiness of its stability lend much credibility to it being a bad console port.\n\nIts artistic side is yet again another moment of individual genius clashing against individual oddity. The locale is relatively novel for a zombie apocalypse-styled game, featuring rundown slums, dense jungles, and beachfront resorts. Its depiction of the undead is undoubtedly graphic, and a special "mutilated" sub-skin for nearly every zombie adds much to the feeling of hacking apart reanimated corpses. The same technique used, however, can be the source of visual oddities; all severed heads are the same, generic gib, badly damaged limbs shrivel up confusingly to emulate tissue loss, and incendiary weapons will turn enemies pitch black, leading more to a dark skinned or even glossy appearance rather than burnt. Maps feature many a misplaced prop embedded in scenery or distended from scenery it was intended to be aligned with. This list continues for many things in the game.\n\nOverall, however, Dead Island is an interesting, enjoyable game with its own merits worthy of praise and shortcomings to be on the lookout for. Its modding capacity, unfortunately, is relatively scant, but its fairly robust cooperative play may well make up for that.","December 7, 2013","true","212.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But one of the things I really enjoyed about the game was the crafting. I really liked having to collect the supplies needed to make the weapon, and then finnaly getting to a workbench to build the badass item. The combat is absolutely terrifying and you actually feel as if you are being chased by a swarm of zombies trying to rip your head off. The weapons are fun to play with and awesome, like a chainsaw beheading a monster while its on fire. I especially liked the variation in  the different weapons, from beheading 4 zombies at once with a four bladed fire-dagger to bashing one's brain in and watching it melt with your skin-blistering poison knuckle-duster. At the beggining, each player has to do their own introduction mission in a hotel, which I found very creepy. The first zombie combat starts after you have walked along a corridor blocked by a baggage trolley, so you have to go past through a door to the side, in which, you have to turn your torch on so it seems even more scary because it reminds you that it is actually incredibly dark in there. After you get out of the room, which you can loot to its theoretical bone, you continue along the corridor to come to a door that leads to the open where there is a cutscene that you see some undead lunge off the balcony above. you then turn around and go to the broken elevator and open the hatch.  There is then another cutscene of the elevator falling down the shaft. It suddenly stops and two zombies start charging you while you're on the ground but luckily the lift falls another few feet. Then you hear a voice over the lift speaker telling you to do exactly as it says and to get a weapon from the maitenance room. You then crouch walk out of the lift and across a balcony and sprint down a corridor, get chased back down by infected, blah blah blah, and you finish after another cutscene. You may think that the cutscenes were insane in that but they are actually quite important. I haven't bought any of the DLC, so I can't review it, sry. I enjoyed exploring the different areas, like finding all of the tiny branches of tiny huts along the very large and blue coast. Although, they just HAD to include the tired, worn cliche of a level in the sewers. But they do introduce the floater in there at the beginning, which is basically a thug (a tank)who can puke on you, what a dull enemy. I would certainly reccomend this game, I haven't got Riptide yet, but I really hope that they improved those rather large cons in the game, but kept the pros almost the same, but it needs to change the gameplay slightly so it actually afs something to this game so it isn't just copy-pasted onto a different disk/download. When rating it I would give it 8/10 because of those major problems with it.","December 19, 2013","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure people swear--especially in extreme situations, which this is--but the language jars one out of the story rather than immerses. It's unnecessary, juvenile and annoying--not to mention downright disgusting when it comes to the endless curses of the Lord, Jesus Christ.\n\nThat aside, I actually really enjoy this game. It's nice to be back in a situation that actually feels like survival horror again. The rpg element is a great twist that keeps the idea of zombies in a video game--again--quite fresh. There's a ton of content, the graphics are strong, if somewhat repetitive, and the ambient nature of the game goes a long way to setting a really cool tone for a horror game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquishyBiscuit/recommended/91310/","SquishyBiscuit","☢ SquishyBiscuit ☢","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquishyBiscuit/","49 products in account","Firstly i used to have this game on the xbox 360 along with riptide once it came out and had well over my fair share of hours lost on it haha.\nIn all honestly this is by far the best first person zombie horror game out there in my opinion, this game was built for a pad so if you've not used one i would recommend you try it!\nThe analog control setting with the pad is so immersive allowing you to swing your melee weapon in any direction. By using the right analog stick and left trigger you will ready your weapon then cut or bash whichever bodypart you like from breaking bones with blunt weapons to slicing off limbs joint by joint, the blood and gore is very well done and damage effects on the zombies are incredible, giving a wide range of diffrents types from walkers to infected to rammers and suiciders and alot more.\nThe characters themselves feel rather stiff in this first game when attempting the strafe right or left and senstivity could do with being allowed a little faster but i guess you can only turn your head so fast with snapping your neck. This however doesnt make the game unbareable or annyoing.\nYou have a choice of four diffrent playable characters in the Dead Island installment and 6 in Dead Island Riptide. Each has thier own unique skill set tree depending on what you'd rather slay your zombies with, this however doesnt mean just because your a blunt user you only have to use hhammers and baseball bats ect but you wont be as effective with bladed weapons but you can still kill zombies effectively. Again unfortunatly the first game rather under powered most of the firearms  leaving you with putting 6 or so magnum rounds into a zombies head before it dies, this however was changed drmatically in the second installment allowing for firearms to prove more effective with headshots against the living dead.\nWeapons come in a very wide range from crowbars, baseball bats, slegehammers, mauls, batons, hanbos, knuckledustters, machetes, knifes, katanas, tantos, kukris, fireaxes, double blades and much more giving you plenty of variety to try out, each weapon is broken down into several catorgories with damage, force, durability, handling. Damage being for bladed wepaons, force for blunt weapons, the higher the force the more knockback the weapon will have. Handling depends on how many swings  your chracter will get before becoming fatigued, so the higher the handling the more swings you will have. Duriability is pretty straight forward being with the higher the durability the btter condition your wepon will stay after mulitple hits.\nRepair benches are quite common throughout the world giving you a chance to repair your items back to full for a cost, the rarer the weapon the more it willl cost to repair. On that note many weapons can be modded with devastating effects from electricution to sickness effects, each mod is obtained either by finding in the various locations or earing as part of a reward upon completing a quest. You may also choose not to mod anything out of the ordinary like myself and keep it to the more realistic mods like the barbed wired mod or the glazed mod which consist of a gluey rag wrapped around a blunt object,covered in glue then rolled in shards of broken glass for a brutal bleeding effect.\nAnyway thats all from me and my review on dead island and hope any of you that managed to read all the way through then thank you for taking the time to read this. Happy Gaming all.","July 2, 2014","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game plays quite well, and although the multiplayer is rudimentary it is servicable for drop in/out play. The story is nothing stellar and may bore some audiences but the survival elements make up for this shortcoming. As you explore the island you will meet various survivors with unique personalities that give the player motivation to continue forward. The visuals in this game are also quite well done, and if you ever get a moments break from the zombie hordes you will find yourself in a beautiful world. The downfalls however relate to some of the core gameplay elements, the combat itself and skill-tree progression system hurt the game more than enhance it, and considering you spend the vast majority of the game fighting for survival this is nothing to take lightly. One example of such is the customization of weapons and the workbench which will consume large amounts of your time repairing or upgrading weapons based on what you find, an intriguing concept but weapons break (condition decay) too easily and most function in the same manner despite forcing you to use select weapons based on the character you select or your skilltree. This hurts the game drastically, almost to the point of making the game worth skipping. As such I can't recommend this game, nor can I recommend passing on it, it may be an enjoyable experience with friends but it is ultimately a potentially great game marred by poor gameplay.","September 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played it when it was first released and bug-laden, prior to its appearance on Steam. Dead Island was clearly rushed to release, and a no-clip mode was enabled by default. The first patch to fix that particular issue was released reasonably fast.\n\nI was mostly disappointed by Dead Island, because when it was first announced, I thought the idea of merging GTA/Saints Row freeroam, Zombie Survival, and RPG elements together was brilliant. I mean, these are all things I've enjoyed.\nThe idea was excellent, but the execution was rather poor.\n\nToday, most bugs have been patched out, and the core gameplay remains. The environments aren't bad, and I like the character designs, but there's still the issue of terrible player animations. To see what I mean, try running or turning or jumping while starting at your shadow or feet. Some of the voice acting is also fairly lackluster.\n\nDespite all these things, if a game is still at least playable, and has good to decent core gameplay, I have the ability to enjoy it for what it is. And this is a good case: I did enjoy Dead Island overall.\nIt could easily have been much MUCH more, but I still enjoyed it.","October 31, 2014","true","42.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

And it was WELL WORTH IT!  The end result was a game that in my opinion was long over due, no one made a zombie game that promised as much as this!!  Sure there are scarier titles like Resident Evil, or even more mainstream such as Dead Rising, This was the zombie game of choice, and I would still take this style of zombie and gameplay over Dying Light.\n\nVery few reasons to not like this game, such as Headshots not counting.  Mods exist for this reason and that issue has been long since addressed by the comunity.  A very odd and frustrating ending, but the hours of sheer enjoyment all before this more than make up for such a small setback!  And of course the dreaded special undead, which is something that somehow every zombie game developer seems to deem necessary!  Quite honestly I feel this game will only be topped by the (highly anticipated by myself) sequel Dead Island 2.  Which in my opinion cannot be released soon enough!  The classic zombie formula is far too much fun a concept to be left unconsidered by even the biggest devleopers, I can't get the thought out of my head that Ubisoft using the FarCry build could make one of the Ultimate Zombie games of our time.  You may call me crazy, but while it "is" a better quality game, L4D has nothing on Dead Island.  No one gives you the full zombie apocalypse survival experience that Dead Island gives you, scavenging, helping or not helping other survivors, open world concept, maintaining and upgrading weapons, building new weapons, a massive city level, etc etc.\n\nSo while I keep dreaming of the "perfect" Zombie apocalypse with classic zombies theme'd survival experience, I always think to myself...

The "heroes" of the island weren't looked at as the only solution, but were often used as a way to coordiante an effort in an intense social situation.  The people felt alive and that they were coming to decisions based on their own character's.  I'm intersted in proper character's primarily because I like reading & movies as much as I like games.\n\nI think I chose my character well.  Xian has a significant mid to late game benefit with a lag time in the early game for gaining experience and such. Tried out Ryder also but wasn't impressed much.  However I may not have taken him far enough.  As far as the quality of the graphics, they were good enough for me.  I run a fairly high end system.  3770k intel with a single 660.  SSD Harddrive and standard hardrive 2tb, 64gb 7200 ram, Windows 64 rates it a 7.9/8.0 so it runs fairly well.  Not any significant problems.  Some glitchouts at some rocky terrain areas and such.  Nothing significant.\n\nCons\nA slowdown period through the sewers that got annoying.  That's about it for me.  The ending had its moments.  My coop partner had a horribly overpowered one-hit kill weapon at the final boss battle that sort of made the ending flat for me.  That was about it.\n\nGood luck and have fun.\n\nThanks for reading.","February 27, 2014","true","70.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Intended for multiplayer, but singleplayer is my personal recommendation if you're looking for immersion.  Word of warning, don't expect a FPS.  Unless that S stands for slashing, stabbing, or smashing.  You'll eventually come across firearms, but you'll need ammo and in true survival horror fashion, it's not going to just fall in your lap.  You will either steal it from other survivors or make your own.

The quests and multiplayer functions work out fairly well, and it can be a decent challenge at times.\n\nOn the other hand, people will naturally and unintentionally out-level each other, making things harder. Some quests, items, and other things will bug out, disappear, freeze or require a restart, but it rarely was a problem that couldnt be solved. The characters and story are complete crap, forgettable and making me want L4D2's in that regard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRUNK_CANADIAN/recommended/91310/","DRUNK_CANADIAN","DRUNK_CANADIAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DRUNK_CANADIAN/","970 products in account","Dead Island is your standard zombie killing fair with a multiplayer element and moderately well told story revolving the survival of the remaining guests on the somewhat undead island. The game plays quite well, and although the multiplayer is rudimentary it is servicable for drop in/out play. The story is nothing stellar and may bore some audiences but the survival elements make up for this shortcoming. As you explore the island you will meet various survivors with unique personalities that give the player motivation to continue forward. The visuals in this game are also quite well done, and if you ever get a moments break from the zombie hordes you will find yourself in a beautiful world. The downfalls however relate to some of the core gameplay elements, the combat itself and skill-tree progression system hurt the game more than enhance it, and considering you spend the vast majority of the game fighting for survival this is nothing to take lightly. One example of such is the customization of weapons and the workbench which will consume large amounts of your time repairing or upgrading weapons based on what you find, an intriguing concept but weapons break (condition decay) too easily and most function in the same manner despite forcing you to use select weapons based on the character you select or your skilltree. This hurts the game drastically, almost to the point of making the game worth skipping. As such I can't recommend this game, nor can I recommend passing on it, it may be an enjoyable experience with friends but it is ultimately a potentially great game marred by poor gameplay.","September 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In my play time I died many times because I was admiring view and zombies managed to sneak on me, haha! But really the island is very beautiful and makes me want to travel some place tropical. I only got to play small part of story but it seemed interesting and there was lot of things to do, many side quests and much to explore. Many different type of weapons to choose from too and you even got to built some more if you got blue print and material for them. Bad thing was that weapons broke too easily and that was bad. Running zombies over with car was best entertainment! Very gory too and I know some people like that in a game.\nI liked that you got to pick what sort of character you play with. All four choices had good strenghts and felt balanced so it was hard to decide who was my favourite. Killing zombies was buggy a lot of times because zombies seemed to teleport from side to side and I think that would have started to be annoying in more difficult missions later but it did not bother me much. It was also great that you could join friends game when you wanted and do things together. That was very nice touch to the game.

It is a bit more realistic though.\n\nI give it 10/10\n\nEven though your weapons worn out pretty fast (which is super anoying)\nyou can spec up in preventing it. And besides it makes it a bit more challenging.\n\nCoop is awesome! But single-player is surprisingly as good, which i aplause for, cause not many games are as fun in singleplayer.\n\nSo basicly the best zombie survival series following my appinion.\nBut I havent played dying light, which is much better in every way. But any pc could probably run dead island.\nAnd dead island i think is a bit more standard.\n\nSo if you like l4d2 and zombies and gore buy this and your wishes will come true.\n","September 20, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game requires a rather skilled player due to the manuevering of the weapons. The menu is a bit difficult to get the hang of, but eventually it will be logical.\n\nThe many weapons to choose from is a great chance to personalize your gaming experience! Do you prefer a machete? Shot gun? Or maybe a hammer? The negative side of this is the levels. You have to obtain a  certain level for certain weapons. Personally, I was VERY slow to upgrade in level, but it was great how the game evolved!\n\nDefinitely a game you must play!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfshotthefood/recommended/91310/","elfshotthefood","ElfShotTheFood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfshotthefood/","1709 products in account","Forget the trailer: Dead Island is Borderlands crossed with Left 4 Dead. The story is bad and the characters are barely one-dimensional, but Dead Island still manages to be a compelling game, thanks in part to its visceral combat and amusing weapons.\n\nAs mentioned, Dead Island is a lot like Borderlands: you're set down in a large open environment and have to complete a variety of simple quests in order to advance the storyline and gain experience points to upgrade your character. But where Borderlands dealt mostly with guns, Dead Island features a very heavy focus on melee combat. The combat looks and sounds nasty, as heads and limbs can be cut off and smashed apart. The fighting is much better if you have an Xbox 360 gamepad since the controller allows for the aiming of swings, meaning you can target specific body parts on zombies and make them go flying with a well-placed weapon strike.\n\nDead Island has things wrong with it, to be sure: bad voice-acting, bad dialog, weird-looking human characters, and annoying bugs, in particular some horrendous clipping that sees weapons sink into the ground and zombies able to strike you through the corners of buildings or even even other zombies. This stuff is annoying.\n\nBut at the same time, Dead Island is very playable: the environments are detailed, and the sound effects are great. It's also fun leveling up your character and searching the island for weapon blueprints that will electrocute zombies or set them on fire. And even though the story is bad, you'll want to keep playing to the end just to see how everything turns out.\n\nDead Island also features co-op play for up to four players and it's pretty easy to set up and join a co-op game, although if you want to play solo you still can. The one problem with the co-op in Dead Island is that enemies level to the highest-level player in the game, meaning a low-level player might end up in a game with very tough enemies. To avoid this, it's best to play with friends at around the same level you are.\n\nDead Island has a lot of flaws and one has to be willing to tolerate them if they want to have fun. But there's fun to be had here just the same.","November 28, 2013","true","122.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One thing that I need to give emphasis is the same generic reason the main character is immune to the virus, because them blood type is negative O… CLASSIC. The story develop is that simple, too. The mission is pretty the same things to do “go there and get something”, “bring something”, “go there, kill those zombies and bring something” “go there and bring me water”, when the infection starts, just you can do things to help everybody. The story doesn’t hold you, this is the reason I skiped some dialogues.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good. The fact that you can improve your weapon is really amazing, but I still don’t understand why you use money to improve or to repair weapons. Those improvements can make the weapons work totally different, my favorite weapon is the ripper baseball bat and you can cut everything with this.\nThe infected is really overpower, I was scary when I hearded more than one infected coming, because those ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ is unstoppable.\n\nI don't have anything to say about the soundtrack, It isn't amazing, but it isn't bad.\n\nI just recommend this game because of the gameplay.\n\nThat’s sound I haven't enjoyed the game, but I have.","June 4, 2014","true","37.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Its combat is fun in places, the land is open with lots of room for discovery, searching, looting, and finding secrets, and there are some mechanics in place to draw out the very lengthy game play.  All in all it was very fun and I beat the game in just over 45 hours on my first play through, so there was definitely some value in purchasing this title.\n\nHowever, the characters were bland and lifeless, the story was almost interesting but managed to fall short of really being anything unique or even explaining existing zombie lore.  The roads are so short and overly populated with debris that driving should have been left out completely.  The combat suffers greatly from balance issues.  And, worst of all, the game is so absolutely full of bugs that its barely playable.\n\nA major patch could boost the game into epic status, but without that effort I recommend this game assuming it comes in a deep discount bundle as I have seen it of late.
