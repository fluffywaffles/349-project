"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/315650/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","In the undiscovered recesses of a faraway planet, beautiful and strange organisms live and breathe in a psychedelic Venusian world of dancing lights and metroid-like organisms. Similarly psychedelic to the visual style of the game is the soundtrack, with its equally as trippy and ambient qualities that build up and evolve with each successful move you make.\n\nDeep Under the Sky uses a one-button control system that while incredibly easy to use is surprisingly deep in execution. The objective of each gorgeously organic stage is to fertilize each glowing plant with the debris from the exploded amoeba-like jellyfish that release from the base you control. As simple as that sounds reaching each carefully placed plant and spreading your pieces far enough to fertilize them will be a matter of careful aiming and finesse as you surpass each obstacle and navigate each twist and turn of the maze-like passageways.\n\nReleasing your little jellyfish and aiming their trajectory with split second perfection is a zen-like experience almost akin to a surrealistic and extra-terrestrial Skee-Ball, the game is all about accuracy. As the levels progress your jelly-like projectiles become faster and force you to think quicker about deciding when to employ your various maneuvers.\n\nYou start out utilizing the simpler skills mostly involving rocketing your pieces in a specific direction, nudging it into the right direction when timed properly. As you move on more hazards and obstacles to work around are introduced and you're quickly navigating elaborate series of bouncepads to reach the proper destination.\n\nBy the second world you gain the ability to morph into a ball to roll across surfaces and gain momentum as you descend any hill. This is also important for squeeing into seemingly impossible tight fits à la Super Metroid. Timing the start and release of your ball form just like anything else in the game is incredibly important and adds even more reflex based skill to how you play. This feels really good, and again reminded me of some kind of psychedelic Skee-Ball or Pinball even more.\n\nAll the elements that make for yet another beautifully strange creation from the minds of gems Incredipede and Pineapple Smash Crew. If you're looking for a fun and simple way to relax with the added effect of being visually and audibly stunning then come and chill out Deep Under the Sky.","August 26, 2014","true","12.9"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","39","45","0","3"

Bounding from the safety of their nest, tentacles swirling in the current, attempting to fertilize a waking host before their short life expires. There's something very poetic about Deep Under the Sky, its bedazzling art creating a hypnotic cycle as you run almost on autopilot, sacrificing innumerable members of this strange species in pursuit of the task at hand.\n\nMesmerizing as it can be, Deep Under the Sky has the inescapable issue of being so hands-off as to make me often feel like my role in it was superfluous, or at least fairly dull and extremely limited in scope. A queue of moves scrolls from the bottom of the screen, their moment of execution being your only means of interaction, and thus levels are laid out before you as you launch jellyfish out attempting to discern the correct timing to be able to reach each of the nests you need to fertilize in order to progress. It's something like being given a catapult but only ever being allowed to pull the lever, leaving the aiming to others and then entering into a series of trial and error as you work within your rigid limitations to recreate the moves of the developer. Success often felt like an accident, yet another thing I had little control over, level after level passing by but failing to leave me with any lasting impression longer than the seconds it took to load the next screen.\n\nIt's not the worst way to spend a few hours by any stretch, but the experience goes by with such little presence that it was almost like I wasn't playing a game at all, just staring at my monitor as my fingers moved on their own and I was left to leisurely enjoy the wondrous, sparkling world of strange organisms draped around a much less engaging game. I find it hard to say whether that's an experience worth your time, my memories of the game already beginning to fade, but I'm equally indecisive in prescribing you stay away so perhaps that says what I'm failing to.","January 14, 2015","true","2.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","2"

While the visuals and the overall implementation of the game concept were done very well, the gameplay itself lacks a bit of depth and smoothness.

Gameplay consists of you shooting these balls from the same starting location and trying to time a series of actions to hit targets (except you don't actually control the actions, all you can do is control when each action begins). In short, each time you miss the target you simply repeat the series of actions until you hit it.....and then you repeat that a bunch more times until you hit all the targets in the stage.\n\nThen you move on to the next stage which presents you with a different order of actions, but the same concept of hitting targets. That is the entire game with only the order of actions changing between stages.\n\n-MISLEADING description: There is no "exploration" or "movement" really...each stage simply presents you with a series of actions and a bunch of targets to hit, and then you go on to the next level.\n\nSimilarly, nothing here is psychadelic. Its simple, colorful graphics, but thats about it.\n\nThe video presented on the steam page (showing "gameplay) is also misleading. It shows the character moving through a variety of environments, but this is not, at all, what the gameplay is like. Your objective is to "explode" yourself near those orange balls and then respawn and repeat until you hit all the orange balls in a stage (usually about 5-7).","July 5, 2015","false","0.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

But this gameplay is pretty simple. All you do is press the spacebar to play. Basically what you do is launch jellyfish and try to hit all the switches in the level. But to get the switches you need to hit the bouncy areas or use your jets, so all the gameplay is timing in when to press spacebar. So if your stuck you'll pass it as it is all trial and error. As you read the gameplay is casual, but is also very simplistic which can get boring for a long session of playing. Also, because it's only 1 button it limits the whole environment and cuts exploration.\n\nGraphics:\nThis game is 2D but the art style is pretty special and works well with the style of the game.\n\nControls & Smoothness:\nThere is only 1 button like I said before, though the game only needs 1 button even though it limits exploration. The game has a little bit of bugs though only a little.\n\nMusic & Sound:\nThe music really helped the art style and it wasn't full on either, it just set with the background which was good.\n\nDifficulty:\nYou can get stuck in this game pretty easy though as it is just one button it is just trial and error before you get all switches.\n\nFun Level:\nI found this game the most fun when you got through the levels quickly though when you get stuck and do trial and error it can get boring and make you want to leave.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is great in short bursts though when you stay and play you will get tired because of it's repitive and limited gameplay.\n\nPro's:\n- Great art style\n- Music works well\n- Some great levels which makes you think differently\n\nCon's:\n- Repitive gameplay\n- Limited levels\n\nScore: 6.5","August 24, 2014","true","0.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

At least, not through Steam. This is a mobile port tried and true, and so faithfully ported from its home device the tutorials still refer to everything as "tapping." Not only this, but if you want to play it on android it's 4 dollars base price. Here, it's 10, which is an absolute rip off unless it goes on sale for pennies.\n\nIs the game itself bad? Not at all. In fact, it's fairly decent of a port, glaring phone prompts aside. As some of the other reviews stated the description is misleading for emphasizing exploration and the ability to turn into a ball "like Samus!" as this is more or less a physics based catapult game, with couple cute little tweaks to make it interesting. The ball transformation stuff only happens for a few choice levels too, and it's simply done as that world's gimmick. It's not a selling point, trust me.\n\nThis being said, I found the art style extremely pleasant, and the puzzle layouts to be very rewarding. While the later levels rely on trial and error, the general layout for a majority of what I've played was quite clever and implemented some interesting tricks with the variety of physic defying powers. I have to say, this is definitely a high tier mobile game and could easily be received well on Steam if they priced it more realistically and, ya know, made the steam version in any way superior to the mobile version. Of course the Store Page doesn't even reference its origins so I doubt that will happen, but I would color this game as kind of a shame, since with a bit of modification and an added area or two it would've been a great little gem.\n\nFor 10 dollars though? Not a chance. At best, get it in a bundle, or wait for it to go on a big sale. Even 4 dollars on mobile is a bit too much to ask for.

I was originally excited for the game, as many people have noted, the trailer makes it look like you have control of your character. In true mobile fashion, this game is playing with one button. You mouse click to shoot, and then mouse click/mouse hold to use an ability. It kind of plays like angry birds. You have to impregnate plants/bubbles basically. You have the same goal and do the same thing every single level. There are a few added abilities like a wheel and a grapple hook, but not being able to aim or control them much is annoying. The art direction is cool, and there still is something satisfying about popping all the bubbles. The game is pretty short, and there is no real story. For some reason, the game would not let me quit it, saying "there's been a problem"??

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #45 - Deep Under the Sky\n\nWhen I started playing Deep Under the Sky, it kept bothering me that this game reminded me of something I had played, but for the life I couldn't remember.  But after getting through the first Chapter, it finally dawned on me that the game I was thinking of was Angry Birds.\n\nAt first glance, you wouldn't really notice the similarity.  And really that is to this game's credit, as I don't actually intend to call it an "Angry Birds ripoff".  In fact the colorful, almost trippy, art style is quite different, and definitely what I would consider this game's strong suit.  And the music blends itself well into this trippy vibe that the game has going for itself.\n\nIt's the gameplay that has some striking similarities to Angry Birds.  In Angry Birds, you launch your birds, and each bird has a different ability that affects how it travels, but regardless of the type of bird you are still trying to take out the pigs.  What birds you play vary from level to level.\n\nIn Deep Under the Sky, you play as a jellyfish that will morph into other forms as you hit the button (which by the way is the single control in this game).  Each form does a different thing, such as launching you like a rocket in a certain direction, or curling up into a ball to roll around.  The forms you take change from level to level.\n\nWith Angry Birds, you launch your bird with a slingshot, but here you always launch your jellyfish in exactly the same way.  So the only difference in controls is the timing of when you hit the button.  In that sense this almost takes the form of a rhythm game where button timing is essential (but the timing has nothing to do with music).\n\nWhile the button timing presents a challenge, it also gets repetitive pretty quick.  Each time you fail and relaunch your jellyfish, you end up pushing the same button through the same sequence, up to the point where you left off and need to change your timing.  It turns into a lot of trial and error, but there isn't any real strategy to it.  It's more a combination of luck, patience, and some amount of skill.  Just don't confuse this with a puzzle game.\n\nWhile I appreciated the presentation and music, I just can't get into the gameplay enough to recommend this to anyone, unless you really happen to like Angry Birds.  I didn't quite finish my hour of gameplay and really I don't feel any need to come back to this game.  It's not something that would really keep my attention, and for that I really couldn't justify the $9.99 asking price.","December 10, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You control a crazy-♥♥♥-looking space jellyfish on Venus as it wanders around and produces offspring. I use the term "control" in the loosest possible way because like the screenshot says, this game only has one button. At the start of every level the jellyfish settles into place and cannot be moved. Your one button launches an egg pod offspring thing in a set trajectory. The icons in the bottom left are the different effects that pushing your one button will have on its movement. There are directional boosts, rolling, bouncing, and of course, exploding. Your goal is to get the pod close enough to the glowing stalks to explode and plant a new offspring there.\n\nThe limited controls mean puzzles tend to be pretty obvious and open to trial-and-error. Some levels have a lot of different travel powers to use that open things up more, but mostly you'll just be using your one or two directional boosts at slightly different times and seeing where your pod ends up. The game is nice enough to show you the path of your last pod, so if you were close to your target last time you can use that as a handy reference. The visuals are weird and busy in a pleasant way, and there's a lot of detail in the particle effect. The soundtrack is a perfect low-key synth thing to relax to as you fling alien spores around. Each stage has two stars in tricky places for completionists to find, and there's about 80 levels to float through. I played it for about 30 minutes and beat the first chapter (20 levels), and when I sat down later to play something else... I actually booted this up again for a bit. It's a great little filler game, not too taxing on the mind and with lots of pretty sights and sounds to keep you occupied.","September 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

My initial expectations based on the trailer (And the fact that it's by the guy who made Incredipede) were pretty wide of the mark regarding what the game actually is, but I quickly got into what it does and the way it does it. In particular the dynamic music and the sound effects are fantastic, and it looks beautiful. I don't think the asking price is too high like some other people do, either; the mechanics expand out in a pleasing way and there are a lot of well-designed levels.","December 1, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

As some of you know, trying to find a decent game for mac on steam is really annoying. This game fit the bill and as expected I really love the colors and music. However you should know that you only press space bar to play and you are constrained to certain limitations they set. The game is 100% about the timing of when you press space bar. Creative concept, beautiful layout, and unique gameplay. I'd recommend it.. but just barely. I wish it had more of an adventure feel.","August 23, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Today we have Lysergic acid diethylamide simulator 2014.  Features:  one button.  That's it.  its so easy your dead grandma could play it. To Lazy to press one button? is that asking to much? do you always say no and back out of tough situations? Look your a friggin jelly fish and you explode and make magic. Sometimes i just smash spacebar over and over,  the more you smash spacebar the more magic you will have in your life. Dear reader, you don't have enough magic in your life.  Or love.  Or friends.  since you have nothing beter to do I kinda suggest this game.  Unless you are a real jellyfish. If you are a real jellyfish why are you reading this, you are drunk, go home.","August 23, 2014","true","0.2"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","2"

Your aim is kind of a "mini golf" situation where you try to bounce towards a target.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very simple, and it lacks a leaderboard [which I think would greatly benefit this kind of game]. Where the game really stands out is the art. The game is very pretty, brightly coloured, and is probably classed more as playable art than a game. Keep this in mind before buying.","August 22, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

An alien chip.\n\nThe game begins with some very basic physics puzzles and quickly ramps up to more and more twitch gameplay; not only will you have to time each click perfectly, especially for the stars, but every level needs several differently timed executions, not just one. It's surprisingly addictive once things start getting more complicated, especially if you're obsessive about getting all the stars. It may be a mobile game, but it makes up for that with excellent level design that easily translates to PC. The graphics aren't much to write home about, but they do a good job, and even have that retro Ecco the Dolphin feel.\n\nThe best part is that there's no fake difficulty, it's all skill. They even show you where you last clicked, so you can do better next time, but despite that it's intuition and reflex that will succeed, not mechanical learning.\n\nBut don't trust the video. That doesn't capture the feel of the game at all.\n\nAs for price, I'm not sure the regular price is worth it, but it's often on sale and it'll keep you entertained for hours. Pick it up.\n\nNote: When it says "one button only: The space bar" that actually means space, mouse, or gamepad button. So it's definitely no limiting you to any control scheme.","July 13, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/315650/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","The only reason I am not recommending Deep Under the Sky on Steam is due to how poorly it was ported over from a mobile system. It can be played with a single finger on a single button and, when it's cooperating, the uncomplicated play style is suited to that equally simplistic control scheme. The trajectory of the jellyfish-spore creature is locked from the start of the level and the tools used to alter its path, as well as the order they can be used, are predetermined as well. Despite a small difficulty spike at the end, even getting the optional hidden stars isn't made to be a challenge. Everything's so relaxed and smooth that I was inclined to play through the entire game in a single sitting. Furthermore the visual style, though not quite stunning, isn't as cluttered as some screenshots make it look.\nThe only irritation I encountered was due to a strange indecision surrounding how to adapt to the lack of a touch screen. No in-game instructions have been altered in the transition, so when told to tap and hold that may mean to press and hold or to press again to release which itself can change from moment to moment. That can become very frustrating very quickly which spoils the chilled-out atmosphere the developers are justifiably proud of. So if a low effort, low stress couple of hours sounds like a good time, pick up Deep Under the Sky, just don't do so outside of a touch screen device.","May 12","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/315650/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","The game is too short and too repetitive to be justifiable at its listed price, even with the pretty art. Only consider this on sale.\n\nI think it's a fine enough, fairly simply but not too simple to the point of being tedious puzzle game. It's mostly a matter of timing, as well as figuring out how to hit everything using whatever moves you're given in each level. There's 80 levels in all, and each has 2 secret stars to collect alongside the targets needed to clear the level.\n\nOne minor gripe I had is that clearing the main objective forces you out of the level, so if you accidentally trigger the last target before collecting the star, you have to redo the level to get it. Happened fairly frequently to me.\n\nThe level design tends to be pretty good, the only really hard stuff to hit being the stars but many of the targets involve an interesting use of the mechanics given. There's a boost in the direction you're moving, a set-angle boost, a move to turn into a ball, and a grapple mechanic, given to the player piece-by-piece over the course of the four worlds. Each level has a preset order of moves and you have to use these moves in specific ways at specific times to hit all the targets.\n\nIt's a very simple game, even if I've accidentally made it sound complex; one-button control and no free movement, just controlling the moves you're given. It's a fun game for short bursts, though I couldn't take playing too much of it at one time, even despite its short length.\n\nIt's a solid enough game, no real gripes with it, though not immensely enjoyable and not immesely rewarding. Basically what you'd expect from a mobile port, I guess?","November 27, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
