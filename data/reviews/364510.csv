"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prionicide/recommended/364510/","prionicide","prionicide","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prionicide/","32 products in account","You're here to figure out whether this game is worth playing.\n\nI'm here to tell that it is. Here's the tl;dr: you don't have to believe me, you can try the base game (which contains a good 75% of the content for the main storyline) for free[steamcommunity.com], to your heart's content, while also enjoying any modifications available for it, which can be accessed through the community forums[forums.kronosaur.com], and all future updates. Yeah, for free -- no, not free2play, but free as in free to have fun.\n\nWhat will you be buying?\nSo, Transcendence has a long term development plan. New versions are going to be released with no end in sight, as far as I know. Transcendence, the base engine, allows you to play adventures in the Transcendence universe. This base engine is free.\n\nThe primary adventure (yes, there are others, well explained by this infographic)[transcendence.kronosaur.com] is that of a character who hears the voice of a hyper-intelligence calling them to the centre of the universe, and listens to the voices in their head -- this adventure is called "Domina and Oracus", and is also free. Currently, Part 1 of the story has been released, along with a content expansion pack called Corporate Command, but the expansion pack is not free.\n\nThere is another official adventure that has been released, and this one is called "Eternity Port". It is about a character who is left for dead in the depths of space after an attack on their ship, only to be saved by a selfish (I saved you, so *obviously* you owe me) entity representing the virtual citizens of Eternity Port. They want you to do something for them, starting off the adventure. This adventure isn't free. If you want to see how Eternity Port fits into the lore of the Transcendence universe, check out the infographic[transcendence.kronosaur.com] I mentioned earlier.\n\nYou're buying Corporate Command (the expansion content for the main adventure), together with Eternity Port (the other official adventure); in other words, you're buying all the content that exists so far, and costs money.\n\nHow are basic things like the graphics, UI and sound design?\nThe graphics are pretty, as you can see from screen shots. Starry space backgrounds, mixed with the foreground composed of ships, planets and stations with textures that fit in perfectly. Even though this is an independently developed game, it doesn't skimp out on graphics by pretending to be "retro", or trying to get into the good books of old-schoolers with trashy UI design. The game's graphics are modern, and suit the gameplay.\n\nThe game has a soundtrack that's original and beautiful (I am humming the music that starts you off on an adventure right now), and has sound effects that aren't archaic. While allowing for some mouse interaction in menus, the UI is mostly designed to take keyboard input, but isn't painful to use because of that decision, and most gamers will feel at home right away: the arrow keys move your ships around in interesting ways, and major buttons like the spacebar or control keys handle the firing of weapons. Keyboard shortcuts usually make sense etymologically (e.g. "D" for Dock, "J" for jump), and there is an excellent help infographic that is accessible any time in the game that lists out all the keyboard shortcuts.\n\nSo, space adventure game. What will I actually be doing?\nThe storylines, depending on which adventure you are playing, give some background as to why you are setting off in space, and then some occasional guiding structure throughout. What do you do in between? Well, it's up to you.\n\nYou can trade: there are minerals to be mined, the ore sold or forged into useful armour, which can be sold for an even higher price. Or, you can go about simply buying low and selling high, making a living for yourself that allows you to buy fuel and the ammunition needed to stay safe. Maybe you decide you're interested in also running a side business in the black market. Well, as long as you have a murky sense of morality, the connections to get started, and the know how to hide your goods from the authorities, maybe you'll be successful.\n\nYou can sign up with the Commonwealth Forces, or some of the other regional powers (depending on which adventure you are playing), and rise up through the ranks. You can meditate in the halls of the Sisters of Domina's temples. Maybe you can figure out what this voice in your head wants. Maybe you are interested in donating items to the Sisters' cause, and helping the needy that you meet in beaten down habitat stations that are nothing more than cargo containers strung together.\n\nMaybe you free slaves held in living stasis inside coffins by the Sung Slavers, as you attempt to make sure you aren't squashed by them. Maybe you get involved in story of the Sung and the Huari, the Aztec/Maya-esque space culture that was decimated by the Sung's relentless ruthlessness. Maybe some zoanthrope buddies tag along because you beat their masters, and thus are next most powerful thing they know to follow. Maybe you willingly submit yourself to the nasty experiments of humans who have genetically modified themselves to such a degree that they might as well be aliens.\n\nMaybe you actually bump into aliens, and other creepy-crawlies. Maybe. It's your call. The game is detailed enough to waste hours of your time, with nice flavour text to spice up every piece of the universe. Bring your imagination along, and go for a ride.\n\nWhat about mods?\nTranscendence is heavily modifiable, and has an active community of modders: everything in the universe can be described and programmed with XML files and a custom LISP variant (TransLisp). The C++ guts of Transcendence are completely open as well, and available for viewing and participation on GitHub. Modding documentation is sparse, but community participation makes up for it.\n\nSo, if you're into modifying games, Transcendence will give you lots to do. If you like playing with other people's modifications, Transcendence won't disappoint you there either. Popular mods include a complete revamp of the mining system, AI based modifications that allow the game world to be even more dynamic by randomly generating conflict and rebuilding stations, content packs that add new weapons or features such as the ability to craft new weapons from components, and so on.\n\nI can't help but quote something really relevant from one of the prominent modders, pixelfck, on why he loves the game:\n\nOriginally posted by pixelfck: The storyline is quite deep, with promise for even more; There is a lot of content (devices, armour, misc-items), many of which hook back into the background universe; Its open source (© George Moromisato); I can mod it (step 1: initial notion); The modding system has a quite powerful scripting available (step 2: the promise); All vanilla content has been made with the modding options available to me, no hard-coded 'magic' (step 3: the realisation of full potential);\nFinal words.\nMy recommendation is that you try out the free content. Get yourself into the community and modifications, if that interests you. If you love it all, and want more, buy the Steam version that contains all content, or buy the content piecemeal as you want to using Kronosaur's "Multiverse" infrastructure. Like pixelfck, start dreaming, and think about how you can contribute too, because I want to play your mod!","July 24, 2015","true","0.6"," 122 of 127 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","122","127","2","4"

This is an OG overhead space sim. Crafted in the days of Tyrian and Escape Velocity, back when floppy and ZIP disks were a thing and you burned "Awesome Summer Mix" onto a CD, labeled it with Sharpie, and popped that bad boy into your Walkman. It's not the most intuitive, not the most graphically intense. But if you're looking for a "good to the last drop" overhead space roguelike, then look no further. It's no Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous, but what it has it does with quality and grace. I was suprised when I found it here, and am happy with the investment. This game will test you and reward you for your skill.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to blast some AFI, re-live my teenage angst, and enjoy the hell out of more Transcendence.","July 30, 2015","true","0.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

I've played this since the 0.95 version came out, and it's been great ever since. The base game is actually free and will take about 1-2 weeks to complete. The Corporate Command and Eternity Port expansions add lots more ships, systems, enemies, missions and plot-lines to follow, and are well worth the 8 bucks. This is like Escape Velocity, but better. And a lot more difficult. One caveat though - you can't switch ships, so you're stuck with whatever you picked at the beginning. There's a mod called "Playership Drones" I remember installing some time ago, it allowed you to buy new ships and even use them as wingmen.\n\nThis is really an open-world sandbox, where you can make your own decisions and do whatever you feel like doing. You can escort freighters, mine asteroids, work for the military, engage in piracy, smuggle drugs, even become a gladiator. Be warned though, your actions and choices will always have consequences both good and bad. Gameplay can be very challenging at times, especially the combat which requires good reflexes. Pick the Wolfen gunship and you'll see what I mean. There can be quite a steep learning  curve  cliff, and you'll get blown up. A lot. You can resurrect and pick up from where you left off, with no penalties apart from a lowered high score. On my first play-through I died about 25 times.\n\nSome tips: Learn the trade routes, and how to profit from the black market. Don't hesitate to use exploits like sitting on a planet (they're invulnerable) while waiting for your shields to recharge, or luring enemies to a friendly station to be killed. When about to die, press (I>1). You can attack salvager nomads (big brown ships) and smugglers (gray transports with small escorts) with no penalties. They are easy to defeat and carry good loot. Don't attack the Huari. And definitely don't feed the Teraton fabricator radioactive waste :) Also, remember to have fun and don't get discouraged by the amount of times you get blown up. It's very rewarding when you complete the game at last. Just resurrect and try again. And again.\n\n10/10 would die again.","July 26, 2015","true","6.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The flying controlls might take a bit to get used to, but it feels great. I like the amount of weapons, armor and tech you can install on your ship to define your own way to play the game.\nOne big complaint I have is that the enemy AI is literally potatoes. You can shoot an enemy base from outside the invividual ships aggro range and as long as you don't hit them they don't give a ♥♥♥♥, only when the enemy base explodes they start chasing you. Even then it is really easy to just get a nice speed up, turn around and shoot at them outside of their range until they die. Or aggro them to an allied space station where they get wrecked, since they don't have a base to return to, the enemies keep chasing after you until you or they die.\n\nOver all I really enjoy this game though, even with the ridiculously broken enemy AI it's fun to shoot and kite them around.","January 2","true","35.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

This is one of the closest things I've found to EV. Its an entirely keyboard driven (in a good way) top-down space game. Travel around, join factions, do missions, trade, fight etc. Its really fun.\n\nIts easy enough to pick up and play, although deep enough that you can spend hours travelling around and customizing your ship. I havent found out if you can buy a new ship or if you have the same ship the entire game so make sure you pick what you want fropm the start. Theres a type of ship for every gameplay style. I prefer the Manticore Heavy Fighter. Its got enough gun slots to do serious damage, but also has a decent cargo space to carry stuff. Its a tank though, so make sure you get nice arnor, youre not going to be zipping around in it.\n\nTheres a ton of different ships, armor, weapons, items. Graphics are what youd expect, little ships of all shapes and sizes flying around with a tiny comet of "flame" coming out of the rear end when you fire thrusters. Lasers are lines, and shots are little round blips. Typical top down space game graphics, but they arent bad. The music is awesome, lots of Empire Strikes Back style scores.\n\nDo not, under any circustances run out of fuel. You use fuel to power everything. If you run out, game over. Literally. No floating randomly about or hailing a passing ship. (AFAIK there is no communication between ships, or maybe I just dont have the ship piece yet to do that).\n\nThe game does let you ressurrect by loading a save after death, although there is a notation for "respecting permadeath" on your charsheet, so it knows if you do this. Best of both worlds, IMHO.\n\nThe story's interesting and weird. I was doing a bunch of random sidequests, of the go blow up (x) or escort (y) vein. I was told to go blow up an anarchist space station. I did and docked to loot (always fun - docking to loot stations and ships I just blew up!), when suddenly.... a story plot happened on the station. It was an interesting story hook too. So there is more to the story than just the main plot.\n\nIf you like EV, you'll like this game. I just wish you could hail/threaten/communicate with other passing ships, and there was more faction subplots, but thats a relatively minor gripe. Its a good game.","October 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

No control settings. No Mouse control. Annoying music. Do not buy, even on sale (I did, I wish I didn't).\n\nGraphics is nice, but the game is missing basic options, which is unforgivable these days.\nGameplay is kinda 'meh', sound is annoying and cannot be turned off, storyline is boring.\nControlling your craft is kinda like in old asteroids game, but more clunky.\n\nI don't know why this game has so many positive reviews, it does some things right, but that is not enough to recommend it to anyone.\nIf you are looking for:\n- in depth, captivating story\n- stunning visual effects\n- atmospheric and memorable music\n- intense combat action\n- trading and economic sandbox experience\n\nYou are not going to find it here. This game actually plays *worse* than Space Rangers, and offers like 1/10 of fun related to SR.","January 4","false","0.5"," 3 of 21 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","3","21","0","0"

For me, the greatest part of the game is its universe with just enough details to let your mind fill in the rest.\n\nOf course I can't make a review of Transcendence without talking about its support of mods. No third party mod installer is needed. You can just download or make the xml files you want and drop it into the "Extensions" folder (make one if needed) in the same location as the Transcendence.exe game file. Also its modding language is extremely user friendly.","August 21, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
