"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/316840/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4901 products in account","Sacred Tears TRUE is a doujin JRPG, a phrase that's largely interchangeable with indie although sometimes attaches stronger connotations of passion and freedom. This is incredibly apparent playing through AlphaNuts premiere Steam title, it truly feels like a love letter to a generation where RPGs really found their stride. The aim was clearly to make a game the developers would love to play and to incorporate everything from the genre that makes it special. They succeed very well at the replication, only it comes with a few warts and tropes included.\n\nYou begin your adventure by joining your hero Seil and his companion in the middle of a heist gone wrong. It's a welcome break from inhabiting an unassuming young adult, moments before his village is burned to the ground and vows revenge against the nefarious empire. That's not to say you won't recognise a lot of traditional set-ups from JRPGs, anime and manga but it's refreshing enough in a typically conventional genre that you'll let a few stereotypes pass. It helps that the characters are quite interesting, with emotional brooding teenagers replaced by charismatic and cheerful swindlers. It's a small scale tale, taking place in a single city but its inhabitants are both memorable and likeable.\n\nThe game is broken down into small chunks and presented in an almost episodic fashion. It's a pleasantly unusual change to the formula that enables the current segment of the story to be wrapped up at the end of each chapter while keeping an arching storyline to maintain interest throughout. In all honesty, you could quite easily ignore the unconventional segmentation and play it as a standard JRPG but it does help structure the story and offer easy points at which to save and take a break. I think we've all stopped playing a game only to come back to it a few weeks later and been completely lost to the events upon resuming.\n\nWhat really sets Sacred Tears apart is also its strongest factor; the combat system. It's difficult to describe efficiently but the strange alchemy of poker, rock-paper-scissors and Play Your Cards Right works remarkably well. You draw a hand of nine cards, each with their own combat options and a value, and your opponent is given a similar selection. You pick three each turn and they're paired off against the enemy's, with certain actions being stronger against others and the numbers deciding the final outcome. There are more subtle nuances such as potential hints towards the cards they've chosen and bluffs but the basics alone are enough to appreciate the labour that went into making an interesting and original system.\n\nIt takes some time to settle into the mechanics comfortably enough to become confident, and while the tutorials are efficient in teaching you the very basics of the structure, there could be a little more in the way advanced hints and thorough descriptions. Personally, I appreciate the lack of hand-holding, but it's a divisive subject and there will be a few that will want to check the PDF manual for tips to the tougher battles. There's a large element of luck to the combat which is bound to frustrate some, but it's difficult to see how guaranteed rules could be implemented without becoming effortless. I hugely recommend trying the demo before purchasing to see which side of the fence you sit. Fortunately, one other contentious facet of JRPGs is largely eliminated and that is grinding. You'll find the best means with which to increase your odds of success are within your own skills and methods rather than spending mindless hours trying to reach some arbitrary stat level.\n\nGenoseed City is a beautiful place, rendered lovingly in pixelated prettiness. It could easily stand besides the games it replicates by creating faux-authentic hardware limits while simultaneously using those constraints to perfect a design close to many gamer's hearts. Knowing that a game was made in RPGMaker typically puts me off, but the signs are much less apparent in this case. There's a clear amount of effort put into creating unique menus, sprites and environments so its origin does little to dissuade me. It's also got a pretty great soundtrack that's catchy at times and dramatic when it needs to be. It's not one I think I'd listen to outside of gaming; like Persona, Final Fantasy 8 or Disgaea, but it's far superior to the typical JRPG on Steam.\n\nThere are some issues that became apparent over extended play, with my biggest gripe being the lack of options. As in, there's no menu whatsoever. Control adjustments, resolution changes, sound levels and more are unavailable, at least through traditional means, and it's a shame that such an obvious omission mars a pretty great whole product. The gameplay begins to flag in the latter third of the game slightly, with the greatness displayed in the first two thirds never really being expanded upon. It doesn't derail an enjoyable and very charming JRPG in any real sense though, but it's something I'd love to see worked on if, fingers crossed, a sequel is ever in the works.\n\nMy complaints mostly come from love, of wanting the game to achieve the heights its potential could have reached. Despite these hiccups, it's still one of my favourite JRPGs on Steam and that's not without lack of competition. At £6.99 you get huge value for money, with a 15+ hour adventure full of smart combat, an enjoyable story with plenty of character development and a hugely charming, beautiful design. It's fantastic to see developers that very clearly respect their players and enjoy playing their games as much as making them. I'm all the more excited to see where they go from here.","May 14, 2015","true","17.0"," 52 of 56 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","52","56","0","2"

Altho the "8 chapters" may be misleading at the start. Since every chapter is pretty short by itself, usually just one mission.\n\nNow, the actual reviewing starts. I havent played into it too much, I am just 3 chapters in, but that was already enough to see some core gameplay.\n\nlets start up with the battle system - The card based system may seem a bit complicated at the start, but in the end - its not. Cards have 5 Levels - 1,2,3,4 and S - and 5 actions - Attack, Special, Block, Dodge and Magic. you draw a hand of 8 and pick 3 of them. higher card does its action and when its a standoff there is a rock paper scissors system to determin who gets a hit in. Strategy comes in when you take enemy Prediction into account, meaning the color of their cards. but theres a guy right at the start explaining you all that.\nAnd even tho it seems ovrwhelming at the beginning, it flows from your hand after 2 or 3 fights.\n\nnow to the art style - the FaceArt is pretty well made, the Intro and Chapter End Pictures all have a nice feel and good handdrawn style to them. the world is pretty colorful, altho sometimes a little overwhelming (more later). The character models themselves seem to bee pretty SD style, means they are more head than anything else.\n\nMusic - from what I could experience, the usic is good. Battle music gets one pumped and the town has that nice quiet peaceful feeling.\n\nbut I cand give all good things. some negative stuff that sprung to me.\n\nfirst of all, You are playing a thief whose dayjob is to be a Private Investigator... best part - he goes thieving without any different outfit. He is out there in the same gear he can be seen through the day. then in the 3rd chapter someone actually comes into your office, having a job fr your thief Alter Ego... I will take it that the Guards are really stupid, this is a THief training Town or Suspension of disbelief.\n\nthen, the city is horribly cluttered. At least the starting one. Some paths cant be seen until you run into them, same with pickups. a lot of buildings you can only identify by waltzing right in.\n\nall in all, I like it. Its to be recommended.\n\nPS: if the dev reads this - could it be that this is a sidestory-ish of tears for Tiara ?  since I get a vibe from some names (namely the namegiving "Goddess Tear" as well as an Item that summons Tiara in Battle.","September 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","48","54","0","0"

Yes this is an rpgmaker game but it is different from 99.9% of them. It has it's own menu (not that crap pre made one) i am pretty sure it has it's own music which is not bad.\n\nThe battle system is unique which is rare for a game made on rpgm If i am not mitaken this uses the vx version  ?  Anyhow to the point it uses a card / luck based system You have you defend cards attack cards spell card and you evasion cards. So how this battle systems works is like this.\n\nenemy                                                           you\n2 defend  3 attack 2 attack                          3 attack 4 magic 3 defend\n\nEach card has a value up to 5  (1,2,3,4,S=5)   The set up i have above me will work like this\n\nOn the first turn since i have 3 attack his 2 defend will do nothing. Other then reduce the damage. On the next turn i have 4 magic and he has 3 attack  magic is casted at random so sometimes you will get a buff spell or and attack or healing spell. Let's say we get an atack spell. we would basically negate his attack. (i think)   now he has 2 attack and i have 3 defend his attack would do nothing.\n\nthere is a way to tell which card is which but that is explained in game. you can change the colour of you cards to try and fool the other player/monster  so there is a bit a thinking involved.  being a different rpgm game i would have to say give this a go it will not be for everyone.\n\nthere are stats involved attack defense evasion ect when you level up you gain a point and you can choose which stats to increase.\n\n","October 4, 2014","true","10.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheepishly/recommended/316840/","sheepishly","Tina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheepishly/","91 products in account","Please do note that this game is made in 2005, so it's a fairly old game that was recently translated.\n\nNonetheless, Sacred Tears TRUE is probably one of the most solid RPG maker games I've ever played. Thankfully, it doesn't seem to use any of the presets, for the character sprites (though I admit I don't really favor it that much), portraits, tile sets, down to the very menu itself, unlike many RPG maker games on Steam. Moreover, there are several CGs that are well drawn between each chapter and some boss fights, though a bit rough, but consistent. The music sounds like most JRPGs, but it's still of good quality, and doesn't feel the least bit annoying.\n\nThe game's description is pretty accurate, so do take a look at it if you're interested. The game is put into an episodic format, with 24 chapters for the main story and 24 chapters of side quests (although the first one is just a free play chapter to explore around the town). Each chapter lasts as long as a couple minutes to well, under an hour, depending on how much you explore/grind/etc.\n\nThe plot pretty much consists of Seil, a low-rank, wannabe thief, along with his childhood friend Seana, doing various of jobs through their daily lives (time progression is notable, actually, if you pay attention to the tree colors in the outskirts). Ultimately, Seil seeks to steal the ultimate treasure of the empire, the Sacred Tear; it's a dream of every thief in Genoseed. A more "dramatic" plot does slowly unveil as the chapters go on, but it's nothing really memorable. I didn't really like that the background story of the Genoseed/the Empire/Holy Church kind of isn't extremely clear. You'll pick up some as the missions go along and talking with NPCs, but through most of the game I was kind of unsure what to think of them.\n\nBut somehow, the character development makes up for that. Each character is rich with personality, especially Seil, a hot-headed, often reckless kid (who the other characters kind of often poke fun at), and Seana, who is the more mature of the two, but easily provoked, especially by Seil. The dialogue is fairly light-hearted for the most part (and expect a good amount of it --it's an RPG), and overall it made the game a fairly relaxing experience.\n\nLike someone else said, much of the game consists of running around, but as someone who actually hates exploring in RPGs (shoot me), I didn't mind it. There is a good number of "hidden" items you may want to pick up, whether to craft items, sell for fil ( the game's currency), or to improve the level of your characters skills.  Besides, you can dash with Z (oh and if the dash bar/chapter name on the screen bothers you, you can press shift to make it go away or move it to another arrangement), so it cuts down a lot of the time. You'll pass by most of the items in each chapter on the way doing most of the storyline work. Plus the area of exploration is pretty small. It's called a "City Adventure" for a reason. There's one central area, with different sectors of the down, along with a suburb, and the town outskirts. It's difficult to get lost, and they do clearly tell you where you need to go.\n\nNow for the battle system itself, I admit that the tutorial kind of misses out on a lot of information. The manual does help with it though, especially explaining the stats, with things like Seana's "judge" wasn't exactly clear (it's her judgement of what type of magic to cast, whether that's fire, frost, spark, ATK up, DEF up, or Healing) or Seil's "evade" stat, which the tutorial called "agility" (it's how accurate Seil can predict the enemy's cards/moves). If you do mess up though, you can redistribute stats any time during the game (on the field) by going to the menu ~> status screen. I also found it helpful to change it around during different boss battles, especially if you have difficulty beating the boss.\n\nThere are only like five kinds of normal enemies though, but they are just recolored over the chapters, getting harder (a cat, slime, dog, a trio of bats, and soliders...well six if you count gangsters (but they forever look the same)). Along with some secret field bosses (that drop acessories) and other general storyline bosses.\n\nAlthough some didn't feel like the card system had depth. I felt differently. The card system lays out 9 different cards at a time for you. They will range in numbers from 1 to 4 (and sometimes... "S" or "5" I can't tell, but the number is in gold). You can choose three of them in certain order. The enemy will choose 3 as well. Now, there are 5 different type of cards: attack, special attack, dodge, defend, and magic (which is what Seana is for, who stays in the back with no HP bar of her own). The cards with the highest value wins, but in the case of ties, certain cards will beat others or have a tie. For example, a 4 attack card will counter out any special or magic attack, but will lose against dodges or blocks (in which the opponent can use a counter attack if it's...two successful ones in a row I think? I might be wrong).\n\nThe game tends to hint what cards the enemy will be using. Green typically means a defend or dodge. Blue typically means an attack. Red typically means a strong attack. A red "CAUTION" means that one of those cards are of a 4 value (but it's any type of card). But this isn't always. The higher your evade stat, the more accurate the predictions are. It won't ever be perfect though. An enemy can "bluff". So what's the point of strategy then? Well, as you use up cards you will recieve new cards of new values, and if you use your highest values first, you're more than likely going to wind up with card values of 1/2. Now, if you know the enemy is probably not even going to attack this turn, you can use rid of those cards (sometimes nothing can happen, like if you're both on the defensive), though be wary if they're a type of attack card (not including magic) as it can result in a counter attack. Of course, this doesn't mean that a high attack value card isn't hiding in there either. You can also do this if you feel that you can take another blow this turn. Though I will say that sometimes a fairy can come and increase a random card value by one, or switch one or more cards with a new one.  And sometimes a 1 value attack card will turn into a red 4 attack card, which I think just happens by chance. Yes, luck does apply in this game, but in a turn-based game, when doesn't it?\n\nThere are potions (each health 50% HP) in this game that can be used at the start of any turn with shift. You will gain potions periodically, for a reason I haven't quite figured out. It might be turns or some other condition during battle. Max is 10, though you can trade 10 potions for a kit that you can use to provide yourself with more potions when you run out. There are also auto revivals you can craft or buy, although hard to craft or somewhat pricy. There are other items you can craft to help aid you in battle, though I haven't quite bothered.\n\nOh, and if you're really lazy to even think during battle, like during a boss battle. You can give Seil a fair amount of HP, no additional attack, no evade, and really high defense. Then give Seana high magic attack, and low judgement. This way the enemy only can really hit you 1~5, even with hard hitting special attacks. The only way you can attack though in this method is by Seana's magic attack. Though if she keeps using buffs instead of attacks, well...it takes forever.\n\nTL;DR I recommend this game as it's a solid RPG. The character development is great, the dialogue can be amusing, and overall it's a fairly relaxing experience. I don't feel pressured to grind or explore aimlessly (oh yeah, there's no random battles). I personally find the battle system to be pretty refreshing. But if you're still unsure if you want this game, there's a demo you can download on their homepage.","December 15, 2014","true","66.9"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

The game starts with the pair involved in a heist that goes south, and barely escaping before their monetary issues come to the forefront. As the main plot goes on, the player is drawn into their quest to steal a "Sacred Tear" (a highly-prized relic) from an art gallery, as well as dealing with machinations from their own guild and a neighbouring province looking to invade.\n\nThe best part about the game is that it takes place in a serialized fashion. You can pick and choose whether to carry on with the main story or pick up "side jobs" that often don't have combat, and are usually fetch quests for other people. Interestingly, the dialogue of NPCs you find in the city of Genoseed changes mission-to-mission, which does a great job of investing the player into the world and the characters' lives.\n\nThe game also has a battle system, which is where some of the flaws begin to expose themselves. You fight by drawing three cards in a glorified game of rock-paper-scissors, where certain commands (like dodging or attacking) trump other commands. After a certain point (and depending on whether you're overleveled), it becomes less a series of strategic moves and more a question of whether you start with enough attack/high-level cards (only found through new cards revealed during battles) that you can take down a high-level enemy before they kill you.\n\nThe music is well-orchestrated and fits with with the 90s aesthetic, but this in turn reveals another problem with the game - there are no graphic/sound options whatsoever. You either have to listen to the same track repeated over and over as you walk through Genoseed, or turn your volume off. Luckily, the game isn't resource-intensive, but it can still be annoying for some people.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the game (and frankly, with a lot of RPGMaker games) is that there's no map to tell you where to go. More than once, I started a mission and had no idea what building I was supposed to go to next, spending time running in and out of districts until I found the place I needed to be.\n\nIt doesn't help matters that the game practically requires you to have a guide in order to unlock the last few side missions, which only appear once you amassed $300,000. You pretty much have to scrounge for every secret room, hidden item and way of making money in order to achieve this goal, and I don't expect that many people would be able to do it without a walkthrough.\n\nLikewise, the plot meanders for long periods of time, and the main character (Seil) is a bit of a fool who never really bothers to change his ways or ignores obvious cues people tell him throughout the game. The real star is Seana (who often chastizes you for your habits), who generally keeps things in check when Seil is lost, but doesn't have nearly enough to do in the game.\n\nIn the end, Sacred Tears TRUE stands out as a highlight among the glut of RPGMaker clones on Steam, and focuses on a "slice-of-life" story with lots to see, do and explore in an interesting way. It's just a shame that there are some minor issues that keep it from achieving true greatness.","August 6, 2015","true","12.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Personally I prefer this, as the characters in general are quite entertaining and they have a nice chemistry with one another. You play the role of Seil, a dude who wants to be a major thief, along side him is his child hood friend Seana.\n\nGameplay - I find that this game have relatively great gameplay for an rpgmaker title. You steal, your craft to some degree and you sell items. On your journey, you have quite a few problems to solve, and usually you can solve them in more than 1 way, usually the more in your face way will be less thief like and or cost you money. The battle system is what I consider the most important element next to characters in an rpg. It's a RPS turn based system with a bit of luck involved. It mostly consists of 5 actions:\n\nStrong Attack - beats dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with attack and magic if they're of the same level.\nAttack - loses to dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.\nMagic - beats dodge and defend if they're of the same level. It has a stalemate with strong attack and attack if they're of the same level.\nDefend - beats attack if they're of the same level. Loses to strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.\nDodge - beats attack if they're of the same level. Loses to strong attack and magic if they're of the same level.\n\nThe highest level card will always win, an example would be despite the fact that Strong attack beats dodge if they're the same level, if you attack with a level 2 strong attack amd the opponent happens to be using a level 3 dodge, the dodge will trump the strong attack. Looking at the strength and weaknesses above, you're probably thinking you should only use strong attacks or magic every chance you get. Well, you can't. This is where some of the "Luck" part of the game comes into play. In order to do any of the above actions, you must have the corresponding card to do so. When the fight begins you are assigned a total of 9 cards, these cards comes in varying levels of 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each turn you must use any 3 cards. When the next turn comes around you will automatically draw 3 new cards.\n\nThe enemies you fight are limited to only using Strong Attacks, Attack, Defend and Dodge. The cards are color coded so you can guess about 80% of the time what enemy is gonna do, but you have little way of knowing the level of their action. Sometimes the enemy will try to bluff you, making you think a card they're using is a particular card, when in fact it's not. This doesnt happen too often, and your chances of prediction increases with Seil's agility parameter.\n\nSound - Pretty good, sfx in fights sounds about right. The music is great imo.\n\nReplay Value - I don't feel there's much if at all any, it's relatively impossible to miss a side event unless you wished to. However the game seems relatively long, I've only put 22 hours into the game and I feel confident that the game will last at least another 10-12 hours.\n\nTldr? Buy it. It's a great rpg for $10 with lovable characters and a fun battle system.","October 12, 2014","true","31.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It was nice to have a system that was more about managing risk than exploiting the enemies weaknesses though. There's a demo out for this game so rather than talk about it if you're interested just go try it out.\n\nThe plot feels like it ends up going nowhere and probably 3/4ths of it is everyday character interactions, which isn't that bad but after spending so much time with these characters (23 hrs + some missed content) I just wished there was a more compelling / interesting plot. If i had to compare it to something it's like a slice of life JRPG, if that sounds interesting to you then by all means pick this up.\n\nAnother thing that got to me was that the playable map was incredibly small, essentially it's just the one town and a handful of dungeons. This game has 20+ hours of content with 24 main missions and 24 side ones. The problem with this is that quite a number of these missions involve you running around the town talking to every NPC you see in order to advance said missions, which gets old fast. There are a few missions which take you "out" of the main town but it's just a scene cut into whatever building the plot requires you to be in. If the devs could have worked in another town or two, expanded on the plot a bit, and cut out the filler I feel like it would have done wonders for this game\n\nIn spite of those flaws the game does have it's merits. The CGs and character portraits were well drawn and even though the gameplay and story weren't exceptional it all came together to create a comfy experience. That's the real draw of this to me though, it's just a nice relaxing experience that was able to easily string me along for 20 some hours, I just wish there was more to it in the end.\n\n\n\n\nSeana is the cutest","September 28, 2014","true","23.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","2"

The amount of customization that went into this RPG Maker game is pretty impressive. From a technical standpoint, I'm not displeased. The character design and artistic direction also overall remains satisfactory.\n\nWhere things fall apart actually is the writing. It falls flat more often than not. You'll start a mission or side story and just as things begin to seem interesting, or you're invested in a cause, it immediately ends. For example, one of the last story missions I did involved me learning more about a shady finance company in town. The two main characters get involved in the plot, and then I sneak inside the building. It is not much of a scenario, we're done in less than five minutes with hardly a hitch other than one guy who tries to beat me up as I leave. The conclusion of the situation isn't even brought up in the ending, I simply return to my home and then can continue to the next part of the story where then in the next scenario I learn the company closed down. But why, how, I'm left with questions and I wish they were addressed.\n\nThere is no problem with the idea of playing town vigilantes or heroes or thieves, or whatever exactly I'm suppose to be. But the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The townspeople did not grow on me, nor did I connect with the main characters either. And that's a shame, cause this kind of idea really could work well if just a bit more effort was put into the writing quality.","February 14","false","9.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

But our cat is in another castle!, that said castle being a roof, then being a warehouse, would someone kindly stop doing that.\nAside from that the game is very good indeed, im yet to finish it as i have countles others to finish, but i could clearly recommend this one to any JRPG turn-based lover, but for now i must go to sleep, its late.

Story follows young thief that starts as unexperienced and hardly know and becomes most famous thief of the city at the end. Characters are likeable and seem to grow when story progresses and music is also nice.\n\nUnique battle system made battles enjoyable and there wasn't much need for grinding in order to beat bosses. Sometimes in battle bad luck strikes, when opponent puls three level four attacks with one or more special attacks, when you least expect it. It's still possible to survive from this, if you use health potions between opponents attacks.\n\nCutscenes were nicely drawn, but it is impossible to skip them and there were couple of times. Saving is also very important and game doesn't never ask if you would want to save. I learned in hard way, that it is always good to save after fight. Those wolves are so annoying >_<.

Again, I want to like and continue the game, but if looking up at a grind with the feeling of "Oh ♥♥♥♥s sake, this same thing AGAIN for a few hours?!", and more frustration and boredom than actually enjoying the game, I'd rather quit.\n\nThe combat consists of a card-game mechanic, whereby you place any attack/defence/dodge/special cards with numeric values against your opponents. Sounds decent, right? The bad part is that any cards you draw are random, with random values, but you can save some in your inventory to use for later. BUT your characters health also sticks around.\nThis creates the situation where you're basically forced to grind for cards with high numeric values and health potions against bosses, because bosses will always have such ridiculous luck with their cards it turns into a situation where you just have to throw enough health potions at your character to make sure he gets lucky enough to get those high value attack/special cards, assuming the enemy doesn't have a defense/dodge card of the highest value.\nYou're kept being forced out to go grind against enemies, but you also have to get lucky with these ♥♥♥♥ers or you're again forced to spend more health potions and saved high value cards than you're actually getting.","February 28","false","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I want to point out that the other reviews address legitamate issues, like the font size/style (the game need to have the japanese localized font to look better, there is a post about how to do this). There are complaints about the simplicity of the games' combat, admittedly the combat doesn't have too much depth but is still fun for that same reason. At times you will not think about how you are using your cards (randomly given card based combat, you will see) others I literally take like 5+ minutes before make a move. There is luck involved sometimes but for the most part if you strategize well battles will be a breeze. Don't forget to look at the guide attached to the game. It's the readme.html file, explains how to play, what stats are for and what they do (the game isn't thorough about explaining these in-game).\n\nThe Pros:\nInnovative-fun combat system albeit somewhat repetitive(stategic at times)\nfun Dialoge\nSerious plot moments, satisfying conclusion\nMaybe some Romance (I thought it was nice)\nCute art design\nMemorable Characters\n\nThe Cons:\npoorly styled text (have to manually get japanese localized font to fix)\nTrue ending is REALLY HARD to get (well you have to check everywhere since enemies don't drop fil)\nGame still good without True ending\nCombat takes a while to get used to\nCertain characters plot not flushed out enough (i didn't unlock ALL chapters so that may be why)\n\nAll-in-All a great wonderful game I'd recomend to ppl that don't mind playing an RPGmaker style game, and are looking for something with great story and decent gameplay.\n","May 5","true","92.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
