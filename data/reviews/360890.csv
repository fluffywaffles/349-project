There is no interaction, with anything, not even doors or animals.\nWhatever you do, do NOT click the left mouse button, it resets you to the beginning of the game... and to make matters worse, it starts a new music track that plays OVER the currently playing one which makes it sound absolutely horrible and even louder.\nWith the exception of a few animals, most do not have any proper AI and just loop an idle animation, sometimes in perfect synchronization with other animals around them.\nAnd Finally... "Winter" mode, is LITERALLY just summer mode with snowflakes.\n\nIn short. Don't bother, at least not yet.

I usually enjoy them from time to time. This game on the other hand offers really nothing. You start at one point and end at another. There is no dialoge in the game so all you are doing is walking through the woods listening to the same 30 second song over and over again. It would have been nice to have had some interaction with the world as well. Being able to open some doors and look around at the cool looking buildings. But all you can do is wave at the buildings and walk on by. The game is only 5 bucks but I really can't recommend this game at all.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxB6oftruXo","April 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 83 of 99 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","83","99","6","0"

I did not like the negative reviews I read because they all complained that there wasn't anything to do. Well, I thought we all knew that going in.\nThere is so much already placed in here that the devs will open up to us, even crates which will surely be loot for us since there would be no other reason for them to be there.  I just went exploring and found much to enjoy. Besides items, and things like turtles and frogs, blue dragonflies and flocks of birds, theres buildings and a water tower, a tree house with a broken latter which I'm looking forward to climbing up into.\nThere is more stuff besides.  I glitched my way past an invisible barrier and fell off the top of a mountain. I thought I was going to die, there was blood, but I didn't, and found some stuff!\nWell, I had a very good time. I'm going to love it farther along in the development, and the music is beautiful.\nWhen I fell off the mountain I never could  find a way out so I had to exit the game.\nFor five bucks why not buy it. Help the developer out to bring this game along. It will be worth it, to me anyway.\nHopefully they will never...EVER....put a zombie or monster in here.

The scenery is beautiful however, and it's a relaxing atmosphere. There is a slowed down effect throughout the entire experience, which does have a certain charm to it, but that gets old after a time, especially if you want to rush over to explore a building - which you will only be able to explore to outside of. None of the buildings you can enter. Relaxing music is played, which is nice, but noticably repetitive after a time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demexicaam/recommended/360890/","demexicaam","DeMexi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demexicaam/","67 products in account","A nice experience, but the game's rough around the edges.\n\nThis casual exploration game was also tagged as being an action, adventure and simulation game, and that might give readers the wrong idea. Although there's a hint of adventure, there is little action or simulation to be found in The Lost Valley. You basically walk around and discover the scenery.\n\nCall it The Vanishing of Ethan Carter minus the gameplay.\n\nIt makes for a very light-hearted experience, which I personally quite enjoyed. If a relaxing 30 minute playthrough without much goals or gameplay sounds appealing to you, then I think you'll find you'll like it. If it doesn't, The Lost Valley won't be able to hold your attention for too long.\n\nFirst off, the game really thrives on the Cryengine. The graphics are wonderfully vivid and the physics are impressive. Most plants move elegantly in the wind and are pushed aside when you walk through them. The animations and models used for the various animals look lively and shadows look nice as well.\n\nThe game really allows you to immerse into its world, but from time to time you'll find yourself uncomfortably drawn back to reality by the unpolished side of The Lost Valley.\n\nThe developers use invisible walls to prevent the player from straying too far from the intended path.\n\nSound produced by waterfalls starts and stops abruptly instead of fading in and out as you move.\n\nThere's a bunch of visual quirks, such as puddles of water that show circles from rain drops when it's not raining and tree branches that move through solid objects.\n\nThe player itself is also poorly animated. You can often walk on water and when you're moving through shallow waters, your arms will make swimming motions above the water. The player's shadow also looks kind of weird when you're walking.\n\nMost importantly, the speed at which you walk is frustratingly slow, and there's no option to run.\n\n\nThe game is quite enjoyable despite of issues like these, but it could easily be improved. As such it feels like a late beta: in good shape technically, but still in need of some serious player feedback. Let's hope the developers find the resources to put out a couple of paches and polish this into what it could be.\n\nAt the moment, The Lost Valley is fun for a single playthrough, solo or with friends. And it's fairly priced.","April 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","19","38","0","0"

This however does not last very long.\n\nThe first thing that hits you when you start to take your walk is the lack of ambiant sound effects, While yes there are some in the game they seem to only be triggered at certain points, The walking should be a constant sound effect, But i only heard it a couple of times throughout the whole demo. There was no wind brushing though the trees, There was no wildlife or sounds of water when walking through the ponds. All these things while easy to place into the game should i fell have been there thoughout rather than just at triggered moments in the demo.\n\nThe next thing to mention is the soundtrack used in the demo, It is awful the first couple of minuets the sound track is the one used in the trailer which in my opinion i was all for i love that type of harmonic music, It all went down hill when that track had finished, It was then replaced by what i can only describe as somone mashing random keys on a piano it was grating and the game lost all of its idyllic setting, I found myself wanting to get to the end alot quicker.\n\nGraphically i cannot fault the demo ,Cryengine is one of if not the best engine on the market at the moment, With it's easy to use machanics and high levle of quality cryengine was an ideal choice for this type of demo. Some things for the devs though, I have worked with cryengine in the past and i noticed the in-game CC was not locked, I was messing around with some commands and while most of the settings where ideal for the experiance there where things like, Level of Detail, Particles, Image Post-Processing and Fps Cap i found myself changing to give a better visual experiance.\n\nAs far as the actually game play is concerned the is not much to it you walk crouch and jump, While crouching and jumping are in the Demo there is no real need for them to be used as the whole Demo can be finished without them, While walking around there is only one point i found myself walking off the track to a building, one thing that would of been a nice thing to add is the ability for explore even if it was to the point of entering buildings or multiple paths to give the Demo some reply value.\n\nAll in all i did enjoy the experiance, If they would remove the piano soundtrack and add the things i mentioned in the review it would complete this game. For £4 i would reccommend this while short in lenght it is a well designed concept of what Cryengine can do.","April 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 30 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","8","30","0","0"

I would reccomend this to anyone who needs a stress relief.\n\nAlso, to everyone hating on this game: it IS a walking simulator, you should read about what you're buying before you buy it. And yes, there are ambient sounds, stop being deaf and try and enjoy the game.\n\nTo the dev: very nice game, would buy more of these. Keep up the nice work.\n\nUploaded some highlight screenshots.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\n\n2. Pound the chicken breasts to about 1/8 inch thickness. In a shallow plate or bowl, mix together the bread crumbs and parsley. Place a slice of cheese on each breast, roll up tightly, then dip into the egg and then the bread crumb mixture. (Note: Hold roll closed; after dipping, you will see that it begins to stay together).\n\n3. In a large skillet, saute garlic in olive oil. Add roll ups and brown quickly, just enough for the chicken to have a crisp outer coating. Remove roll ups from skillet and drain on paper towels.\n\n4. Pour 1/2 of the chicken broth into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add all four roll ups. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, basting once with the remaining broth.","April 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 13 of 47 people (28%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","28","13","47","21","1"

But how often do we actually hear the nitty-gritty details of how we might actually achieve those things? Bustle has enlisted Vanessa Marin, a licensed sex psychotherapist based in San Francisco, to help us out with the specifics. This week’s topic: How to masturbate.\n\nQ: I’ve heard the advice that you need to learn how to get yourself off by masturbating. I’ve tried masturbating before, but I just can’t figure out how to do it without a vibrator. Sure, some things feel good, but unless I use a toy, I can’t reach ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with just my hand. It’s just that nothing ever feels that amazing, and I give up. I feel like an idiot! Is something wrong with me? What should I do?\n\nA: Please don’t feel badly! No one ever gets taught how to masturbate, and there are plenty of women who feel just as clueless as you do. I’ve been asked this question by almost every female client I’ve ever had.\n\nI “prescribe” masturbation to most of my clients, so I’ve come up with specific instructions for learning how to masturbate. Let’s go through the steps.","April 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","13","3","24","5","1"
