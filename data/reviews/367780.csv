As friendly as this game looks, you will die a lot.  Is it a rage quit game?  I've had a chance to check out for a few hours so let's find out.\n\nAero's Quest is the classic tale of saving the girl.  Aero has to solve puzzles and platform his way to save Ariella from the evil Andraus.  The game is based on hitting switches to deactivate a laser barricade.  Each level gets trickier and trickier as more puzzles and platforms are introduced.  The Steam page says it's like Super Meat Boy meets Megaman.  But there's no shooting, so I'm not sure where the megaman comparison came from.\n\nThe highlight of the game is the challenge.  It's a rage quit type of game.  You will die many times trying to pass these levels.  And the challenge varies between timed platforming and puzzles.  There's a few dynamic elements from power ups to teleporters that will effect how you finish the puzzles.   Repetitive dying can be a bit frustrating, but each level has a distinct challenge.\n\nThe controls can feel a bit floaty at times.  Which is annoying because so many jumps require perfect timing.  Then there's sections when there are too many random obstacles.  Sometimes it's more a matter of luck than skill to pass these sections.\n\nThe art style also has good and bad points.  It looks very friendly even though ironically you end up smashing into a million bloody piece when you die.  The characters look cool and the environments look nice.  But it doesn't really have any signature details.  You're just kind of tossed into random areas like forests or volcanos.\n\nAero's Quest isn't a bad game, but it has a few flaws.  If you want a challenging indie platformer you can give Aero's Quest a shot.  If you get frustrated easily, proceed with caution.

Personally, I think the game has an old school mega man feel to it. The puzzles are extremely varied, but not overly complicated. Special power ups such as Speed Boost, Stealth, and High Jump are sometimes found, making some puzzles easier or more difficult depending on the situation. This looks and feels like a game for the original NES. There are leaderboards for competing with others, a speed-run mode and more. If you like puzzle games and don't mind going a little retro, Aero's Quest will probably be a fun little puzzle platform for you.","July 16, 2015","true","2.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/367780/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Puzzle-platformers are an interesting genre. The game has to have a decent balance of both platforming elements and controls as well as puzzle elements to keep fans of both genres entertained and satisfied. Aero’s Quest attempts to achieve just that. From screenshots and videos it seems more platforming than puzzle at first glance, but let’s take a deeper look to see if Aero’s Quest can bring out the best of both genres.\n\nAero’s Quest revolves around Aero who is attempting to save his girlfriend Ariella who has been taken captive by a fearsome android named Andraus. After Andraus captured Ariella, he also captured Aero and partially turned him into a machine before dumping him back into the woods.  Now Aero must prove his love to Ariella before Andraus can rip it apart. In other words, it’s your basic story of “boy likes girl, villain also likes girl, villain takes the girl, and you have to rescue her”.\n\nThe game is comprised one hundred stages which is spread across five areas, each separated into two parts with ten stages in each. In each stage you’ll find anywhere from one to several red switches on the ground. To complete each stage you have to turn on each switch by stepping on it which opens a cage at the end that contains Ariella, then reach the cage only to have Andraus take her away. Kind of Meat Boy-esque in a way. Unsurprisingly it’s not typically as straight forward as that as you’ll have to occasionally find keys to open locks to some of the switches, dodge enemies, and basically find the best way to accomplish all of this without getting hit even once.\n\nThe early stages are simple enough; hit the switches and get out. As the game progresses you’ll be introduced to different enemies and obstacles you have to avoid such as cannons and rockets that shoot out from the walls, as well as a few different power-ups to collect such as temporarily being able to jump higher or the ability to slow down time.  These add some interesting mechanics to the game, but at times can seem a bit misplaced. I’ve seen a couple of times that I’ve had to backtrack through some obstacles and the game gives you a stealth power-up to pass right through them, as it would be very difficult otherwise, but then a stage or two later you have a very similar scenario and the game gives you a Time Warp power-up instead. Granted that slows down time but with the fire rates and speeds of some of the bombs and rockets, it’s still difficult to find the right moment to proceed without getting blown up, even with time slowed down.\n\nThe controls aren’t too bad but they feel a bit tight and loose at the same time. The controls are very responsive and you can even change directions in the air on a whim, but the jumping itself is kind of floaty. What I mean by that is when you jump you kind of float back down a bit as opposed to realistically descending at a normal rate. It’s hard to put into words but think of various classic games such as Mario and Mega Man, or even more recent games like Axiom Verge.  When you jump up you come down at a reasonable rate.  Here it’s a bit more slow and can throw off your timing or make various obstacles hard to avoid.  I swear I had one stage early on in which I died close to two dozen times at a set of steps that launched out rockets because I kept mistiming my landing speed and end up landing right on a rocket.\n\nGraphically the game looks okay.  I wouldn’t say it’s anything to write home about, but it’s not bad either.  It fits the game pretty nicely, but there is one thing that I have to complain about, and that’s the foreground.  The game has around one hundred stages taking place across several different environments, but sometimes the foreground and area effects can actually hinder things, such as in the volcanic area.  I appreciate the art as well as the heat effects they put in, but on numerous occasions they’ve actually hindered my progress and I’ve lost several lives because the foreground blocked my vision of what was ahead.\n\nIn terms of replay value there’s quite a bit if you can manage to clear the stages themselves first. You have the ability to replay any level you’ve already cleared in an attempt to earn stars with each stage giving you three possible, and sadly all three are earned the exact same way every time…and I don’t mean “it’s always X amount of points and such”, but the exact…same…way.The first star is for getting at least 1500 points, the second star for nabbing at least two drones in each stage, and the third for finishing it without dying.  However, if you fulfill any of these requirements when you first play through the stage while going through the story, you’ll already have that star completed when you go back to it later.\n\nFinally there’s a speedrun mode which lets you basically rush through the game in two different ways: either the entire game as a whole or each set of ten stages (keep in mind that each of the five areas has two parts of ten stages each).  I like this as outside of the full game run you only have to worry about ten stages, but there are two things I thought would have been done differently.  First, I’m a little curious as to why you can do each individual part, but not the area as whole. Second, you can even do the areas that you haven’t even been to yet.  I figured that like when going for the achievement stars you’d have to have an area available in the story to speed run it, but apparently not.  I was able to go straight to the last area in Speed Run mode before I was anywhere near it in Story mode…not that I recommend it, I died a lot.\n\nIn the end, Aero’s Quest is a fun and challenging game if you like puzzle-platformers, but it’s not without its flaws and a couple of them can frustrate some players quickly.The foreground elements can on a few occasions get in your way, but not to the point that it’s a major hindrance for the entire game.The jumping is probably the worst area for me and, again, it’s not game breaking or anything, but I felt like a lot of the deaths weren’t necessarily because of me, but because of how the game handles the jump physics. Overall if you like puzzle games of this nature, this is one to check out and give a shot.","November 6, 2015","true","47.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This game hits a niche audience, as the game as a puzzle platformer for the average gamer will not hit the notes that one would hope from the genre, as elements of its game design can cause a unique amount of frustration in the player with unconventional level design and some out there change up in the genre. However, that's what I have to specifically point out: those who love frustrating platformers, there is something unique here as the game definitely hits that portion of it, and what makes it stand out in that particular sub-genre is the variety of levels on display, as a good mix up of levels keeps it fresh. In the end, it's not the game for me or the average player, but there are elements that will make it appeal to those who like the frustrating platformer genre.\n\nGameplay and Video First Impressions : http://youtu.be/_f5mx2Gd-FA\n\nLists:\n+:\nKeeps up the challenge. Frustrating gameplay is the highlight here.\nVariety in the levels keeps things fresh through out the game, even with the same mechanics.\nPuzzle elements are done decently.\nUnique look.\nDevelopers are responsive. Very Responsive, when video came out, they brought a change almost immediately with the design. That bodes well. -:\nThe visuals don't work at times for the game.\nThe Design of the game mechanics can feel unfair and cause trial and error gameplay. While frustrating platformers are expected to be “unfair”, there's challenge, and then there's design going against you.\nSome odd choices in controller button options where smarter button options were available. For example, restarting a level is R3, where back and the bumper keys are not used.\nMusic starts to wear on you.","June 8, 2015","false","3.5"," 13 of 37 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","13","37","3","0"
