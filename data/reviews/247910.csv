"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/247910/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","But, Mien Fuhrer... this is only one part of the trilogy... we need all three parts to protect us...\nRight. So. Hum. Sniper Elite : Nazi Zombie Army 2. The title alone reads like the gaming equivalent of Sharknado. It probably should be the gaming equivalent of Sharknado, going so far off the hysterically ridiculous scale that it actually warps around to awesome. Let's start with what this game is not - It is not in any way to be taken seriously, it is not to be played with the kind of serious approach that one might use for say, Call of Duty. That's not to say it's easy or anything, quite the opposite, but to get the most out of this game, you need to stop, put your brain in neutral, and only then, run the game.\n\nThe opening cutscene, using the ingame engine no less, provides a rather amusing explanation to how Hitler ended up meeting his maker at the hands of the very zombies he released in a sort of last ditch attempt to protect his empire. Yes, I actually had to watch the intro twice, the first time I was too busy laughing to make much sense of it all, but it's nice to know that the developers in this case played him almost as Ren from Ren and Stimpy. I near expected him to scream "YOU STUPID EEEEEDIOT" before pummeling his lieutenant with the mcguffin.\n\nYOU! TELL! ME! THIS! NOOOOOW?\nWe're talking pure B movie brilliance, it's wrong in every possible way and yet the mixture somehow results in being entertaining, and that extends to the game. These zombies are not the L4D rushing mobs of screaming gnashing teeth, but rather the zombies of old. Slow, shambling, numerous. A slow and ever advancing wave of undead flesh, many of which are still decked in their uniforms and wearing helmets - this element is important, the gun modelling has been lifted from Sniper Elite V2 and as a result, deflections from indirect hits can and will happen. Additionally simply riddling a corpse with bullets isn't a total guarantee that they will stay down, more often than not they'll resurrect a short while after and require re-killing. The only solution, as with any good/terrible zombie trope is to shoot them in the head.\n\nUnlike Sniper Elite V2's unforgiving and often po-faced approach, this one allows you to go nuts with the entire toolbox, not bother with all the stealth malarkey and go right in for the bangbangs. The result is a significantly better game, playing to the strengths of the V2 engine, complete with wonderful moments where you see your bullet go through an X-rayed version of a zombie, causing havoc as it tumbles. Grenades, tripwires, all of the fun things are yours to use and abuse, and the result is -glorious-. Carnage and havoc and a bodycount closer to the somme  - and that's just the first level.\n\nThe only real criticism is that the enemies don't change much, though the inclusion of kamikaze grenade holders and the odd Stormtrooper wielding a LMG do add some solid spice to proceedings, but let's be clear, you'll be shooting zombies. You need to like shooting zombies, a lot. This game hinges around that concept, see. It's in the Title. Nazi Zombie Army. There is an Army, of Nazi Zombies. You will be killing them. If that's not you're thing, you're in the wrong place.\n\nFor an apparently throwaway game the level of options is obscene...\nSeriously, one point I need to highlight. The options menu. This game delivers. In every possible way, if you want graphics customisation ohhhh boy does it deliver. Every possible option, slider and checkbox in the history of GPU tweaking exists here. Same for just about everything else, if you can change it, there's an option for it. Suffice to say, the game can be made to run on a massive spectrum of systems and will scale up to some amazing levels of pretty at the high end, whilst still managing to look good even on modest budget systems. This game set the standard for the Trilogy, and that didn't disappoint either.\n\nYou did nazi this surprise package coming did you...\nThe game looks fantastic, runs and scales well, and delivers on a wonderful B-movie supernatural experience. If you go in expecting that, you'll get what you paid for, and it will definitely give you your moneys worth. In shambling, stupefying, and groan inducing entertainment.\n\nHowever...\n\nWith the trilogy out, this now becomes something of a museum piece. The trilogy is now the place where all the cool kids are. This review will be held as a reference. But from now on, Sniper Nazi Zombie Army Trilogy is where people should be headed.\n\nVerdict : It's good, but the Trilogy is here...","November 26, 2013","true","4.5"," 344 of 404 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","344","404","0","11"

Where to begin?\nAh yes.\nJesus Christ.\nHow this game isn't branded as 'Sniper Elite: 5000 for the Achievement' is beyond me. You want zombies? This game gives you zombies: thousands of zombies. And I'm not talking Left 4 Dead's hordes that cack-handedly slap you in the face in the hopes of making you feel bad, every single one of the shambling fascists is more than capable of dishing out a bucketload of damage before you're able to shoot or kick them away. And yes, this version of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army comes with the ability to KICK. Thank God! A marked improvement over those awkward 'Oh God, it's right in front of me and slapping me with a torch, blindly noscope, blindly noscope!' moments from the previous instalments. I say instalments, since if an enemy was right in front of you in SE:V2, it turned into a frantic mess of you flipping your SMG out and randomly spraying.\nOh! That brings me to my next topic: The new weapons. Well, I say 'new' quite losely, since they were in the previous instalment of 'Hitler Forgot To Say The Lord's Prayer Before Playing With an Ouiji Board', but c'mon. What you're given is the set of DLC rifles from V2, including the good old fashioned Lee Enfield and M1 Carbine (My personal favourite), and a few other new toys including the MP44 and Webley revolver. I'm not saying they're bad weapons; By all means, use whatever you like since one rifle headshot puts down any regular shuffler with absolute ease.\nBut just know this: You miss a headshot, and that guy's probably gonna get right back up and smack you in the face with whatever is in his hand.\nAmong the hordes of normal mindless grunts, you do have a few guys to keep you on your toes.\nThere's undead Snipers in gasmasks, capable of leaping from perch to perch through a sheer disregard of the laws of physics.\nThere's Fire Gods, which are 8 foot tall burning men that supercharge other zombies if you don't stop them, and those zombies run at you like they're on fire (They really are. What a nice bloke, setting his mates on fire.)\nThere's everybody's favourite exploding runners, who run at you whilst screaming demonic noises that are actually marginally disturbing.\nAnd then, of course, there's your old pal: The giant, trench-coated MG42 operator that takes a good few headshots to take down.\nThey never said this would be easy to play. One wrong move, you're surrounded. One missed shot, he's already back on his feet. One wasted grenade, you've only removed 2 out of the 16 that are shambling at you. But with steady nerves, you can get through it.\nOf course, your nerves are unlikely to be steady when you discover the darker secrets of the game. Hitler is long gone from the Fuhrerbunker, so that's just one less problem. You wouldn't really have had time to kill him, anyway: You'll probably be discovering disturbing easter eggs, keeping an eye out behind you, and all while everything is probably plotting how to rip you to shreds. Mannequins can move themselves. Lights can change in an instant. Things can wake up without warning. And Sieges can happen at any time.\nYet, through all this, it's probably one of the best looking zombie games I've played for a while. Sure, the amount of mist and whatnot can play havoc with lesser PCs, so make sure you can run Sniper Elite V2 on at least medium before you give this one a go. Yes, there are probably more frightening zombie games. Yes, there might be games with a better co-op experience (EVERYBODY is going to be stealing grenades from each other in this one, so just get there first). And yes, there are DEFINITELY better zombie games available.\nBut for £10.00, this is probably one of the best available for a tenner and does come with an air of fear you just don't see in games anymore.\nAnd what was that you just saw shifting down that hall?\nBetter save that grenade, it's probably just another shuffler.","September 7, 2014","true","30.1"," 112 of 123 people (91%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","91","112","123","36","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/247910/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army 2 might have one of the dumbest titles I've seen so far, but it's an excellent, but short, co-op game. It's fun if you have a team of 4 dedicated people that you can trust. I have to see that most of the people that play this game at least try to stay connected. I remember the first game being awful, just because halfway through a game you'd practically always be alone. People left whenever things didn't go their way. This game is, so far, different and as I said it's one of the things that make it (more) fun.\n\nThe graphics are moody and the levels have a good atmosphere. They absolutely fit this game.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as the previous game. You just shoot as many zombies as you can, usually with a sniper rifle. And once in a while a special zombie will appear that requires a bit of (team) effort to take down.\n\nFinishing the game shouldn't take too long; there are only 5 levels to complete. Granted, they're pretty big and should take about 30-45 minutes to finish, usually going from point A to B to C while fighting off hordes of zombies. All you need is a good team. I'm sorry to say that once I finished all of these levels the desire to finish them again was non-existent. Which is unfortunate, because a co-op game should be all about playing with people. I guess it's because the levels are always the same and the zombies always spawn in the same places. So once you've seen it, you've seen it all. That's not a good thing for a game that's all about multiplayer.\n\nThat doesn't take away the fact that it's still a very, very enjoyable game. Just don't expect to play it for days and days.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","March 2, 2014","true","7.3"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","52","59","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/247910/","femboyancy","♥Princess Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","This game surprised me. Truly.\n\nHow many times have you not heard the concept of "Zombies have been done to hell and back. It's boring now, cliche, and generic 'horror' material. A solid go-to concept that game developpers, movie directors, and halloween costume fanatics go to in an effort to get the desired effect of creepy spooky scary, with minimal need for customization and story writing."\n\nSniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2, pretty much takes every preconception of Zombie themed horror games, and puts a bullet in its head with the carved words "Suck my tallywacker" put in the side.\n\n"I don't care that I'm generic. I don't care that I'm cliche. I don't care that I'm 'just another zombie flick', and I most certainly don't care that my storyline is on-par with World War Z! I'm a zombie game, where you snipe zombies, and magic is the cause. Don't like it? Go F yourself!"\n\nThat being said, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 manages to do something few titles have managed to do before. Take something cliche, and make it fun.\n\nGameplay\nHave you played Sniper Elite of ANY kind before? If yes, then you'll find nothing new here. Gameplay has gotten zero changes from the father-title Sniper Elite V2.\nFor those who havn't:\nThe gameplay takes place in a linear third person shooter type style, with predetermined 'jump out and get you' moments where entire flocks of zombies appear from around a corner. There are two moments in the game: There is traveling, where you're moving from point A to point B, with a few handfuls of Zombies to shoot here and there, nothing too stressful. The other is siege, where you hunker down in one spot, and put down trip wire explosives, land mines, dynamite etc., while sitting in your perch and trying to kill every zombie before they overwhelm your position. Between those are safe houses, where you can refill everything, and where you'll get a free checkpoint.\n\n"THIS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE LEFT 4 DEAD WTEGELKJBGKLAWBGKI"\nYeah, it does, doesn't it? That's cause it pretty much is L4D, except that it is in 3rd person, and only two kinds of zombies can run.\n\nGraphics\nSlightly outdated, but that's due to its engine being a few years old now, but it is definitely good enough for medium range rigs and up. I can attest to the fact that a computer more than 4 years old will not run this title above 5 FPS unless it was a top end rig in its hayday.\n\nSound\nI can best explain this by drawing a paralel to the once popular, now garbage TV show 'Lost'. You all remember how amazingly good that show was, but then the creators just started dragging it out, adding more and more bullcrap to it, until they tried to end it on a good note, and failed MISSERABLY!?!? That's pretty much what the sound is for me in this game. It's the one major draw-back in my book;\nThe sounds in the start of the game are pretty good. Really spooky scary, demonic whispers from Satan's world where you hear Hitler repeat sentences like "WE ARE ALL LOST!" and women crying for mercy etc. That's all pretty damned cool, and it really did a splendid job at setting the mood....\n....\nUntil you play through like 4+ levels, and realize that the music soundtracks...Ambient sounds...Hitlers little frantic demonic time looped yelling? Is all the same, unchanged. By the 6th level I was literally able to to IMMEDIATELY mimic Hitlers words cause they were on a time loop that I eventually learned by heart cause I started to count the time between them(It's 7 minutes and 30 seconds by the way).\nThe music though, is good, if a little uncharacteristic, but it's good music to shoot nazi zombie brains to mush with, so I'm not complaining too much in that regard.\n\nConclusion:\nWalk into this game expecting a linear, poorly narrated story that pretty much says 'unholy relic turns dead into zombies and only the relic holder controls them, assuming all parts of the relic are together....Which Hitler didn't quite realize until it was too late.' and you should be fine. I'd say its worth it, and to add a boost to the fun, the game permits many different difficulty varieties...The lowest to get a feel for the genre's controls and getting used to the playthrough etc. all the way up to Sniper Elite difficulty with a multiplier that goes up to as many as 4 times as many zombies as there normally would be(By the way, that means that for every 1 zombie in the normal game setting, there would be 4 extra ones in the highest multiplier)\nNaturally, the 1x(Standard) multiplier, plus the regular difficulty settings, are intended for single player playthroughs, whereas the multipliers are for the hardcore games where you cooperate with 3 other players. Yes, there's multiplayer by the way!\nI'd say, if you're into Zombie Games, and you have a group of like minded friends who want a shooter where you shoot magical satanic nazi zombies? Then this game is pretty much specifically created to suit your needs. If you're one of those 'ZOMBIE GAMES ARE DUMB, THIS IS DUMB, MAGIC IS DUMB, SATAN IS DUMB, I WANT Call of Duty BACK' people, then I suggest trying Hello Kitty Online instead...Yeah, I went there, deal with it.","November 3, 2015","true","9.2"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","90","37","41","14","5"

The biggest issue that I've noticed is that it wants to be a co-op "shooter" over a co-op "sniper."  There are far less areas for sniping and many more tight corridors and small rooms.  There is an addition of stationary turrets in some parts of the game.  While we all love a good stationary turret with unlimited ammo to blast zombies with, the machine guns can take from the experience that the first Nazi Zombie Army was going for.\n\nA few new enemies were implemented to help mix up the game-play.  None of them are ground breaking or innovative, but they do add to the game.\n\nIt all comes down to how much you enjoyed the first game.  SE:NZ2 is a fun, but it is not an epic title.  I personally found the achievements fun to hunt with a group of friends.\n\nOne other thing to take into consideration before getting this game is the lack of players.  The match making, like the first game, is dreadful.  If there are any public players on, you'll be lucky to find a team anyways.  Be sure to have a group of friends to play with if you are looking for a good co-op experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=200404875","May 18, 2014","true","14.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/247910/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3729 products in account","What would happen if, in an alternate timeline, the Nazis had a secret backup plan once they realized they were losing WWII: turn all the dead soldiers into zombies? Well, you'd get the basic plot of numerous video games and movies, I'd reckon. The Nazi Zombie Army subseries (which branched off from the Sniper Elite series of games) of games takes this basic plot idea and then gives you pretty much what you'd expect: an action-packed third-person shooter where you either work alone or with some friends to stop the Nazi zombie menace with the best tool at your disposal: a sniper rifle.\n\nThe BreakdownSo, what sets this game apart from other, similar titles? Well, I'd say the "bullet time" mechanic, where the camera briefly follows sniper rifle bullets as they whiz through zombies' faces.....but Sniper Elite V2 already has that. Hmm....well, it has co-op! Though....Nazi Zombie Army 1 had that too.... So, hmm. It's hard to discern what makes this game unique because, quite frankly, it isn't.\n\nThis game barely even differentiates itself from the first game in the series, and that's perhaps my biggest problem with it. I enjoyed Nazi Zombie Army 1 to an extent, so I was excited to try out the second one with a few friends. As we kept playing, I began to notice that this game was basically identical to the first game, with only a few minor differences. The "story" (if you can call it that) continues off from where the first game ended: 4 soldiers have just fought some zombies, and now they're trying to piece together some sort of relic thing to stop them.\n\nSo, NZA2 (as I'll be referring to it) has you moving through 5 bland-looking levels, shooting anything that moves, You have the option of bringing along some friends (which essentially breezes you through the game, even on the hardest difficulty setting, at a pace of about 2-4 hours per playthrough), or playing alone (which makes the game considerably harder - I beat NZA1 solo and it took 5-6 hours or so, and I'd imagine this game would be similar). Your opponents consist of generic-looking WWII soldier zombies, skeletons, explosive suicide zombies, "fire demons" (more on that), and "elite" zombies with machine guns that are pretty tough to kill. There's also zombies that summon more zombies and even sniper zombies (getting tired of the Z-word yet?).\n\nWell, are there any new additions? No, not really! The only noteworthy difference from this game to the first NZA game is that there's now "fire demons", which are essentially zombies set on fire that then set more zombies on fire to charge at you, similar to the explosive suicide zombies. They don't pose much of a challenge, and nor do most of the other enemies. The only real challenge comes when the game sends multiple elite zombies at you during "sieges", which are moments when the game wants you to hunker down and fight in a small area against numerous zombies. These moments are initially fun, but as the game progresses they serve to simply waste your time and add unnecessary padding to an already dull experience (in my opinion, of course). In fact, I'd say that a lot of the game's problems boil down to it being initially fun, but not particularly exciting thereafter.\n\nIt's a shame really, as I somewhat enjoyed NZA1. I'm mainly just disappointed that Rebellion chose the safe route in making a sequel by changing pretty much nothing from the first game and simply continuing what already existed. It's a lazy sequel, and a painfully average one at that, too.\n\nOh, and it doesn't help when a sequel has the same final boss as the first game.\n\nProsInitially engaging from a gameplay perspective. The first hour or so is pretty fun!\nThe bullet-time camera is always laughably silly and visceral to watch.\nGraphics are what you'd expect from Rebellion: somewhat beautiful, though nothing incredible\nSound design is functional and fits with the enemies.\nTightly optimized (from my experience, at least) for great performance. The decent amount of options is quite nice too.\n4-player co-op (with a solo option as well)! Always a plus.\nCollectables (bottles to shoot + gold to find) are well-hidden.\nSteam achievements, trading cards, and a leaderboards/score system.\nConsLackluster, lazy cut-and-paste gameplay from NZA1. Expect very few new additions (one new enemy at best).\nVisuals (especially the textures) often look muddy and not particularly polished.\nLack of variety in options, gameplay-wise. There's a few sniper rifles, 2 shotguns, some SMGs, a few pistols, and some explosives, yet they all feel the exact same as their counterparts.\nFeels very "grindy" at times (especially with the plethora of unnecessary "sieges"). Some of the achievements ridiculously go beyond what is sane, too (one of them requires 5000 kills).\nMusic isn't particularly interesting.\nMore bugs and glitches than the first game, at least from my experience. My friends and I experienced multiple crashes and even a few game-breaking bugs (one of which involved the final boss not spawning four times in a row).\n5 levels, each at around 25-45 minutes long. This means that playing co-op, you'll probably blaze through the game in about 3-4 hours or so.\nIt's lacking in the horror department, if you're interested in that aspect of the game.\n\nConclusionSniper Elite is a fun, engaging series of third-person action games. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is a fairly solid spinoff from that series. Yet, it's hard to say that the sequel to it does anything fresh or exciting. If you enjoyed the first game, you'll probably leave feeling at least a little disappointed, though you may still enjoy it. For those who didn't play the first game though, you may end up quite liking Nazi Zombie Army 2.\n\nFinal Verdict: 5.5/10","April 10","false","19.5"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","31","39","2","2"

With this version they have it so players can join while in mid game which is AWESOME!  Version one didn't have this feature and even though that game is also great it sucked not having that feature.\n\nLots of weapons to choose from.  Game play can be pretty challenging if you ramp up the difficulty and number of Zombies.  Some pretty massive and brutal hordes come at ya.  I can play it for hours and not get bored.  It didn't get rated that high by critics and some people complain about it but I think it's a great time and have no major complains about it.  Seems to be a pretty stable game.\n\nNot a lot of people playing with open servers so plan on getting friends to join you.

It takes the unique sniper gameplay established by the game Sniper Elite V2 and implements zombies into it. Quite simple really but at the same time glorious. Theres really no counterpart for landing the perfet headshot on a zombie and then watching the bullet slowly turn the zombies bowls inside out. It never gets old. In addition to shooting zombies with your sniper rifle you can use both an SMG of your choise and a trusty old pistol , and trust me you ll be using those a lot more than you 'd think, which is something I really enjoyed seeing as how both the SMG and the pistol where left practily completely unused when I played the Sniper EIlite V2 game. The zombies are also masterfully done with each enemy type having plenty of unique animations that make them seem remarkably realistic and terrifying. These are the strong points of the game, as unfortuneatly it does come with some weak points.\n\nFirst of all the entirety of the maps available to play on are recycled material from the game Sniper Elite V2 that just have had a paint job of blood and satanic symbols done to them and then mixed to make new maps. For someone thats played the game Sniper Elite V2 this is quite disapointing as you are not greeted with anything fresh as far as sceenery is conserned. The game itself is also quite small containing only 5 levels, each lasting about 30 mins on the highest difficulty. However it should be noted the gameplay does give the game some replayability. The story is also quite monotonus and dull and moreover most chapters goals are "Survive the siege of zombies" or "Clear out the Zombies" something that adds to the general apathy you ll develop for the games story. By far the weakest point of this game and one that really saddens me is the fact its almost completely dead. Out of 2 days of playing during christmas and while the game was on sale I barely got into 10 lobbys ,and in most the same people kept coming up. For a game thats based around team work this is a big minus. Most of the achievements available while quite simple required a 4-player team, and so it was a real struggle getting them all. And it is realy a shame that this game has been abandoned to such a degree because its a really solid, good game.\n\nTo conclude , Sniper Elite Zombie Army 2 is a unique, fun and an overal great game. It does have its drawbacks and it is for the most part dead, but if you manage to gather some friends, or build a group using the steam forums its a must buy for any zombie fun out there.","January 2, 2015","true","14.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CinemaFromage/recommended/247910/","CinemaFromage","CinemaFromage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CinemaFromage/","614 products in account","Let's be honest here.  It's essentially the same game as Sniper Elite V2, especially as far as mechanics go. The sniper rifles look and feel the same, the shoot them same, the still fill you with excitement as you hit a headshot from 900 yards.  Nazi Zombie Army 2 is essentially a re-skin of V2.  You'll find yourself in some of the very same maps and locations, recognizing much of the same scenery as you did the first time around.  However, there's one important difference:  Every single one of these maps has been decimated by war and they're filled with shambling zombies!\n\nThere's a couple of details about this game that makes me love it, just a hair more that V2.  Almost all of that love steams from atmosphere.  Nazi Zombie Army 2 is fantastic in that atmosphere department and I'm not even talking about the zombies.  I'm a horror fan.  A big horror fan at that.  I co-host three fairly popular horror podcasts, so I'd like to consider myself well versed. (Check the links in my profile if you're a podcast fan!)  The devs took a lot of time and research to make the horror tropes in NZA2's looks and sounds really pop to make this a really stellar horror experience.  From the very start of the game, we're struck with an orange color pallet that screams Halloween.  The music is an homage to bands like Goblin that have crafted many common themes in the genre to make the game even sound familiar if you're a fan of horror movies.  It's just a really great package as far as horror nerdery goes!\n\nThen, we get to the zombies.  Even they’re creepy!  They’re also a good homage to horror nerdery, pulling more from the Romero Zombie well vs. the Zak Snyder fast zombie well.   The shamble, wobble and lurch, which makes getting those sweet sweet headshots all the harder.  But those headshots will happen.  You’ll get those amazing slow motion long distance shot ending in an x-ray that shows the bullet pass through the skeleton of your zombie of choice.  This time around though, you can feel all giddy and excited without feeling bad for it.  You’re shooting the undead, not other humans!\n\nThe only note to be wary of with Nazi Zombie Army 2 is that it is clearly designed towards a co-op experience.  Most missions end in a “survive the waves” shoot-a-thon that while flying solo, can be a bit tiresome and difficult.  You can play solo however!  Just make sure you’re going to have to work for it a bit harder.","June 24, 2014","true","6.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wtfthisisntwii/recommended/247910/","wtfthisisntwii","Chubs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wtfthisisntwii/","248 products in account","Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a good game.  Just want to get that out before I start.\n\nThe story to this game is pretty basic, something about piecing together this thing which will get rid of the zombies or something.  It's really passable, but it's not meant to have a story in the first place.\n\nNow, there are a few problems with it.  The largest issue is the length.  You can beat this game in probably 4 hours.  However, you could argue that for the price it's allowed to be 4 hours.  Now that's all opinion on how you like to spend your money, but for me, I would say for its 5 levels, it should be $10 rather than $15.\n\nThis game has some great atmosphere, the destroyed buildings, to the gloomy skies, and the orange deathly glows, overall, it makes it just a great experience.  Although, I would say the level design is a hit and miss.  It's good because it's varied; it's not the same thing repeated.  It's a miss because the levels are kind of, well, not very exciting.  I mean, there are some great parts, but it's more of, meh level design.  Although, these levels do setup some very fun moments for sniping.  This is all just my opinion though, and like I said, it still does have fun levels with varied designs, but the levels aren't mindblowing.\n\nThe real star here is the gameplay.  It's still very fun to blow zombies heads off and kick them down on the ground and blow their head off.  The gameplay just really makes the game and makes for a lot of replay value which pretty much overshadows the short game length.  It should also be noted that this game is a little easier than the first, I reccomend Marksman or Sniper Elite.  It's overall not as hard as the first, which is a little dissapointing, but there is always Sniper Elite difficulty.  Also, this game is not NEARLY as enjoyable if not playing co-op.  Co-op is how the game is ment to be played.  You don't neccessarily need to be playing with people you know though, playing with random people is almost as fun.  Although, this game doesn't do anything really different from the original.  It's pretty much an add-on, for what is an add-on.\n\nOverall, I love this game, and all the pros really overshadow the cons.  It's a fantastic game, that doesn't really do anything different than the original, but it's still great.  I reccomend picking the game up, especially if you have friends to play with!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention the bullet cam.  Well, it's still awesome :)","March 3, 2014","true","7.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","6"

They sell you a product advertising a solo campaign mode, failing to mention, or advertise in any form that said campaign mode is virtualy impossible to complete on your own due to overwhelming numbers of enemies and a typical scarcity of amunition. You may be thinking "ok well I'll just join an online game then". Not a bad idea, except for one thing: no games can be found due to a lack, or non-existence, of online players/hosts. Why, simple, because no one is playing the game but you.\n\nThat being said. Sniper Elite: NZA 2 isn't all bad. Here are a few positive and negitive aspects of this perticular title:\n\nPros:\n- Excelent graphics\n- Visualy unsettling levels\n- Creative enemy concepts\n- Varied weapon choices in primary, secondary, and even explosive categories\n- Most enemies can be searched for ammo and explosives\n- Health is based on the stamina/endurance system (Call of Duty style)\n\nCons:\n- Campaign is virtualy impossible to complete in single player\n- Co-op play unlikely (lack of intrest/player base?)\n- Ammo extremely scarce. Even with enemy looting you will only get to loot a certain amount of enemies. Even then there is no guarantee you will find the ammo you need.\n- Enemies rarely appear on their own and numbers only increase as the game goes on.\n- Enemies also increase in "skill" by gaining new powers or abilities (summons, elemental powers, and so on) these "special" zombies appear alongside the vanilla zombies and can appear without warning and seemingly from nowhere.\n- Enemy numbers are capable of overwhelming a solo player very quickly, even on the lowest setting. (especialy during the "Survive the Siege" portions where the player is trapped in an "arena-style" area unable to leave and must hold out until all enemies are defeated. This, coupled with the above mentioned increase in enemies numbers, abilities and lack of ammo, is one of the main reasons why I list the single player story as "almost impossible")\n\nShort version: Don't waste your time, don't waste your money. There is no one online hosting games to join and single player will get real hard real fast.","January 9, 2014","false","10.2"," 79 of 148 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","79","148","0","10"

So direct that it's pretty much same gameplay but on different levels. Came out at the end of 2013, after Rebellion suddenly found out that NZA was a hit. Shoot more zombies from the third person view shooter!\n\nMultiplayer community is kinda there. Most likely you will find no games when you launch coop, which would start your own lobby. And then, only a few minutes later it will fill in fully. So yea, wacky like that.\n\nAnd eh, what can I say. It's not much compared to the first one. Setting got changed to be more of hellish-otherwordly thing of yellow color. It has a bit more of spooky moments, while not spamming demonic things as much as the first game.\nShame about music though. It seemed to be more down the earth, not as much of synth rave personallity here.\n\nNot many additions to the game. There are turrets that are pretty good, unless you are doing solo. And yey, new sub-bosses, one looking like a demon from the thumbnail of NZA1.\n\nIt's a bit less polished in a sense that I sometimes would see zombie getting stuck in geometry. Heck, on the 5th level after killing all zombies during siege I decided that something glitched and I got stuck only to find out after the second replay that there were sniper zombies in faraway towers, who spawned yet were looking at different direction, thus not noticing me and thus not giving themselves away with attacks.\n\nIt's still not nicely paced for a single player either. There are actually few sieges that are literal hell to do in solo, since they are nothing more then almost straight line of space so you can't run around elites. You have to just outdamage them first. Because of it difficulty jumps around in solo play, very uneven.\n\nOn other hand, coop is certanly better. There are more of interesting situations. There are no sieges that are way too dragged out. And there are less of filler moments with just normal zombies.\n\nBut meh, it's more of same thing, just with a bit more elements and different levels. Probably better than NZA1. But it's more of a part of a bundle.\nP.S. P.S. It has different balance from ZAT. In ZAT kicks are much stronger, non-rifles are weaker, skeletons die from one kick. Turrets are weaker too.","April 3","true","23.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/recommended/247910/","Valerie-Valens","~★PetSquirrel★~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/","647 products in account","Originally planned as a DLC for the original Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army game, it became a fully-fledged game later on, and I can see why, there is about as much content on this game as there was on the first game. Unfortunately, this game isn't as good as its predecessor. Which is a shame, because there are plenty of new zombie types that kept things interesting.\n\nThe first problem comes with the way the zombies are animated. They often bug out, and twitch around at random. For example, sometimes, when they get knocked down, they pop back up in the standing position without any animation for a second. Another glitch is when they get stuck on each other and gets frozen in their animation as a result.\n\nThe second, bigger problem is that, the level design is far more cramped, which is to the game's detriment, since this kind of gameplay demands the ability to outmaneuver the horde to a better sniping position, and there are certain spots in this game where that kind of luxury and mobility isn't afforded. In simpler terms, this game has a lot of dead ends that are death traps, and there are some cases where the only real way out is to push through, because those dead ends are unavoidable. This is in stark contrast to the first game where any instances of being trapped is the fault of the player, and not because of the level design. Another thing to add to this is that it seems to be specifically designed to spawn zombies on top of you out of the ground, which is also poor level design.\n\nOverall, while I do appreciate that they made the effort to make it not just more of the same, there isn't as much care out into the map design or QA done this time around. It is because of this that I cannot really recommend this game at full price. If you see this game on sale, then by all means, do pick it up, but $15 is a bit more than what this game is worth. Which is a shame, because in Single Player, it is 4 Hours worth of Zombie shooting with a solid netcode to go with the Co-op mode. If you are curious about this franchise, I would recommend that you pick up the first game instead of this, and only pick this up if you have to play more of it.","June 2, 2014","false","5.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

NZA 2 plays the same as 1, the same 5 level campaign, that can be played cooperatively with friends, the same guns as NZA 1, and the same type of storyline and enviornment. This can get very repetitive quicky, as there is not much innovation and change from the original. After beating the campaign the first time, I have yet to pick up and play this game again, and do not have any intent on doing so in the future. If you have 15 bucks lying around with absolutely nothing to spend it on, this will provide entertainment for about 2-4hrs. Verdict? Do not buy NZA 2, until Rebellion puts something innovative and different in this crappy game. Save the $15, get something else.","April 11, 2014","false","7.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Indeed, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 shatters the proverbial bar, becoming a technical, cinematic and gaming standard that future action and stealth titles will be judged by. It's been a long time coming, but this game is a true classic and a masterpiece from Hideo Kojima, Kojima Productions and Konami.\n\nLegends die hard and deserve a heroic story that lives on when they are gone. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 is such an ending for the legendary warrior Karl Fairburne. Not only does it sum up the full franchise of Sniper Elite, its depth and its complexity, coupled with its technical prowess, make it one of the best games of the year and, indeed, one of the best games ever made. Get some well earned rest, Karl Fairburne. You've earned it. We salute you.","March 3, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

The first one was in my opinion not the best optimized and in some moments quite annoying and hard to play due the effects but it was mostly playable and a very fun game to play even in singleplayer because you simply cannot connect to some cooperative game because there werent any. But i liked that game a lot. In this game the optimalization is even worse so its completely unplayable for me which is shame and i dont understand it.. Rather get the first one, but dont expect random coop, you must have premade friends with you if you dont want to play alone.","May 30, 2014","false","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great game for what it is , but the difficulty seems to spike randomly at points in the game ( One seige you could have a huge field to move around and kill stuff , then at another seige they put you in a stupid hallway with no room to move and one million zombies charging at you ) , thats my only gripe. Incredibely repetitive and boring but I can't seem to stop playing because I hate not finishing games. Would recommend for mindless zombie killing . Mediocre at best , glad I got it on sale or I'd feel like I got burned. 5/10","March 27, 2014","false","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the orginal, but finding players is worse than before, in fact its pretty hopeless! This sequal is "more nighmare-ish" with more fire, rivers of blood oh and (imo) A LOT more enemies*: (*If you play on the easiest difficulty, with the least enemies (X1) AND a full team its a total cake-walk)\n\nI'm sure I could clear every achievement, I'm thankful that nothing seems too difficult... But I wonder how many weeks or months will pass before I chalk up less than the 36h I took to nail the first game?\n-I'm not taking a dig at the 'length' of the game, I'm happy with the game I'm just not happy (like otherwise absorbed with) playing the game!","May 10, 2014","false","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having said that, the game plays noticeably differently than SEV2 - cover no longer matters, and ammo conservation is much, much more important.\n\nDefinitely worth the 4 bucks I spent on it, though I probably wouldn't have spent much more than that.","June 17, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A 53?  For THIS game?  Ridiculous!  This game is fun with other folks, you need to havea good four man on comms and cover each other's back.  It's the strategic sniper gameplay from the OG Snipre Elite V2 as well as zombies.  I have The first game and the second one and both are excellent ways to spend some time.  The only downside is the capmaigns can run a little long.  But the sound design, creature desing, the guns and the settings make this a must own.

For FPS fans, the 3rd person view will take a bit of getting used to but most of us these days have played from both perspectives.  I found the NORMAL mode very challenging so played on CADET for a bit until I got used to the play mechanics, loadouts, and gameplay.  After getting used to it, its not so bad on the more difficult levels.  There are multipart campaigns with designated safe rooms like L4D, but at the end of each campaign/mission it launches you into the next rather than simply ending as I suspect the last campaign is the "ending/escape"\n\nThe zombies swarm you but in a very different way than L4D because they don't rush at you with a full on sprint but rather just emerge and move in large groups that tend to overwhelm just in sheer numbers.  The game relies on focused shooting with critical and headshots rather than brute force (like some other zombie games).  I do like the fact that enemies don't just randomly appear all around you.  That used to bug the heck out of me in R6 Vegas 2.  After you a clear a room it should remain clear and enemies shouldn't just spawn in instantaneously.\n\nThe ability to use more than just standard grenades and giving the ability to set trip mines and proximity mines is pretty sweet but be careful not to be too close when they go off.  And if you set them too early they do self-detonate after a fair amount of time.  Using grenades, and mines creatively is very effective against the boss characters as they will mow you down with their big guns of you try and take them head on.\n\nThis game was so worth the $3.75.

Nazi Zombie Army 2 continues the template laid down by the original almost to a tee, offering a series of corridors and open levels in which to snipe and lay down traps for the incoming hordes, wrapping its premise around the loosest and silliest of plots. It’s still basic and slightly awkward, and it’s still 100% more fun when played with other people.\n\nTrading the Nazi soldiers for those of their undead cousins, Zombie Army 2’s combat takes shape as a series of shooting galleries, sometimes confined and sometimes open, often requesting the gang of four combatants to defend a specific location from assault on multiple sides. Physical barriers block progress until each and every last zombie has been dispatched back to the underworld, and a neat scoring mechanic allows for competition between groups as players vie for the highest tally of grenade kills, headshots and long-range bollock-busters (or the space where they used to be, anyway).\n\n\nMy local Tesco has gone downhill\nThe plot, for those of you that are interested, takes into account Hitler’s plight in the original game, with his ‘Plan Z’ now in full effect and overpowering even his own bunker. In order to put a stop to the undead hordes you’ll need to find three pieces of an ancient artifact stashed away in various hellish locations far removed from the original’s re-used World War II assets, with the majority of the new environments swathed in devilish flames and lit with hues of orange and red.\n\nJust like its predecessor and the original V2 however, the sniping and gunplay mechanics remain largely the same in Zombie Army 2. The go-to weapons are unsurprisingly still a variety of WWII sniper rifles augmented with a steady-aim breathing gauge that recharges during combat, with secondary slots available for a machine gun and pistol. The latter two begin as fairly useless options as each level slowly unfolds, but soon become invaluable for popping groups of zombie heads whenever the shufflers breach defences and begin to swarm your position. A swift kick to the guts will also put them down in a pinch, but that solitary melee attack still lacks the crowd-control utility of alternatives found in the likes of Left 4 Dead, making it a little limp as a last resort.\n\nThe planning and trapping aspects of Sniper Elite are also still in full effect here, played up to the maximum in the all-new levels designed specifically for Zombie Army 2. The array of options remain the same, encompassing two types of grenade, trip-wire explosives and dynamite. Working as a team to successfully booby trap a location and take down swathes of shuffling zombies is a satisfying experience when a well-thought-out plan comes together, and the frantic corridor-clearing when things fall apart is just as frustrating or enjoyable depending on your luck. And Rebellion obviously knows its onions regarding the elements players responded to best the first time around, as the level design in the sequel is far more accommodating. Siege locations are more prevalent with numerous cover spots and opportunities for funnelling the undead into carefully-laid traps, whilst machinegun ammo is found with a greater frequency, enabling more of those last-gasp firefights or desperate runs to revive a colleague. The range of special zombies are also augmented by a couple of new additions to the mix, with a fiery, fast-moving variety proving particularly tricky and the “summoner” constantly resurrecting fallen foes unless you take him out.\n\n\nThat’ll be a tricky shot with a sniper rifle\nIt’s also very much still the case that if you’re playing Nazi Zombie Army 2 alone, then you’re in for a pretty dull experience. Despite the additions, the extended waves of enemies and narrow shooting galleries can still become a frustrating slog in singleplayer. In four-player co-op however, Rebellion’s title sputters to life with a satisfying blend of preparation and on-the-fly tactics, made all the better when you have to backtrack or wade into a crowd in order to help up a tardy or over-confident comrade. Being part of a well-oiled four-player sniping team is a huge amount of fun, and even the chaotic mess of an incompatible unit is good for a giggle while it lasts.\n\nstrategyinformer.com","March 7, 2014","true","33.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

COOP.\n\nI say its an improvment of NZA 1 because new types of zombies, improved graphics and the levels do not seem as dull and dark anymore. Atleast I enjoyed it more then the first one.\n\n--Graphics are really neat and effects, world and zombies are nicely detailed and shown. Sound is great aswell and the music fits to every level.\n\n--The X-Ray bulletcam is still as fun as it always was and it never gets bored seeing the bullets popping a zombies heart, eyes or even the balls xD.\n\n--Not only a game to hunt heads... There is nazi gold and blood bottles shared over all the levels for you to find.\n\n--Then there are build in secrets in every map... Can you find then all?\n\n--As said its a short campain game so yeah dont expect it to take hours to beat the game but since it has coop and different difficulty settings and options the game can be played again and again and is still as challenging and fun.\n\n--With only random strangers or friends the coop is fun and its nice to know you have another player who will watch your back and helps you killing those OP elites haha.\n\n--There are also some fun elements inside it where zombies sit around on toilets or talk with eachother (You have to look for them of course) and yeah some stuff to find and discover like those hidden creep n surprise elemts.\n\nSo yeah I say buy it and give it a try since it is not all to expensive and has some nice stuff build in. :>","February 9, 2014","true","140.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Decent amount of weapons you can choose from without having to level up to obtain.\n3. really cool kill cams\n4. Unless you play on the hardest difficulty game isnt too hard but still isnt easy.\n5. levels seem to be pretty long\n6. Multiplayer which i havnt been able to use yet since....well i have no friends haha.\n\nthere are tons more cool stuff i didnt list just buy the damn game and find out yourself Xd\nits sorta like Call of duty world at wars Nazi zombies but you arent trapped in a small area.\n\ni give this game a 8/10  thumbs up","May 16, 2015","true","51.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Glitches, bugs, only 5 chapters (again, a relatively short game you can complete in a mere 5-6 hours) and a horrible algorithm that makes it extremely difficult for you to find players.\n\nI know for a fact that there are a lot of people wanting to play this game and finding hosts is very, very difficult. And even if you manage to start the game from Chapter 1 with 3 friends who are willing to play it till the end disconnections will be common between the chapters.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is the same so in case you do not encounter any issues it is pretty fun. There are some new enemy types and some scenes when you can mount a gun turret having unlimited ammo at your disposal so you have no issues with gunning down hordes of enemies. And of course bullet time is still very exciting.\n\nAlso, the environments now look different: this game is darker, more creepy and there's fire almost everywhere. I liked this as the 4 soldiers' mission to get rid of the zombie menace seems to be more desperate.\n\nStill, playing it without issues is difficult and it is a shame they could not correct the problem related to the game session finding.","March 7, 2014","false","7.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

If we need a perfect example to describe a “cash-grab”, then Nazi Zombie Army 2 is it. I would almost have been fine with how absolutely identical NZA 2 is to its predecessor, had the original at least been a solid game. But that is not the case. NZA was a seriously flawed game, that was only enjoyable if you tried really hard to enjoy it and three of your friends were willing to join in. Barely anything has been fixed or improved and virtually nothing new has been added. Going in, I had hoped to see some new levels that take more advantage of the gameplay but those were the same levels from V2 with just a thin coat of paint thrown on top.

Released within the same year as the first one, will this be the game you want to play ?\n\nStory wise this game picks up as soon as the first one ends. We are dropped of by the boat on a dockside and we have a goal, we need to collect three relics which can stop the zombie apocalypse. Just like the first one it's not much of a story, cause apart from the recordings you hear in safe rooms and the pre-mission briefings, there's not much exposition.\n\nNow for record, I'm not a massive fan of Sniper Elite apart from Sniper Elite 2 which I fairly enjoyed.  Gameplay is a carbon copy of the first one and Sniper Elite 2. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 feels like a mod rather than a full game. Everything from the menu and mission goals are borrowed from the first game. I felt like this was a cheap money grab than a full sequel.\n\nSoundtrack is the game's strongest feature. I love the synth music and it reminded me of the awesome horror movies that came out in the 80's.\n\nThere's really not much to say about NZA 2 since it's basically the same game as the first one. I will try and to explain a bit more what I dislike about this series.\n\nThe game is even harder than the first one. The combat takes place in small corridors and there's zombie hordes swarming you, so if you can't control the situation, you are pretty much done for.\n\nThe game is even shorter than the first game. It took me 3 hours to finish the entire game and unless you plan on doing a second playthrough, it's not worth getting at full price.\n\nOverall this is a poor sequel and more like a cash grab. My honest suggestion is either get the two games on sale or get  the trilogy which is includes the first two remastered games which I hear are great. Overall Nazi Zombie Army 2 is a bad game and I don't suggest wasting money on it.\n\nFinal Rating:\n4/10 - Wait for a discount or skip\n\nIf you liked this review please give it a like and if you disliked it, please post a comment on what you disliked.","October 4, 2015","false","5.5"," 30 of 59 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","30","59","2","0"

(that sounded dirty i know shut up >.>)\n\nThe Co-op could be more enjoyable if my internet card wasnt total ♥♥♥♥ :/\n\nEither way i find this game alot of fun especially with friends and alone.\n\n9.5/10","March 3, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I was lucky enough to pick it up when it was only $3ish annd it was the best $3 I've ever spent on steam. The graphics are very detailed, especially for a game this low in price and production value. The gameplay is a little monotonous in single player, but get three of your friends, turn the difficulty up to sniper elite and multiply the zombies X4 and you'll never look at a zombie apocalypse the same way again. This game can go from laughably easy to downright impossible depending on how hard you want it to be. The guns all feel similar, with only one having notably less damage (M1 carbine) and the obligatory shotgun (and the preacher) and magnum (called the webley). The game is in a sort of 3rd person mode but zooms down a scope when you fully aim with any rife. In addition to the three classes of guns (rifles, subs, launcher, shotties and pistols) the game gives you 5 options for explosives: two kinds of grenades, land mines, trip mines, and dynamite which explodes when shot. What this game doesn't do is tell an in depth story. what it does do is blow away boredom along with several hundred zombies at a time. If you see it on sale, I heartily recommend picking up a four pack (as this game is best played with 4 players) and sharing it with your fellow zombie shooter loving friends.","March 7, 2014","true","50.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Story pretty much the same. Gameplay is same. Some new enemies as the first game only had a handful of different enemies this one has atleast well.. two handfuls. I love the skeletons! They seem to have gotten smart and acquired some body armor so its harder to hit them in their one weakness, the heart. Thats brilliant. The self-immolating zombies are pretty much like the suicide bombers except they torch you when they get close. I think the first game was better for multiplayer as the sieges were usually in a house or building that allowed someone to snipe and someone to cover them. I enjoyed this one more as a single player adventure and it flowed nicely as such. Other notes:  I love the gameplay, seems so simple yet can be very hard without practice. The zombies walk like drunk people and are hard to headshot ( which is what you need to do or they may resurrect). Music and soundtrack is amazing.

Sniper Elite's idea on it however, had no weapon progression and focuses on map progression in a linear game instead, and it's really nice. Giving fun bonus weapons every once in a while, and camp spots on certain areas as you progress, with no overall hub is a pretty cool idea, giving even more spookiness since you have no preparation for the waves. It's a nice idea done pretty well, even though it's kind of boring without co-op and even then gets a little old pretty fast. If you like zombies and games like Call of Duty, I have to recommend this game, and you really would enjoy it. I didn't have too much fun with it, but I'm sure you will.","October 3, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/247910/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","After my experience with the first game I normally wouldn't have continued on to the second, but I already owned it thanks to a package deal, so I figured: why not? Let's go snipe things.\n\nOf course, this game suffers from all the problems of the first: there's no story (possibly even less of one than before) and the focus is on an arcade experience where it usually makes more sense to use automatic weapons and pistols due to the close quarters than it does to snipe anything (despite the very name of the game).\n\nOn top of that, this sequel hardly brings anything new to the table. There's two new enemy types, but that's it. No new guns or explosives. And all the environments are the exact same levels from Sniper Elite 2 - literally cut and pasted - with some lighting changes to dress them up in a poor attempt to make them feel different. But if you've already played that game (like I had) then you already know the layouts of all the levels here, making a quick run through even more tedious.\n\nIn short: this is the laziest milking of a franchise I might have ever seen. It can't have taken much time or thought or effort for the developers to grind it out. I can imagine that it might be more fun to play with a full co-op team, but even then I wouldn't want to go through it more than once. There just isn't much here.","July 28, 2015","false","16.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

My 6.9 hours represents the game completed so it is short, and the same time to play as NZA. Therefor get it on a budget. Or even get it now when NZA, NZA2, and (the up-coming release of) NZA3 are bundled for £12.\n\nYou get co-op with these games and other people say it's awesome. I only played single player so far, and it rocks. Check out a bit on youtube just to make sure it's for you.\n\nOne other thing. The graphics are about average for a game these days.

I imagine that this series could carry on with more games, and I assume that it will.\n\nI played this game along with 2 of my friends, and at times it was difficult. Currently I am playing through the first game and OMG it is hard. Ammo is scarce and you really worry when you’re running low and you have a load of zombies in your path. I assume that the second is no different.\n\nThe story is somewhat lacking, when playing through it didn’t feel like there was much point, it doesn’t really force the story upon you. Even in the cut scenes none of the characters talk. Which is very odd. I hope that future games will have a bit more of an immersive story.\n\nHuge recommendation, while there is no real story the gameplay alone is extremely satisfying.\n\nEspecially for the low price.\n","March 9, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Having said that, the game plays noticeably differently than SEV2 - cover no longer matters, and ammo conservation is much, much more important.\n\nDefinitely worth the 4 bucks I spent on it, though I probably wouldn't have spent much more than that.","October 31, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not many people play it and that's why this game is very cheap.\nBasicly this is because this game is very unknown. But should you buy it? Yes! And I'll explain you why.\n\nThe game is a big co-op where you have to play together with your friends or random people you meet online by joining a co-op match to survive of the massive nazi zombies. Once the zombies come there is no stopping onto it. Blood, brains, guts... nothing is enough. Dead people everywhere, nice killcams, oldschool guns, and on top of that it's all in really good graphics. If you don't have any friends to play it with? No worries, you can also start the game on your own!\n\nAll the different types of zombies, weapons and places to stack up amunation make this game very special and unique in his type. It's not just as the other Sniper Elite games. It's better!\n\nDefently worth a try!","January 3, 2015","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(Nazi zombie army 1 had slightly more fun levels)\n8/10\n\n\n*SPOILER*\nOne of the most bizarre things about this game was that you don't end up killing a zombified hitler.

I didn't finish the first one and nor have i finished this one but i must say that this game is so god dam fun! I've been enjoying this one more than the first one but both are good.\n\nThe zombies are scary as ♥♥♥♥, especially the huge one with the MG42. Honestly nothing gets your heart racing than having to face that thing when you're all most out of ammo. Although most of the maps are basically just copies from sniper elite V2 with a bit more rubble you still feel as if you're going thought a whole new game. Also in Sniper elite V2 you leave Berlin but this time you've got to go all the way back!!!\n\nIf you've ever seen Frankine stiens army then you'll love this game, sometimes you wish that the creations from the film could be in the game! But then at times you wish you where not playing this game.\n\nThank you for reading my review and sorry for all the bad spelling and grammour!\n10/10 would revisit the dry-cleaners again!","May 26, 2015","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D3V1LL0/recommended/247910/","D3V1LL0","Proxy is waifu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D3V1LL0/","68 products in account","Sniper Elite: nazi Zombie Army 2 is the first full game of Sniper Elite that i played (i played SE v2 demo but it was few years ago :P) and i must say that i love this game. Now sometimes the game can make you rage, swear and curse creators of the game, but after few tries you realise what did you do wrong, and you fix your mistake, and then progress with a "banana" on your face.\n\nGameplay :\nThis version is kinda varied from other Sniper Elite games. Mainly because you wont use your sniper rifle that often. Another diffrence, is that you actually shoot zombies, that melee you, instead of shooting enemies. Well, there are Zombie Snipers, that kinda sounds stupid and unrealistic, but i'll explain that later. I really like the balance between needing to use your sniper, and full options to use any weapon you want.\n\nStory (NO SPOILERS) :\nWe start with a cutscene of Hitler speaking to one of his generals (i couldnt identify him closely, but that doesnt really matter) about the Relics that supposed to keep the zombies in control. We get to know that Nazis had some Relics that let them control these zombies. Our mission is to get in the possesion of those, and stop the Nazi Zombies. As simple as it gets, i dont play the game too much for the story. The story isnt anything super great, but i dont mind it.\nRealism :\nNow I could even dig it that Nazis got some super zombie virus that let them to take over the whole Europe or something, but they got some magical relics, that control zombies. What is that ? I mean i dont hate it, but you could atleast implement some more realism in that part. The only thing that i understand about that, because it actually matches the story, is the Zombie Snipers i mentioned before. I mean, they can somehow fly, but i guess creators though of him being somehow powered by magic of the relics or something like that. They are kinda annoying because, you scope in, and they jump to another position, but i guess it is supposed to be the diffrence from other games.\nDifficulty :\nI am playing this game on the hardest difficulty, and i must say that it isn't that hard as i expected but in some parts It can get frustrating. I guess i could finish the game on easiest in about 4-5 hours. As i read some other people's reviews, they finished on hardest in about 9-10 hours, I didnt finish the story yet (writing this at Friday, the 13th) but i guess im gonna have a time around that, maybe even faster.\n\nPros :\n+Balanced difficulty\n+A good variancy from other Sniper Elite games\n+Good gameplay\n+Nice Graphics\n+Sound effects are good\n+Bullet cams are cool as always\n\nCons :\n-Not that realistic as expected\n-Zombie Snipers are more annoying than challenging\n-No local cooperation mode\n\nOverall : 7.5/10","November 13, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

This is by no means a bad game but should have been a DLC to the first game, not a sequel. As a sequel it is a completely suck-♥♥♥ waste of money ripoff. It should have been released only as a $5 DLC for the first game. What makes this so disappointing is that it is literally the EXACT same as the first game with almost no real noticeable changes besides a couple new enemies, some new maps, and a new story (who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about story in a game called Nazi Zombie Army lol). The story is barely there anyway. You just pick up relics at the end of levels and hardly anyone ever says anything. The double barreled shotgun (aka The Preacher) blows away a whole group of zombies with one blast. But you only get to use it for a little while and it does not transfer to the next level when it starts, so basically forget i even mentioned it. Total waste of time for them to even put it in the game. It seems like the zombies jerk a little more now making headshots harder, but maybe that's just me. These games should be called "headshot simulator" because anything other than a headshot is, half the time, a waste of ammo. And you need all the ammo you can get. Mostly though you will have enough ammo, just be smart with it. Snipe anytime you can, pistols to kill skeletons, and machinegun only when necessary.\n\nOverall the exact, and I mean EXACT same game as the first which makes it deserve the bad reviews it got, but some new environments are cool. Pretty solid and fun for maybe a week or two, meaning it is absolutely worth the sale price I paid of $3.74. Do NOT buy it at full price, wait for it on a big sale like I did. 6/10","February 27, 2014","true","4.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

This "DLC" is bad , the idea of this game is that you are supposed to be a sniper , killing targets from far distances or "Sniping" but what this DLC does is they put you in small corridor or WORSE - a small room filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of zombies , and this guys arent shambling pieces of rotten flesh NOOOO , once this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s get close to you , they literally get a second breath and start running at you like crazy , messing up with you aiming and generally become a huge problem.

I don't know why the option is not there to play single player but with 3 bot like in Left 4 Dead.\nIf there is, then I missed that option.\n\nLOL it can be testing on your nerves on single player late at night with the lights off.

Thats all i can say, apart from the seige levels that were a complete annoyance i thoroughly enjoyed this game. At least it had great ambience. The Hitler bunker level got me chills considering it had some of the odd scenes like, turning around and seeing yourself in the doorway and walking out, then dissapearing. I looked around and in real time said "Oh haha very funny guys" But i realised i was on my own so i was talking to myself.\n\nThe final boss was boring, no doubt about it all that hit you was zombies, when i saw all that ammunition and explosives i was expecting a big boss battle with magic and huge health etc. But no, it just threw hordes at you which bored me stiff considering the game did that anyways. Some of the levels could buff up on the mountables, by levelsci mean seige ones. If in singleplayer please if you are making a sequal try to add only sinfgleplayer placed mountables. Multiplayer mountables i rarely used considering they were mostly on the edges of the arena and not the middle.\n\nOverall it was quite creepy, gorey (i love gore) and amazingly thrilling.

Aiming was optimized, so it made this game more exciting from the beginning. I guess developers have admitted their mistakes and listened to the voice of users. They have also added about 4 new zombies that makes the situation more 'bloody'.\n\n+) Lightning effect which covered the hole screen with light made me nervous because I could not see where the zombies were.\n+) Optimized cursor. They sure made the cursor easier to control. It didn't move like a car in Nazi Zombie Army I.\n+) Ammo box for every type of weapons. In NZ I, They only had ammo box for snipers. This time, they made it for rifles and pistols.\n\n-) If they only dealt the cursor, It would've been a great game to enjoy. However, they had to go and crank it up a notch.

Popping zombies heads in x-ray never gets old but unfortunately the campain does. The problem with this game is there is only 2 game modes, online co-op and campain. The campain is awesome when you first try it but after your playing with your friends on the same maps over and over again you will start to get bored.  What this game is really missing is a good old horde mode where you just fight endless waves of zombies. It should also have different co-op missions to the single player missions otherwise your just playing the exact same missions again and there is no excitement in that. I still recommend this game because it has lots of features that still want to make you go back and is good fun.","June 19, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only complaint is that it takes a very long time to find co-op players if your friends who play are not online. There is no group view, you have to rely on a pop-up that says "Searching for a game" for anywhere between 1-15 minutes. The same music loops over so it can get a bit frustrating when no one is seemingly online.\n\nIf you had a few friends and a love for zombie shooters I would definitely suggest this game.","June 22, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The individual missions are few, but very long. There's a few annoyances (If you die, you can't rejoin a game in progress, and you can't save in the middle of the missions between sessions). But overall, the experience was tremendously enjoyable and entertaining.\n\nThe game play is mostly of the form "go from A to B, through a horde of zombies". Sometimes you have to do "seiges" in which a bunch of zombies spawn and you have to kill them. At all points it felt pretty organic - you just go around killing zombies as you see best, and you're not really locked into any given strategy most of the time. There's a variety of weapons (Sniper Rifles, SMG's, and pistols are your guns, while you have trip mines, land mines, grenades (2 types) and dynamite for your explosives and traps. You can also get two types of shotguns (though only off the ground in some missions). The gun handling is superb, as you'd expect.\n\nI recommend it, especially if you like zombie games, or sniping games (though there are few chances for real long-range sniping).","March 6, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed it even though it felt quite incomplete at the end. I've played pt 2 for maybe 10 mins and I can already say I'm pretty disappointed. Not in the game in general, but in the fact that they've released a game that doesn't really include anything new in terms of weapons/story and not really any new mechanics (which is not really as important in a sniper elite mod/ expansion). Sure, they released a new campaign which I've yet to fully experience, but this game, if anything, should've been an add-on to the original Nazi Zombie Army. The series itself appeals to me because the zombies are the slow shambling type and headshots are completely required to survive which makes it a bit "realistic" and the sniping x-ray mechanic is really awesome. I can't recommend this game to someone that's already bought pt 1 unless they really enjoyed it like I did. As for people that haven't played pt 1 I'd recommend this game but only after u've watched a few youtube vids and if u've got a few extra dollars lying around. As for everyone, just to prove a point to the develepor, only buy this game on a steam sale like i did. I'm sure u will enjoy it solo like I did and love it playing co-op, but still, just buy this game on sale.\nGraphics are good so long as you have a decent graphics card cuz it runs really well on my pc which has a nvidia gtx 560ti. Anything below that, just be careful. a lot of people that have posted reviews here stating that it's not properly optimized. It runs very well for me on high settings.\nI would give this a thumbs down because it's a ♥♥♥♥ING expansion to NZ1 but I've enjoyed the series enough to give it a thumbs up. Just don't pay $15 for it. Support the developer, not for a $15 expansion, but for the idea that a pretty cool zombie $15 game could be expanded upon. Buy it.

Its way to easy really. ofcourse you can multiple the numbers of zombie heading towards you. but if you set everything on sniper elite mode. and not multiply the number of zombies that will be charging at you, its really too easy.\n\nalso the range of explosives bums me out a bit. as the grenade does his work just fine. you can also shoot at barrels, fuel tanks and many many more, but the range of that explosive is soo miniscule that its really not worth it. also in a certain part of the game you need to activate a V2 rocket. but in real life Im pretty sure I cannot sit behind a corner and wait.\n\nNevertheless its a fantastic game and its really worth the 11 euro's you need to pay for it.
