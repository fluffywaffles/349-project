Basically you are looking for your Dad. After a small landing proplogue you are trapped at the spaceport and must get out of there. For the first act the riddles don't seem easy. But if you find somehow a solution then you can proceed straightforward through Act II and Act III. Win a billards match, win an ape race, take a tank ride, free a prisoner, enter a discotheque and escape a cavern on a mystery island. You will always encounter a mixture of comedy, adventure, thinking and combining. Most funny I found that you made Gail Pilgrim to wear a red dress. At the end it is announced that the story will be finally concluded with Ep. IV.","February 5","true","7.0"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","28","31","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/439250/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Gail Pilgrim and her co-pilot Sabina White set course to Leto, in Delta Pavonis. After ousting the police out of their spaceship and helping the rebellion, they need to stay low. Leto is a planet with many retired rebels or pilots and Gail's dad is living there. So, while Sabina will try to get Emet out of the space port and make sure that the android isn't spotted, Gail will try to find her dad as he disappeared and help friends of his... Seems to be easy, eh?\n\nThis third game continues the plot from the second episode. As usual, it's full of humor, of Gail putting herself in impossible situations, though Sabina is now joining her in that field. True, the ending wasn't the one I was expecting and I'm eager to discover the final episode but it's nice to have a story that isn't revolving around space ships.\n\nThe gameplay is still the same, you discuss with people, you take items, you use them or combine them and you try to make people happy so that you can reach your goal. The fact that you can go where you want is nice too, mainly in Gail's part of the story, where she's using a map to reach each district of the town.\n\nThe game is made with RPG Maker. It didn't change. However, what changed mainly is Gail and Sabina's appearance. No more long hair, no more nice haircut. Nope, you're under the impression that they're coming back from a huge rain. I can understand the need to make Gail look like an adult as she was looking like a teen in the previous games. However, while I don't mind the removal of freckles, I do think that her new look isn't the best. Also, I loved the goggles too from the first game. Anyway, the fact that you're leaving finally space and the Quicksilver, Gail's ship, is a good change. You're now on a planet, even if the first act is only in the space port. Gail is in the city and you even have a beach, so...\n\nThe soundtrack is good too: when you enter the café, it's like you're into an old one, with classic songs. However in Club Venom, it's loud beats.\n\nFinally, this game is longer than 1 hour. I've played nearly four hours, only because I didn't save my game and that I exited with a wrong move. So, I must say that in 3 hours, you can finish the game.\n\nThe price is still interesting, despite the game being longer. So, yeah, while Space Pilgrim isn't the most innovative game in terms of gameplay, it's getting better each time (apart for Gail losing more and more of her appearance each time). So when is the fourth and final episode released? Because I'm really eager to discover what will happen to Sabina and Gail!","February 9","true","10.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

It's a good improvement over what was already a pretty competent- if low budget- game.\n\nOnce you get out of the spaceport you'll have quite a few areas and buildings to explore for clues and items: the puzzles are a bit more complex and sometimes rely on small objects in the environment or joining multiple items together. I must also say that for the first time in the series I was slightly stumped a couple times as, for example, you were required to go back to certain locations to see new events: it was nice to see the game providing some challenge.The story flows, and there's some ties to previous games that I won't spoil: I still don't see much of an engaging overarching plot but I hope episode IV will finally clear things up and provide a good ending.\n\nAll things considered Episode III is an advancement for this decent little saga and it's a good purchase for its fans.\n","March 12","true","2.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Gail and Sabina are an awesome pair and with each new Episode being more elaborate than the other I can't wait for the final Episode of the series. I sincerely wish that the end of Space Pilgrim will not sound the end of the adventures of Gail and Sabina, because they definitely deserve to be in the spotlight for much, much longer.","February 6","true","0.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The plot thickens, you meet some old friends and enemies. Oh, and there's character development too. Sort of.\n\nOnly thing I disliked about this part was the side-scrolling part of the game where you run around in Hope City. While graphics are not the main focus of this game, those sections do indeed look quite bad and somehow plain compared to the rest of the game.\n\nOh, and the game had an (apparently rare) game-breaking bug. It took the developer a day or so to fix it once I posted about it on the game's Steam forum. For that, I give an extra +++ although personally I just started a new game before the update happened.","March 9","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/recommended/439250/","Kelesis666","Paikia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/","605 products in account","Duplicate warning: This is pretty much the same review I wrote for each of the two previous episodes of Space Pilgrim, so if you've already read either one of them, don't waste your time with this one.\n\nSpace Pilgrim is a cute and short point & click adventure game, which kind of reminded me of the old Sierra quests from the 1990s, except it took me couple of hours to beat. The graphics are nothing special, there's hardly any music or sound effects, but the story is nice and funny, just enough for this game to be worth it, considering its price.\n\nThe only aspect of the game that really got me annoyed was the user interface. It took me way too much time to figure out where and how many times I needed to click to use or combine items. Also, whenever there's a dialog box open, it seems like the mouse cursor doesn't need to actually be inside the box to choose an option. Too many times I ended up clicking somewhere outside the dialog box (for whatever reason), just to accidently choose something to do or say.\n\nTL;DR - A nice low-budget point & click adventure. You can enjoy it as long as you don't expect too much.","February 22","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you have enjoyed the series so far, you will definitely want to continue with Episode III...it is actually quite a bit longer than the first two entries, and clearly more ambitious.  Overall, I think I enjoyed it a bit less than the previous episode, but I appreciated that the creator incorporated new features into this (admittedly very simple) game, and I'm now quite eager to see how the story concludes in Episode IV.  There were even a couple of tasks that I found a bit challenging this time around, but nothing that couldn't be puzzled out by being thorough.  Be sure to examine the items in your inventory closely, or you may find yourself stuck for a bit at one point.\n\nOn to Episode IV!","June 3","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
