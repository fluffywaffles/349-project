And the questions have thus-far have not been repeated, and are of similar style of the ones on the show.\n\nThe game play is the same as the show - pick a kid, answer questions, get up the millionaire-style ladder. However, what makes this different is - the game encourages you to "go to school" to upgrade the classmates in some sort of cookie clicker game to upgrade the curriculum.\n\nIt's not "Funny Bad" for your funny let's play youtube channel, and to game show fans, it's maybe worthy of a buy if you just feel compelled to pick-up every version of 5th Grader.\n\nIf you could find a copy of "Make The Grade" you're better off, if you want 5th Grader, otherwise, I suggest grinding it out in the "School" mode if you want to make sure the "cheats" you get are of any use.\n\nAlso, that techno soundtrack in the background gets very annoying.","August 31, 2015","false","2.8"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","32","38","3","2"

Until this is patched, even if you know the correct answer in at least 2 cases there is an outright wrong answer and many more are badly worded but still solvable by choosing the least wrong answer or the one for what you think they try to ask.]\n\n"Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?" is a trivia question game that has me break the rules of orthography to keep my usual review beginning. Also it is a license game of an U.S. American game show that runs in TV and has like all trivia game shows some funny clips you can watch on Youtube. Unfortunately, the game is highly unpolished although it also brings a motivating feature.\n\nThe gameplay is done with the mouse entirely. You play as a contestant that can inexplicably (read: Gameplay and Story Segregation) participate on the game show as often as he wants. Now the price money in this one is not only a high-score number, but can be used to improve the school your helpers in the game show come from.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics and sound are both forgettable. Music - nope! So you go through menus with the charme of classroom drawings and one 3D screen where you see five schoolkids and the host. Of course there is nobody else who attends. I hate to say it, but even the very dumbed down "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Special Edition" has better graphics.\n\nThe gameplay, of course, is where a trivia game is succesful or not. There is not much to do, but a wide variety of questions is necessary. I played only a few games, and the questions did not repeat yet. So what is the bad news? Well, the questions are at a rate of estimated one in 20 simply questionable. This is not to an extent that it stops you from solving most questions once you accept the moon logic of choosing the least wrong answer instead of the right one. For example, the opposite of "desire" is apparently "dislike", although desire is much stronger than dislike. The - unlisted - answer disgust would have been more appropriate, but still a bit off. In my very first game I had a completely wrong answer even - 37.713 divided by 10 is 3.7713, I thought. It was 377.13 however. This is in addition to ambiguous questions that at least don't offer the wrong answer. How much is 4 over 12? The correct answer is of course -8, but the game wants you to add 4 to 12, making it 16. I managed to choose this correctly, but it still is annoying to have questions not clearly named. Often you are supposed to know a biggest city, usually it is the capital. I didn't check for all if it is the biggest city, but once you have it in the spelling category where you have Barcelona and Madrid both spelled correctly, requiring the additional knowledge that Madrid is bigger. Those are only small issues, but they add up.\n\nAfter you answered the first 10 questions correctly, you can drop out with 500,000 dollars - something that also can be done at any previous step, although it wouldn't make any sense at the first or sixth question) or opt to see the million dollar question. You are presented with the category before you decide if you want to try it. Once you see the question, dropping out is disabled, and your only safety is at 25,000 dollar. In the whole game except this question you can also use three jokers. Two can be activated: Peeking at the answer or letting your pupil choose the answer. The third one is automatic: When you answer wrong, your pupil can save you by answering right. This is a nice concept not seen in other games. In the final question this is impossible. If you go for the million, you are on your own (or of course cheat, like it always is possible at such games, by looking up the answer while the clock ticks down).\n\nWhen you won some money, you can rinse and repeat. Alternatively you can upgrade the school or hold events to learn more about your pupils, so they gain new fields of interest or dislike possibly at semi-random or possibly just unlocked in a linear way. Upgrading the school makes people better, for example having a science lab helps with science questions, and having math equipment helps with math questions. I can only hope this was not also based on real elementary schools. As a nice bonus you gain offline money, trickling in at a dollar or more per second. Upgrading the school generates a small but permanent bonus that way also, meaning less grind by playing through the game. So you eventually unlock new wings and get access to more pupils, until you eventually know all 30 of them. Wait, so the more money you have, the more teaching you do?\n\nThe more money you have, the more teaching you do! Thanks! Finally I understand! We don't work to live, we live to work! We must invest money into our companies so they allow us to do more unpaid work for them!\n\nJoke aside, this grants you higher trickling money, significantly so, making the billionaire achievement (read: Exactly What It Says on the Tin) easy enough if you wait long enough. Is this motivating? Or to ask differently...\n\nWould I recommend this game? Well, unfortunately not. It's like playing an idle game, addicting to a degree but repetitive. It's the small grind for the ten minutes of time in-between, like most trivia games it is a casual one, and it would be nice at this. But then there are the questions that are so blatantly distracting, ambiguous or even wrong. They are often challenging even to me, and at one point I even learnt that Y is a vowel (which was not a mistake in the game). So yes, the game would be nice with the questions corrected, challenging but still possible, with a motivating idle minigame that improves the jokers you hopefully don't need. Even with all the technical badness it could have enough potential just in the core gameplay to be good. Unfortunately for now a major patch would be necessary that revisits all questions. Or to end with another reference to an addicting website: The game feels almost finished, but not polished enough to enjoy it (read: Obvious Beta).","October 17, 2015","false","1.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","1"

I feel bad for the saps who've paid the asking price for this game. It's a rather bland representation of the show; there are no voice-overs, the soundtrack is tedious and the repetitive nature of the title makes the game quickly become boring. The graphics are also that of Nintendo DS capacity, which is a given seeing as this is a port from the handheld system.\n\nAside from the typical "show" style game play (called Primetime), you also have a School mode where you can upgrade various curriculum to make your students smarter and host events to learn their likes/dislikes/strengths/weaknesses. This will play a semi-crucial part in whether or not you succeed when you don't know the answer to a question.\n\nEven though there are a very large amount of questions available, the game itself just okay. It's good for wasting low amounts of time here and there. You probably won't get more than 3-4 hours of enjoyment from it. Don't bother at its full price, and don't go in expecting too much.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","16","23","8","3"

First they see "Mostly Negative" with 15 negative reviews and only 4 positive. Then they see the price at $14.99 . After already deciding they won't be buying this game anytime soon, they read the reviews. Here is the gist of the reviews:\n\n"The 'right' answers are wrong"\n"Not a good portrayal of the game show"\n"Overpriced"\n\nAnd those reviews are how you will feel playing this game. Let me start with the "right" answers being completely wrong, and the trivia questions being uneducated. I have screenshots on my profile if you would like to see. Like a review below, it asks for a synonym of a tidal wave, and tsunami is the answer. Here is that review. Examples I have had is "Put the correct operation in the blank. 8_5=12" With the options being +, -, =, and >. The only plausible answer would be greater than (>). However, it told me I was incorrect and the correct answer was addition. If you aren't particularly good at math, 8+5=13. There was something similar the other way around, with a subtraction problem instead of an addition problem.\n\nAdding on with the problems, the trivia questions are uneducated. One question I had (there is a screenshot of this as well), was "Which country was the thumb piano originated?" The options were all continents (except for one, and one that is both). The options were Africa, Asia, Australia, and Central America. At least say Countries/Continents to sound somewhat educated.\n\nThe format is also the type of format you would expect to see on a mobile game. Gameplay on one side, options on the other. I would expect to see that on a DS/Phone, not a steam game.\n\nThis could be fixed with simple patches by the devs, however even if it were to be fixed no one would buy it. At $14.99, it would be idiotic for someone to buy a game like this. I got this game for free through a reward website, which is the only way I would recommend anyone buy this game. The price should be reduced to $4.99 at most, however I think around $2.99 is a better price for a game like this.\n\nTL;DR: Don't buy this game. The "right" answers are wrong, the questions incorrectly worded, format unsatisfactory, and way overpriced. Wait until the price is reduced and gameplay is fixed, then I would urge you to consider to buy it.\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention this in one of my paragraphs - multiplayer is basically non-existent. I was once in a search for 20 minutes and found no one. So don't expect to be doing challenges anytime soon.\n\nEdit: The only reason I have a somewhat high amount of hours is because of achievements.","November 24, 2015","false","2.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

A tidal wave is the wave motion of the tides. A tidal wave is a shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth. ("Tidal wave" was used in earlier times to describe what we now call a tsunami.)

Your school starts out at level 0 causing your students to have a D average across all subjects for the most part.\n\nThe reason why I mentioned that this game has potential is because it is a rather fun game overall, but the issues are with the questions. I ran into a couple math questions that were outright wrong. As a graduate student in a STEM major, this is absolutely frustrating. There were also a couple questions that were very poorly worded, or ones that can imply multiple correct answers depending upon interpretation. If only these question banks went through a QA department that was paid well, I would have rated this game much higher. It's a shame. Although the ambiguous questions do not appear too often, if it came up on the $1,000,000 question and you answered it wrong, I can bet you money that you would wanna do something to animated Jeff Foxworthy.\n\n==== Score ====Bad\n- 4/10","November 14, 2015","false","0.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I have never experienced such a fun game on Steam and was honestly impressed by how well made the game was- the storyline, the graphics, everything about it.\nI don't mean to get started on this, but now I've mentioned the graphics, I must also express how great they are. The graphics are absolutely outstanding. What did I expect from a PC game? Nothing but the best. I experienced a full-game with nothing but enthusiasm as I joined the game and thought to myself: "will the graphics to this game ever have an impact on my eyesight?". I was honestly wondering this for a while, and I was unsure whether such graphical content is even legal. A slight disclaimer would be appreciated, at least.\n\n10/10 - Would play again.","December 1, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","23","3","13","4","2"

Let me explain:\n-The graphics are so good, they most likely used require a Titan graphics card but they found a way to make the requirements lower\n-The storyline is great, Jeff Foxworthy tells a great story\n-Its so fun to play with friends\n-Great replay value\n-Game is awesome\n\nBe sure to pick this game up, it's really good.","December 1, 2015","true","9.7"," 0 of 12 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","12","0","0"

Otherwise its not bad for improving on your vocabulary if you're not a native speaker.\n\nAs long as there is no option to deactivate those archaic imperial measurement questions, I've got to give it thumbs down.\nWhy are the USA among the only 2 countries on the planet not using SI-units anyhow?","December 19, 2015","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Due to being a DS port expect to play in super widescreen view.\n\nWith no voice acting and repeating host dialog the game is flat and lifeless.  The children you select to cheat from are from an under funded school and fail all of their classes so they game expects you to spend your prize money upgrading the school in order get their grades up.","March 17","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader 2015 Edition is going to test your Mind to see how much you know about what you were thought in school. Despite using the Nintendo 3DS Engine, to be fair, Ludia did make the iOS Version while UbiSoft made the PS2 Version of the game, which are really fun to play. Answer every single Question & play through an entire game exactly as shown Primetime TV.\n\nIf you're stuck you can cheat by Peek or Copy to get the desired answer but be careful, you only got ONE Safeguard in case you make an error via incorrect answer, but if you did everything right in your mind and Memory then you could be Smarter than a 5th Grader!","May 31","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
