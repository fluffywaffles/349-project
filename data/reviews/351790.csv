It feels more like the start of a novel than a short story, but even for that  the characters and the world lack that certain something to draw me in and keep me wanting more. That said, generally the world building, the plot and the characters and their interplay are solidly done, so with more practice or the right editor, the writer could easily move up from "decent" to "good". Pretty much the same goes for the art, it is decent, and "free VN" cheaply made, and judging from observing webcomic artists  develop, give the artist a few more years to hone and develop their style, they could easily move up from "decent" to "good".\n\nDespite the aforementioned weaknesses, I did enjoy playing this VN. It's free! Recommended.","March 2, 2015","true","1.3"," 82 of 94 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","82","94","5","0"

I don't recommend this game, but there is clearly something here that many people like if the mostly positive reviews are any indication. Read this review for my pros and cons if nothing else, and decide for yourself if you'd like to try the game as a demo-esque experience. While I am aware negative reviews garner many "not helpful" votes despite their content, I hope that there are players that do find my commentary helpful regardless of whether they agree with my points or not, and hopefully constructive criticisms will lead to the upcoming paid content from this developer being of a quality that potential fans can enjoy.\n\nInvisible Apartment is a free "demo" of sorts to introduce players to the universe that the developers have created, in an attempt to generate interest for upcoming releases of what I assume will be a series of visual novel games in the same universe. I am a fan of visual novels, cyberpunk atmospheres, and of the dystopian genre in particular, so I was more than willing to give this a shot.\n\nWhat Invisible Apartment does well is its atmosphere and artwork. It is refreshing to see such colorful environments in a dystopian game. It is apparent that the story behind the game has potential; it teases substance and intrigue, a corrupt government and civilian uprisings.\n\nThe problem with Invisible Apartment is...everything else. The writing is particularly unpolished. It honestly reads like a high schooler's writing project. There is no shortage of mispellings, grammatical errors, or sentence structure issues, and when there is a mistake on nearly every page of text, it feels unpolished, unprofessional, and simply not anywhere near ready to be released to the public. This game is in dire need of an editor.\n\nThere are also transitional issues (abrupt scene changes, for example), some sound issues (music stopping abruptly), and some odd miscellaneous gameplay issues (clicks not registering, blank screens that make it appear as though the game is over when it is not, etc.). While the story is clearly held dear to the writer's heart, none of the characters are well fleshed out, ideas are bluntly told to the player (or skimmed over) rather than introduced as relevant concepts that the player should care about (and think about for a time after the game has ended), relationships between characters are shallow and come out of nowhere, and the reasons behind the government doing corrupt things are not realistic or interesting in the slightest, and basically boil down to, "well, this guy is pretentious, so others have to suffer." It's the type of black and white thinking that turns possible brilliant storylines into the clichéd and forgettable because it has no basis in practicality or reality.\n\nIn summary, Invisible Apartment plays like a visual novel "outline" for a writer's possible upcoming novel. Nothing has substance, nothing is terribly interesting, and everything is rough around the edges. While I can understand releasing this for free to generate public interest for paid content (and thus sacrificing a bit of quality), I also have to take this at face value for what it is and how it is presented to the public. For being a released game, it is terribly unpolished, and story-wise, I feel like this needs to go back to the drawing board to be fleshed out. If the quality of Invisible Apartment is indicative of what we can expect from the upcoming paid chapters, I highly doubt I'll be sticking around for the rest. If the developers released this mostly to listen to feedback and suggestions, I believe they have a decent start, but they have a long way to go in terms of writing and gameplay before even thinking of a paid release. Invisible Apartment shows potential, but unfortunately, potential doesn't make up for its glaring flaws.","March 30, 2015","false","0.5"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","52","60","0","0"

He had a little mistake of not specifying this, so hopefully he'll change the store description and maybe fix it up a bit. Click the thread link for a more in-depth explanation from the Developer. Hope you all enjoy this game, but realize there is more to come! This is merely a demo of sorts to keep you interested. I still highly reccomend this title!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is my first Visual Novel, and probably only Visual Novel I'll ever read. I got into it because it's a Cyberpunk Visual Novel, being the Cyberpunk junkie I am. I wanted something in a Visual Novel that wasn't about harem and hentai. So if you wish to start getting into Visual Novels that don't throw anime boobs in your face, this is certainly a good one to begin on.\nHonestly, I had a negative review earlier when I finished the game. I loved this game, but the issue I had with it was the fact that this is unfinished. There is no ending. The plot builds up until it suddenly says "THE END" and being a fan of this Visual Novel so far, I was quite disappointed. But I realized the following points:\nIs it a bit short? Yes.\nIs the ending unfinished and completely abrupt? Most definitely.\nIs it free? Yeah, it is.\nDoes it at least entertain you throughout? Yeah, it's a fantastic story and premise.\nNot only that, but the developer is also going to be releasing the prequel to this game called "Invisible Apartment Zero" to Desura on March 17. Will it come on Steam? Maybe. Maybe not. But if you think this game is too short, realize that the developer is active, and there is a good chance he'll be continuing Invisible Apartment and hopefully end it the right way.

The only thing needing work is the writing, which is less than ideal for something that purports to be a visual novel.\n\nThe writing is rushed and rough, switching between scenes suddenly and quite often without an indication why. At times, it explains nothing, while other times, it dumps info on you. It's incoherent, and doesn't appear to have had a pass for formatting, presentation and grammar.\n\nIt looks like a first project, and that inspires both hope and anger in me. Hope, because I think the ideas presented and the storyline feebly attempted are worthwhile, and can be salvaged. Please, read some tutorials, practice more, and then revisit this - I really think it deserves it.\n\nAnger, because the visuals are quality. It's above-average in places, good in most, and even great at times. As a writer-programmer without an artist, it's sad to see art like this so callously wasted by sub-par writing and bad UI.\n\nAt this stage, I cannot recommend it, apart from having a quick skim-through for the ideas presented. If, in future, the writing is improved, I will adjust my opinion - I certainly hope I will get that chance.","March 5, 2015","false","0.7"," 64 of 91 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","64","91","3","0"

Some of this I'll attribute to the creators being Italian; the issue might be the translation only.  Characters as a whole feel as if they're built slim; they lack a unique voice to the point I had trouble telling the characters' dialogue apart.  The traits also seem misapplied.  Our protagonist is a hacker who doesn't play a role in a hack other than walking around.  Her A.I. companion does all the digital work, yet fails to spot an obvious missing link in a database join.  And in order to make certain a scene happens the mysterious guy she meets turns out to be a stalker if the right choice is made, before the point he would have any motivation to do so.\n\nThere's funny dialogue, some of which are spoiled by translation issues, and there's rudimentary scene-setting moments.  The character growth I saw mentioned in a couple reviews, and the reason I'm trying it out, isn't there.  In a half hour's worth of reading, about 3-4 days pass plus indeterminable time while Bunny's unconcious.  The "growth" between the protagonist and maybe love interest is boiled down to about half an hour of conversation split between a few days.  She goes from scared of him to wary of him to trusting within a five minute conversation.\n\nBeyond writing:\nThis teaser only has 2-3 choices in total.  Basic mechanics are fine.  The artwork is probably the best reason to play the game, and I expect is the main reason for many good reviews.  Setting is a bit glitchy if you have any knowledge of IT; the setting as a whole could've used more setting up.\n\nMy Conclusion:\nFrom what has already been shown, I don't hold much hope for the following titles.  Don't recommend.  But hey, it's free.  So give it a shot for yourself.","September 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","34","43","2","0"

So i thought before i spend money on it, i'll play the first game so i know what is going on and with all the positive reviews, i thought this was going to be a good series i could fall inlove with. And it just so happens to be free. But even if its a free game to play, it doesn't make it a good game. As you can see, this is a visual novel which has choices you can make. But the choices in this game are dead end choices where you must pick the right one to continue onward. That was a huge disappointment to me because i kept picking the ones that got me caught. Linear novels with no tweaks for pick your own path really bother me because i felt duped in a way. And for whatever reason the "quicksave" button would not let me save at my current point. So i had to start from the very beginning which was frustrating till i found out if you go into the menu and hit "Save" it will work. When you make a visual novel, you want the reader to fall inlove with the plot, the characters and to pull them in. But i was somewhat lost by this novel. When you first start, the game puts you right in the middle of something that you won't understand and does not explain very well later on. And right off the bat you can tell this game felt rushed a bit or was mainly just a project to see if someone could actually make a visual novel. However, even if the art style and charming music were a nice touch which are positive things to note, the scene's did not flow well at all and made you felt like the developers didn't care if the dialog flew from one end of the town to a apartment or a rooftop without warning. I just couldn't understand it. The writing isn't good either but i kept playing it because i really want in my heart to like this so i can try out the 2nd game. So i pushed on, in hopes it would get better. But after reading more of the story, the main character Bunny started to make me mad. It was hard to tell that she was talking to the AI "Mask" and not at the other character she was interacting with in the physical world. But it wasn't just that, it was her personality as well. She seemed to act like a child, not a skilled hacker. I just resented the character even further than i did in the beginning. And also what i noticed is how this novel lacks any descriptive details about the places bunny travels too. *Shes in a park* Well what did the park look like? *shes in a hospital* Well, can we get some more details please instead of bunny constantly talking? I love visual novels so much when the story comes to life, but i cannot recommend this to any of my friends and advise you to look elsewhere. But hey at least this game was free so no one had to waste anything but their time.","September 26, 2015","false","1.0"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mvri/recommended/351790/","mvri","19ths","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mvri/","241 products in account","Invisible Apartment is a short visual novel that took a painstakingly long time for me to finish. Thirty minutes of gameplay should be a breeze to get done in one session -- especially for bingers like myself -- but I just couldn't bring myself to do so this time around. In an attempt to judge the game as unbiasedly as possible, I ended up "leaving" and coming back to it three separate times. Unfortunately, these breaks didn't make the story (or the characters) any less of a hassle to sit through. I personally found the MC and the cast to be a group of bland, stock characters with very little dynamic and very little room to grow. The writing and general flow of information seemed inconsistent and the relationships between the characters were lacking, if not completely dull.\n\nFor what it's worth, the artwork and the music of Invisible Apartment aren't half-bad; they're definitely the strong suits of the game. Everything else, however, just comes off as "rough draft" material rather than "finished product" material. Despite it being free and short, this is one VN on Steam I wouldn't really recommend.","March 16, 2015","false","0.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/recommended/351790/","Megasan","Megasan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megasan/","543 products in account","Invisible Apartment is a visual novel that is free to play on steam. The story takes place in a semi-cyberpunk world where you play as the female character “bunny”. Who is trying to hack into a corporation to try to clear her name.\n\nGame Play: 3\n\nAs a visual novel, you just click after each dialog to get to the next one. With a few here and there choices that can lead you in the right path or not. The lack of choices and how they play out are pretty Meh. Given that you only interact with the game about 3 or 4 times(Depending on what you choose). This game is very short. I was able to beat it in 40 to 45 minutes and 50 to 55 by going back to the other options they give you. Needless to say that it's not the best visual novel out there for game play.\n\nStory: 4\n\nThe story in it's self is kinda of lack luster. You follow the character bunny to undercover information about a hacker who stops you from hacking into a corporation. Which you in turn find yourself chasing down the hackers connections to uncover who they really are. Over all the story isn't that great. There is no real character development, you don't have any real connection to the character her self.  You find your self some what interested in the story about half way when it starts to get interesting. When you think it's going to pick up more it doesn't the game just kinda of suddenly ends. Leaving to question whats going on but not enough to care. There may be a part two some day but as of right now you are kinda of left with a some what of a build up. All the characters you met outside of bunny are not that interesting either.\n\nMusic: 8\n\nThe music to me is the best part. I feel like the choices of music was pretty good and well placed with in the game. However the music does repeat it's self often and sometimes you can hear the music cut off to repeat it's self. I wouldn't mind owning the sound track to this game. However there is only a handful of songs being playing.\n\nGraphics: 7\n\nThey game has an overall anime look and feel to it. It try’s to be a cyber punk style game. However only the Main character and some of the other characters have more of cyber punk look to them. While a very few backgrounds have a cyber punk look or feel to them. It's mostly city backgrounds, or indoors. Nothing to amazing. I did find the graphic very pleasing and nice to look at. Mostly bright looking and colorful graphics.\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nI find this novel not the greatest nor the worse. For a free to play novel it is decent for what it is. Would I recommend this to anyone? No. however do I think you should stay away from it? No. If your into visual novels and your looking for a filler or something quick to do I would say try this game. Otherwise your not missing out on much.\n\nFinal Score: 5\n\ncheck out my tumblr for other reviews and other things. http://rogue32807.tumblr.com/","March 4, 2015","true","1.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imsodonionringsrightnow/recommended/351790/","imsodonionringsrightnow","grrrrrrr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imsodonionringsrightnow/","51 products in account","Now, mind you, I did not enjoy this game very much. It fails in many aspects as a visual novel, and it didn't really hook me. Why? I will explain. (Warning: Probably spoilers)\n\nMUSIC: The music is just Kevin McLeod royalty-free music, or most likely royalty-free ambients. The loops aren't clean, they use simple fade outs and fade ins to create the illusion of "looping". A lot of the music cuts awkwardly, and some sounds I feel do not fit certain things.\n\nCHARACTERS: The characters in this are *very* basic. You have your protagonist, Bunny. She just wants to live a "normal life", but due to her having a bad record, she can't get a job anywhere. So basically she was like "♥♥♥♥ it, I'll make my record even worse and just try to get by!" And, very oddly, she's suicidal? Many moments she has times where she goes into philosophical "if I jumped, would anyone miss me?" scenarios and it's honestly very out of place, and kind of silly. I guess they were trying to flesh out her character more? It just feels really out of place, and it'll just appear at random moments. One minute she's lying down and talking about this great couch, next minute she's on the balcony thinking about how she could die. Nice.\nBunny's personality is all over the place. One minute she's acting like a bratty teenager, next minute she's acting like a cool teenager, next she's a wise-monk teenager, next she talks about how she wants to die, cycles back to bratty teenager. It's very weird.\nThe other characters are all as equally bland as the next. There is literally nothing defining by each of their personalities that describes them as "different".\n\nSTORY: I don't know. Hacker chick hacks things for... a reason, gets a proxy (???), hunts down a lady in a coma, dude gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause coma-lady is his mom, hacker chick is like "whoa I'm sorry, potential-love-interest-of-the-story, I guess I should blindly trust you now", hacker chick gets in trouble, hacker chick is in a coma as well, hacker chick has weird dream with the lady in a coma, dude busts hacker chick out, the end. There are branching paths, but there's really nothing to them.\n\nPRESENTATION: The art is honestly really nice, probably the best thing about this game. It's very appealing and quite simple. The text on the other hand isn't very well done. Many errors in grammar, spelling and just sentence structure in general. It's hard to tell who's talking, and if the picture in the background has any form of bright colors, have fun trying to read the white, non-standing out text! There are strange times where the dialogue is poetic, which sounds very out of place, and it almost sounds like those cheesy fanfictions you wish you never read.\n\nMost of these things I've said are negative, so you must wonder, why am I recommending this? The art's nice, and the story is sort of easy to follow along. And for the cheap price of free, and a file size that even a toaster could hold, Invisible Apartment is a fun little game you can play on the side, as it only goes for about 20 minutes tops. If you get past the bland characters and bad translation, you'll find some enjoyment out of Invisible Apartment, and you'll probably remember it for the rest of your life (or for maybe a couple of weeks, if you're that kind of person).\n\nInvisible Apartment gets a 4/10 from me.","March 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","3","4","4","0"

This was about 1% game and 99% bedtime story. It was essentially a text-based game with lullaby music in the background. There were no animations to anything, which isn't necessarily bad, except that the same images were reused constantly. The most annoying of which being the information displayed on Bunny's Mask. The basis of the plot would have been okay if it weren't full of holes, nonsense, and inconsistencies. Overall, I'm just glad the game was F2P because, as it is, it isn't worth any amount of money.","March 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think there was only two or three areas where you actually could determine the outcome of the story by clicking different reactions. Besides that, there is nothing to do but read. Take my advice and don't bother even though its free. The story was so boring and I assumed there was some actual game aspect to it, I began clicking furiously to get through the drole story line to get to the gaming part, then before I knew it, "The End" popped up. 0/10. Actually, 0 out of anything.","March 11, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Why?\n\nYou learn how to hack like a 1337 pr0. 10/10.\n\nSome transitions within the scenes are to jump-cutty, lacks smooth fluidty and dynamic flow - not much atmosphere or engangment with the user.\n\nAudio transitions could be imrpoved - same with choices. Again, instantly cut. Akward girl moans or noises when protagonist speaks.\n\nI can't see backlog or history of narrative if I try scrolling up. Most VNs have that option and I can't speed through/skip text if I scroll down using the wheel (mouse 3).\n\nLittle to-no character development or it's severly slow in building that connection.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfyxblack/recommended/351790/","wolfyxblack","Chester Cheetah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfyxblack/","18 products in account","What a great story. The graphics, the music, the storyline, it all pulls you in and makes you feel like part of the plot. Some may be able to easily relate to Bunny (The protagonist). The choices you make draw you in, make you feel the happiness of a good decision, the sadness and fear of a bad decision, and the excitement of what is yet to come, and what you have mixed yourself up with in the story. The music was a key factor, I feel. I always wanted to make soundtracks for my stories, and the creators have found a perfect way to do it. There are some tracks that loop a little much, but a few clicks down the rabbit hole and you are into a beautiful song, or an entrancing melody that holds you and wraps you in what the character is feeling as they fight to figure out their life. I'm sure many people can relate to the struggle of not knowing where you are going, or if what you are doing is the right choice, and this visual novel is by far one of the most interesting stories I have ever read and related to on such a profound label. It isn't too wordy to put off a more common reader, or younger eyes, but it isn't dumbed down like some stories out there. You need to pay attention, and learn more about the world and people in it, and once you do, you will be glad you did. I recommend this game for anyone that enjoys a cyberpunk plot and feel, a deeply written and profound story, and if you can relate to a life of struggles and bad choices, then this is definitely for you.\n\nOn a personal note, I really hope the creator comes up with more. It is a little bit of a shame that this one is free, but Invisible Apartment Zero is a bit of money spent, though I am sure it is money well spent, and I'll gladly help crowd fund this endeavor. Also, this is the first time I am writing a review for something on Steam. Even out of my favorite games to play, and ones that I have played that Steam has, but that I had played on different consoles or independantly, this is the one that inspired me to leave a positive review.

I understand this was a sort of demo to gather whether there would be interest.\n\nI'm very much interested in the story and characters and seeing where everything goes. I appreciate that our protagonist is female and not sexualized by default.\n\nI hope in future installments, it plays with more options available. For example, the first scene where the player is given 3 options to choose from, only one of the options is viable. The others lead to immediate death. I'd rather they lead to different story paths (including death, sure, but not all of them). Not to mention, in the option where she chooses to stay there, I find it difficult to believe that skilled hacker who's gone under the radar for so long would be so easily nerve-wracked.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stibnitive/recommended/351790/","Stibnitive","Stibnitive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stibnitive/","449 products in account","I recommend this game.\nIt's not for the story, which I didn't get far enough into to actually get to,\nIt's also not because 'the gameplay is good' (it's not)\nIt's finally not because of the story, which definately has potential, but started basically when the game finished.\nIt's actually because this is an interesting example of how NOT to make a visual novel, without being necessarily bad.\n\n(warning: contains very mild spoilers)\n\nThis visual novel is a great learning experience for starting visual novel creators as it's not 'just' a rough gem', it's an extremely rough gem with very fundamental flaws.\n\nThe game runs on a custom engine made for iOS and poorly ported to windows, and it really shows. There is literally only one hotkey and that's the spacebar for 'next line'. Every other function is a button either on screen or in the menu (which is also a seperate button). On iOS this makes sense since tabbing the screen at any place other than a button can only have one function.\n\nAnother result of this is that many functions are cut. There are no options for sound management (which isn't that much of an issue since the only sound is background music, making your line-out the only sound management you actually need), different screen sizes, text speed, font size, skip options, or jiggle physics (which is sliiiightly less important than the other options missing). It's all cut down to the bare minimum of 'play, save and load'.\n\nIt COULD work, but it doesn't here. The background is usually very light, but they use non-bordered white letters for this visual novel. The black bar that the text was displayed on, was, in combination with what I mentioned last line, not enough to actually make it readable at the speed I desired to read it at. This could be fixed in either one of two ways:  give the translucid bar a higher opacity or an opacity slider in the options, or make the text borded by a small 2px black line.\n\nAnother thing, that's a clear relic of the iOS days, is that the buttons feel extremely unresponsive. This is, simply, because there is no feedback at all. I imagine that on iOS, the phone would vibrate a bit, and that visual aids aren't needed since you don't see the button anyway when your finger is in front of it, but on windows I can never tell whether or not I quicksaved.\n\nThe biggest flaw is the lack of history. In most visual novels, you can either press a button or scroll up to see some of the past dialogue, but in this game, that's not possible. Since it's a sci-fi game and not some romantic comedy, you sometimes really want this function when something in the next line refers to something you accidently read over in the previous line.\n\n\nWhat to learn from it:\n1. get, besides a load and save option, at least a way to customize some of the game, be it by resolution changes or some extra slider bars in an option menu\n2. make sure that there's an option to read older dialogue\n3. make buttons responsive/when you port an engine, optimise it well for the new platform.\n\n\nAnd now to the writing:\nIt's not bad. It started off just as atrocious as the interface, but 10 minutes in, I noticed how most annoyances were simply no longer there in the storytelling.\nThe game starts off extremely fanfictiony, with *'s for action, rather than for ambience.\nThe good way to use *: "it's getting late *sigh* I'm going to bed"\nthe bad way to use *: "It's getting late *she sights* I'm going to bed"\nIn the beginning, you're not sure what's going on until they actually go to the city where the invisible appartment actually is. It's not 'mysterious', it's just written messy.\nFinally, the big words used during stages of rest (when the player should relax as well) made it feel unimmersive and pretentious.\n\nThis was over time fixed after 20 minutes. The only problems I have now are that Bunny is an extreme whiner who talks extremely cheesy. This *could* work, if it wasn't for mask being awkward and for the spelling and grammatical errors.\n\nAnother flaw in the writing is the huge amount of sudden unannounced skips in the story with the only possible explanation being that she's narcoleptic.\n\nWhat to learn from this:\n1. do your research before you make your first VN. Look at how everything is used. Then, out of that, create your own style\n2. when you come from a different medium, don't try to mix it in right off the bat (kind of overlaps with 1)\n3. let someone playtest this before you put it up on greenlight. Ask him too look at more than just the story (which is, reading in the comments, basically the only thing this game is praised for).\n\nAnd now the story:\nThe story itself it a bit too short to actually review here, but there are certain aspects that I can review.\n\nWithout spoiling anything: for a first episode of an episodic visual novel, the story cut off at a good place. It's right at the start of something new that we'll see a next time.\nThe story definately has potential. The longer I played it, the more I wanted to know about what happened. So far, it was predictable, but not in a bad way since it just followed natural progression instead of something forced.\nThere are two things that I do have some critique for:\n1. the choices you're given don't mean anything. I know you're only at the beginning of the game, but if there is only once choice that doesn't get a forced bad end, don't give them! The first choice, where two of the three branches are obvious dead ends, is a common thing in doujin soft/indie visual novels, but there are still too many choices where the other choice simply means instant death. Choices that in the end don't matter, but do matter for your sense of freedom in the moment (like when you find the woman in the hospital, and someone comes towards you), are fine, and, this early into the story, they're even good. The story branched off for just long enough to actually feel like it mattered.\n2. You know way too much of the enemy already. You know, out of nowhere, his face, name and background, while none of this is actually necessary. The mystery stops when the evil has a face. it's a shame that they did that already. The encounter was fine, and Klement (I like this name for a bad guy) having a name is also fine, but the actual enemy should have just been a shadow.\n\n\nThis next one is just my opinion as an AI student, but mask seems 'too human for how stupid he is' and the other way around. It requires immense hardware to run a program that can interact with humans, let alone act human, while storing data and logical thinking are relatively extremely easy to pull off. I think that a better way of phrasing it is 'mask's mistakes are way too human for an AI'. Of course you can program AI to make mistakes like that, but that would be extremely counterefficient for a personal computer.\n\nNow to the music:\nThe music itself is pretty decent, but still has clear mistakes.\nThe part where she's at the hospital sounded loud, drone and repetitive (because it was a 8 second loop that wasn't even well looped). 'Drone' is a word that comes to mind in many of the songs, and it's the only complaint I have, for example, about my personal favorite track in the game, which is the one with the guitar, harp and (drone) strings.\nMusic with lyrics is fine, but it's a lot harder to make this work this work as background music in visual novels. At first I applauded this attempt, but I soon noticed that this track is played for a rather long time, making it loop just a bit too much.\n\nFinally: none of the songs actually loop well.\n\nWhat to learn from this:\n1. mix your music right. If the rhythm is too loud, it could sound drone, but if the lead is too loud (doesn't happen in this game, however), the song could fall flat.\n2. Make the songs about 3 minutes, or at least 30 seconds, but well loopable.\n\nReached character limit. read this pastebin for the art and conclusion: zAEyuL6V","April 12, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics, the music, the storyline, it all pulls you in and makes you feel like part of the plot. Some may be able to easily relate to Bunny (The protagonist). The choices you make draw you in, make you feel the happiness of a good decision, the sadness and fear of a bad decision, and the excitement of what is yet to come, and what you have mixed yourself up with in the story. The music was a key factor, I feel. I always wanted to make soundtracks for my stories, and the creators have found a perfect way to do it. There are some tracks that loop a little much, but a few clicks down the rabbit hole and you are into a beautiful song, or an entrancing melody that holds you and wraps you in what the character is feeling as they fight to figure out their life. I'm sure many people can relate to the struggle of not knowing where you are going, or if what you are doing is the right choice, and this visual novel is by far one of the most interesting stories I have ever read and related to on such a profound label. It isn't too wordy to put off a more common reader, or younger eyes, but it isn't dumbed down like some stories out there. You need to pay attention, and learn more about the world and people in it, and once you do, you will be glad you did. I recommend this game for anyone that enjoys a cyberpunk plot and feel, a deeply written and profound story, and if you can relate to a life of struggles and bad choices, then this is definitely for you.\n\nOn a personal note, I really hope the creator comes up with more. It is a little bit of a shame that this one is free, but Invisible Apartment Zero is a bit of money spent, though I am sure it is money well spent, and I'll gladly help crowd fund this endeavor. Also, this is the first time I am writing a review for something on Steam. Even out of my favorite games to play, and ones that I have played that Steam has, but that I had played on different consoles or independantly, this is the one that inspired me to leave a positive review.

It sets the stage for a good and interesting game, and then it ends. I guess that the idea is that this will be episodic, but all it does now is get you hyped up and leave you with blue balls. It's a demo for an experience that doesn't exist yet.\n\nWhat does exist isn't bad, though. The art is quite solid and the story, while nothing too special so far, isn't bad and shows promise to get better.\n\nBesides shortness, the game is hindered by technological weakness and a lack of options, as it doesn't let you set text speed or to review previously displayed text, which together make this bit of a hassle to proceed through, and I found myself also missing skipping, as I wound up going back to a quicksave and hurrying through to read a bit of text I missed, by using mouse clicks to hurry the printing along, a few different times.\n\nThe writing occassionally drops into artsy bits that, to me, come across more as pretentious than deep, and the pacing feels rushed, but overall it's an engaging style and the storyline was effective at grabbing my interest. I would like to read more from the author, if only this author did add more to his story. I think that when/if there's some manner of "Invisible Apartment: Complete" released, with the full story completed and packaged together in a single, more professionally composed program, and when the story has had some good editing work done, this has the potential to be an excellent VN and perhaps one of the best on Steam.\n\nThis release is nothing more than a tease for a product that doesn't yet exist, though.

Needs some more work, but there could be something good here. Has some interesting ideas, an alright art style, and characters that are kinda likeable. The setting and theme of the story are definitely interesting. A cyberpunk setting with a hacker as the main protagonist hasn't really been done before in a visual novel game (as far as my knowledge of visual novel games goes..). I actually would kind of like to see more of this game, but mostly if the full game is better improved as opposed to this game. The game's not bad, it's just on the ok side. I think with a little better writing and more pictures showing alittle more of what's going on and help portray the characters' emotions better, this story could take off. Because in the beginning it's pretty eh but later on the story starts to get a little more interesting. Also, kinda have to commend this game for not being filled with overly sexualized women. Not that those novel games suck or I deeply hate them, it's just nice to see a visual novel that doesn't play off of or contain that stereotype of the visual novel genre. Overall, not a bad 30 min-hour "waste of your time." It's free, not too long, and (as another user has already said) it does have a better story than Twilight.","March 8, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too short sadly, as there is too much plot crammed into such a small game. The characters develop too fast, (it being a short game and all, it's forced) and makes it feel dumbed down. Though, you will know who will fill what role rather quickly upon reading each characters text, so, it's not bad considering it's such a short game. This has so much potential to evolve into one of the best Visual Novels "out there".\n\nTHE MUSIC IS AMAZING!\n\nPROS-\nFairly decent visuals.\nEnough plot to let you know what's going on.\nSeveral points of intereaction, where you make the choice to advance the plot.\nHUGE ONE here. The music is incredible, and it fits a cyber punk theme perfectly.\n( Seriosuly, after a playthough, go back and just listen to the music)\n\nCONS-\nToo short.\nStory is fairly common for Cyber Punk.\nCharacters follow common tropes. No suprise twists.\nVisuals are a bit static, but hey, you're supposed to be reading anyway. ;)\nYou will feel like it is unfinished at the end.\n\nSide note; this game reminds me of Neo Seoul in that movie Cloud Atlas.\n\nI give this game an 8/10.

I understand this was a sort of demo to gather whether there would be interest.\n\nI'm very much interested in the story and characters and seeing where everything goes. I appreciate that our protagonist is female and not sexualized by default.\n\nI hope in future installments, it plays with more options available. For example, the first scene where the player is given 3 options to choose from, only one of the options is viable. The others lead to immediate death. I'd rather they lead to different story paths (including death, sure, but not all of them). Not to mention, in the option where she chooses to stay there, I find it difficult to believe that skilled hacker who's gone under the radar for so long would be so easily nerve-wracked. Again, since I understand that this was sort of demo, I'll forgive it here. I wont be so forgiving in future, fully developed installments though.\n\nI look forward to the next episodes.\n(P.S.

It sets the stage for a good and interesting game, and then it ends. I guess that the idea is that this will be episodic, but all it does now is get you hyped up and leave you with blue balls. It's a demo for an experience that doesn't exist yet.\n\nWhat does exist isn't bad, though. The art is quite solid and the story, while nothing too special so far, isn't bad and shows promise to get better.\n\nBesides shortness, the game is hindered by technological weakness and a lack of options, as it doesn't let you set text speed or to review previously displayed text, which together make this bit of a hassle to proceed through, and I found myself also missing skipping, as I wound up going back to a quicksave and hurrying through to read a bit of text I missed, by using mouse clicks to hurry the printing along, a few different times.\n\nThe writing occassionally drops into artsy bits that, to me, come across more as pretentious than deep, and the pacing feels rushed, but overall it's an engaging style and the storyline was effective at grabbing my interest. I would like to read more from the author, if only this author did add more to his story. I think that when/if there's some manner of "Invisible Apartment: Complete" released, with the full story completed and packaged together in a single, more professionally composed program, and when the story has had some good editing work done, this has the potential to be an excellent VN and perhaps one of the best on Steam.\n\nThis release is nothing more than a tease for a product that doesn't yet exist, though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenshiOkamiLove/recommended/351790/","TenshiOkamiLove","Tenshi Okami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TenshiOkamiLove/","64 products in account","It’s sometimes hard to talk about a Visual Novel because their really isn’t much game play to be had. The story this one has is a bit confusing as you can’t understand fully the world it is set in. It’s a futuristic world where the government keeps tabs on everyone. Our main character is a girl hacker with a ‘awakened AI’ that helps her out in whatever she wants to do. One day while trying to hack something, she gets caught by a guy and ends up wanting to see him. It follows her and him through this maze of mystery into conspiracies about the place New Jessica.\n\nWhat is interesting is the version I played was free. It also felt more like just the opening to a game. Mostly your clicking to scroll through the text and then when left with a decision, you pick what you want. Some will make the game end rather fast, the others will let you keep going. I went through all of the different branches in the story and they had a really interesting amount of dialog to go with it. The characters personalities’ sort of change depending on which way you go but it’s not a very big change. Bunny is pretty much like a tomboy in how she acts; a real risk taker that could get her into trouble. Her AI Mask seems to be like her physiologist in some ways, over analyzing things she does or the people around him. He acts a bit human in fact especially on his constant want to stay alive and not be deleted. He doesn’t really make jokes, might not even know how to actually, so most of the time he is very serious and stiff. Alex on the other hand is very laid back. He ends up being really caring even to someone he has only just met and will do pretty much anything to protect them. For this beginning to a story, they are the only characters that I can really talk about.\n\nThe artwork is so amazing but I can chock that up to it being still images. It’s very bright and actually feels sterile, much like the idea of the future. The people are very anime style especially with the main character having pink hair and then blue. By the way, I really want the thing she uses to change her hair. Anyway, Bunny looks as though she is a lot younger then what I would think; she is more like high school age and yet how she talks seems more like someone in their twenties. Alex looks pretty much like a geeky/cool guy. He’s tall, and always looks like he is leaning slightly back in his artwork.\n\nThe music is amazing! It’s rather soft and very mysterious. The music doesn’t seem to overtake the scenes it’s in and there are a couple different songs that go along with the artwork. Most of them are instrumental but there is I think one song that has vocals. The vocals are rather soft again, and they don’t mess with the overall feeling. I couldn’t hear much of what it was singing, so it doesn’t get in the way of trying to read the text.\n\nOverall this is a really good start of the game. It’s not a full version, just feels a bit like a demo but it’s a solid demo. The story seems well put together from what I could see of it, and I really do what to know what’s coming next so if I do end up getting the game, I will let you guys know more about it.\n","September 16, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buob/recommended/351790/","buob","Buob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buob/","370 products in account","Invisible Apartment seems to have a decent premise. A young girl is followed while hacking into a bank system, causing the authorities to be alerted to their presence. So, they try to find the other hacker... for some reason.\n\nIt's not really explained why the girl and her AI go look for the person who followed her instead of looking for another way to hack into the bank system aside from basic human curiosity. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when thought about from a logical persepective, it doesn't really make sense, especially when the game itself basically states "we only know they followed you, probably because they were curious why you were breaking into the system." They try to give another reason later, but to be honest, it's pretty weak.\n\nAside from that, the characters are introduced at break-neck speeds, unless the author doesn't want you to learn their names, in which case it's very drawn out. The names are not the only thing that are whiplash inducing. Scenes flash by with maybe two or three boxes of dialogue and then will transport you with no warning to another area with another couple boxes of dialogue. There was even one scene that was basically the main character making a short "I am who I am" speech that really had no reason to be there, and much like the earlier scenes, cut into that scene, said it's part, and cut out of the scene into the next one.\n\nThe art is well done, and I really can't fault it for that. The characters have sort of a moe vibe where everything is a bit shiny, but again, there's nothing wrong with it, and I actually rather enjoy that kind of character design. The backgrounds are mostly simple painted lineart pieces, but it makes sense when the focus is on the dialogue boxes and characters. They also go really well with the cyberpunk theme.\n\nThe setting makes sense but the author tries to make some use of what a cyberpunk future would look like and some of the scenes don't always work or seem forced in.\n\nMost of the game seems rather forced, actually. Some of the choices are overreactions or would be illogical in the situation, but are the only "sane" choice and are therefore only there to move the story along. The story itself is pretty short, a half hour play time to go through all of the options and learn a little bit more about the main character. It's a nice touch, but when it leads to the same ending, you almost think "what's the point?"\n\nOriginally I thought the game was a demo, and would have recommended it. That not being the case, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it, though it's honestly more of a neatral rating than it is a negative one. It's half an hour of foreplay for no significant end result, even though there is currently a prequel and soon-to-be sequel. We'll see if the sequel is any better--I certainly hope it is.","September 12, 2015","false","0.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't really have any idea what to expect, but even then I wasn't prepared for the complete lack of polish in this game.\n\nThe art is decent, but too often it's wasted on quick, throwaway shots that don't make good use of the time it took to produce it. Sprites suffer from a lack of transitions, the default, boring textbox makes it hard to read the text at times, and by the point I had to give up on this game, every major speaking character had the same color name, making it a chore to keep track of conversations. In a medium that focuses largely on dialogue, those are pretty huge mistakes.\n\nUse of sound effects was sparse, while the music was generally lacking. The game opens with a public domain piece, and at one point there's a song that's literally five seconds long and badly looped over and over. Add to that what appears to be a complete lack of any kind of options screen or main menu, plus absolutely wooden writing that has about as much style and substance as a bowl of tapioca, and you have a recipe for... well, something that's just not any good.\n\nIt looks like this game was used as a springboard to gain interest (and funding) for future games by these developers, and while there's a good chance their other games are better than this one, I wouldn't pay to find out.

For example, I picked the "wrong" selection in the very beginning and got to the end of that selection branch a few lines later.\nI feel like a VN should have a selection tree instead of a selection stick for it to be a good VN.

The characters are interesting and likeable, though only the protagonist is fully fleshed out. The near future setting is well presented and believable, not overly dystopian as is sometimes the case. The story is good and intriguing, though short, as it continues in the sequel. The music is fantastic and does a lot to set the mood of the game. I think the art is beautiful.\n\nThis is not a novel where you steer the story by your choices. There is only a handful of choices, and some of them lead to the story ending early. (You should save occasionally). The choices are more about understanding what the protagonist could and would do in some scenarios. She is talented and capable but also vulnerable. She is not an action hero and has to prioritize self preservation in her choices. The choices are there to emphasize that aspect of the character, and they work well in that regard.\n\nOn the negative side, the dialogue writing is merely OK, but not bad enough to distract from the good parts. The characters except the protagonist are not fully developed and their motivations are not quite clear, hopefully this is expanded upon in the sequel. There is also a small number of typos, not nearly enough to affect the experience.\n\nThis novel can easily be finished in one sitting, in under an hour. It has good story, art and music.
