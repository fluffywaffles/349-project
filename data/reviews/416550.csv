It's crazy, random and really funny. I was expecting a really bad game because of the screen shots and price. The game introduces you how to play slowly through cutscenes with chunks of humor in them. The levels have fun variations and one level you are seen dodging snow, the other levels you must shoot these weird enemies!\n\nI would recommend this to all gamers, it's cheap, funny and quirky. Nothing better than being a duck and shooting your load at twinkies! or whatever the enemies are called! check my preview video out for more.","December 15, 2015","true","2.4"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","28","37","5","3"

The game made me feel like I was playing out of a childrens story book (In a good way). After seeing the title I thought it was a very interesting and quirky game, I'm very glad it lived up to my expectations. I would have eeven purchased this game for over the price that I paid as the the secrets and easter eggs made this game better than 1$. I was so pleased with the game and it fair price I bought 5 copies for my friends and family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see Ducky, other ducks like achievements from the dev (Yeah I'm looking at you John) so it will boost their self asteem and prove that they indeed are pretty cool ducks","December 22, 2015","true","3.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

In reality, it plays a bit more like a puzzle adventure where the puzzle is figuring out which tools are best suited for the given job and what each level's secret is.  While very short and fairly simple, Rubber Ducky and the Rainbow Gun is a very fun experience with great humor and gameplay, it feels surprisingly interactive.\n\nGameplay here: https://youtu.be/io_uXbock5w","January 1","true","2.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You might think "wow, what an awesome gun!" and you're right, it really is!\n\nThe goal for this game is to shoot the spikies. But, that's not all. There's also a nice narrative story about the different characters of this game. Like most games, it starts off slow and casual. Then...comes the twist. It didn't take long for things to become challenging and I absolutely love that! Most games have a really slow buildup to the challenging bits but the buildup in this game was acceptable and nicely done.\n\nThere are also LOTS of different guns to choose from (which you'll unlock after successfully completing a level). My personal favorites are the rainbow gun, the banana blower and the rocket blarp.\n\nGameplay Review\nThis game looks repetitive and it is BUT nonetheless it's still entertaining and absolutely fun to play. It's not a game that you can complete on the first go because the developer included secrets in each level (I think it was like the first 5 levels or something). Without finding all the secrets, you aren't able to play the remaining levels. That's a nice addition to the game and the secrets are fun to find!\n\nPros\n-This game is suitable for all ages.\n-TONS of replay value! (because you can unlock additional characters and because of the secrets)\n-LOTS of guns to shoot the spikies with!\n-This game is casual and you can play it while you eat or even while you're half asleep!\n-Limitless A & D'ing\n-RUBBER DUCKIES\n-RAINBOW GUNS\n\nCons\nThere aren't really any cons for this game besides the fact that it is a short game. But for the price of the game, it's definitely worth a buy!\n\nSome levels were extra challenging but hey, don't hate the game OR yourself because it's all just for fun!\n\nWould I recommend it?\nYES!!!\n\nIf you're looking for some time to kill and want to just play a casual game, play this one!\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nPrice: 10/10\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10","January 22","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/recommended/416550/","LFantrider","L. F. Antrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/","426 products in account","Wow.  This game is only selling for .99c but I still recommend you to hold off from purchasing this fetid piece of ♥♥♥♥.  If I had to characterize it, I would say it's like a platformer that got aborted in its fetal state.  ♥♥♥♥ that, saying it's an aborted platformer would be too nice.\n\nIt was made for some "Ludum Dare" thing, which perhaps in the context of such a contest it would look better--however, upon looking into the Ludum Dare website, I was confronted with a website that seemed about as terribly organized as this game, so gave up trying.\n\nRegardless of why this game was made, it is terrible.  For something with "gun" in the title, the game isn't as much about shooting things as it is avoiding getting hit by things.  The condition for completing a level perfectly is ending with full health, not beating a certain number of enemies or anything else that would make a satisfying win condition.  You don't get any points for shooting things and you can pass some levels without shooting hardly anything.  The ways in which you beat the levels feel contrived and unsatisfying.  It's not skill that wins the games, not even logic, just some gimmicky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you'll end up figuring out by playing over and over.  The Rubber Ducky title is also superflous...  There's nothing duck-like in the game and the character is just a pixel square that you will never ever feel any love for.\n\nIt took 3 levels of play to figure out that the point is to pass the levels with full health.  During the 5th level, the Developer blatantly points out that this is pretty much a failed effort without a sound concept.  It sounds like he's apologizing almost, but DON'T WORRY--HE'S GOING TO MAKE UP FOR THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME.  HOW?  Oh, by adding the extra challenge of making you find a bunch of stupid secrets laced throughout the levels in order to proceed to the final level.  You would think the secrets would take logic and skill to find, that it might at least be one satisfying part of the game attempting to seek them out... but ♥♥♥♥ NO.  One or two secrets took minimal thought to accomplish, the rest happened by accident for me and could hardly be called secrets at all.  It's nothing like finding an easter egg... the Dev merely forces you to do some trivial task like exit on the left side of the screen instead of the right or some other equally pointless task.  None of this effort was satisfying to me and I was annoyed that someone made me go through the motions just to see if the ♥♥♥♥ing game would pick up... IT DOESN'T.\n\nWhat else can I add to the list of ♥♥♥♥ this game pours forth?  How about Achievements for clicking a link to follow this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on twitter?  I clicked a little bird icon thinking it was a secret that I had to check out, but NO... it pushed me out of game and tried to link me up with Twitter and said I obtained a "social media addict" achievement... right before the ♥♥♥♥ froze my computer. Another achievement just for buying the game.... (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).  The game also seemed to lag at certain points in some levels.\n\nIf the gameplay itself wasn't annoying enough, it gets worse because you have to listen to the developer narrorate the game controls in what he feels is a humorous banter, which is really just annoying.  This is especially so since when you have to redo a level, you have to click through the multiple frames of text in order to get to another unsatisfying level.  Also, have the time the narrator speaks as if talking to the audience and half the time he speaks as if to the player.. This isn't a problem, except on the damned Ludum Dare site, he described this game as "a dialog between the ever-silent Rubber Ducky and his eccentric developer, all made to hopefully make you smile!"\n\nNO--this game doesn't make me smile.  I feel less intelligent for having played it. The fact that you're charging for a piece of ♥♥♥♥ soundtrack to boot is ♥♥♥♥ing LUDICROUS.  The fact that you throw in trivia about your game development efforts into the narration of this game and blatantly try to use this  just to advertise yourself seems idiotic, since people will now be aware that you made a REAL ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME.  You didn't have to bring our attention to it.. you could have been nice to yourself.  Let your friends donate to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ project through paypal or something, don't try and rip people off on steam.  "LOOK MOMMY!  I CAN SELL A PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥ ON STEAM AND PEOPLE WILL BUY IT!  I'M A ♥♥♥♥ING BIG BOY NOW!!!"\n\nI played your game, I made it to the end, I clicked a bunch of ♥♥♥♥, made random graphics appear, and now want to slam my head in the wall...... *OUCH*","December 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 16 of 61 people (26%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","26","16","61","6","40"
