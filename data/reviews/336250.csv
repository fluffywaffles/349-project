"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idopost/recommended/336250/","idopost","BulletWithWings","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idopost/","166 products in account","A sincerely bad game.\n\nMonster Jam Battlegrounds has 3 modes: Skill Driving, Stadium Events, and Stunt Mode.\n\nSkill Driving mode is a copy of Trials (basically time trial mode) but with virtually no ability to control your Monster Truck mid-air. I may have done it on accident once or twice, but the buttons seem overall unresponsive. Seems like the devs didn't even know how to fix this, because your Monster Truck corrects itself whenever you're about to fall over or fall on your roof. The tracks in Skill Driving mode are totally uninspired and dull, with two different routes if you're lucky. There could be three on a few later in the game, but I honestly don't find the game fun enough to play to find out myself. As far as difficulty goes, the game is either very easy or punishingly difficult almost to the point of impossible, going so far as to include an "expert mode" which you are able to toggle if you want to rip out your own hair.\n\nStadium Events is what I would want from a Monster Truck game, that I sincerely miss from the first game of its kind: Monster Truck Madness for Windows 95. It's from a 3rd person perspective rather than a psuedo-2d perspective like the wannabe-Trials mode. The stadiums here are just as uninspired as the courses from Skill Driving mode, and the AI you race against has to have some sort of learning disibility, not that there is anything inherently wrong with that, but you will not find a challenge in Stadium Events. You will lap them almost every single race if you have patience when you hit your jumps (because if you don't you'll spin out). WHOEVER HEARD OF A MONSTER TRUCK GAME WHERE YOU WANTED TO DRIVE WITHOUT RECKLESS ABANDON?! Not only is it poorly executed from a technical standpoint, but it doesn't even follow the rules of Monster Jam. You may exit the lines on the race-course whenever you feel like it and you will receive no time penalty... not that that would even be a problem, since you could drive around the stadium twice and return to the course and you will still win the race. Anyway... Stadium Events had the right idea, this is what a Monster Truck game should be, not a bunch of gimmicks, but it's done rather poorly here.\n\nStunt mode is just Skill Driving mode but without a time limit or Skill, really. It has such thrilling events as: jump as far as you can, try to land in a specific area after you jump (different from long-jump mode, I promise), and crush as many cars as possible while you go through the course (this is far more boring than it sounds).\n\nThe Monster Truck selection is rather dull, with alternate paintings (skins) of several trucks appearing, such as three El Toro Locos and three Grave Diggers, with a total of 23 trucks. Why no legacy trucks? Maybe I'm just out of the loop, since I've loved Monster Jam for well over 20 years and many of my favorite trucks have been retired. Something inexcusable is that there is no Bigfoot. Seriously?\n\nThis is a short game, I would estimate I'm somewhere inbetween 25-33% through with a little over 20 minutes played.\n\nAvoid at all costs, even if you love Monster Jam.\n\nLooking at the positive reviews it is honestly pathetic how they are so obviously bought & paid. More evidence you should NOT buy this game.","June 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 69 of 90 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","69","90","9","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/336250/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","What better way to prove you're a real man then playing a game with Monster trucks... All the excitement of being at a live monster truck show. The crunching of cars, the shattering of glass, and the roar of a huge engine being driven by a 50 year old slightly balding man in a blue jumpsuit...\n\nroar... starting this game up I was drawn back to my days as a lad. Watching my 21 inch television, the screen flickering occasionally, looking at huge monster trucks, barreling down a dirt track toward a ramp... hitting that ramp and falling directly on top of 4 or 5 car shells... Crushing them immediately under the weight of the 4 ton monster truck...\n\nStarting the game up I was quickly disappointed by the fact the game seems rather bare bones. Although thinking about it, how many different ways can you set up crushing cars..\n\nOnce started up, you have 3 options to choose from....\n\nYou have skill driving (which is pretty much a direct copy of Trials) this requires you to drive around on a locked track, hit ramps where you can do tricks... This works well with a motorcycle, but not so much with a Monster truck.. All the awesome tricks stuffed into Trials aren't present in Monster Jam, instead you just hit the A button and hope you have enough steam to climb the next hill... or when you hit a ramp your truck doesn't flip on it's hood...\n\nArena mode - ahh Arena mode, you race an invisible truck around a track. The track is fairly basic, with one sometimes two ramps, a few cars around. The track doesn't tither you to a straight line as much as skill driving... but... the steering is crap. You feel like you're being held on a string and only allowed to deviate off the destined path slightly or else you lose..\n\nLast of all you have Stunt mode, which well i'm guessing it's nearly the same as Skill driving only with points being awarded for you doing stunts?\n\nall of them are pretty boring and uninspired. It's just a matter of hitting the drive button, and waiting for the win screen to pop up... Unless you magically flip over your truck and lose... Trust me it's boring..\n\nThe game play is set up in nearly an identical way as Trials, you advance to harder difficulty settings by getting a set number of stars, stars are rewarded for completing tracks in a timely manner. I guess it could be fun if you are into repetitive game mechanics and boring game play.\n\nThe only positive aspect of the game was the officially licensed Monster trucks.. the game has 23 officially licensed trucks including some like Grave Digger, which even non Monster Truck fans will recognize. So if you're big into monster trucks maybe consider buying it for that reason.\n\nThe bottom line is... unless you are a huge monster truck fan, or want to own a game which will eventually be removed from steam (officially licensed trucks) I'd avoid this game. Even if you're a huge fan of Trails, this game won't fill that void, it'll just come across as a cheap knock off trying to cash in on using officially licensed monster trucks..\n\nSave your money for something else, unless you can find it for under a buck... then it may be worth it for the Trading cards alone... Surely not worth a full price purchase...","September 18, 2015","false","4.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","17","23","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamshity/recommended/336250/","jamshity","jamcity nights","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamshity/","2565 products in account","My decision not to recommend this game comes from the high price tag.  With only a couple hours of content before completing the game 100% I've come to have a bit higher expectations in mid 2015.  Not to say I always measure games by their playtime.\n\nVisually the game looks like PS2 era which does not help the case.  While the game modes are fun but short, the ones I enjoyed most were the shortest. You are forced to play through them all in campaign earning stars to advance usually achieving highest rank on first try.\n\nThe stadium mode reminds me of the Monster Jam live events, there are only a hand full of arenas though and a lap is never more than 30s with only 3 rounds to win the event.  The stadium events offer freestyle mode as well which feels like button mashing in a racing game or hurling your truck into jumps to pull of tricks.  The game also has side scrolling game modes in the trials style of balancing front and back as well as speed to make your way through obstacle courses and jump challenges.  An enjoyable adventure but looking ten years old at release, I say again, its hard to justify such a price tag.","July 22, 2015","false","4.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

There is still some control but it isn't overly sensitive. Which leads me to the physics, which really shine in this game, even at high speed and the graphics being what they are (awesome in my oppinion), especially when jumping / landing. The music isn't terrible, but isn't great either. It doesn't hurt the general feel or flow of the game.\n\nI have had some problems though; Game crash when select Own Score from the Leaderboards after a match, which also prevents me from getting to the Friends Score list. Not much into those online scoring stuff but I can see how others may feel differently.\n\nAnd then there is the incorrect keyboard diagram shown during loading of a level, which marks A and S as movement keys in mid-air, which is kind of misleading (W and D should also be in there, although I never actually found A and D to be doing anything...).\n\nIt took me a while to figure out how to collect stars (which unlock tracks, arenas and other gamemodes) and the objective in for instance a Jump game; Do I perform stunts, height or distance? Couple of tries before I realized it was distance...\n\nSometimes it does tend to crash for no apparent reason, but the game is saved often enough and it is quite fast in starting back up.\n\nAll in all a great game, has some issues, but nothing major.","June 16, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For years there's been a lack of an offically liscensed Monster Jam game,Path Of Destruction was the last one,met with negative criticism back in 2009. Yeah,it's been 6 years. And it seems like yesterday i was unboxing that one! Well,here we are,Monster Jam Battlegrounds,the next gen era of gaming containing such classics as Skyrim,Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain,Gran Turismo and Forza 6,Infamous: Second Son,and a ton more,and now we have a Monster Jam game to match.\n\nPros:\n\nthey FINALLY got the engine sound right! For years we've been hearing that dying go-kart noise in the games,but now these new devs have taken REAL audio clips from various shows,and merged them all into that classic,awesome noise we all love. The best sound design to date in any of these games.\n\nThe physics. This game is like Rigs Of Rods,but with all but a few glitches removed,actual damage,decent sounds and effects (such as exhaust and lights),and an updated selection of the biggest names on the scene,including El Toro Loco,Grave Digger,Monster Mutt,NEA,El Diablo's 2014 design,Bounty Hunter's new look,that Madusa truck,Son Uva Digger,Lucas Oil Crusader,and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The physics as well as this new selection makes it a MASSIVE improvement. Oh,and it's offically liscensed too,something else it has over ROR. I like to know that when i buy a game and play with Monster Jam trucks,that the money i spent is going to the people actually behind it. Not something most people think about,but it can't hurt to mention.\n\nCommentary. THANK YOU so much for the commentary! Older games would have at most 5 clips on repeat,and it was obvious. Some didn't even have commentary at all. Not a lot of people know this,but when you go to a Monster Jam show,you actually CAN hear the commentary from where you sit,assuming you listen hard enough over the loud engines. And this game,though it doesn't have many more clips that the others,manages to use them in a way that fools the mind,making it seem like fresh,new dialouge. It seems impossible,but one or two plays and you'll see what i mean.\n\nThe credits and upgrade system. In this game,it's possible to play effectively without upgrading trucks,but if you do,that makes them more resistant to damage,gives them slightly easier handling (which is IMPORTANT considering what i'm gonna talk about later),and on the side their boost and acceleration get little power-ups as well! You get credits for doing events,based on how good you did. That's another thing,the computer is REALLY good at judging your runs,and giving you the stars according to how many you would get realistically. More stars,more points. You can spend the credits on new trucks AND upgrades. But don't worry,you get Madusa,Lucas Oil Crusader,and Bounty Hunter from the start.\n\n\nThe events: Lots of people will probably disagree,but i like the events in this game. There are 3 categories: Skill Driving,Stunt Driving,and Stadium Events. Stadium events are your basics,Racing and Freestyle,at tons of stadiums from Angel Stadium to AT&T Stadium to of course Sam Boyd Stadium where the finals takes place. These are the only ones that allow you to actually steer your truck. Too bad to,because in the other 2 types,your truck WILL spin out at some point,i guarantee it,and the AI bot put in charge of steering is honestly TERRIBLE at it. you'll spend a good 10 full seconds stumbling and sliding around trying to get the bot to steer the truck forward again. But with good use of Air control,you can avoid this. Oh yeah,they added Air Control,and someone finally got it right! you can use W and S to tilt your truck forward or backwards. This is a must-have unless you want to total your truck.\n\nNow the 2 types of events that this game surprisingly got a lot of hate for. Skill driving is your basic 2D platformer,it shares it's 5 track themes with Stunt Driving,Frozen,Farm,Urban,Forest,Desert. Get across the track in time to get at least 1 star without totaling your truck or your toast. From what i understand,people hate these and Skill Driving because their outside the stadium,but i think it's an EXCELLENT idea. Monster jam has done "Monsters On The Beach","Monsters In The Snow",and "Back To School Bash" for YEARS now,all taking place outside of any offical stadium,but still allowing for great jumps and stunts. That's basically the exact same thing as these events.\n\nStunt driving is like skill driving,but it isn't just get across the map,this time you have to do 1 of 3 goals,which you will see before you start the level. Destruction requires you to destroy at least 3 cars and make it to the finish,Jump requires you to slowly inch your way through the map,blasting the gas when you hit a massive drop so you fly a certain distance to the finish,and then there's precision,where you jump for one of three targets. I couldn't help but laugh at one of these when i didn't even get the easy goal,and was greeted with the message,"CONGRAGULATIONS,YOU GOT THE NONE GOAL." I know i'm making these sound easy and dull from my descriptions,but they surprisingly require TONS of skill and practice. Chances are,you'll be playing at least one of these 3 times before you beat it.\n\nTrading Cards - always a nice touch\n\n\nDecent Zombie: this game uses the pre-2015 zombie look. Any monster jam nerd will know,they seriously dumbed down the look of the zombie truck in 2015,to avoid scaring the growing younger audience. However,for zombie nerds all over,it was a let down to see what was once such a dramatic,dark looking truck turned into what looked like something made out of play-doh. However,this game returns to the exposed brain,red spots,and that classic glossy finish on the paint. THIS is a zombie.\n\n\nNow onto the cons:\n\n\n- Automatic Assists\n\nNow i know what your thinking,"The game's aimed at kids,won't these help them to enjoy the game despite their younger minds?". Well,yes it will. However,there's an "Expert" mode,that supposedly gives you full control of your truck,and even then these can't be disabled. Their only in the Stadium events luckily. I managed to get around them by slowly inching my way around the track,and only really flooring it when i wanted to jump,but i wish they would have let the amazing physics of the game shine through as players really got to feel the real potential of the trucks,instead of basically forcing us to just hold the up arrow until a bar is full. If you get one of these,my best advice is to slam on the brakes,and wait for it to go down. BUT that can DESTROY your performance,because the whole time limit thing.\n\n\n- Impossible levels\n\nI have been playing this game non-stop since it was released,and i found impossible levels. Not incredibly difficult ones,but literally impossible. As in,i have messed around with them for what feels like weeks now,using air control,pressing all the buttons,and i can not find a way to possibly get past some of the stuff they throw at me impossible. The game is aimed at kids,yet an adult couldn't beat these or predict some of the random obstacles they throw right outta nowhere. Luckily,due to the way the game is built,you don't HAVE to do these to unlock more levels,you just have to get a certain amount of points to unlock new levels,so you can work around them in your playthrough and save some frustration. Here is a list of the levels that were like this.\n\nSkill Driving - Extreme Forest\n\nSkill Driving - Extreme Desert\n\nSkill Driving - Medium Farm\n\nSkill Driving - Extreme Frozen\n\nAs you can see,most of these were Extreme levels,and all of them were in Skill Driving. I don't know if i'm missing something,or if the play testers are just amazing,or if it was a mistake or what,but i seriously can not figure out what to do in these,or how i'm supposed to get going fast enough without flying off the second i hit a bump in the road.\n\n\n4/5 stars,a must buy for anyone into racing simulators.","September 21, 2015","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've tried, I've tried hard...but...just no...unless you're buying it for a buck or have absolutely no expectation, skip it.\n\nThere are three modes, but basically it's Trials with Monster Trucks.\n\nThe controls are simple, but physics/truck behaviour is clunky at best. Once you know what you're doing, you're dependant on sheer luck as sometimes your truck will start spinning for no reason. No drive is like the other...jumping over ledges you might flip, you might not. It's a pure gamble. One of the reasons I gave up on getting all the achievements.\n\nThe camera is wonky like truck behaviour, often you can see the there's no landscape programmed aside of the track so you're staring into the background or similar.\n\nMusic is okay, sound effects are are okay too.  Also you can drive Grave Diggers, the only real upside about it.","November 20, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
