I am an old grognard who loves games varying in compexity from Gary Grigsby, through the Scourge of War series to Total War and some of the great mods that have been made.  The point is if there is a new grand stategy game that comes out I will buy it.  No refunds, I will gradually work hard to understand the game and if it isn't quite a diamond in the rough to start with I'll be patient and revisit from time to time.\n\nThere is a huge amount of promise in this game.  The mechanics make sense and I do love the passion that has gone into making this game.  I will say straight away that it gets a recommend from me simply because of the ambition and effort of the one man who put it together.\n\nThe game lacks finish at the moment, the graphics are poor although you can easily see through this with a bit of imagination.  There are moments where glitches occur to make the game look a little untidy such as words overlapping.  There is also the frustration of not being able to use certain links whereas others take you straight to where you need to go.  All of these are mild problems - as an old grognard I'm used to chasing little boxes around screen and imagining these litte sprites and boxes represent an army or a village.  This is a game where your imagination must get involved.\n\nBut it does have a huge learning cureve and this really needs some support.  The tutorials are not good enough but like many others I am already hooked an determinded to learn in stages.  I can see a few big couck ups along the way but I believe there is real hope in this game not least from the positive way that the developer has responded to questions and support.  Wortst case scenario I may have lost £14,99 but maybe just maybe I have found something that will develop into my diamond.  I'm willing to support it because there is defintely something there.  Good luck to the developer.","October 31, 2015","true","11.7"," 86 of 92 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","86","92","2","2"

For someone like me who would actually name the regiments in his Empire Total War armies, and make brigades out of the regiments within those armies, the order of battle and divisional heirarchy system will be immensely fun. Every regiment has a commander that can be replaced if ineffective, as well as its own equipment and level of experience.\n\nThe Seven Years War (1756-1763) is definitely not going to be for everyone though. The learning curve is somewhat steep but I found the initial gameplay to be more intuitive than games like Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings. The graphics aren't very good, but in a sprite-based battle map I can overlook this, though improvements are always welcome. Chances are though that if you're even considering buying a game like this, you're the type of person that would enjoy it.\n\nI do agree with the people that suggest some tutorial scenarios would be nice, and it would be helpful to be able to zoom in just a little closer on the battlemap for times when you want to order individual regiments around instead of brigades or divisions.\n\nAll in all, I'm very impressed and excited for the future of this game.","November 1, 2015","true","0.4"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","3"

The developer has clearly invested a lot of passion into this game, but I found it unplayable in its current state. That said, I'm going to follow this game's development closely.\n\nPros:\n- Game seems to model to detailed economic and development systems.\n- Basic supply seems to be modeled.\n- Theres a command-and-control delay implemented in battles.\n- Graphics are adequate and reasonable for a indie strategy game.\n- Tons of passion and historical knowledge invested into this game.\n\nI use the term 'seems' several times above, as there is a lack of feedback in the UI, and a lot of information is presented in opaque and difficult to understand ways.\n\nCons:\n- This game desperately needs a detailed manual. The video tutorials are a basic introduction, but are insufficient to understand the game.\n- UI exposes information in opaque ways. It seems like important informaiton is not presented. For example, in several scenarios, I watched the morale of my armies drop quickly to zero, but there was nothing I could see in the UI that would cause this. Bug? Feature? Can't tell.\n- Actions in the UI often work in strange ways, and not always consistent ways.\n- Bugs -- many, many bugs. For example, I was sometimes not able to set a policy at the beginning of a scenario (despite having no policy set). Restarting the scenario, I would then be able to set a policy.\n- If you have Nvidia NSync, the game crashes on launch. It has to be turned off globably for the game to launch.","November 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","0"

I did not play the game for long yet, but the game surely has some big potential and the dev is listening and interacting with the community and regularly publishing patches. There are only very few hardcore strategic games in the RTS branch. Knights of Honor or the Hegemony series are a few. This one lets you develop your economy, build buildings, research, build armies and has an XP and promotion system for commanders and armies as well as moral and supplies.\nYou can fight tactical land battles and influence sieges in a mini game. Fleet combat is automatically resolved.\nThe UI can be improved and there are typing errors and some smaller bugs still present. But I do not have any doubt, that the developer will take care of it. I´d like to see this developer ( and he is really only one person ;-) to keep on improving this game - so I do recommend it to be bought - it is fun already and there are very few games touching this genre at all - and has even bigger potential if given enough success and time.\nIf you enjoy Paradox game, AGEOD games, Matrix/Slitherine games and other Grognard strategy games, with pausible gamesplay, then you should enjoy this one too.\nIt is like a TW game with more focus on depths and difficulty, than on UI, graphics and arcade mainstream ;-D","October 31, 2015","true","6.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

The developer is highly responsive to feedback.\n- Somewhat outdated graphics, but in a quaint and engaging way, rather than just being a pixellated mess. Building graphics have a level of detail that draws the player in.\n- Ambitious scope (real time, player-controlled battles, trade, economy, diplomacy, research) with a time period that has been very much neglected by other companies\n- Complex and detailed systems that provide a great deal of replayability and ensure mastery will take time\n- Detailed strategy map that segues well and accurately into battle maps\n- Prussia!\n- Challenging\n\nMinuses:\n- There are still a number of bugs that are being worked out (but the developer has acknowledged them, fixed some, and seems determined to tackle remainer)\n- At times certain systems can seem somewhat obscure (this is a plus and a minus - draws you in and is more satisfying, but sometimes frustrating)\n- Still a great deal of work required for battle AI and campaign map AI\n- A number of the systems still require some considerable polish. This game could have benefited from a round of beta testing, but understand likely not within means of developer\n\nOverall, this is an ambitious project that has the potential to be very interesting, and has some unique or new takes on systems that bring some innovation to a genre that has been lacking such innovation for some time. This is not yet a complete game - I wouldn't necessarily advise buying it today, but you should add it to your wishlist, follow the forums and definitely buy it at some point.

It's a good mix of those two series' and with a few more updates and some tweaking should be a truly fantastic strategy title. The campaign is fairly easy to get to grips with and does a fine job of providing a campaign experience, the battles themselves however are the meat of the game imo. thousands of little sprites cover HUGE battlefields to recreate the spectacul;ar battles of the time period and they allow you to fine control every regiment, or move entire divisions with ease. Not for someone looking for an arcade title, if you want a decent strategy game, with more realistic battles than Total War, look no further.","January 23","true","10.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

I have just over 9 hours of play time . I bought it the other day . I was blessed that it was also 15% off may not sound like much. I live on limited income since a mugging causing perment head tramua in 2004 . I been saving for 6 months to get a new computer and spent 400.00 on the desktop to play this game and few others like it . I came across this game oh 6 months back been following the boards since.\nThe most impressive items are this is a one person project . I viewd videos of battles said this was impressive one person could design all this . some reveiws  say graphics are bad . I say for one person design are great. I been playing this style before internet with Gary Gigsby's civil war games and  battles of napolian .  was not untill I played a 1/2  battle till I realized oh my the detail this game has in the battles . Name a Big name company this game has the same if not more detail realism into the battle and you can dial it out or in pretty much as much as you want.\nNow when doing the 30 turn tutorial I felt like was the King of England ,there once more is so much detail it blows major other games out of the water .I read the manual before and still after and will most likely print it out or get another screen to pull it up durring game play .\nThe developer thought of just about everything and what he did not others did , for whitch he was quick to respond to with his feed back on a patch or disscussion on it.   for example  I was marching a army at REAL TIME was like this game going get old fast . all of sudden the tutorial says go speed up the game once you do this this and that . !!! bam few seconds later was at the place . set speed to normal . another plus orders comands and other tasks can be done while you pause the game . A real big plus . Ever play a space game go modify a ship only to find out the capital was just blown up and you never knew it ...\n\nSo the game off sale is arround 20.00 bucks it is worth every penny of it . this is not a game to sit play casual or I don't think it is . There is a learning curve but the game is friendly about it with the pause button till you know what your doing . the default is auto save one week time i set mine every day  until I can figure out how to manully same several stages of the games progress.\nAll I can say is with only 9 hours so far into the game I have a feeling this game will be in my top 5 all time best games to play for enjoyability and historicaly ..\nplease excuse my grammer, spelling the head tramua was a mugging in 2004 that killed me, revived me.I woke up after 3 days in a coma ,18 in ICU  Mike Tyson could not done a better job it ended my nursing carreer as well .\nBob c owner Crazy bear Flutes","May 24","true","20.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

So in terms of content the game has got you covered pretty well.\n\nHowever, there are still some negatives to be found in this game:\nFramerate drops when hovering over cities and moving around with buildings\nResearch UI is a mess: Due to dependencies spread across 5 tabs, you sometimes have to click 5-6 times to research prequesite technologies.

Let's face it they're a bit of a mess. I'm not sure what is going on most of the time. Battles last a certain length of time and frustratingly  just simply end suddenly without you really knowing which side won!\n\nBut the biggest complaint I have about the battles in this game is that they don't 'feel' like European SYW battles. Two things in particularly get me:\n1. Square formation - absolutley unheard of in major battles of the SYW. It just wasn't doctrine. Read Duffy, Nosworthy et al if you don't believe me. Lines of infantry simply turned their rear rank. Cavalry rarely took on formed infantry head on - again just not doctrine. There should be no capability to form square in this game.\n2. March column - again only used to get to the battle - not a fighting formation in any shape or form. Tactics were linear. Troops formed up in line well before they got close to the enemy.\n\nAnd what's this thing about forming lines into skirmishers!! Ridiculous.

Gotta love the effort, but I cannot recommend this game.\n\nIts goal is admirable: to be a Total War/Scourge of War hybrid that provides more tactical depth than the former and includes a strategic/operational layer that the latter doesn't.  And it does so with a period of history that has not been the subject of many PC games- The Seven Years War.\n\nHowever, the execution is not good.  It's currently unstable.  I had crashes in both the battle and strategic maps.  And the stratAI came across as a comatose.  My biggest problem, though, was the game's incredibly complex and unintuitve economic engine.  It seems geared towards economics graduates or MBA students rather than players interested in an 18th grand strategy/tactical wargame.   Why would I want to bother with setting "selling points" and "profit margins" in a wargame?  I don't.\n\nAlso, the game doesn't really assist with its steep learning curve.  The manual is rather useless.  The tool tip aids are incomplete with lots of misspellings and awkward grammar due to the developer speaking English as a 2nd language.  And even the "Let's Play" youtube clips are not helpful.  The one player who is regularly posting them seems absolutely clueless as to many of the game's facets.\n\nI fiddled around with it for two hours before deleting it.  Maybe there is a good game hidden there somewhere, but I don't have the patience to dig through the unintuitive interface, poor documentation, and CTDs to find it.  AGEOD's Wars in America or Rise of Prussia do much better with the subject material at the operational level.  And Scourge of War tactical battles are infinitely superior.  It'd be great if someone could combine the two, but The Seven Years War isn't that game.","February 26","false","1.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","2"
