"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaut/recommended/298110/","supernaut","supernaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaut/","241 products in account","Far Cry 4 is for people who have imagination in taking down their enemies, turning Kyrat into their personal playground. Unfortunately I'm not one of those people. Giving someone like me a large map, filling it up with collectibles, chests and various activities, I will invest 80 hours into doing all of them. After 30-40 hours that stops being fun, especially if you take too much time between missions.\n\nDon't save up on money. If you unlock something, buy it and go have fun. It's unlikely you will run out of cash, cos there are so many ways to earn it. However, don't buy every map as soon as you can, cos you will be overwhelmed by the sight of what is available. Ignorance is bliss, just enjoy the moment and focus on completing the next objective.\n\nForget about the chests, only open those that are closest to you at any given moment. Do not go on a chest-hunt, it's just mindless grinding. When it comes to discovering locations and looting, beyond just using the grappling hook to access them, I would like to see puzzles in future games, at least at the locations that are harder to get to. I don't know if anyone remembers this French TV show, but I enjoyed the hell out of Fort Boyard as a kid. Seeing something along those lines would make that side of Far Cry a lot more engaging.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about Far Cry 3, I enjoyed here as well. The hunting, the combat, climbing up bell towers (again, reminded me of Fort Boyard) and liberating outposts. But that's about it. To do just that for 20-30 hours, I would be content, but since I see all of that stuff on the map, I want all of it and I have no clue why. Every open world game has turned into a completionist nightmare, not full of game, but content.\n\nThe game wasn't hard enough on Normal for me to hire help, so I spent almost nothing on those upgrades. I guess I would find a use for them on Hard. I also didn't use syringes much, except for healing, cos picking plants ran its course in the previous game. I'm also tired of slippery mountains, eagles, leaving an outpost and be told soon after that it's under attack. Most of all, I kept hoping that Pagan Min would have Rabi Ray Rana shot on air.\n\nFar Cry 4's bell towers, outposts and fortresses are puzzles in their own right, but everything between them is a bore. Granted, a pretty-looking bore. I soon gave up on reading letters, notes and journals. Once again, chests offered loot in the way of junk you can sell in a click of a button and also money. Chests = loot + money = money + money. Loot that is junk is not loot, which I hated in the Bioshock games as well.\n\nWhile I definitely recommend this game, I recommend it in moderation, cos it's a linear shooter in a vast open world, which makes it hollow. No matter how crazy the villain or the hallucinations in these games, no matter how many hundred people you assign to develop them, it's all too impersonal to stay with you. But if you know how to have fun in Far Cry, you will have fun and then some.","September 6, 2015","true","80.6"," 453 of 490 people (92%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","92","453","490","43","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordAssassinz/recommended/298110/","LordAssassinz","Lord Assassinz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordAssassinz/","74 products in account","After seeing way too many negative reviews for this game I figured I needed to write my own. Just so it is clear I am writing this review after playing 31 hours and beating the campaign.\nGameplay\nThe basic gameplay is very similar to Far Cry 3. You have campaign missions, side missions, liberate towers, and of course attack outposts. The biggest gameplay differences are throughout the main campaign you have two leaders arguing and you always need to be the decider. Second gameplay difference is now there are fortresses, which are a lot more fun too attack since they pose a little more difficulty. Third, the map being based in the hills has a lot more opportunities to make use of the grappling hook and the wing-suits. Finally the side missions are a lot more common and varied to keep it interesting even after you have finished the main campaign. A Quick side note, the economy is unballenced but since it is only in single player it isnt to horrible that way. I know I still have a ton of the map to explore. Overall the gameplay was familiar and I really enjoyed it but it didn't feel like an exact replica of Far Cry 3, they really improved the base model of gameplay\n\nGraphics\nI have a custom built hi-end PC and I was able to take full advantage of the high graphics quality. Everything from the characters to the terrain to the animals all looks so amazing and only a few games able to compare with that level. I know that for people with lower end computers it may not be as important, but for someone who can run it, the graphics are amazing. I understand many (too many) players have had issues with the game from black screens to frame stuttering, I have not had these issues since the launch day but I hope Ubisoft fixes them all for everyone's sake.\n\nStory\nWhile I was very skeptical of the story having to follow the amazing story brought to us in Far Cry 3. That being said the story is very well written. It has plenty of hooks and switches to keep you guessing from the start. One thing I will mention that there are several opportunities to shoot a person before they tell you their part of the story, I just wish that was a little more obvious so nobody misses any.\n\nSounds\nAs usual the background music for the whole story was amazing as well as all the sound effects. Everything fit very well together and made the game one step closer to perfection.\n\nMy Closing Opinion\nI loved the game. I do feel that the story was unable to match Far Cry 3 but was still amazing. I love the vehicles and coop was a nice addition. I know I will still be playing this game every second of my free time for probably another month or two. I know I still have plenty of submissions and collectibles lying around to keep me entertained for a while.Thank you @Orbitaldrop for the vertical gameplay and side missions addition","November 22, 2014","true","108.1"," 888 of 1,014 people (88%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","88","888","1","31","29"

I could go on and on in a review about this game, and how perhaps it might lack in certain areas or could have been improved. But honestly, at the end of the day it's not about how unique/interesting mission XYZ was. It's about how fun it was just trying to get to the mission and come out alive. My joy for this series can only be explained via scenarios of actual random events...\n\n-Completing a hostage rescue mission only to have a pack of dogs jump out of the bush and kill the hostage mere seconds after he says "thanks friend, I thought I was finished".\n\n-Seeing a leopard bound across the road in front of me and leap attack a yak, grappling it at it's throat, spinning over it and taking it to the ground.\n\n-Finish up purchasing ammo and selling random junk to a traveling merchant. He bidding me farewell saying "See you again soon". Then a couple locals in a car killing him in a hit and run 2 feet from me.\n\n-Shooting the pilot out of a heli over top of the fortress I'm trying to take down and watching it crash into a jeep with 3 guys pulling up due to the reinforcements alarm having gone off.\n\n-Watching 2 bears or 2 tigers up on their hind legs scratching and clawing at eachother for territory dominance.\n\n-Eagle just swoop down and carry off that pig? Yup, that just happened...\n\nI have stories for days about my experiences in this game. It truly is like no other gaming experience.\n","December 10, 2014","true","36.4"," 506 of 571 people (89%) found this review helpful 112 people found this review funny","89","506","571","112","10"

We are a loyal fan base and the nice thing to do is Port correctly. Along the same lines, don't release things unfinished and have to resort to releasing multiple patches after release to make the game even playable for some. This game is horrendous when it comes to PC optimization requiring a near supercomputer to run at the highest settings (An issue Far Cry 3 never had).\n\nStorywise, this game is completely brilliant, unlike anything I've seen in regards to Open World Shooters. Sidequests, exploration, interactive enviorments are all a plus. But I couldn't help but notice how un-innovative this game is compared to Far Cry 3. There's a new map for sure. New animals, new obstacles, new guns, ect. But other than the basics which get old quickly, there isn't any new innovation here. Everything from vehicles, crafting, hunting, photos tagging, it's all a direct copy from the prior. Very disappointing considering how new and well done Far Cry 3 was.\n\nIn conclusion, Ubisoft, these titles and series are great, well thought out and executed for the most part, but I fear for your future. You disregard loyal fan bases, push out games before they are ready, and lack creativity when it comes to your titles. You are a studio that has revolutionized in the past, but this game has noticable corners cut, which is not what I expect of Ubisoft, a company with great potential.\n\nMr.Quiggles Super Heavily Intensified Testing Score (♥♥♥♥♥) : 8.2/10\n\nEDIT 12/08/14 - The 1.5 Update brings much Audio/Visual updates to the game. This update has noticable frame stuttering fixes, and CPU/GPU performanced I have personally seen w/ monitoring programs. The score has been revised to reflect the improvement of stability in the game.\n\nEDIT 12/26/14 - "Near Super Computer" was a exaggeration joke. I did not literally mean 5000 GTX Titan's all watercooled was the only way to run this at maxmimum settings.","December 1, 2014","true","44.8"," 567 of 677 people (84%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","84","567","677","22","37"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shannongreen/recommended/298110/","shannongreen","satans-sphinx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shannongreen/","236 products in account","Far Cry 4™ is graphically stunning, and the game-play is fun, exciting, and long lasting; after fifty hours playing, I found myself only fifty percent of the way through. The same psychotic craziness from Far Cry 3™ is reminant, but added is an Asian-oritentated spiritual culture that adds a nice touch to the exploration.\n\nThe jokes that lay in the notebook from Far Cry 3™ remain in the form of witty saracsm, but in addition are in game voice actors and scenes which truly make you laugh.\n\nThe hard mode is actually hard this time time over, it gives hardcore gamers a good challenge; you will die lots and mastering some weaponry can take some practice. There are a ton more signature weapons, which are costly, and harder to acquire. I haven't tried them all yet but the ones that I have are powerful and unique.\n\nThe same outpost system is incorporated but with the new weapons, enemies and environment, it's a fresh gaming experience; on top of that, there are four fortresses--harder outposts that can be liberated, primarilly to stop annoying attacks on outposts you have liberated nearby. If a fortress is still in control by an enemy, often an outpost you control, usually the one you're closest to, will be under threat from enemies and you will have to stop what you are doing to defend it.\n\nThere are some new vehicles but you'll recognise a similarity between Far Cry 3™ and Far Cry 4™, the animals are different however, and those missions where you find rare animals are, let's say, more intense and harder to complete. Added in with the throwing knives, grenades and Molotov's, is bait, which you can throw on the ground to attract nearby predators, either to attack enemies or for skinning purposes--gained everytime you skin an animal that's not part of a quest.\n\nThe characters and setting are almost perfection. The side quests aren't given the same artistry as the campaign, or semi-campaign quests; though, they are improved from the last game with unique conversations and stories for each quest.\n\nThere is so much to collect, notebooks, masks, letters, Mani-wheels, and so on. The loot system hasn't changed but the currency has, and I'll repeat that it's more difficult to earn money, so you won't start out with some of the best equipment this time. There is a new tool, the grappling hook, which is used now and again to scale mountains or cliffs, it's no big deal but swinging from one side to another sometimes can be exciting...\n\nThere are some special missions called Shangri La that takes you to a beautiful, and mostly red-coloured spirit-world, where you can perform cool moves like slowing down time or commanding a tiger attack ghostly blue enemies with scary masks.\n\nThe syringe system is simpler with only five syringes, made in the same way by collecting different coloured plants; all five can be upgraded. Also, when you collect two green leaves, which are only used in the healing syringe, it automatically crafts it. There is no crafting page for the syringes, it's been replaced by a tab similar to the weapon selection from Far Cry 3™; you press and hold a key, an overlay sceen appears, and then you press one of the four directions to craft it; the healing syringe is excluded since it auto-crafts.\n\nThe talent tree is almost the same as Far Cry 3™, but simpler, with a few new additions. There is not much to add if you've played the prior game, except from it looks cooler.\n\nThe co-op is a great addition allowing you to play with others in your own campaign, and this helps a lot if you're trying to take down one of the fortresses.\n\nThere aren't many downsides to this game, but to name a few: minimal sound settings (i.e. you can only turn up or down the master volume); which makes the buzzer helicopter annoying at times. Repeat trips to the Himalayas get boring and you cannot save the game while located there, once or twice would have been perfect. The physics engine isn't as good as it could be--when I shoot tires I expect them to blow out like in Grand Theft Auto 4™. Some glitches and crashes here and there and I'm on an expensive gaming PC.\n\nFar Cry 4 is a priority purchase for any FPS players.","December 30, 2014","true","93.1"," 349 of 404 people (86%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","86","349","404","19","11"

I'm really enjoying just walking around doing my own thing, discovering locations just by chance, with my bow and arrow ready to take down any wild animals I come across.\n\nLots of interface options too, so you can remove the minimap and other helpers, and take off auto tagging when u aim a weapon at a bad guy to make the experience more immerseful.\n\nWell, im sure there's a bunch of professional indepth reviews coming to help you decide whether or not to buy it, but if u loved FC3, then u'll love this too!\n\nI haven't come across any major bugs yet, I have the graphics on ultra and occasionally get some sort of flickering effect now and then, but nothing to dampen the enjoyment of playing..\n\n*update!*\nThis flickering effect appears to be some sort of tree glitch, where trees are changing between a detailed 3D model to a 2D model rapidly, and this has been solved by updating nVidia driver to 344.75 :)\n\nAs for controls, they are fine.

Many people have said that it is too much like Far Cry 3, that there isn't anything new. As they went on, they mentioned bugs, glitches, and a multiplayer mode which is not working. but that's a FAR CRY (badumm tss) from the truth. Not that far though.\n\nWhat they failed to mention is that, while 4 is very much like 3, it also is more than that, and, most importantly, more fun. AC 2 was a hard copy of 1 with a little cherry on top...ok,  a big cherry, but the following games all used the same principle. Now, after they puked out a hundred titles of tower climbing simulator, people finally noticed and started to complain.\nYes, FC3 and 4 are similiar. You cant expect an open world shooter to be a chess game with hookers, can you? But it's still wildly entertaining, on a very base and simple level, which is not a bad thing, as you can see with other base and simple things I can't write here.\nNow, there were some things I didn't like.\nMaybe it is a lot to ask, but who am I playing? Some guy, coming to Kyrat to scatter my mothers ashes. And of course I am also perfectly trained in combat, able to comandeer with every vehicle, use every weapon perfectly...seriously, he comes out of nowhere and dishes out some stuff that would make some war vets wet their bed. At least that surfer guy in 3 had his magic tattoos which gave him spiritual...killing...and...aiming...powers....I guess.  Just a little hint as to why I am suddenly a one man army, would have been nice, narration is after all an important part of a game.\nThe fortresses, while a great idea, were meant as a co-op opportunity, very hard, and, as the voice over states, almost impregnable as long as the residing antagonist is still in charge. This was a blatant lie, since I could snipe my way to the heart of the fortress with ease, and  I am a casual gamer. I imagine the hardcore guys  did it while reading Ulysses or something. Overall, easy outposts as well. You might argue that the game gives you the popportunity to make it harder for youself, with a differnet set of weapons, or doing it while only using takedowns. While this might be fun for some, I don't want to cripple myself to artificially (haha, while talking about a game) to increase the difficulty. so...that could have been done better.\nI liked the Idea if the Hunter enemy, tougher to fight, able to control the wildlife (how? you ask? it's a game ubisoft says, buy it and shut up) and...rarely seen. possibly out hunting or something. I remember 4 distinct skirmishes with them, other than that, absent.\nIt is a shame that almost all the weapons are taken from FC3, also, there are several weapon sets which, in combination, are so ridiculously overpowered that you can basically play as asian rambo/chuck norris most of the time. The Z93 for example, a sniper with, if you wish, a silencer, is able to kill a guard from 4 meters away (45.432 hobscotches for our friends in the colonies) and his friend right next to him can not hear it. And I did not play on easy or anything.\nAlso, driving still feels like you comandeer a bar of soap on soapy streets in a hailstorm of soaps.\nNow, what did I like.\nThe main antagonist is, like in Far Cry, devillishly charming. Evil, ruthless, cruel and also very eloquent. I was always waiting for him to broadcast something, or call me, or show up, which could have happened more. I also liked the connection to asian rambo, in other words, you, the player, obviously, who himself appears a tad bland next to such an demonic peacock. The other characters are more or less well executed, I also liked de Pleur, though I can't say why because of spoilers. Willis appears again, also nicely done, and overall, a story unfolds which I was interested in. Not overly interested, but still.\nI enjoyed traversing the area, collecting the wildlife to do my bidding as an ammuniton receptacle, there were other side quests which enticed me to follow because of the story they told, spoilers, again, so, see for yourself.\nActively including animals in the fights through the use of bait was a nice touch. sometimes it didn't work though, because 'no animal is interested in your bait'. then again, ubisoft might have been going for realism here. Oh, and riding elephants into battle...yes. that please, again, on rhinos maybe. Lots of killing happend. Good times.\nbefore I forget. I hate eagles now. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, the lot.\nin summary, even though it might sound as if I actually didn't like it, I did. very much.\nThe good thing is, even though I only have a 550 TI, the graphics were still pleasant to look at. I would compare it with FC3 on Xbox. I was at this game the whole week now because there is so much to do, so much to see, so many foes to smite with the use of my mighty soundless wonder sniper.\nI would have wished for some more new additions, maybe some different takedowns, or some more opportunity to invole the world around me in the action, like they did in the promo video with the barrel and the c4. I also hope they don't bring down they series with worthless DLCs, though it's ubisoft, so they will, as far as I can tell.\nI bought it for 45 Euros, and I don't feel like I have been ripped of. If you enjoyed FC3, you will enjoy FC4, they do give you a lot to play with. I would not pay more though.\n\n*edit*\nI corrected some typos, sorry for those. Also I like to add that some of the maps created by users are more fun than crying really far. I'm sorry, that didn't go as planned. so yeah, they are fun.","January 9, 2015","true","110.1"," 197 of 233 people (85%) found this review helpful 91 people found this review funny","85","197","233","91","10"

I really hate to say it, but I'm actually  disappointed by Far Cry 4 so far.\n\nAbout 8 hours of gameplay in since release (3 on steam, 5 on uplay last night offline mode).\n\nI pre-ordered it with high hopes from the trailers.\n(given that so far this is my experience in the amount of time I've played so far as shown by the hour count in the top of the review.)\n\nThings that are the same from Far Cry 3:\n-Weapons progession the same so far, look the same and sound the same\n-The quests to recapture cell towers, complete with rickety and broken sections down to the same ropes to jump-climb to. Even the exact same zip lining to the ground and the zoom to the 3 different areas around each tower.\n-Trash looting and selling is the same\n-Skinning has the exact same animation\n-Collecting plants has the exact same animation\n-Healing yourself is the exact same in function and very close to the original animation\n-Hang gliders are the exact same in function and model\n-Outposts. Right down to the alarms.\n-Fire extinguishing animation\n\nThings that are new so far:\n-Grappling hook that can only be used in certain places\n-Setting destinations on the map shows the roads to take to get there in your minimap as well as on the road itself\n-Auto drive so you can shoot while driving (also functions as fast travel, although I hit cars in the road while using it)\n-Different skill tree\n-Bait to bring wild animals to bear (no pun intended) on enemies\n-New mission style at major intersections - "choose your path" which affects your gameplay\n-New enemy "hunters" can charm animals and use them to attack you\n-Throwing knives and riding elephants into fights\n\nHonestly, I feel like this is more of an expansion than a new game in and of itself. The initial trailer had me excited but now that I've gotten into it...it's more of the same. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I loved Far Cry 3 for the story and the mechanics. I just wish it wasn't so re-hashed so far.\n\nWithout really wanting to get into spoilers, you get thrown into the action (once again a tourist in a foreign place with a seemingly insane person) only this time...you're just bringing your mother's ashes to a place. You're not kidnapped and forced to run for your life and survive - everyone knows who you are and you're just a tourist. There's no story motivation to skin animals or collect plants like there was in Far Cry 3 - you're just some random guy who even makes the same noises when doing so. The psychological effect of watching Jason from the last one go from scared and weak to eventually being able to do complicated takedowns and becoming less affected when skinning animals was fantastic. With Far Cry 4...you are a tourist who is trying to deliver his mom's ashes. And incidentally you are a great shot and know exactly what to do with plants (harvesting with the same animation) and taking skins after killing animals (with the same animation). The main character feels bland and un-interesting, down to his voice lines.\n\nThe whole basis of the plot (3 or so hours in, this may or may not change) for your character is that you're some guy's son. Really. And for some reason everyone knows it even though you're just coming back to Kyrat. That's the basis of your abilities and your fame.\n\nIn FC3 you earned that feeling, people saw you as a skinny white guy until you got the tatau and everyone knew what you had done and how much of a badass you'd become. Vaas even let you go because he didn't think you were a threat. Even your friends realized it later and were frankly scared by it. The sequence in FC3 where you were driving away, telling Liza to serpentine while grenading vehicles behind you and actually laughing out loud - that's the point at which the player realizes he really has changed. That kind of immersion in which you kill the first guy with the knife after he tries stabbing you and going "oh crap, oh crap" then proceeding to run shows the character's flaws and how blatantly unprepared he is for dealing with getting his friends back. He was nervous about even shooting a pistol in the beginning.\n\nIn FC4 it's another guy who has no...development? He can shoot guns, he can loot plants, he can skin animals but there's no motivation for it. He's just...there. In the middle of a war, trying to get his mom's ashes to a place. And for some reason isn't shocked there's a war going on, but instead says "i'll help you guys out" and runs around the island probably with his mom in his backpack.\n\nI'll update later as I play through. It's not a terrible thing that it's a lot of the same...but I don't think it's worth 60 bucks as an entirely new game.\n\nAgain, this is all -so far- so players can get an idea of the amount of time I've played vs what I've seen. Thanks for reading, feel free to share your ideas. I intend on being active in the review process.","November 18, 2014","false","25.4"," 2,142 of 2,866 people (75%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","75","142","2","57","161"

One thing you will notice when running around is that the game feels a lot like Far Cry 3, but a lot of the annoyances are fixed. Falling damage isn't nearly as brutal, and takes a longer fall to trigger it; simply jumping while running on a slight slope will no longer take half your health. The driving physics are also much-improved, and the vehicles, though similar-looking, are more useful and a bit more capable off-road. The pickup trucks no longer look so generic, and actually strongly resemble older-model vehicles of a particular US brand. You also get access to a wider variety of powerful weapons much sooner than in FC3.\n\nSkill progression in FC4 is much more open than in FC3. There's fewer restrictions based on where you are at in the campaign. Sometimes you do have to accomplish a particular feat or task to unlock a skill, but it always tells you what you have to do so it isn't hard to figure out. Side missions are much more varied and rewarding.\n\nThe biggest problem I've had is that the game tends to stutter a bit randomly, for no real reason, and my machine exceeds the recommended hardware in every way. I am sure a future patch will fix this, but it is a bit annoying at times.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3, you'll love Far Cry 4. It takes everything great about Far Cry 3 and improves it.","December 7, 2014","true","251.4"," 196 of 237 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","196","237","6","3"

I've beaten the story 2 times, I conquered all outposts dozens of times and I've got the max level in MP. I reached the point now where I am totally done with FC3, and ready for FC4. I played FC4 now for around 30 hours, but I'm already done with it because I am so disappointed.\n\nIf a game series is moving on to a new chapter, then I personally expect some kind of progress in the basic gameplay while keeping the good moments and the atmosphere of a game-series. This is my main complaint about FC4: the lack of progress. The thing which made FC3 awesome was that the developers really tried to take the criticism of Far Cry 2 to heart and create a great new gaming experience.\n\nIn FC4 I can't see anything of this. It's FC3 in a new setting, telling basically the same kind of story and fails to add some significant gamechanging features. The basic-gameplay (movement, gunplay, driving, flying, etc.) is a total rip of the predecessor, with all good and bad. Similar thing with the features: exploring, hunting, leveling, side missions, enemies - mostly the same stuff as before, most of the time worse then FC3 (Hunting is totally the same, only 2 skill trees left with a few more "skills", some new sidemissions, only one new type of enemey, ~70% ripped weapons, ...).\n\nThe story isn't as good as FC3. The FC3-story itself wasn't extremely good, but basicly ok and lived by the great characters. FC4 also tries to create some interesting characters, but fails to compare to FC3 yet again.\n\nThe technical side of the game is well-done. Kyrat is a beautiful setting, the graphics are as impressive as the sounds (nice music, great weapon sounds, good synchro). I haven't noticed any bugs so far. Only complaint here is the very ugly menu and some of the controls, which is caused by the console-port. One big plus is that you can play everything except the story-missions in coop. I can't say much about MP because i'm really not up for it anymore.\n\nFC4 might be a good game standing by itself, but compared to the progress FC3 made after FC2 this is a total shame. If you are going to say that Battlefield 4 is Battlefield 3.5, then you also have to say that FC4 is FC3.2. After I finished FC3 I was really up for a new game experience, but this isn't it - only a new setting and some extremly disappointing features doesnt justify 60€ or the "4" behind "FC". Feels like an addon, so why sell it as full-price? Next time, Ubisoft, take one or two years more and then release a game which really brings the series to a new level.\n\nIf you never played the FC-series before, get FC3. If you did, then don't spent more then 30€.","January 20, 2015","false","35.8"," 795 of 1,060 people (75%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","75","795","1","52","61"

A lot of what made the last game great has been copied to this and polished even further.\n-Firstly the graphic detail is spectacular, not much else I can say about that.\n-Heaps more side quests and odd jobs with the addition of random events ensures there is always something to do.\n-Story line is interesting and is influenced by the missions you decide to do\n-Characters are great and voice acting is spot on.\n-Enemy AI is quite intelligent\n-Local wildlife is just as dangerous and is a great addition to only human enemies. Wolves, bears, tigers, honey badgers, rhinos and many more\nIf you're like me and you're bored of conventional military shooters that throw you in a linear setting with conveniently placed cover and walls of enemies that know exactly where you are no matter what you do, this game and Farcry 3 are great refreshing ways to play. Much of your engagement in the open world are wandering patrols, vehicle convoys, lightly guarded camps, fortified compounds or even just a dude taking a ♥♥♥♥. Each setting allows for many ways to approach.\n- Lure them into secluded spots for silent take downs\n-Pick them off from distance with a sniper rifle or bow\n-Throw in a hunk of meat to lure a tiger or a pack of wolves to cause chaos\n-Set fire to the ground and watch the flames spread and engulf enemies\n-Fly over with a hang glider and throw rocks like an ewok on endor.\n-Set landmines or c4 charges\n-Run in guns blazing throwing grenades.\n-Run in guns blazing throwing grenades while riding an elephant.\nWith access to gear and weapons like pistols, smgs, shotguns, rifles, snipers, bows, heavy weapons, grenades, throwing knives, molotovs, c4, landmines etc (all can be modified as well) There are many fun an entertaining ways to play.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it doesn't really have replay value.

I want to give this a "neutral" rating. For $90, which is what I paid for the season pass and this game though? Negative. Here's why:\n\n1) The story falls very short of the first three games, especially when compared to 1 and 3. I feel like a child caught between mommy and daddy arguing. No decision is correct, someone is always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, and while there are "consequences" to every action, I have to listen to an NPC chew me out at the end of every mission because I chose the lesser-loser situation. Not a fun factor.\n\n2) The much flaunted CO-OP is pretty terrible. Your CO-OP buddy can only join to help you with outposts, herb gathering, and hunting missions. Your buddy is also limited to 150 meters before they disappear off the face of the earth. It's like walking in a world where only the first player can see anything, and the second player is stuck to stare into oblivion only to support you with a few extra bullets towards a goal which is already foolishly easy. Even on hard mode, the game struggles to challenge.\n\n3) UBI: WHAT DID YOU DO TO MULTIPLAYER? One of the great aspects of Farcry 3 was the DM, TDM, and CTF modes. You had a great thing going there. It was a very nice tribute to old school competitive gaming. With this, you do NOT have DM, TDM, nor CTF. You have a messed up version of cowboys and indians where one side gets bows, one gets guns. Sure you can argue there are abilities, but as with every other game that has attempted asymetric combat, in the end, it leads to premade groups and utter frustration. Not to mention... the "indians" are severely underpowered. The average player who doesn't want to gather 5 of his buddies at the same time every night is underpowered because he's stuck in the hunter-gatherer stage of life.\n\nThe good though?\n\n-graphics are nice\n-story is decent (though not as strong as 3)\n-decent characters.\n-runs like absolute BUTTER (maxed). Great optimizations.\n-Plenty to do.\n-nice entry into the seamless coop arena, but it fell short. see above.\n-lots of weapons to play with and variations to explore.\n\n\nOverall, I give it a 6 of 10. Playing Farcry 3 spoiled me, and this is a rehash with a story line borderline dull, a multiplayer that made me want to shelve the game immediately, and $90 less in my pocket which I wish I would have researched more carefully. I would NOT have bought season pass knowing the COOP and the MP was so terrible (in terms of flexibility. Some people like cowboys and indians I guess), and would have heavily debated paying full price for the game. Likely would have waited until it was on sale.\n\nIt hurts to say this, because I love this franchise. Once again, UBI fails at multiplayer.","November 19, 2014","false","15.8"," 681 of 965 people (71%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","71","681","965","13","43"

It is the small things like the amount of trees and the snowy mountains surrounding the map that add to this. The graphics on the characters are well done, with the faces of the main characters having lots of detail when on high graphics settings, and the animals when you get up close to them look very realistic.\nGameplay & Combat\nThe movement and combat is quite fluent and responsive. The driving feels responsive and the new added feature of "autodrive" is a great one so now you can shoot and drive at the same time. The new small helicopter that you are able to fly is good fun. However, it is unfortunate that there is a vertical limit so that if you fly too high your helicopter will stall and bring your altitude back down. The gun combat is great and the sounds for it sounds really good.\n\nFar Cry 4 in comparison to Far Cry 3It is no surprise that the gameplay and combat is a solid experience considering that it is running on the same engine that was used for the previous Far Cry, Far Cry 3. The types of weapons that were in Far Cry 3 are in Far Cry 4 as well, and the gameplay is essentially the same, with the exception of taking down fortresses and other small things. There are not many brand new additions to Far Cry 4, which is neither a good thing or a bad thing. The formula of Far Cry 3 worked and was undoubtedly fun, however doing the same thing in Far Cry 4 will become somewhat of a repeat of the last game.\n\nOverallOverall, if you are a fan of the Far Cry series and are willing to pay for effectively Far Cry 3 with a change of scenery and graphics, then definitely get this game. This goes the same for people who have never played a Far Cry game before, as it is not really necessary to play previous ones to understand what is going on in this one. However, if you have already played Far Cry 3 and are only looking for a completely new experience with lots of new features, then i would probably steer away from buying this game.","July 15, 2015","true","160.0"," 95 of 112 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","95","112","4","0"

Ubisoft has really outdone themselves in the visuals department because this game looks ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! The world of Far Cry 4 is massive and beautiful in every corner, not to mention very alive and dangerous. From the tenacious Royal Army to the merciless predators of the wild (those effing eagles, man..), Far Cry 4 will keep you on your toes... Well, at least in the first 10 hours or so.\n\nStandard AAA games praising aside, Far Cry 4 is definitely not that far cry from it's previous predecessor. In fact, players from the previous game (which is excellent FYI) will notice from the start how Kyrat is very similar to Rook Island in a way, just with different settings and a lot more snow. There's the standard takedown moves, radio towers (bell towers, in this case) to climb, outposts to liberate and standard treasure hunting for collectibles. Don't get  me wrong, it's fun doing those but it does get boring when you're doing the same thing for hours.\n\nCompared to Far Cry 3, the story here is mediocre at best and plus, the ending is absolutely anticlimatic, i.e. HORRIBLE, but I do prefer Ajay more rather than Jason since he's not that whiny. The plot starts with Ajay Ghale, first time in Kyrat, to fulfill his mother's final wish that is to spread her ashes at "Lakshmana", wherever or whatever that is. Of course, nothing goes smoothly in the harsh world of Kyrat, he founds himself captured by the story main antagonist, Pagan Min. After a few explosive scenes later, Ajay founds himself fighting for the rebel group, Golden Path, to free Kyrat.\n\nI think the biggest problem in Far Cry 4 for me is that there's just "too much of a good thing that it's bad". There's plenty of things to do in Kyrat but mostly it's the same thing over and over again. The collectibles are also not that impressive and only serves to explain a little bit about Kyrat's history and counts toward the 100% completion rate.\n\nPROS     KYRAT IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! Seriously, it's worth it just to go through the story just to see what Kyrat has to offer. The world is full of details and the character models are finely animated. There's plenty of interesting places to see, for example, a few side missions requires you to go up to the Himalayas and one of the story mission brings you to the mountainside prison. Not to mention the amazing Shangri-La!\nThe game is greatly optimized in PC. I'm not sure how the game fares early on but it runs fine on my ancient rig now. I even managed to run it on Ultra, which is extremely rare for games nowadays! Bugs and Uplay issue aside, the game never crashed on me once.\nExtremely detailed character animation. That includes the acrobatic movement, gunplay, animals movement. Although I do have to mention that sometime when Ajay climbs up, his feet doesn't seem to "hit" the solid ground or rock that he's climbing up from. It's a little weird but nothing gamebreaking.\nVariety of weapons to cause chaos in Kyrat, more than the ones available in Far Cry 3. Some them even have the option for customization, albeit too simple (basically, suppressors, larger mags, sights) but it's there.\nNavigation is easy in the world. Plenty of fast travel points between outposts, extremely useful gyrocopters (limited by a vertical limit sigh) and even wingsuit can be unlocked early on.\nThe characters are interesting enough to give the extra variety to Kyrat.\nPlenty of side quests to complete (perhaps too much?), which includes the excellent Shangri-La quest line! (Seriously, do not skip this one)\nThe main campaign offers replayability since there's an option to choose in some of those missions which dictates how the story turns out.\nThe game offers excellent level building editor and from what I've seen is pretty impressive. Either it's an extremely well made fortress to liberate or just a Pagan Min slaughterfest, there's plenty of fun to be had if you're willing to dig.\nMultiplayer modes are plenty although there's no one playing it anymore. Could be fun if you had a group of friends to play around.\nThe whole world feels dynamic. There's always something going on, whether there's a firefight or just animals trying to chomp on someone (which includes you).\nNEUTRAL     The game can be too easy early on, even if you played on the Hard difficulty. Unlike Far Cry 3, advanced skills can be unlocked early on and by utilizing advance takedowns, you can basically romp through the story in a short while. Not to mention the Signature weapons that are also unlocked early on. Oh, did I mention elephants? Yes, elephants. Fun to ride but fricking OP.\nThe amount of collectibles in this game is TOO DAMN HIGH!\nExploration isn't that rewarding other than for screenshot hunting and collectibles. There is a backstory in some of the area but nothing impactful when you compared it to the likes of Skyrim or Fallout.\nThe Arena is fun but, due to the lack of variety, gets extremely tedious to grind since you have to rank up to Level 10 to unlock the Bushman signature weapon (which counts towards 100% completion).\nRacing side quests aren't exactly racing, just another time attack mode, which isn't very different from the Survival mode. I'd enjoy it more if there's an actual racing.\nCONS     The game gets repetitive FAST! Even worse if you've played Far Cry 3.\nThe game is a bug fest. Nothing gamebreaking but it sure is annoying when a guard gets a pathfinding bug and suddenly detects you out of nowhere or the wingsuit doesn't activate in air even after you've pressed Shift. I guess massive games like this can't help it when it comes to bugs, huh?\nCrafting is very uninspired, disappointingly similar to Far Cry 3's. Skin 3 dogs to upgrade your weapon sling. Okay, next, skin 4 yaks. Bah, boring. I have to mention that one of the final upgrades only unlocks after you've finished the main story line, which is idiotic in my opinion.\nMultiplayer mode is pretty much dead. I didn't try it because I can't since there's only either one or two lobby running at any time and both of them shows insanely high ping (probably played in the NA server). Same goes for the co-op mode in the campaign. It's a shame since there's plenty of game modes available and the co-op is one of the main attracting factor for me to buy the game in the first place. I guess I'm just too late for the party.\nLoots are unimpressive since they offer nothing other than to sell it for money. Although a few of them have some interesting description that refers to the previous game or other mainstream title.\nStoryline is forgettable. Even the main antagonist isn't that impressive!\nIf you really don't mind about your progression rate and ignore the side quests, the main campaign is actually quite short. I guess you can finish it around the 15-20 hours mark?\nDespite all the negative points I've listed for the game, Far Cry 4 is definitely an enjoyable experience as a whole, both in terms of gameplay and visuals. If you like Far Cry 3, then you're probably gonna enjoy this one as well. As for me, Far Cry 4 goes highly recommended!\n\nPersonally, I give Far Cry 4 a great 4 / 5 just simply because Kyrat is amazing on it's own!\nI paid RM51 (~ $12) for the game and got my money's worth. Just keep in mind that you're probably buying the game just for the single player experience, unless you have friends that plays the game and are willing to dive back into the series.","February 15","true","70.8"," 103 of 127 people (81%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","81","103","127","14","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hatesolstice/recommended/298110/","hatesolstice","HateSolstice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hatesolstice/","321 products in account","It's a great game with some minor flaws and, sadly, technical hiccups.\n\nThe positives: Much of the mechanics from Far Cry 3 that returned(most of them) have been streamlined quite a bit. For example, the sliding crouch and ability to hide bodies are no longer skill points you have to waste, but are actual abilities you have from the start. The syringes have been improved upon as well, as green herbs will auto-craft health syringes as you collect and/or use them, plus the various other syringes have been combined to reduce the number of syringes you need to keep. Also, animal kills now show up on you minimap/radar as tiny Xs. It's small and simple things like this that really help.\n\nThe new stuff added is also great. The elephants, for example, are just awesome and fun, even if a bit overpowered. You can use any of your weapons while riding them, smash and flip vehicles, grab nearby enemies and bash them into a bloody pulp, and even coax other elephants to follow you and fight along side you. Finally, the elephants can swim, and make it so you are not attacked by the damned devilfish that populate the rivers and lakes of Kyrat. Honestly, one of my favorite additions.\n\nAlso, there are now flying vehicles called "buzzers". They're essentially one-man gyrocopters, and make travel much easier. Plus, it's quite fun to bombard enemies bellow with your grenade launcher.\n\nThe negatives: The worst part of the game is the technical problems. For whatever reason, Ubisoft as of late has been very anti-PC gaming, and sadly it's showing. Constant framerate stuttering on a vast majority of rigs, buggy game save problems causing deleted files or ignoring player progress, and certain locations on the map not acknowledging player discovery are all the biggest culprits.\n\nA lot of people will complain about the story and characters, and honestly, I think they're quite silly to complain. People seem to think that stories have to have a protagonist that is the epitome of good, and that the evil antagonists have to be a certain way. I personally really like the horribly flawed characters that Ubisoft has created for their games(be it Aiden Pearce from Watch_Dogs, Jason Brody from Far Cry 3, or Ajay Ghale from Far Cry 4). It gives the games more pesonality.\n\nLastly, the worst parts of the gameplay are actually the collectibles. Let me explain. You see, as you collect the lost letters, journals of Ajay's father, the evil masks, etc,  you  earn more experience points and other rewards for reaching certain progress milestones. The problem with this is that, by the time you're done with them, you will have been max level with all skills unlocked for ages,  and there are only a couple weapons that you can unlock this way. So, by the time you're halfway through the game, you'll have probably unlocked all the really good rewards. I feel Ubisoft could have balanced this out better.\n\nOh, and the predatory animals.....they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They're far more aggressive than they were in Far Cry 3, and far more dangerous. The worst ones in the game are the eagles, and only because they come out of nowhere, swoop down and attack, and most of the time are completely unavoidable. The rest of the time it will be when you're scouting out an outpost, and just about to pull the trigger on your sniper rifle to take out the enemy scout, when all of a sudden you look down and see a tiger or leopard or honey badger eating your leg. 9 times out of 10, this will cause you to give away your position and totally screw you out of bonus xp for taking the outpost undetected. Luckily, the game now has bait that you can throw and hopefully draw the attention of the predators away from you(and have them attack the camp for you instead), or you can use the hunter syringe and cause animals to be a lot less interested in you.\n\nIn the end, even with the aforementioned flaws, the game is fantastic. I haven't had a chance to play co-op, so I can't comment on that, but the multiplayer is a lot of fun once you figure it out. Oh, and before I forget, there are a LOT more random events and encounters throughout Kyrat, so you rarely  will go more than a couple minutes without wandering into random firefights between allies and enemies, or hostage situations.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed the other Far Cry games, or enjoys FPS in general, or are simply sandbox game enthusiasts.","December 25, 2014","true","167.9"," 106 of 132 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","106","132","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/298110/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Far Cry 4 is a phenomenal game from Ubisoft’s Montreal studio: an energetic open-world playground that brims over with emergent potential. The fictional sub-Himalayan dictatorship of Kyrat that serves as the setting is a living, dangerous thing. Your actions can affect it, but life there continues on with or without your input.\n\nThe game starts off innocently enough as protagonist Ajay Ghale returns to his country of birth, Kyrat, situated in the isolated expanses of the Himalayas. The reason for his return is to fulfill the last wish of his mother, to take her ashes to be with Lakshmana. What should've been a simple journey to his mother's final resting place quickly takes a turn, as he is confronted by the king of Kyrat himself, Pagan Min. This little slice of paradise is anything but, as is quickly made clear when Ajay finds himself at the center of a civil war between Pagan Min's army and the Golden Path, a rebel group which Ajay's father once led.\n\nThe story for the most part sets itself up far better than in the previous title, giving the player more choices that impact the story as well as more interesting characters to interact with. Everyone remembers Vaas Montenegro, but do you remember anyone else from the Far Cry 3 character list? Most players would remember Citra and Vaas at most with very few of the rest of the large cast actually being memorable at all. I found this to be much different this time around. The main cast themselves are portrayed mostly in a convincing light that shows the two sides of the same coin.\n\nThough it boils down to good and evil, some of the characters at times at least are able to come across in a morally gray area which is often where the choices you can make in the story follow close behind.The most notable character however is Pagan Min. Despite being seen about the same amount as Vaas, Pagan is a much different flavor of crazy that is much more involved in the overall story arc. Rather than mostly hearing about him through hushed whispers of fear, Min will often try to talk to you sometimes dealing with idle chit chat and other times giving threats under the guise of advice. Though the story is overall an improvement this time around, there are often times much like the predecessor where many of the campaign missions feel forced.\n\nMuch like Far Cry 3, the majority of the gameplay is going to revolve around you being tasked with taking down strongholds and assets of the enemy force. This time around, they bring back a lot of old toys and several new ones.A far more imposing way to take on your enemy would be to mount up on the back of an elephant. I found myself doing this quite a bit when I just wanted to let loose and tear things up. You'd think after a while rampaging around and shooting a fully automatic weapon from atop the noble beast would get boring, but for me it didn't.Another new thing is the grappling hook which unfortunately is often squandered. Given that it can only be use at pre-marked and determined destinations, it undermines the potential usefulness and fun of the device.The new toys aside, for the most part it plays like Far Cry 3.\n\nSo what is the major part that makes this game shine? The setting.Kyrat is not only a beautiful place, but also one of much more variety. From the snowy peaks of mountains, to the grassy farm-filled valleys, even when you've seen it all it feels new depending on your perspective of the land. It also feels much more alive, with friends, enemies, and civilians all going about their day to day tasks.\n\nFar Cry 4 overall is a worthy successor to Far Cry 3, if only slightly less mind blowing than the previous entry. It has only been a couple years since Far Cry 3's release after all, and for many it may be a game that was played to death and they desperately needed a break from after all that time. If you don't need a break, Far Cry 4 is worth checking out immediately.","February 21, 2015","true","191.0"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","68","77","3","0"

First off Im sorta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the bad reviews I've seen on metacritic and other places due to the fact that it takes a good PC to run. A lot of people have found "bugs" that is obviousally them trying to run the game on very low without the required settings and are discovering issues due to that. Ok now that I've said that heres MY review\n\nSingleplayer:\n\nThe only negative thing is that it is kinda repitive when it comes to the other FC games, beyond that it is fantastic. It keeps a lot from FC3 and adds a whole lot more. The world seems a little smaller, yet. For those who dont know:\n\nFar Cry is an Open world game, meaning that you can go around and do quests, campaign missions unlock more of the map, take outposts and do whatever the hell you want. Its also a First Person Shooter and ties the FPS and OW together very well.\n\nThe world of Far Cry 4 takes place in a fictional city called Kyrat, that is located in the Himilayas, you can hunt animals to skin them and craft sacks to carry more of any given item. the game also features enemy outposts where youy can gain an XP bonus for how you take it, the less detected you are, the more XP you get. Now as XP goes I wanna talk about are the skills, instead of 3 groups like we had in FC3, we have 2, Elephant and tiger, Elephant is more defensive whereas Tiger is Attack.  there is no tatoo however ( thank god. it was kinda weird) The quests I havent diven into that much, however there are popup quests around the map as you travel called Karma that will give you Karma XP, which basically as it would suggest, shows how reputable you are with your tribe, Golden Path (Thats what it called right?) If you gain enough XP you can call in troops to help fight with you, however you cant call them in during a mission, which i find sorta annoying.\n\nThe next thing is that co op isnt seperate anymore, instead you can aid eachother in single player, mainly to take down the fortressess. Which are like huge, well guarded outposts. Another thing is animals in the game. They are very tough and start to become a quick problem.   However a new feauture can counter this. When you skin an animal, you take its meat and put it in a bait sack, bait is one of your throwable objects, animals will go eat the bait then attack the next thing closest, so you can throw bait into a crowd of enemies to get an animal to attack them. The last thing I wanna talk about is the campaign. I'm not gonna spoil anything, however there are 2 seperate sets of missions after you hit the 6th or 7th missions. So, you can play the game twice and have most of the missions be different.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nIt is amazingly fun.  It is 5v5 and there are 3 different modes. The maps are GIGANTIC! you can use the wingsuit to fly around the map, and the Golden Path can use guns and vehicles, and the enemy act as hunters which are enemies that have bows and can turn invisable. So you get bows and can ride elephants. You also get 2 Special Tipped arrows and you can summon animals to attack the Golden Path. There are usaully 2 10 minute halves depending on the game mode. You are one team for the first half, then switch for the second.\n\nOverall this game is amazing. I HIGHLY reccomend\n\n10/10\n\nPS This is my first indepth review. Let me know if its any good.\n","November 23, 2014","true","51.7"," 138 of 185 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","138","185","0","15"

The game isn't bad, but it is insanely overpriced. The animations are exactly the same, the weapons are no different, and overall the gameplay is just copy&paste. As far as the story goes, you are Ajay Ghale (don't know if I spelled it right). By your mother's dying wish, you travel to Kyrat to spread her ashes, and what you find yourself in is a civil war between two "factions". And you instantly become this hero that destroys everything the dictator (Pagan min) stands for. Like, if you were going to travel somewhere, wouldn't you already know about a civil war? Anyways, it's rushed, you become a war hero within the first 30 mins of the game, which is just like FC3, but FC3 did it better. The characters are weaker, the types of enemies are exactly the same. The game is good, but it is very very overpriced. Nobody should pay 60$ for a re-skin.\nNow, the pros&cons for the lazy ones.\nPros:\n+Great graphics\n+Another very well done main villain\n+Rideable elephants\n+Decent story\n+Good voice acting\n+New animals, new vehicles (like 2-3 of each, nothing special).\n\nCons:\n-Copy & paste gameplay from FC3, with the same animations etc. If you were tired of FC3, don't get this one.\n-Weaker characters\n-Story feels short, can be repetitive\n-Alot more difficult than FC3, for no reason.\n\nOverall, the game is  good, cause it's JUST LIKE FAR CRY 3.

Overall 6/10, slightly above average. In my opinion just play farcry 3 if you want 95% of the same game mechanics with a better story.\n\n(WARNING slight spoilers and text wall ahead)\n\nStarting off the things I like about farcry 4 are its graphics, beautiful sceneries, nice explosions and great looking character models.  The sounds design is also fantastic, guns sound deadly (the .50 cal MG literally shook my desk), animals sound fierce and no random low quality dialogue that you saw with some of the random NPCs in farcry 3 (that bugged the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.) Lots of guns for you to use and customize, pretty pink shotgun with red dot sight? Check.  The map design is also great, the large amount of 'verticality'  really feels authentic but this also causes issues with the games AI.  Probably the most important issue, the game is fun, be it riding an elephant machine guns blazing, delivering grenade bombings from your trusty gyrocopter, or stealthily stabbing everyone in the throat; you are sure to have a good time. Also, lots of side mission, so many that they start to seem pointless.\n\nWhile mechanically sound, the poor AI, bugs, story, and overall unoriginality really harms the overall experience and makes you wonder how they got so much right but so much wrong.  First and foremost is the most important, (to me) story.  Trying not to spoil as much as possible, the protagonist is asked by his now deceased mother to return to her war torn country of origin, that she fled from when you where a baby, to spread her ashes; bad things happen and you are rescued by the local anti gov malitia because your father was someone special.  After this for no reason your character decides to stay and help fight becoming a mass murderer who never questions why nor what he is doing for the people who do nothing but complain about every victory you bring them.  The character dose not develop in anyway, unlike farcry 3's Apocalypse Now story.\nNext main issue is the ' unoriginality' statement that I threw around earlier.  You liberate bell towers and outposts just like farcry 3, identical vehicles, and most of the talents and craftable items are the same.  While having the same things as its predecessor is not a bad thing none of it is expanded on or evolved in any way besides the few new talents (ex ride elephant and vehicle takedown.) This lack of ingenuity really shows in the “fortresses” that players can take down.  Seeing how you are fighting a fictional North Korea (quirky seemingly insane leader who keeps the populace under control by violence and drugs also using strict security to keep the media and foreigners out) you would expect that fortresses would be these military compounds with fuel and ammo depots that you could blow up to make distractions while you mow down soldiers with machine guns screaming “WOLVERINES!!!”  What you get are small compounds or cave systems that are easily infiltrated or can be sniped from an obvious cliffside, small handful of guards, and while the reinforcements that are called in are helicopter gunships they are easily taken out due to low HP (one shot by the secondary grenade launcher) and them flying low and slow.\nThe AI which feels copy and pasted from farcry 3 is unable to deal with the large terrain differences and the new flying vehicle, leading to congo lines of ai trying to get to your sniper position or complete domination by areal grenade launcher spam. Lastly bugs,  while not many I did have 2 major bugs. First was while doing a stealth mission the AI detection system was turned up to haxorz level; they would see me through walls and have amazing hearing even though there was loud background noise (like someone hearing your footsteps trough a wall at a concert.) Second was many of the world events in co-op not spawning for both participants leading to your friend shooting at nothing on your screen while he was getting pelted by machine guns on his.","January 30, 2015","false","52.3"," 157 of 223 people (70%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","70","157","223","12","5"

Some things were fixed, some were not, and some were broke.\n\n=The Good=\n\n-More guns, always good, literally the game designers seem to have said "Lets keep most of FC3's guns, but then add a ton of awesome guns from all time zones". Only complaint is the sawed off forces you to shoot both barrels at once, but in all honesty thats a small complaint, the thing is death, literally, death used to carry this gun under his cloak and it fell out when he was hiking in kyrat.\n\n-More area to discover and explore\n\n-much more stuff to do\n\n-replayable outpost missions\n\n-dont have to stare at hands the whole game, now you get gloves! (Cant be changed but still)\n\n-Added gyrocopters\n\n-Co op in main game, with hurk, a man with brilliance unmatched\n\n-can shoot one handed weapons from driver seat (But oddly cant use two handed ones from passenger seat?)\n\nEDIT:-There are more random things to do now than there were, from chasing couriers to blowing up caravans, but these events take a matter of seconds and dont really challenge the player. I Took down a convoy of three vehicles with 3 shots from a shotgun, without leaving my vehicle. the fun missions, assassinations, hostage rescues and the like, are not replayable.\n\nEDIT: WOW! Just looked in the options menu, not only are outposts replayable, you can actually RESET them ALL to hostile, that is awesome. This allows players to replay the game in a more hostile setting even after beating it, and means, unlike the outpost master replay things, you can actually approach the outpose how you see fit, big Plus here\n\n=The unchanged=\n\n-Some weapons have an utterly paltry amount of attatchements and many are completely made\nobsolete late game, something i always despise. (This isnt as bad as FC3 though, im still using the mauser to good effect late game and it was an early game pistol, still wish i could mod it)\n\n-the wing suit still kills you more often than you actually get to use it. Likes to turn on when trying to get takedowns or jumping roof to roof, carreening you into a wall and instant death\n\n-Lacking enemy selection, despite being a dictatorship and rich, pagan's forces have no tanks, no real military vehicles, etc.\n\n-0 Customization, you are this kid, Ajay Ghale, nothing more, theres some story to him but its really pretty simple. no clothing changes, and very limited weapon customizing, hes less of a stupid teen than Jason was though, which is nice.\n\n-Signature weapons are still around, yuck, i wanna make my own killing tool, not use one the game designers cooked up.\n\n-Uplay means you need another game launcher and as a result, more lag.\n\n=The Broken =\n\n-no save slots, so once youve beat the game with whatever choices you made, if you wanna try again, start all over, erasing data.\n\n-Extremely laggy and prone to locking up at bad times, reminds me of malaria from farcry 2, i have a REALLY good computer and it still lags on LOW settings. EDIT: Recent patch has made it less laggy, still cant put it on high graphics without the computer locking up, but theres less lag overall.\n\n-Simple, lacking story. Not so bad considering you are only gonna do it to unlock stuff and then go play with said stuff, but still. it would be nice to look forward to story missions instead of loathing them.\n\n-While there is far more choice in this story compared to farcry 3, its still always gonna end with the player mostly unhappy with how it went.\n\n-Once you make a certain choice, a big part of the story literally bloody disappears and nothing further happens (Bahdra)\n\n-Pagan is extremely interesting but doesnt show up at all really, save for little radio calls every now and then, and if you make the moral choice in the end thats that, the game is over. You can now run about playin' around wondering what really was going on. Wanna try the other ending? restart the game, all over....EDIT: It honestly seems like the gaming trend is to make the player regret their choices no matter the ending. I read the other path, to see what happens if you dont shoot in the end, and honestly shooting is still the right choice BUT you miss out on ALOT of plot, so i recommend not shooting.\n\n-Dying shortly after missions can cause important mission info to not be told over the radio, and you can miss out on plot\n\nEDIT:- The devs seem to feel a need to put mass drugs into these games, to get completion, you have to subject Ajay to the same trippy treatment in a questline of about...5 missions? each is almost literally unchanged from the last. You wake up in Kyrat with pink and green fog, and run to three checkpoints looking for the two who gave you the drugs, then it ends. Very uninteresting missions, I dont think they should be there honestly, seem to exist just so the devs can stick needles in Ajay\n\n\nI will add more as i play\n\nWAYS TO FIX CERTAIN BUGS\nIf you find your car is trying to drive itself or auto aim is on, go into options, to gamepad, and turn those to manual and off, etc. The game thinks you have a remote and is trying to set up for that.\n\nIf certain parts of your sound go out, fast travel somewhere and it should be fixed. It seems going to certain outposts can maks some sounds, such as reloading, stop working\n\n==Do i recommend this game? ==\nyes, its fun, despite all this. in the moments where there is no lag, no stupid guy on the radio singing praises to a drug queen, you can have legit fun. Maybe not customized to perfection, but still. You CAN have fun and WILL, often even. Flying a gyrocopter and blasting cars below with a grenade launcher is fun, chasing a truck weildding a double barrel shotgun in one hand from an ATV is FUN!","November 20, 2014","true","41.9"," 123 of 170 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","123","170","2","11"

Gameplay mechanics are almost verbatim. If you liked FC3, then you should be able to enjoy FC4. I enjoyed both games but grew tired of the mechanics by the end of FC4.\n\nAs FC3 was graphically demanding, FC4 is more graphically demanding. I only started playing after the 1.6 patch and I've not experienced any bad hitching. You will need to take into consideration that you may not be able to crank up all details and get a smooth experience, so drop details until you can maintain your desired frame rate. FC4 is very pretty, though, and that's what really kept me going. I ran it with a Galaxy GTX 780 HOF with an overclock on the RAM, which helps quite a bit; FC4 loves to use everything it can. The graphics are very nice, so it's definitely not just wasting energy on the GPU.\n\nI recommend Far Cry 4, but consider that it is very similar to Far Cry 3 and judge for yourself what that is worth to you.","January 15, 2015","true","57.9"," 95 of 129 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","95","129","11","0"

I've been wanting to play it since I got it, but I just didn't get into it. Far Cry 3 was good, but I was not that impressed actually. I played through the story pretty quick and I didn't do any sidequest. I just didn't like it that much, beside the main story.\n\nFar Cry 4 has really changed my mind about far cry though. Sure, it somewhat repetitive and similar to far cry 3. But I think that Ubisoft really improved upon the concept and made something even better. Kyrat is a beautiful place and such a nice combination between sunny paradise and snowy mountains. When I powered up my computer with 980 SLI and 1440p monitor recently my jaw just dropped when playing this game. It's so cool to sit in that mini-helicopter and just fly over the map.\n\nThe story is interesting and you actually make some choices. Side with the guy that wants Kyrat to be like old times, or with the girl that want to change Kyrat into something better. On top of that you have the new villain, Pagan Min, which is crazy and funny guy, just like Vaas from previous game. The story is filled with crazy missions that are fun for the most part. Sidequests in far cry 4 is really good! I ended up completing almost every single one of them. I think that assasination missions, kyrat fassion week and the quest where you blew up propaganda was the most fun ones. I don't really like racing, so I skipped some of them. Not that they were bad either, I just hate race games with timers and missions with fail-state. This game has almost no timer on missions, which is something I usually have a problem with in Ubsoft games (looking at you assasins creed..)\n\nThought I was just going to play this game really fast, just like far cry 3, but ended up spending huge amounts of time in Kyrat. All in all im very happy that I've played this game. The story was good, graphics is outstanding, upgrades/skills are really useful and for every mission it actually feels rewarding. The powerful weapons you get later on, with upgrade possibility and paint, you can really create a nice loadout. I spent time to hunt so I could carry more ammo and many weapons at the same time. I really liked the feel or getting better and better gear, without feeling like it was to difficult to achieve.\n\nIn the beginning outpost was hard, even on medium difficulty, but with all skills and all weapons at my disposal I just ran through the fortress in the end. It was just a blast and I had many fun moments. I found very few bugs, I guess it pays to wait a bit before playing a AAA-title, cause I heard that far cry had issues at launch. Not anymore anyway, running at 100+ fps on 1440p with settings around high. Game goes way higher though, up to very high and ultra, and game supports SLI.\n\nTo wrap this up, far cry 4 is a great experience and a massive improvement over far cry 3 in my opinion, with new weapons, animals and interesting quests. It will take you 50+ hours to do most things, but if you really want everything you can spend even more time. In my opinion this game is worth full price, but if you get it even cheaper then it's a steal! Recommended for players that want a story-driven FPS with open world questing and a big map to explore.","May 8","true","50.6"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","1"

And yes, that is true. But after playing for a few hours I realised Far Cry 4 plays much smoother and a lot of things were more polished. More important, the land feels more alive. And besides that….it looks absolutely gorgeous!\n\nThe country is wild and filled with mountains and you can climb them. The wild life is out for your guts and there’s always a fight going on in which you can participate. Lots and lots and lots of thing to do for which you get rewarded some way or another.\n\nWhen I started the game I knew the map was big but after some hours I realised that big was BIG! So many places to discover and they put some effort and a lot of love into make you find them a lot of fun.  Driving, transport and especially climbing is much better than in Far Cry 3. There are 1 person choppers! Fun! Puzzles, hunting and missions are better too.\n\nToday someone broke into my game and I gave it a try. So I played co-op for 3 hours. We did a hard mission that is almost impossible on  your own this far in the game. I had a lot of fun playing with a partner.  Didn’t knew the guy and there are no chat options, only standard commands you can give one another. Didn’t matter. We wreaked havoc on the bad guys as if we’d been a team for a couple of years. Fun!\n\nFar Cry 3 has better characters and a better story. But I really don’t give a fart when I’m scaling the mountains of Tibet and look around me. Feels like an action packed vacation without the nagging wife and children and a lot of things to shoot at or blow up.\n\nO! Guns are great! Yep.\n\nAny negative review on this one is plain stupid.\nLike complaining when you are on a well-earned vacation that the sun is the same colour as last year and ignoring that the food is much better and the drinks are for free. Best and most impressing Ubisoft game so far. All the people involved in making this game should be treated like rockstars. These people are making my life a whole lot of fun with their games.\n\nSo if you’re in doubt if you should  buy this game…..no worries, Excellent game.\nI’m off! There’s some gaming to do.\n","April 28","true","66.2"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","0"

I thought there were a lot of great things about the game (the combat, the visuals, the late-game skills), but there were a lot of things that kept it from really clicking with me (environmental navigation was boring and tedious, it took way too long for the skill-tree to open up the really fun skills, roughly 90% of the voice-acting was rubbish, almost every story aspect was lazily-written [and the parts that were good were few and far between]) and with all that in mind, I was very cautious about Far Cry 4.\n\nSo far, this is the game that deserves to be dubbed "Skyrim with guns" or at least, far more deserving than its predecessor. Yes, much like the previous entry, Far Cry 4 has some truly atrocious caricatures masquerading as characters (which largely outnumber the game's few good characters [Pagan Min is a hoot, and Troy Baker does a wonderful job bringing him to life]), yes a large portion of skills have been ported wholesale from the last game, yes the story is dull (so far, haven't finished it yet [though I never cared about the story in Far Cry 3 in the first place]) and the fact that I still can't skip the (mostly) awful dialogue in this game puts me in a sour mood, but at least when I'm set loose into the absolutely beautiful game world that is Kyrat, I know that whatever activity I'm about to take place in will cheer me right back up again.\n\nThe single best thing I can say about this game (or at least, the thing I can't stop having a blast with) is just how fantastic getting around the environment feels. In Far Cry 3, I routinely took shortcuts down hills and slopes, and because of the (I felt it was) unpolished nature of the sandbox, I would randomly go tumbling down what appeared to be easily traversable terrain and lose large chunks of health, or worse, die. In Far Cry 4, I've only ever had an unfortunate tumble down a hill once, and to be fair, it was a steep, steep hill. Even better is the addition of the new grappling hook, which lets you ascend/descend cliffs and swing across gorges to access some hard to reach areas, or just take super quick shortcuts. Additionally, the wingsuit (which was one of the best things about Far Cry 3) takes way less time to unlock this time around. Whereas Far Cry 3 required you to be a good halfway into the game to unlock the suit, Far Cry 4 gives you the option to buy it less than three hours in, and considering the urge I get to leap off of every cliff I see (sometimes even with cliffs I just took the time to climb up), it was a wonderful decision to give this toy to play with early.\n\nOther improvements made over the previous game include a much better economy, a reworked stim system (there aren't nearly as many arbitrary stims this time around), improved outpost liberations, better vehicles (the little ramshackle helicopter is so much fun it's almost criminal), a much more varied environment (thanks to the verticality of the map layout), and elephant riding, which never stops being both hilariously funny, and insanely empowering.\n\nFar Cry 4 might just be more of Far Cry 3, but that's a great thing in my book. To me, it doesn't feel like I'm getting a rehashed Far Cry 3 with some new bits and bobs; it feels like I'm getting the game I wanted Far Cry 3 to be. Think Just Cause 1 vs. Just Cause 2. Essentially the same game, but the second one took all the ideas from the first game and improved upon them to the point of making Just Cause 1 entirely obsolete. I definitely recommend giving Far Cry 4 a look, it’s a f*cking blast!","November 19, 2014","true","28.2"," 116 of 166 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","116","166","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poor_yurik/recommended/298110/","poor_yurik","Poor Yurik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poor_yurik/","494 products in account","I absolutely loved Far Cry 3. I beat the singleplayer, the coop campaign with 3 buddies, and hit max level in multiplayer. You can see my Far Cry 3 pvp videos on youtube, including "Rambo Mode", named by PCGamesN as one of the top 10 entertaining FC3 videos. Based on my love for Far Cry 3 I went ahead, on blind faith, and preordered the deluxe edition of this game.\n\nWith that said, what a massive disappointment this game is. There isn't any one single aspect that breaks it for me. Instead, I would call it death by a thousand cuts.\n\nFirst off I want to address the absolutely undebatable. Something that has nothing to do with personal taste. This game is BUGGY AS ALL HELL. Several times I've randomly slid backwards up hills as if an invisible force was dragging me backward. I've died from 5 foot drops, and in the next moment fell 30 feet and didn't take a single point of damage. Birds constantly land in midair. I've seen up to 4 birds all perched in the sky, and it's not due to draw distance -- this happens even a few meters away on ultra detail. If you skin an animal and your inventory is full, that animal is forever broken and cannot be skinned, even if you drop items to free up space. To add insult, they still glow white as if lootable. Small bugs like this are absolutely pervasive, and affect nearly every mechanic in the game.\n\nLooking past the bugs, this game is also riddled with poor design decisions. Perhaps the most outrageous and baffling is that there is a constant tiny radius around you during every single mission where if you walk 10 feet out of it, you lose. I thought this was an open world game? An early game example is when you have to pick between two quest givers and there is a propaganda poster less than 50 feet away from them. But you can't pick it up. If you do, you'll fail the mission for being out of bounds, and you'll have to watch the entire mission intro cutscene again which is several minutes long. You might say "well, damn! That's not a big deal! I'll just turn around if the message pops up!" Good luck. All the most fun ways to travel (wingsuit, gyrocopter, handglider, etc) move so fast that you'll get game over'd a split second after you see the message. This game is an open world game that arbitrarily decides it doesn't want to be open world anymore. It wasn't such an issue in Far Cry 3 because a) it was far more rare, b) the boundaries were far less confined, and c) there were clear out-of-bounds lines shown on the map when this type of rule applied. Not here.\n\nIn coop, we experienced falling through the world. Respawning and instantly dying as if falling from a great height. Terrible syncing issues, such as seeing whole groups of enemies and vehicles that my coop partner did not. This was not a consistent issue, but it's something we never experienced in all of our hours playing Far Cry 3. The most ridiculous death I had was getting teleported to my buddy because he had wingsuited off a cliff. It teleported me close to him in mid-air, in my own wing suit, headed straight toward a cliff wall and I promptly died.\n\nThe PVP is so bad now I'm not even going to waste words on it.\n\nA lot of people complained about Far Cry 3's story, but this story is just flat and lifeless. Pagan Min seems entertaining enough, but your character's motivation -- what we're supposed to relate to -- is meaningless. You're here to spread your mother's ashes -- so logically you might as well stay and instantly transform into a super soldier. Criticise Far Cry 3's Jason Brody all you want, but at least he had an easily relatable motivation -- revenge, and a modicum of development. He changed, however unlikely, from a terrified kid into a guerilla leader. In this, your character literally goes from being a bored sounding tourist with no desire to be involved in the war, to hanging up on the rebel leader offering you backup and telling her you are going to destroy the very first enemy outpost in the game by yourself. Why? "Because I can handle this." And your character still sounds incredibly bored about it all. I can't stress how bored your character sounds at every moment of the game.\n\nI am scratching my head trying to understand how they could take a solid game like Far Cry 3 and break so many aspects of it. The grappling is cool. Some of the new wildlife is cool. The graphics are gorgeous. But everything else? I'm just not happy with my purchase at all. I should have loved this game, but the only emotions I felt while playing coop were boredom and anger, punctuated by an incredibly rare moment of "wow, that was cool". Those rare moments were not worth $60, let alone $90.","November 26, 2014","false","6.6"," 426 of 663 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","426","663","3","32"

It's probably #2 or #3 on my list of favs.   Now that I have completed Far Cry 4, it turned out to just be a large disappointment.  I love a game with a great back story and Far Cry absolutely did NOT deliver in this area.  More on that below in the spoilers....\nThings I liked:\nThrowing knives - I hope there is a FC3 mod for this someday.  Completely changed how I take out enemy camps.\nRepair tool is no longer considered a weapon.  You can have your 4 slots and still have the repair tool\nGyro-copter - Nice touch.  Makes getting to hard areas easier.\nGrappling hook - Again, nice touch, but was really hoping I would be able to use it against any rock surface, and not just pre-set areas.  Might as well be ladders placed in the world.\nGPS and Auto-drive - love/hate this....   It's useful at times, but I didn't use it much.  Also - there is a certain truck (enemy truck - not jeep) that auto corrects your steering even when auto-drive is not enabled.  This caused me to crash more than once in deadly ways.  I eventually just avoided this truck.\nGraaphics - They are better quality than FC3 - the scenery is beautiful.\nEnemy animal controllers - loved these guys.  Very challenging.\nArena Fighting - Nice touch, but didn't do it very often.  Still - a keeper.\nPropagation Sites - These were fun to blow the hell out of.  Would have liked to see more of these - or the ability to do this kind of damage to camps.  NOTE - this is not the same as the posters.  See below.\nCargo trucks and Min's caravans - I always went out of my way to attack these.  A lot of fun!  Also - the Golden Path cargo missions are a lot of fun too.\nHostages - This is a great addition to the Far Cry series.\nEnemies attacking your bases - This is a nice touch, however - there were a few that I didn't go rescue and I still didn't lose the base.  Not sure if I had let that happen more if I would actually lose the camp or not.\nHURK!  - Once again a hilarious part of FC.  If you didn't get the DLC for FC3, it's worth it.  Hurk is standard in FC4.\nNot X rated! - While there is the fair share of F-bombs in the game, I'm not subjegated to a porn flick like FC3.  However, I still loved the story of FC3 - FC4 just really fell short in the story area and had the overly adult material been included it would have been an obvious grab for money.\n\nThings I HATED! - SPOILERS!!\nStory - This story was incomplete and boring at best.  They set the entire thing up in the beginning.  No hooks, no surprises, no great cut scenes....   Within 10 minutes I knew what would happen and just prayed that it wouldn't be the case.  Unfortunately, I was proven right.   The final "battle" with Min was me walking in to a room and shooting him in the head with a pistol.  Then - fade to black...  roll credits.  Lame!\nPropagation Posters - Waste of time.  Didn't impact the game at all.\nMasks - while finding the masks was at times entertaining, I was hoping I would eventually find the killer (like in the final mask or something) and fight it out with him.  So much potential lost here....\nShangri-La - Waste of time.  Wish they had removed that and put more time in to the actual game.\nFashion week (i.e. hunting) - Obviously hunting was necessary, much as it was in FC3 - get skins craft cool stuff.  However - in FC4 you are trying to put togther some outfit for a 3rd world Calvin Klein.  When you finally get to recover the last pelt, you are asked to attend the fashion show.  When you arive there is a note saying it's cancelled.  In other words, UBI ran out of time and didn't give you anything for it.  Not even a, "Sorry I had to bail, in the corner you will find your +4 staff against dragons" or something....\nFlightsuit - Overall I love the flightsuit, but for whatever reason, my guy could NOT jump off a cliff to save his life.  Instead he would half slide down, then die.  This never happened in FC3 - it was always obvious that he was leaping in to the blue to use his suit.  I stopped using it because I could almost guarantee that my guy would not do it right.\nEAGLES - Seriously UBI???   What land do you come from where eagles attack you every chance they get?  The occasional attack would be nice, but damn - every time I was turning around, I was getting attacked.  this is by far the most annoying enemy you will face.   And way too many dogs too.  FC3 had the balanced perfectly.  It was just enough that when you were taking over a camp, you were worried about getting surprised from behind by some animal you didn't see - or you were trying to hide from them more than the red guys because you couldn't kill them as silently as the camp personal.  Perfect.  In FC4, you are getting attacked by wildlife ALL THE FRICKING TIME!!!  Annoying.  It really is just the eagles and the dogs - The other wildlife seemed to be balanced better, though there are a lot of leopards too...\nSpecial weapons - Uh - can someone tell me what was special about them?  The regular high end weapon of the same category was identical!  FC3 - I couldn't wait to unlock that special shotgun and sniper rifle!  FC4, I rarely used the special weapons.\nCaves - The caves in FC3 were massive and worth exploring.  The caves in FC4 were just indents in the rock - No adventure at all.  Very disappointing.\n\nThat is all that comes to mind right now.  Here's hoping that 5 is better.....\n\n\n","January 31, 2015","false","405.6"," 101 of 150 people (67%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","67","101","150","14","12"

The driver wasn't available when i first played. The stuttering is fine now.. for the most part. still many hickups. However the mouse acceleration is still present and anoying. TB also mentions this in his status report video (totalbuscuit on youtube. check it out!)\n\nI can almost recomend the game now. Wait a week or two and these issues might have been fixed... not sure\n\nOld review below! no need to read... but left it in for reference:\nPlease read before you buy! Expensive game, expensive pain....\n\nI've played for about 5 - 6 hours now. I have to say it is better than I first expected. The game is super awesome! It is a lot like far cry 3 like people are saying. Not that it is a bad thing. there's still a ton of new features and fun things to do. Characters are great and interesting and the world look awesome! The animals are way more lethal now and how many uses. both for you and the enemies.\n\nBut... why the hell would you not recomend it OP?\n\nGood question random gamer.\n\nI can not recomend this game to anyone at this state. The main reason is the microstutter and mouse acceleration. The in-game options have mouseacceleration turned off yet the game still have it enabled. It is super anoying to aim and the mouse controlls just feels inconsistent and sluggish. Far cry 3 had a little bit of this but not nearly as bad. Raw mouse input would solve this probably... GET ON IT UBISOFT!\n\nThe other thing is the stuttering. I have a GTX 980 and my fps are as high as you would expect them to be. However, despite the high fps the game lags. I am pretty sure it is some kind of in-engine lag.\n\nSo do not expect a true smooth pc experience with this game. I hope Ubisoft listens (as they never do) and fixes these problems asap. Until then i can not recomend this game.","November 18, 2014","false","36.0"," 236 of 374 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","236","374","0","15"

Yes, it DOES have similarities with Far Cry 3 - the hunting, the syringes, the enemy, the map, the skills system, the tower unlocking.... but you know, as somebody who raced through Far Cry 3 so eagerly I finished it far too soon, Far Cry 4 was exactly what I wanted. It has (MUCH) better graphics, incredible scenery, more intelligent NPCs, more variation in tasks, a tighter learning curve, a more likeable character, more ways to move around the map, more animals, a better story plot and better weapons.\n\nNow let me talk about the much talked about antagonist of the game: Pagan Min. I decided, before this game was available, that although I would give Far Cry 4 the chance it deserved, there was no way on this earth that they could produce a villian as bloody brilliant as Vaas from FC3. He was unpredictable, dangerous and completely nuts; just the right combination. And then I met Pagan Min. It was like they had taken the dangerous, violent nature of Vaas, added just the right amount of flamboyance and a sharp suit, mixed in a double helping of sadism and topped it off with a slice of gentlemanly British manners. He is just perfect.\n\nI have over 30 hours of this game and I am still only about 60% of the way through. I feel like FC4 is a very well developed, high-standard open world game in which you can play exactly how you choose. Although there is a new DLC out, this game is so absolutely jam packed and qualitative, I feel like I don't need to buy it. In a time where so many games developers release sh*tty, unifinished games then try to flog £50 of DLCs to just make it a worthy game (I'm looking at you Evolve and Borderlands), Far Cry 4 has been a highly enjoyable experience with a serious lack of tiresome addons and DLC. It does have similarities to 3, but if you can get over that (or, even better, enjoyed 3 as much as I did) then it will be well worth your time and money to buy this game.\n\nUpdate: Finished the game. I don't know what ending other people who complained had, but that was the most fun and challenging finale in any game I have ever played!","February 16, 2015","true","37.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"

I just wish they would have changed the skinning animations or the radio tower mechanics.  Far Cry 4 is basically suped-up Far Cry 3, but this time you get a bunch of different grenade launchers and a one-man helicopter called a "Buzzer", which is invaluable.\n\nThe Arena in Far Cry 4 is probably my favorite part - pulse-pounding survival game that is chaotic, and crazy kills and chain combos are rewarded with health, ammo, and the roar of the crowd.

I am using AMD everything, basically, and I've found that most of the issues AMD users were reporting early on have already been fixed (either by Ubisoft or AMD).\nThere are some parts where waves upon waves of enemies will be spammed at you - more than in the weed burning mission in FC3. This is really a matter of opinion, though, and can be pretty fun at times.\nThe positives:\nMy computer is quite a bit below the minimum specs recommended, and the game still works quite well most of the time. Granted, I had to update my video driver (as you do), and change a few settings in the GamerProfile.xml that weren't accessible ingame, but it worked in the end.\nAssuming you do have a decent computer, the graphics are seriously nice.\nA fairly detailed & colossal map.\nAll of the old guns from FC3 are still here, if you had any favourites. Most people seem to be treating this as negative, but I have absolutely no problem with it, given that:\nHeaps of cool new weapons aswell. Most notably: an automatic crossbow, the M79 GL (which is treated as a sidearm), throwing knives (extremely accurate, silent, ranged weapons which you throw using the grenade key), and sticky variants of your favourite bombs - your grenades, mines, and C4 can now stick to whatever you throw them at - best of all, this option is toggleable on the go. There's also bait, which is thrown like a grenade to lure nearby hostile animals, which there are always a few of.\nSome weapons are now considered "sidearms". All this means is that they can be used in certain situations where others couldn't be - most notably, when driving any vehicle. The downside is that one of your weapon slots can only hold sidearms - however, the other 3 can also hold sidearms, if you want to have multiple.\nA fair few new animals - from the small honey badgers, which are terrifyingly vicious, to the much larger rhinos & elephants.\nYou can ride the elephants! They may seem like a gimmick, but they are a huge amount of fun. I haven't seen any outside of quests, and maybe an outpost, though. I wouldn't recommend using a RPG while you're on it though, they uh, don't survive the blast too well. Or at all really.\nEver wanted to race a tuk tuk? Probably not, but now you can anyway!\nGyrocopters - by far the most convenient mode of transport, only losing in style to any elephant.\nA grappling hook, which can only be used in specific spots. It adds a nice bit of variance to climbing puzzles, and provides a good number of alternate routes to various places.\nAdopts the alternate approach system from Far Cry 2 for some of the main quests, meaning that you get to choose from two different ways to deal with the mission. If you care for immersion, it can make for some pretty interesting choices.\nFar more random encounters, with greater variance. It can be quite fun to save a couple of hostages while moving towards your goal, or to stop a honey badger terrorizing an innocent civilian (and get paid for it).\nHuge amount of notes, books, and other information lying around in game which enriches the story setting nicely. If you like reading about game lore, then you'll probably be happy with this.\nGreater variance in voice acted lines, and a great amount of contextual lines - for example: I've heard people saying things specific to the outpost they were in after I'd liberated it.\nImproved AI - I had no complaints with the AI in FC3, but it's definitely better here.\nWish you could've sided with Hoyt in FC3 (who doesn't)? Well, there's a secret ending that lets you peacefully end the game by siding with Pagan Min. Pretty snazzy detail, I think.\nThe sidequests are plentiful, and much improved. If you were planning on skipping over them and just following the main questline, I'd really advise giving them a try.\nThe HUD is fairly customizable, to a point which should make fans of ziggy's mod happy.\nNew weapon/crafting wheel system, which can be extremely handy, especially since it can toggle sticky bombs, and craft + use syringes on the go, although it can take a little getting used to.\nSkills and equipment have been rebalanced, with some things that were skill dependant in FC3 now being available by default, or obtained through other methods. For example: instead of having a skill to get 2 skins from a single animal, you just have to make it a 'clean kill' instead - using bolts, arrows, or your kukri instead of bullets/fire/explosions. The wingsuit is now available from the start, I believe. It can be obtained in the shop for about 25 grand, by picking it up for free in a couple places, or somehow not obtaining it long enough for it to be given to you during a mission.\n\nThe story, while seen from the point of view of the main character, is far less centered on him than it was on Jason Brody in Far Cry 3. While I'm a little sad about this, it also pays off hugely because it enables the story to focus more on the struggles of the country, from the over all civil war, the condition of the Golden Path group, to minor details like a son's father being killed for trying to set up a free radio station. This results in a fairly rich environment, and I found that it added a whole lot more depth to the game world.\n\nI've missed a whole lot of great points, but it's an extremely fun game, and I'd happily recommend it to anyone.\n\nEdit: I've finished the main story, but definitely not all of the game, so I'll finish off my review by adding that by the end, I loved the story. It has high replayability - both the gameplay and the story, since you can choose alternate paths which affect both.","November 20, 2014","true","49.4"," 75 of 109 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","75","109","0","4"

This is more of a 30 minutes in first impressions than a actuall review. Firstly this game is absolutely beautiful, I have a I5 and a gtx 770 with 16gb ram and able to play this game at high settings with 2xmsaa and the first option for multisampling (Forgot what It's called) with fov at max and managed to get 70-80 fps with a few dips to 40-50 (Possible fixable in a future patch/graphics card update). Next I was quite surprised at how well this game runs at launch, you've probably had your ears blown off about the preformace of watch dogs and the 30 fps cap of ac unity, obviously I'm in the minority seeing as I have quite high end hardware and can't really base how well this game runs on lower end specs. I was kinda dissapointed Ajay didn't have a accent and sounds almost identical to Jason from fc3. Also I'm not sure if it's just me but mouse input feels......weird....like one second it's the sensitivity I set, than the next it's the lowest sensitivity for a split second then back to the sensitivity I set (Hopefully fixed in a future patch). Anways initial impressions for me have been far more impressive than that of watch dogs and most other AAA games.","November 17, 2014","true","12.6"," 180 of 287 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","180","287","0","8"

F.e. Gyrocopter\n\nContra:\n- Pretty similiar to Far Cry 3 which doesn't have to be a negative thing\n- The optimization isn't good yet\nI get 60 fps with vsync on ultra and turning off some small stuff but there still are framedrops at certain points like fire for example.\n- You are Ajay Ghale, the son of the creator of the Golden Path "Molan Ghale". But you're stuck between 2 People: Sabal and Amita - Whatever you do it is kind of wrong since one of them needs this the other one needs that.\n- You came to this country to leave the ashes of your Mother and then you just become a one man army Warrior just out of the sudden? Come on.\n- There are plenty of side quests but they're pretty much the same f.e. "Armored Escort" is pretty much the same with different routes.\n- Map Editor not available for competetive game modes.\n-uPlay\n\n\nMy personal conclusion is that Far Cry 4 is a big World with Animals, plants, a crafting and a skill system nontheless it still seems to be Far Cry 3 just wtih a new HUD and Story. Some weapons arent customizable anymore because they sell f.e. the AK in a different "Signature" Design which has stuff on it but is pretty expensive. Also you gotta liberate all Outposts just to get one damn good sniper rifle which is pretty expensive though so its pretty useless in the end. Also there are some things that could have made the game better just small things like adding a skip function for cutscenses....but no they didnt do that whenever you leave a mission YOU ARE FORCED TO WATCH THEM.....also just adding some kind of inventory loadout at the beginning of the mission would have made things so much easier.......but noo....they didnt wanted to do that. It is really annoying to get forced to watch every Cutscene over and over and over again just because they were to lazy to add small things that would have improved overall game experience. Aside that there still are technical performance problems and they really have to fix them, this is a TRIPLE A Title with a Season Pass,but....???! the game isnt proper made yet. This is kind of a BETA right now.\n\nTo be honest I've only been playing Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, and I had great fun with these. But Far Cry 4 doesnt justify it's pricetag with a new story, some new settings, rerendered guns from FC3 which are basicaly the same weapons, technical problems and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ season pass for a Beta Game.  Paying for Content that actually belonged in the released game....... Also the game is kind of unoptimized and people still encounter issues. Also uPlay is hugely untrustworthy with its servers and so on.\n\nIf you wan't to play it it's up to you. For me as a former Far Cry 3 Player I feel kind of scammed by its price tag.\n\nPersonal Rating(for new Far Cry players): 6,5/10\nRating for people that already played Far Cry 3: 4.5/10 (Pretty much the same game)","November 20, 2014","false","32.8"," 133 of 211 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","133","211","0","22"

Five Rhino hides for a wallet? How ♥♥♥♥ing big is this wallet?\n\nHigh DPI mouse will be very low, since this is quite obviously a console port. You can tell by the complete dog ♥♥♥♥ menus and the terrible response for snap aiming and turning. Not much in the way for setting to fix this either.\n\nSAVING? You get ONE save file, and a backup of a save from earlier one. Ubi mannages this. You do not. You have no choice where it autosaves/quicksaves. Which could be a problem if its in the middle of a place you dont want to be and for some reason, the main save doesnt work. if you try to make a new save, FC4 asks for you to start a new game. HF W/ That.\n\nFOV is more like a joke, since there is just a bar with no actual scale of how much you are changing. That means there is a bar, but no numbers to realisticly judge how much of a FOV you are adjusting your games FOV to.\n\nThe sounds are great though, so a nice headset will do you some justice. The combat, however, is terribly random. Sometimes you can hump a dudes leg and they wont see you, other times they see you through a wall. Bad AI, especially with animals.\n\nAnimals....yes...you will find you are under nearly constant barrage from eagles, wolves, tigers, and rhinos through out the game. Every ♥♥♥♥ing squirrel in the univers is trying to stuff its nuts in your mouth. The only ♥♥♥♥ that wont try to kill you when it magically spawns behind you is an Elephant. You know? The most agressive territorial animal in the world aside from Humans.\n\nOn the up side, this ♥♥♥ you play isnt Jason Brody, but he looks like a complete ♥♥♥♥twat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyhow. Not like the strong, strapping lad I saw in the pre-release trailer for FC4. That dude looked prime. This guy looks like some college football benchwarming ♥♥♥♥ sucker.\n\nCrashing. Youll find a place you can go, or a mission you are forced to do that takes you to one of those special little unique areas...and you cant go back....and you CTD every time you try to get through it...This game has tons of ♥♥♥♥ like that, and all sorts of messed up shadow glitching, and silouette effects that make the entire world blacker than the globe trotters. Even High End PC's have been having issues like this. That is, if you can even start the game. (Check the forums for complaints about not being able to start the game on seriously good hardware.)\n\nUbisoft and UPlay. You are forced to deal with both. The game comes with a warning on it mentioning this. It doesnt change the fact that Ubisoft isnt giving two ♥♥♥♥s about patching any issues except ones they are forced to fix by law and threat of legal action. But instead of doing all they could to make this a decent console port, they ♥♥♥♥ all over the PC community again and quite openly said "We dont care about PC users anyhow, they are all Pirates.". I dont have to explain that UPlay is the same ♥♥♥♥ as steam its just not Steam. Which is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because if I wanted to play this game from UPlay I wouldnt have got it on Steam in the first place. Third party DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ect ect.\n\nIts a pretty game, to sum it up, but it has issues and some serious debates on Ubisoft justifying their verbal slander towards PC users. If you use a PC they already insulted you, even if they dont have your money yet. And if you bought a game or two from them, they already told you to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. You decide if its worth it.\n\nI leave you all with this: https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/8390196992/hAC00B18D/","December 3, 2014","false","111.4"," 427 of 712 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","427","712","5","39"

I will give an example, I rode an elephant into pagan min's fotress armed with a chaingun, grenades, two different cars covered in c4 blew the gates down after I let them ride into the base, my friend was above me in a gyrocopter with a grenade launcher and together we stomped (literally) the entire population of the base including the reinforements.\nThe second way is easily just as fun. I snuck in the base alone armed with nothing but my kukri, an autocross and a bow. Slowly I snuck my way over to the sniper's nest I preformed a takedown on one and threw a knife at the other simultaneously. No one noticed. Then I made my way to the two other sniper platforms, preforming takedown after takedown knife throw. Finally all of the snipers were taken care of. Then I took down two people by leaping down from a rooftop onto his head, I stuck a knife in his throat and spun quickly to his partner before any alarm could be raised. I took their bodies and placed them carfully underneath a table. Around the corner a heavy gunner walked. He had heavy armor on, I could not kill him with my bow or crossbow. So I snuck behind him and stuck a knife in his neck. There were twelve more guards left. I took out six of them silently then aproched the last five on the center platform. I took down one then pulled my victims pisol out and shot the rest. I had liberated the outpost without raising any alarms.","April 28","true","75.3"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","25","28","5","0"

Completely changes the story on how you choose your path.\n-New COOP mode for campaign. Now you can play the story with one of your friend.\n\nCons and could be changed in the future\n-Horrible mouse lag on PC. There are some ways to decrease them, but don't think currently people can compeletly get rid of them.\n-Plays little bit too much like FC3. Hunting and skinning animals, gathering leaves and taking down enemys stealthly. Maybe it's only because Im just started playing.\n-Main character's voice acting and lines are bit boring... Only in my opinion though.\n\nOther than some of the low perfermances currently on PC, it's a great game for people who loves sandbox and open-world FPS games. Definitely worth a buy. It also don't requires a godly PC like Assassin's Creed: Unity, my 660ti can run medium to high with around 40-60 fps no problem. Havn't tried the multiplayer yet, don't know how it will perform. This game is mainly about the campaign anyways, even if the multiplayer is not as fun, still won't be a huge problem.","November 17, 2014","true","39.4"," 202 of 335 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","202","335","0","3"

But from the very start I had issues with this game.\n\nAt the first run the game only worked in 4:3 mode. After some try and error I finally got it to run on 16:10 but there was still huge black bars on both the top and bottom of the screen. Sometimes the game would only display a black screen once started.\nThis game was obviously designed to run on console. The mouse control  feels like it is created as an after thought for the games PC version.\n\nThe game is not bad but I was simply waiting for something so much more. The graphics are good but not amazing, the world is beatiful but nothing we haven´t seen before. There is no real innovation in this game. If you have played FC3 you will be straight at home (and bored) with this game.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the co-op mode. It is huge fun to go through the land with a friend just tearing a hole  in Pagan Min´s forces. If you do not play co-op (or have no friends) my suggestion would be to buy FC3 as it is cheaper, has almost exactly the same content and somehow I find the world much more ineteresting.","January 26, 2015","false","37.3"," 60 of 92 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","60","92","4","0"

And that's completely understandable. I'll be the first to admit: At a glance, this review looks like a troll review. You might be sick of troll reviews. It just so happens (at the time of this writing) that it looks like 43% of you are sick of troll reviews. It even looks like one of you decided to look at the rest of my reviews and vote them all down. Well, it may come as a surprise to you, but this review isn't a troll review. Yes, it's short. Yes, it's one of those 10/10 posts without substantial reasoning. Yes, it looks like it's trying to be funny. Hell, it might even actually be funny to you. However trollish it looks, those came as afterthoughts to this review. This review was, first and foremost, about letting people know about the alternate ending where Pagan Min doesn't become the bad guy and you don't even need to fire a shot. This review is about letting people know that this game tells two sides of the Far Cry 4 story. This review is about letting people know that the psychotic dictator in fabulous pink clothing, who stabbed two different people within 10 minutes of the start of the game, really, truly, might not be as bad as the Golden Path storyline wants you to believe.\n\nThis review doesn't just say "Pagan Min told me he'd come back in 15 minutes. He did. Turns out he's a pretty cool guy.\n\n10/10 - Would beat Far Cry 4 in 20 minutes again."\n\nIf you read between the lines and then follow through, this review actually says "There are two sides to this story.\n\nOne where Min is your friend who genuinely intends to help you, where you can live in blissful semi-ignorance of the scale of the rebellion happening around you. He just desperately wants revenge on the golden path for killing his daughter.\n\nThe other, where you take up arms and rebel against Min and his Army to finish your father's job and free kyrat from his regime."\n\nI almost take it as a compliment that the meaning of this review was hidden so deep behind a troll facade that 43% of you thought it was a legitimate troll.

This is the first far cry game I have ever played. The story is alright but irritating at times when the character your playing stays quiet when you didnt make the right 'branching decision' in their eyes and you just have to sit and take their crap. The combats fun enough but you will always be getting sidetracked with your outposts being attacked and karma missions which all feel pointless. There is a wealth of things to do but again, it all feels pointless unless its a main story mission. Rewards for side quests include: MONEY! and XP! and.... well thats about it apart from some karma which again, seems pretty pointless.\n\nThe graphics in the game are beautiful flying around and using the glider suit are fun. I haven't expeirenced too many bugs apart from being unable to loot some corpses because they're next to walls. Controller and mouse work fine for me.\n\nI feel its all a bit meh. There is no reason for your guy helping the people there even if his parents were from there. You the player have no idea why the dude you're playing as is a badass and can shoot, skin and make syringes. WHY? HOW DID HE GET ALL THESE SKILLS!? ITS PISSIN ME OFF! Anyway, overall not a bad game but I keep finding that I have to push myself to play in the hope that it will get better. Its not addictive or something that im that excited to play, it just.. is.\n\nI would wait until a price drop it you want to try it out. There is probably 60$ worth of content here, the question is is it fun enough\n\nEDIT: So i just completed the game and the story did get a lot better. Do i recommend it? Hard to say. There are some really cool things and some really not.\n\nThe Shangri-La Quests are awesome ( I wont spoil too much) they could make a game on that place alone.\n\nThe Gameplay also gets better when the enemies get more difficult and you get more of the takedown skills, syringes etc.\n\nHowever, I still find that the 2 mission characters Anita and Sabal are complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game tries too hard to push difficult decisions on you so you get the feels. But in reality it only serves to ♥♥♥♥ you off. Best way i can sum it up it : "Hey Ajay, go save this, for Kyrat!" "No Ajay! Blow it up for Kyrat!" **Blows stuff up** " "AJAY YOU COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥ING WASTE OF SPACE ♥♥♥♥ DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!? OH MY GOD YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ YOU!"\n\nMy favourite NPC in the game is the villain Pagan  Min, The game did nothing to turn me against him. Seems like a nice guy (y'know apart from the torture and opression stuff...). Hurk is cool too but you only get him with a pre-order which seems wrong because he adds what feels like a lot to the game, as if he was taken out of the completed game and put back as a pre order bonus, which feels wrong.","November 18, 2014","false","48.4"," 150 of 254 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","150","254","0","6"

However, you can definitely feel every part of Farcry 3 in this game, if you like it, go ahead and buy it. Obviously it's not JUST Farcry 3, but alot of mechanics are the same, with added animals and a few weapons etc. I wish i had a better rig to play it, unfortunately my 570 cant even handle it on Medium-High so i don't want to ruin my experience. I do think the prologue is a bit too long (40 mins) but other than that its truley stunning.\n\nThe default settings that it sets you are a bit silly, you'll need to configure it to your likings. Mouse acceleration and sensitivity is almost non existant until you turn it up.\nEdit: I would personally reccomend you skip this game if you don't have a fairly new computer, the game is disgusting with anything under High and alot of graphics issues start to pop in. I don't think FC4 was very optimized for PC at all unlike Shadow of Morder for example that could run high on very old GPU's and still not drop below 30 fps.

Gliders? Yea they are here, but those are really a FarCry3 sort of thing. This is FarCry4, we use Wingsuits. I've spent some time zooming across the map and find myself trying to reach higher places to jump from just for the visual and fun of flying through trees, and just bearly making it over a crest to another opening then deploying just before hitting the ground.\n\nThe AI is reasonably smart, and if you take some time with your camera or sniper rifle you can see them doing some funny things. Through my scope I found one of the factions members taking cell phone photos of a propaganda poster on a radio tower just before I joined part of him with it.\n\nElephants... Not only can you ride them, you can use them to call others.... Need to storm the castle? Break through that front door with a pack, that's how you make an enterance!\n\nCo-op is... Fun! If you have a mic. The in game comunication is limited, salute for yes, give the finger for no, and a few other minimallist commands.\n\nUplay's Reward for Playing features, more points, more in game goodies!\n\nThe random encounters with animals, Karma events, and "other" things (I don't want to add any spoilers for those who are just looking into the game.) keep it fresh.\n\nThere are small personal hellicopters, these are a great way to get around, get to a high enough altitude to flight suit, or to have a co-op buddy grapple onto so you can sling them over top and have them land in the blades... Death from above off of a ledge? Thats for noobz! Death from above from a chopper? That's more like it, just don't be flying it when you jump down to kill the enemy. It hurts when it lands on you...\n\nOne of these Rino's is not like the other...\nRino's seem to be the bad ♥♥♥ of the jungle. Come near them and they may just go on a rampage and kill everything around you... Yes everything, not just everyone. Really? What did that little K car do to you Rino? It was a good Reliant Automobile! ...Some times they are rather easy to dispatch. 2 shots with the elephant gun and down they go, other times, 4 shots in the head with a high powered sniper, 3 shots in the face as it charges with the elephant gun and a box of bullets from your buddies LMG and you MIGHT have finally put it down. This might be bug, not sure, but I like it. Makes you think twice about using them for bait meat and skins.\n\nThe bad:\nIt uses Ubisoft's Uplay (This list of reasons why this is terible is long. The only thing I actually like is that players get rewarded with content for playing the games. This is great, everything else.. bad... bad Uplay! Go to your room...)\nStill, it's better than Origin.\n\nUbisofts match making is usually so bad that you can't play games with others unless the moon is in perfect alinement, some alien force is boosting reception and all planets in our galaxy have alined.  This time? Not that bad, however all the advertising about "Play with up to 10 of your friends!!!!" Is a bit missleading. You can play with 1.... not 10, 1 for co-op. If you want to play PVP then yes you can play with 10. Uplay doesn't have a "Recently played with" section to add friends, so if someone is a terrible troll you can't easily find and block them, and if someone is awesome, the same problem.\n\nThe game has some glitches, some quite amuzing... But mostly annoying, and mostly in co-op. Single player has been mostly smooth.\n\nSTEAM overlay doesn't work at 2160 res (4k) I love the overlay so this is a bummer.\n\nIt's Dark at night.\nNo kidding right? you know what, hold on.\n\n\nThe ugly:\n^^There. It's DARK at night, and in any shadow in the game if you are using SLI. When I say dark, I mean black. No increase in brightness helps, that just changes the black to grey with no texture to see still.\nI wouldn't care if I could control equiping my flashlight, and if the AI was just as blind as I was (animals excluded of course, they should be able to see you still.) Saddly that's not the case, you don't get to see anything and they can see you still as if it was daylight out. This seems to be a issue only effecting SLI users and I'm looking forward to a fix. I'll update this once it get's one.\n\n\n\nIn the end it's a fun game with a few bugs but nothing game breaking. It's not FarCry3. The story moves much slower than in that game, but the world seems larger as well. You get a little choice about what you do in the game so far as "who to help" and such. So far as story goes though FarCry3 imo had it much better. I had a reason to fight in that game, a reason to step up and risk my life... In this game, I'm here dropping off my moms ashes and figured, what the hell... Let's play with drug dealers, freedom fighters, and a tyrant.... Not nearly as good of a reason to get involved except "I'm here so why not" I also look like a D-bag from Jersey Shore and my partner in crime "Turk" used to star in East Bound and Down but hey... Turk in all fairness is awesome.\n\nGive it a play, and if you pick it up add me on uplay, same name.\n","November 21, 2014","true","46.4"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","2"

Well aside from the very intriguing intro movie that sets up the Big Bad, Pagan Min, and one of his three main cronies, the game very quickly goes south in story telling. Your protagonist is supposedly a descendent of Kyrat natives, but was raised in the United States living some life that the game never really takes the time to mention. For all intents and purposes, Ajay has no backstory beyond 'lives on America' and 'mother died and wanted ashes spread on some hill in Kyrat'.\n\nApparently living in America automatically makes people like Ajay into instant super warriors and killing machines with no training. The 'good' guys 'rescue' Ajay and almost immediately drop him into a desperate escape from about two dozen guys - all on his own - armed with just a huge knife. Nothing comes out of Ajay's mouth to remark on his situation, leaving me wondering if I'm really just controlling a seasoned serial killer that some American cop is losing sleep over stateside.\n\nYou're probably thinking: are all FPS protagonists basically that, though? Well they more or less wind up that way, but given that Far Cry 3 showed Jason going from spoilt rich kid scared of pirates to full-blown psychotic murderer, I was expecting something in the spirit of that kind of characterisation in Far Cry 4. Instead we got a protagonist with basically no character beyond the player's whims, which just feels lazy.\n\nOn the topic of lazy, we reach the gameplay. It's basically the same as Far Cry 3. Same skills, Same guns (more or less). Same kinds of vehicles (the pilotable helictoper is a waste of time). The only thing different is the difficulty. Overall the game is stupidly easy, with powerful weapons and items that would take a while to get in Far Cry 3 being acquireable in the first few hours of Far Cry 4. I had the wingsuit in less than five hours. I had taken two out of the four fortresses in seven hours. The rest of the time I wasted trying to get to the third fortress - only to find that the game will instakill/relocate you to keep you out of the Northern section of the mission. I did do some story missions, but I just don't feel invested in the plight of the other characters. They're all caught up in some civil war and are going on about low morale and how Pagan Min's army is tough - completely ignoring the fact that I've been curbstomping them and liberating outposts and radiotowers and two fortresses since I got here.\n\nThere's not really anything in FC4 that FC3 doesn't do much better. You're better off playing FC3 instead, and then playing Blood Dragon if you want something different - because you're not going to find anything interesting in FC4. Do stupid minigames? Collect pointless junk? Try to force yourself to appreciate the most boring storyline in the series? No thanks. I'll stick with Far Cry 2, or Far Cry 3 + Blood Dragon. Hell, Far Cry 3's co-op mode is pretty kickass. You'll have more fun that way.","January 30","false","8.7"," 40 of 62 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","40","62","4","1"

And the latter seems a prerequisite if you want to play this one. It's the exact same game, with a borderline insignificant change of location.

While this game is large and offers a lot of activies and things to do, it doesn't feel like it deserves to be a whole new game. It feels more like it should've been an expansion. Couple that with how terribly it runs, even on my new fairly high end computer, and it's hard to recommend it.","December 15, 2015","false","10.7"," 98 of 168 people (58%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","58","98","168","18","7"

Although you would be right to say that the general gameplay of the Far Cry series hasn't changed much from Far Cry 3 (Which, as a fan of 3, was exactly what I wanted), but you would be completely wrong to say that Far Cry 4 is lazy and just more of the same.\n\nIf there's anything that I want to praise here, it's the overall feel of the environment. Rook Island was a fantastic location, don't get me wrong, but I believe that Kyrat is a solid step forward. The architecture and the wilderness that surrounds it have a very distinct charm, one that I have a particular liking to. As opposed to rickety and rusty metal shacks, the flagstone composition of Kyrati villages (As well larger settlements) gives a much bigger impression that the world of Far Cry 4 is a place where people actually live as opposed to a giant battlefield littered with decay. The wildlife is fantastic, with great variety from location to location and one species in particular (The elephants) practically deserving a category of its own.\n\nBut it's more than pretty mountains and prayer flags that makes Kyrat feel great- sidequests and random encounters have both made improvements. As opposed to random fights occuring when cars smash together on the road, skirmishes happen almost everywhere and even escalate into full on battles with organized invasions of previously liberated outposts (But, for better or for worse, outposts can't actually be taken back). I won't waste time listing all of the different kinds of side missions because of their sheer abudance, but I will assure you that there are plenty of quests to be done with enough variety so as to leave any impression of a grind in the dust.\n\nThere are other things that I would like to add onto the pile of praise but honestly they won't change your purchasing decision. If you liked the gunplay of Far Cry 3, you'll find loads of fun to be had here. If you found that you didn't like Far Cry 3 much or that it didn't run well on your PC, I doubt that enough has changed within the series to alter your viewpoint. At the end of the day, fans of the series will have a great time in a solid sequel to Far Cry 3.","December 26, 2014","true","62.0"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KelseyRiha/recommended/298110/","KelseyRiha","kelsey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KelseyRiha/","60 products in account","So Far Cry 4... My short answer is sure its worth the money (for me) but is it worth it for you?\n\n\nStoryline: So obviously the storyline is no where as good as Far Cry 3s, but that does not mean its bad. Throughtout the story your fighting with the Golden Path with the two real annoying leaders who never can agree on ♥♥♥♥. I wish the story had a little more meaning to fight for rather then, I need to kill all these people so I can spread my Mother's ashes. I find myself enjoying myself more when I am just exploring then actually doing the Main Quest. Also to note there is some copy and paste missions from far cry 3. However still a pretty good Story, not Far Cry 3 status but still better then any Call of Duty. I do wish that you heard more from the main antagonist Pagan more often as he just disappears intill almost the end of the story.\n\nSide Missions: In Far Cry 4 there is a ton of side missions to do, lighting your map up. Some of the side missions get real tedious after a while, but they give good money and karma so its worth it. With all these missions you will be busy for hours after you complete the main quest.\n\nGraphics: The graphics in the game are real amazing... Well when your standing still atleast. When just walking arounrd the graphic look stunning with himalayas in the background. The second you get yourself into a car or start wingsuiting the graphics become a blur and you begin to see the real flaws with in the graphics. That is still an issue in Far Cry 3, but thinking out of a Far Cry setting it seems a bit annoying. Most (almost all) textures in the game are amazing looking for being an open world. However there are some ugly looking textures when it comes to the rocks and the water. But in all still a jaw dropping experience.\n\nAudio: The audio in the game is by far the best I have heard in any game. When running through the forests of Kyrat I feel like I am in the world, hearing all the sounds of nature ( deers, monkeys, elephants, etc). The sound track is done so nice, with all the ambient sounds and entertaining mixes to listen to. Speaking of mixes however I did found the Radio station a bit annoying at times. When you constantly hear the radio talk host Rabi Ray Rana repeat the same damn things over and over again. Which I know it would take forever to make enough dialogues to not hear repeats but when Playing GTA V I dont hear them repeat as often. My last and only gripe with the Audio is that you never get to really hear the protagonist Ajay Ghale. As he only speaks a couple of words at a time.\n\nNew Features: The game has done a real good job at making it feel fresh without making the game loose its purpose. The saying, "Don't fix something that's not broken" is present in Far Cry 4, at the base, but they have added some many new things to the Far Cry series that its amazing. Some features that they have added that are worth noting are; being able to throw meats to get animals attention, the ability to throw knifes, being able to purchase the wingsuit instead of waitin half way through the game to obtain, gyrocopters, hovercrafts, being able to call in backup, a refined map editor, actual good co op, and a pleather of new vechicles to choose from along with some old favorites from Far Cry 3. There is of course a lot of other features but those are just the ones worth mentioning.\n\nA.I.: I feel they did a good job at A.I this time around, the bots are noticably harder and smarter compared to Far Cry 3, but it makes it more enjoyable and satisfying when you get a kill. The animals on the other hand is kind of a mixed bag. They do do a good job at being animals I guess, but they always seem to come and attack at the worst times, like that its in the code for them to just ♥♥♥♥ you other when you're already in ♥♥♥♥. Overall A.I. is pretty good.\n\nProblems worth to Note: There are some issues in the game that I will note now; bad optimization (I feel it is no where as good as far cry 3s optimization), steam overlay does not want to work (for me atleast), cutscenes are unskipable, you have to wait through a long boring slide of things when you launch the game up everytime. Money in the game is way to easy to obtain and that I see myself always waisting money on things so my wallet isn't full. And lastly that it uses uPlay.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion it diffently has its spot in your library if your new to the Far Cry series or if your a veteran. At this very time I give the game a 7.5/10. If ubisoft come through and change most of the problems (being) textures, cut scenes. and optimization then heck I would change my rating to 9/10. However at the end of the day it is your choice to make the decession to buy not me. Happy Gaming. IGN 9/10- Went into a heavy guarded fortress and murded everyone with myself and my elephant.","November 22, 2014","true","40.8"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","35","56","0","1"

It neither innovates or changes anything in terms of game play.  With that said it was really up to Ubisoft to give us an ultra polished and killer story, a few new tools to play with and exceptional presentation to sell us what is basically Far Cry 3 on a new map with new characters.  They fail to do this and it's a step backwards in nearly every category from it's predecessor, Far Cry 3.\n\nThe story wasn't all that engaging, lip synching was way off in certain parts during dialogue [Far Cry 3 was stellar, like playing a movie], some things you do don't even make sense/matter/have a point at all [Yogi & Reggie?], none of the characters really tie into one another like they were all written by different people in a silos and outside of a few new welcome events game play is virtually completely recycled content from Far Cry 3, and not even recycled well.  In Far Cry 3 I would cringe going into radio towers, in this it was nothing. That was my experience with nearly everything in this game.  The magic just isn't here.\n\nI don't recommend it to anyone at full price.  Hold off till this is $20 or less.  What you're getting with Far Cry 4 is basically exactly what Blood Dragon did to Far Cry 3 and even that was more entertaining/original then this.  It's a decent enough game on it's own, I guess, but held next to Far Cry 3...  this is rather disappointing.\n\nIf you're starting the Far Cry franchise with this game, you're going to like it.  Do yourself a huge favor though and check out Far Cry 3 afterwards and everything I've said here will make perfect sense.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/recommended/298110/","DeliveryGodNoah","DeliveryGodNoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/","363 products in account","DISCLAIMER: This isn't a proper review. Honestly, this is me venting. Take my "review" with a grain of salt. As a brief overview, this is honestly a good first person shooter plagued by technical issues for many people. (FPS drops, stuttering, graphical glitches)\n\n\nLet me tell you a short story.\nIt begins in 2010. I pick up a game called Far Cry 2 for the PS3.\nI couldn't wait to get home and play it, all the gameplay I saw seemed like the game was THE first person shooter I was missing.\n\nI got home, loaded the game, and was literally blown away. Even in the games sequels, never have I felt like I was IN a video game setting quite like how Far Cry 2 made me feel. The gorgeous lighting combined with the muddy, dusty, rusted textures truly made me feel like I was in a part of Africa. I could almost feel the heat.\n\nGuns jammed, enemies hunted you, and there was this visceral feeling to the combat. I loved walking around feeling like a total badass.\n\nFar Cry 3 was a mostly worthy successor. They removed the "realistic" mechanics of the game in the favor of much more action oriented mechanics, which is all well and good, but while I did really enjoy my time, I didn't have the same feeling of immersion or belonging in the world of Far Cry 3. It was, and sometimes still is, plagued with bizarre bugs and optimization issues. Mostly in areas with a decent amount of NPCs is where the framerate would drop from 60 to about 35 with horrible stuttering like you were constantly jittering your head up and down.\n\nThen pops in Far Cry 4. Again, it basically promised more of Far Cry 3 with refined mechanics and a GORGEOUS setting.\nNo more tropical settings in this game.\nPagan Min is no Vaas, but they are both played by some damn fine voice actors, with some very decent writing.\n\nFar Cry 4 was for the most part exactly what I expected. The gun play was more than functional, even if it was missing a bit of "realistic" flair that was in 2. The story was still a little weak, but story was more of a way of stringing you along rather than being what invested you. Sound was excellent, visuals incredible, make no doubt, this is still a very nice looking game and it plays like some of the better first person shooters you'll play.\nIf my opinion was just left at that, I would stop here and say buy the game. It's well worth it, with plenty of content, side activites, and world to explore. But I can't.\n\nNo, if I recommended the game to you like this, I'd feel guilty.\nSome people will tell you I'm either lying, or I have a potato of a PC, but this game does NOT run well.\nAt first glance, even with a mid-range machine, you might notice 60FPS. Great! Until you start moving. Until you get in a settlement. Until a large amount of combat happens.\n\nThe stuttering issue I mentioned from Far Cry 3 is not only still present here, but tripled in severity. Anything remotely below 60FPS and you will, more than likely, get this headache inducing hitching as you move forward, like you're being shocked as you move. It's hard to explain if you've never experienced it before.\n\nI also upgraded my PC THREE TIMES to run this game. I honestly wanted to play that bad, I love the Far Cry games. But even with a 980ti, a  i7 4770, and 16GB of RAM, in towns I hover at about 50 FPS with the stuttering.\n\nI also still get the infamous driving stutter, which happens almost regardless of frame rate.\n\nTo hit the final nail in the coffin for me, the game of course uses UPlay, which is a literal cancer on my PC. Everytime I boot up UPlay, my computer literally locks up for upwards of ten minutes, and that's if my game even open properly afterwards.\n\nIt sucks so much, because I truly sense that the developers really tried to make a game people would love to play. It looks great, plays great, and seems well put together, but I think it's time to retire that engine.","January 2","false","14.9"," 75 of 132 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","75","132","11","10"

His attitude toward everything was just perfect, it's too bad he didn't get much screen time.\n- Freedom to approach nearly every situation\nWhen you are sent to take an outpost or assassinate a target, you can approach the situation however you want. You could go balls deep with rocket launchers and shot guns or keep to the shadows and take everyone out with your knife and silenced weapons.\n- Awesome open world\nKyrat is a beautiful open world that makes you want to explore every inch of it.\n\nCon:\n- No real/good motivation to continue the main story\nThe biggest thing I didn't like about the game is it gave you little motivation to continue on your quest to free Kyrat. This is a video game. I'm not here to help people; I'm here to blow ♥♥♥♥ up. The only real motivation the game gives you for continuing on the main story line is spread your mother's ashes. For me this isn't real emotional motivation, the game doesn't show or tell you anything about your mother. Maybe if there was a flashback or something where your mother is on her deathbed and, as you watch her die, she tells you she wants her ashes spread in Kyrat. Nothing like that happened in the beginning, but they could have been relying on the curiosity factor to lead you through the game hoping you would try to find out about your parents. The Story writers did an excellent job in Far Cry 3, where the "main" antagonist, Vaas, kills your brother right in front of you (Literally in the first 10 minutes of the game don't ♥♥♥♥♥ about spoilers). This gave the player emotional motivation to kill Vas. I was disappointed and did find myself not wanting to do the main missions.\n\nOverall great game, 8/10","February 10","true","27.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","2"

Gorgeous intricately detailed forests that are pleasant just to watch, I literally spent hours just watching the trees and water. Sometimes when you got a classy angle  in a water cascate you realize that the border between reality and virtuality is already minimal ( yet I believe we can reach perfection).\n\nStory : 78/100 --» This standard is relative. I do , honestly , think that it is somehow a cliché. I think the main protagonist barely has influence in the narrative although the antagonist is ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN A VIDEOGAME. The class of Pagan Min is absolutely brilliant and I do think it is definitely a role model to imitate. I somehow enjoyed the dispute over control in the Golden Path between Sabal and Amita. Unfortanly I do think that the death of Ajay's mother is poorly explored and I do think , sometimes , it is a pretext so that the main narrative ( The territorial dispute over Kyrat ) can be played.\n\nSounds : 93/100 --» The sound design of the game is definitely brilliant and dinamic. I  , in a certain point of the game , was definitely afraid of the jungle as it's power felt enormous due to the energy it's sounds transmited. Absolutely brilliant !\n\nGameplay : 82/100 --» I honestly cannot give a better mark to the gameplay of Far Cry 4 because I already played the other titles of the franchise ( except Primal) and I honestly besides a thing or two it is exactly the same thing. Fine yet it is becoming boring due to the fact that it is always the same thing. One thing for sure, if I never played the other titles of the franchise certainly I would give a better score to it's gameplay.\n\nDue to all of the factors explained above I give an overall evaluation of : 86/100\n","March 13","true","31.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","1"

Far Cry 4 brings back many of the things that were great about 3 and makes some of the annoying aspects of 3 much easier, such as very large open map with "Belltowers" to reveal the map and outposts to liberate to lower the amount of enemies in the open world and most of the inventory/crafting and weaponry is basically a direct port over. The features that separate this from it's predecessor are some nice improvements like a grappling hook, wingsuit almost immediately, autocrafted healing syringes and some interesting side quest lines. The story itself is in all honesty sort of mediocre aside from Pagan Min because his character is honestly quite great, nowhere near Vaas, but still brings that great arrogant sociopathic personality with the dark humour of modern antagonists. With the slightly disappointing story it will point you more towards the open world; which the game excels at both aesthetically and gameplay wise. You'll end up loving just exploring the mountainous territory of forests and meadows, taking over outposts and dealing with the semantics of the wildlife. 7/10","May 30, 2015","true","31.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Several new vehicles and a slightly tweaked combat system allow for a better playing experience. While this may feel like a drawback, in all fairness Ubisoft games are more memorable for their story than the gameplay.\n\nIt’s important to note that the story is not just an improvement over its predecessor but a moral journey in the backdrops of a civil war. The story will explore themes of redemption, the emotional consequences of a broken heart along with the internal conflicts of traditional values vs. modern values. The biggest driving force in the story are the two characters who are in conflict with each other but bound by a sense of duty to an adopted country.\n\nUnlike Jason Brody from the last game, Ajay Ghale is not some annoying brat who acquires combat skills after taking some hallucinogens. Instead he is a man with a troubled past that wants to put his mother to rest while exploring his families heritage.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum is Pagan Min, who seeks to keep control of Kyrat by what ever means necessary. This is a villain that could easily be described as a J-Pop star with the personality and style of the Joker. While he lacks the junkie-style savageness of Vaas Montenegro, he makes up for it with his charismatic charm.\n\nDespite being total opposites, they have this twisted relationship that is very similar to what is shared between Batman and the Joker. A relationship that is best demonstrated in how Min doesn’t taunt or provoke Ghale but instead converses as if they are friends.The common theme that bounds these characters is they have a Western upbringing but have have come to Kyrat for a purpose that evolved into an odyssey to better themselves.\n\nFar Cry 4 preserves everything gamers liked about its predecessor while introducing a more memorable story that is rich in context. While it will feel like a familiar game, the journey will make players explore a new world with many wonders.","May 25","true","38.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's like Tomb Raider with more content and less polish.  Visually it's on par with Tomb Raider, but larger in world size.  Don't buy it for co-op like my wife and I did, you can't just drop in and start playing together, you each have to beat the entire first chapter of the game before you are even given the option.  No thanks.\n\nOpen world can be frustrating because it often leads to, "Now what?".  I don't mind having a ton of unimportant quests littered everywhere as long as the important ones aren't something I have to dig and dig to even find.\n\nLooks beautiful, gameplay is mixed, but I only curse at the game every few hours of gameplay...and I don't often curse at games so bear in mind that this has some REALLY rough edges.\n\nThe game likes to drop you on your face a lot, metaphorically speaking.  Lots of "WTF, why am I dying, what am I supposed to do, why doesn't this work?" moments.  It just drops you in cold rather than introducing you like the developers had heard of a difficulty curve.  Things like climbing out of the ice water onto a dock shouldn't require bouncing in and out of the water while frantically trying to grab onto the dock over and over while you are supposed to be stealthing.  You'll know what I mean when you see this part.  Polish, this game needs lots of polish.  It does work...but oh so roughly.  It is absolutely huge however, so it has a clear emphasis on quantity over quality.\n\nYou can almost hear the conversation during development,\n\n"There is a bit of a problem with this part."\n\n"Is it game breaking?"\n\n"Not completely."\n\n"Does it look amazing graphically?"\n\n"Well yes..."\n\n"Then why are you bothering me with this?"\n\nThis game likes to place you in killboxes too.  Not just ambushes, but areas that provide terrible tactical disadvantage.  Winning a firefight isn't just a game of reflex like a quick draw at high noon, it's about using your environment to your advantage.  Too often however, they forcibly throw away the option for tactics and turn it into a test of your reflexes, but certainly not your brain.  I like the occasional firefight mosh-pit when I choose to rush in, but not when it's the only option that is forced on the player.\n\nThe proof's in the pudding, I'm actually planning to finish this game and have made it quite a ways in.  Can't say that about every game I pick up these days so I'll call this not just a good game, but a great one.  Greatly flawed, but still a great game.\n\n9/10 Would get dropped on face again.\n\nOh wait, UPLAY is down.  I hate UPLAY, it's an app that some idiot suit thought might make Ubisoft more money.  Well actually it's going to make you lose money because I'm changing my review to a thumbs down for that reason alone.  Online play only?  Login to one app then login to a second app (steam launches UPLAY which launches the game...when everything isn't broken)...I'll play this game sometime when it's actually working again.","December 9, 2014","false","76.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"oh I was gonna scatter my mothers ashes but while I'm here I may as well liberate an entire country from Mao Ze Dong in a pink suit." You finish by picking a new leader of the country, then go to the main antagonist (who's been gone for the whole 2-99% of the game) and he basicly says: "What are you looking at I'm not gonna save this ship wreck of a story line."

Gameplay was the strongest part of FC3 in my opinion, though it did pretty good with it's kooky villains and the main character slowly transforming, out of necessity, into a brutal warrior out of a need to survive a harsh environment. So... in the gameplay department, things are more or less the same. And because of that, FC4 already is "good enough" for me to recommend.\n\nAnd yet something was missing. Maybe it was just that the main character didn't seem to have any personality or character growth this time. Maybe it was that the central story conflict which, while interesting, ensured that the ending would be basically bad no matter what. Maybe it was that it was just so damn similar to FC3 and yet... wasn't quite as good.\n\nHonestly I didn't even finish the game properly. Yes I got to the ending, saw the epilogue scene with my chosen jerk leader, shot said leader in the head with a .50 cal sniper rifle after that scene, and saw the secret ending that happens at the start of the game. But I didn't do all the major side-quests, liberate all the outposts, or even get all of the upgrades. I ended up just plowing ahead through the story rather than taking my time to enjoy things. In other words... subconsciously, I wanted to be done with this and cut corners so I would be done relatively quickly.\n\nSo I guess this is actually a "no" recommendation then? Ehh.... Is it a bad game? No, not really. It's just... bland. It has the gameplay that made FC3 great, but it does not have the same sort of story that kept me interested and wanting to see where things went. Yes FC3's second half was pretty bleh in the story department, but it didn't totally go to hell.\n\nFar Cry 4 can be summed up as a "safe" game where it tries to be Far Cry 3 again, but misses some of the key elements that made that game so memorable despite it's flaws. I see myself wanting to play Far Cry 3 again. This... I don't know.\n\nThis would be a "maybe" if Steam had that option, but there isn't. So, honestly? I'm going to have to say "No". Play Far Cry 3 instead. It's better, has more than one save slot, and doesn't feel like a lazy sequel to cash in on a previous games success.\n\nThis game isn't bad. It's just... middling.","January 26","false","25.0"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","1"

It's greatest strength, sheer abundance of insane situations that occur, is also lifted straight from Far Cry 3. They're nearly identical, with all the faults and gameplay nitpicks of 3 being addressed. But for some, this is also FC4s greatest weakness. It's glorified DLC. Ultimately, your purchase is determined by one factor. Do you want more Far Cry!? Thankfully, I did.\n\nStory: Welcome to Kyrat, an ancient Himalayan country torn apart by a civil war between it's despotic self-acclaimed King, Pagan Min; and the Golden Path. You are Ajay Ghale, returning to his barely-remembered homeland. Son of rebel leader Mohan Ghale, you will lead the fight against King Pagan Min, another amazing Far Cry villain. Like Vaas, but with a wry sense of humor, and spiffy pink suit; his unfortunate underutilization is one of the games downsides. We want more Min! Unlike Jason Brody, Ghale has no aversion to killing, no story of callusing. He's a blank paramilitary badass slate, a whiteboard for the player to impose themselves on, doesn't talk much, which is a blessing. Through a fairly intriguing storyline, you will decide the fate of Kyrat and direction of the Golden Path, through a series of choices. Do you save captured soldiers, or leave them to their fate to retrieve intel? Your choice has the illusion of consequence, and it works quite well. I cared about the characters, adored MIn (not so much his lieutenants) and the various moral dilemmas  had me deep in thought for a few minutes. Perfectly satisfactory.\n\nPresentation: Beautiful. Sweeping wooded valleys, soaring mountain vistas, sun tinted water, the forest and steppe environments are breathtaking and gloriously realised with perfect background audio. Birds chirping, water lapping, prayer flags flapping in a swirling breeze. Wildlife from bears to honey badgers stalk their prey and yourself. Himalayan tundras are appropriately desolate and panther filled, this game is awe-inspiring and immersing. A well realised menu theme scatters colorful prayer dust across your settings menu. Supplemented by perfect voice acting, and crisp and shattering gunshots and explosions, the entire package is wrapped up in a exciting dubstep/Nepalese score, truly realising the setting. Welcome to Kyrat, and good luck setting down the controller.\n\nGameplay: See Far Cry 3.\nKidding.\nUtilise a massive suite of weapons, ranging from rapid fire MG42 machine guns, volatile flamethrowers, devastating RPGs, workhorse AK47s to hi-tech Vector 45. ACP submachine guns, roaring magnum revolvers and explosive shotguns. Objective? Hunt animals to upgrade your equipment (3 bear skins= 1 extra weapon holster?). Scavenge herbs to craft health and sensory potions. Mostly, kill the soldiers of Min's Royal Army. Enemy types vary from standard 'duck in cover and spray' infantry, hulking heavy machine gunners with no regards for personal safety, bloodthirsty melee berzerkers, and elite snipers and stealthy hunters of Min's Royal Guard. Enemy AI is capable and brutal, expect calculated assaults and stalwart sieges from Min's troops. Utilize an incredibly realized stealth system, distracting guards, sneakily picking off stragglers with suppressed weapons and bows, and leaping into brutal melee kills and streaks, all without tripping the alarm. Like FC3, 4 has a brilliant and receptive FPS mechanics, firefights are exciting and harrowing, stealth is difficult but ever-so-rewarding. Plus, they finally added vehicle combat. Aside from all the killing, discover the awesome open world of Kyrat, takeover outposts, climb towers (ubisoft...), creep through caves, pursue side quests, etc. It's great. Even more so by the unpredictable nature of the DUNIA engine, firefights are often interrupted by animal attacks, Golden Path reinforcement. I've been hunting deer, and gotten ambushed by a pack of honey badgers, who are fleeing Royal Army soldiers blasting them from vehicle mounted machine guns. Chaos!\n\nTechnical: I'm running a GTX 760 and FX6300, alongside 8GB of RAM. Ran consistently at 60fps, at high and medium alternating settings, with AA on low. If you wanna run this on ultra, 8xAA, HBA0+; expect needing some serious hardware. But, even for mid range PCs, FC4 will run like a charm. It's just as beautiful on medium, I assure you. Occasional glitches pop up, but pop in is minimal, and  textures across the board are superb. This isn't Unity, fear not.\n\nIn conclusion, Far Cry 4 is a rewarding, and downright fun experience. I enjoyed every second of shenanigans, and the story was more than satisfactory. Plus, you can fool around in co-op with a friend! If you enjoyed Far Cry 3, I absolutely recommend Far Cry 4. If you haven't played Far Cry 3, what the hell are you waiting for!?!?\n\nSee you in Kyrat!","February 8, 2015","true","46.5"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","14","22","3","1"

Starting with the story, I find it to be opposite of Far Cry 3, which had a storyline I found amazing as well. While Far Cry 3's strongest part of the storyline was the start, Far Cry 4 starred at the ending, an ending that may not be the same for everybody. As the game progresses there are multiple choices throughout it, unlike most FPS these choices change the storyline in drastic ways. So the story can shape towards what would seem more real to you personally. My only complaint about the story is how there was little sense to the fact that Ajay Ghale entered Kyrat being able to kill and fight at an experienced level, at least in Far Cry 3 they had trained Jason for a little bit and used the Tatao as a reason for his speedy ascent to master killer. But this hole in the story was greatly outshined as the game got better and better as time went. The graphics are most likely the most stunning of the time, sure the animals have some weird looking fur, but I can't blame Ubisoft for experimenting w/ that, other than that the lighting, texturing, and the environment all looked amazing. Finally, the gameplay, which some players accuse of being to similar to Far Cry 3. First of all, that is somewhat true, but why is that a bad thing? I mean I feel as if people expect more from games made by Ubisoft, and in return I feel like they try to pass limits they cannot pass and that is how glitchy games like Unity are born. It is not fair to be fine with multiple GTAs, multiple CODs, multiple battlefields, multiple Halos, and multiple of any game series and then complain that they made one game similar to their previous game that had such amazing gameplay. If Ubisoft had created something so amazing as Far Cry 3, why should they have to change in drastically after only one game? For every other developer adding just a new story and new graphics pleased the players, so why does it now please you when it happens for Far Cry 4? Also thats forgetting the fact that they did add a good amount of new things, such as riding elephants, grappling, gyrocopter, a bunch of new weapons, new takedowns, or new additions to mobility such as being able to shoot out of vehicles or takedown from one vehicle to another. Sure, those all can be considered small changes, but it is a hell of a lot more than most developers add in w/ a sequel. Also, do not forget the open world online Co-Op that they added in, being able to play w/ your friends in Kyrat adds a whole new feeling to the game. Not to mention the amazing map editor and the fact that you can create custom maps, then play with your friends. Reminds you a bit of Halo forge mode that so many people loved? (Sure not as good, but still a nice gesture to the game). Overall, I was verrry pleased with everything this game had to offer, and was dissapointed by the fact that some people found it to not be awe inspiring. 10/10 if you have the money you should buy this game, its worth every cent and more.","February 6, 2015","true","100.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kill_phil/recommended/298110/","kill_phil","kill_phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kill_phil/","327 products in account","The only good game Ubisoft brought us 2014. Have to say that it isn't really something world breaking or really new compared to Far Cry 3, so people who were bored of FC3 should stay away, but the causual shooter fan will like that game.\n\nIt has exceptional weapon gameplay. Every weapon with its strong and weak points. It needs a bit testing to find your perfect loadout and i personally liked that a lot. You have to experiment and there are weapons for every situation you could come in. CQC or long range sniping. The armory has a wide range to offer.\n\nThe graphics are astounding. Like FC3 it is very colorful. Not as much as FC3 but still more than other shooters. It gives the game a more exotic look. On Ultra settings one of the best looking games i played in 2014.\n\nThe game mechanics are great. Yes there are bugs, but only few and none are gamebreaking. The sprint, slide, melee system works really well. The crafting as well. The loot system where you have to loot every single body gets annoying with time, but with time progression you don't need to do it anyway. So i can look over it.\nThe explosions and the overall balistic is great. If you blow up a truck with an RPG you can basically feel the impact of the rocket.\nThe stealth is very intuitive. If enemies spot you or not is measured by many factors and to me it always seemed fair.\n\nThe story is ... meh. It is easy to follow, but it just happens so aprupt. So fast. Here you are on the way to bring back the ashes of your mom to his home country and the next second you are the leader of a civil war. That was clearly to fast. the plot also goes too far away from the ashes and gets more and more to the "we have to free our land from that bad man" attitutde. Which isn't really a bad thing at all, but a bit more emphasis on the whole "why were you here again?" wouldn't have hurt.\n\nThe mission design gets a bit repetitive with the time. Yea i know it is a shooter, but especially most side missions are "kill that" or "collect this" The Main Quests are a bit better there.\nRepetive or not, i never got really bored out of the missions. If you accept what the game is, then you can have a lot of fun with it.\nI don't want to spoil muchm but the main missions and the decision making is very good here. On one hand you have the traditional guy who wants to bring back the old ways of Kyrat and on the other hand you have the gal that wants Kyrat to become more modern. It is just a minor factor, but the ways both sides try to achieve their goals put you into a dilemma. You really have to think about who you pick.\n\nThe characters are pretty good. You have bible reciting gun wielding priest, drug addicts etc. All characters have their little crazyness which makes em good :) People who liked Vas and his insanity will also like Pagan Min. He isn't as crazy and unpredictable as Vaas in FC3 but still well written psychopath.\nThe guy you play is called Ajay and there is where Ubisoft could have done better. Yes it is about decision making and all, but it wouldn't have hurt to give Ajay a bit more personality. In the end Ubisoft just rolled with "you play as him. Play as you like" which isn't really a bad thing, but a bit more personality could have done the trick to get a bit more attached to Ajay.\n\nOne thing i really need to mention. I HATE the hunting. You kill Rhinos, Elephants, Tigers like nothing. Yes they attack you, but it doesn't feel right to me to blow up a Rhino with a RPG. That is a mechanic Ubisoft should reconsider.\n\nOther than that minor thing. I highly recomment the game. It looks beautiful. It works great. There is a ♥♥♥♥ ton to do and with all the side mission and random stuff happening you never get bored. A must for every shooter fan.","February 15, 2015","true","40.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","5"

But they are not bad. The gameplay is well done like in FC3, you can either shot all of your enemies down, or go sneaky beaky like and kill them one by one, hopefully without being noticed by the enemies. The gameplay is very open, you can do whatever you want, as long as you complete your Mission.\n\nGraphics: 20/20\nThe graphics are perfect. It's just awesome to look over the map, it's beautiful. You can take a bunch of beautiful screenshots, if you want to!\n\n\nOverall: 74/100\nThe game is great, you can play it for a long time without getting bored.

It offers graphics that are great, gameplay that's fun without trying anything new or particularly interesting, and a story that (so far) has managed to move the plot ahead and be off-handedly interesting without ever being anything spectacular. It offers enough gameplay to be something that you can come back to for a few hours of fun consistantly, but isn't anything groundbreaking or spectacular.\n\nUnfortunately the huge weakpoint of this game is in the quality of the port. It doesn't support a wide range of aspect ratios, giving you black bars on the top and bottom of your screen, stuttering was a huge issue for me (I've played this on a GTX 750ti and an HD 7950) And the FOV slider doesn't appear when you use certain resolutions. This is a huge issue, as the devs for the game have claimed outright that if your FOV slider is gone, you pirated the game.\n\nIn general, this is a pretty good game with a garbage PC port.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisbi/recommended/298110/","wisbi","Wisbi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisbi/","1109 products in account","So before I'm scorned for writing a negetive review, let me start out by saying, I *LIKE* Far Cry 4. I do in fact recommend it. There are a number of issues though, and most of them actually involve the last game. I normally WOULDN'T review a game based off its predecessor, but since the two are so similar, I feel I have to. So let me break it down: (Note - this review was written while playing on Normal Difficulty.)\n\nThe Good\n-It's literally just more Far Cry 3. I LOVED FC3, it's certainly my FPS of the Year for 2012.\n-New setting, mountains and snow, things we've never really seen in previous Far Cry games, and the scenery is beautiful.\n-You can get the wingsuit super early on, which really helps with the new mountainous terrain.\n-THE GRAPPLING HOOK.\n-The climbing with said grappling hook is actually pretty fun, even if you're limited to certain 'grapple locations' like we're playing Metroid or something. Though I can understand the addition of this limitation.\n-Actuall throwing knife weapon to fit in your throwable slot. Even if they're not that great, it's a nice touch.\n-Gyro. Coptor.\nYou can ride elephants!\n-Lots of guns that actually succeed in feeling somewhat different from eachother.\n-THE VECTOR. Yes, it's now an actual base weapon.\n-The bow's back and comes with seperate models. (The second being a straight-up upgrade, sadly.)\n-CROSSBOW PISTOL.\n-There's a harpoon gun??? (I've yet to see one but there apparently is?)\n-Revelations 19:11.\n-The 1911.\n-No seriously, the 1911.\n-You get an actual house this time and can upgrade it. It's not too in depth and feels pretty experimental, but I like the direction.\n-First Far Cry with actual connections to the last game.\n-Super secret ending.\n-"GOOD PEOPLE OF THE IMPERIAL CITY. WELCOME. TO THE ARENA."\n-(There's an arena.)\n\nThe Meh\n-The area feels super cramped, with short distances between settlements and outposts with very well traveled roads, probably adds the most 'civilized' feel to any location we've yet to visit.\n-The new hunter enemy is kinda cool, though his gimmick feels like it's literally just to be annoying.\n-The effect of pure eyesore the game flashes at you when you capture an enemy structure(s).\n-Ajay feels like a less developed (and honestly less interesting) character than Jason.\n-World's full of side quests and collectables like FC3. Your call if that's good or bad.\n-Zero effert into making up new factions. (It's seriously just the same two from the last game.)\n-Zero effert into making up a new bad guy. (Crazy guy heading an army of color-coded badies.)\n-I'm pretty sure Ubisoft just wants to make a game about drug trips by this point.\n\nThe Bad\n-It's literally just more Far Cry 3. Again, I LOVED 3, but this game is seriously just a 60 dollar expansion pack.\n-For some reason, the weapon menu starts to lag out the more time you spend in it.\n-Unnaturally glitchy terrain. Frequently lose half your health on fall damage from jumping across a gap in the sidewalk.\n-The wingsuit mechanics are just as jank as they were in FC3. So if you didn't like it then, you won't like it now.\n-Parachute still can't be deployed unless you've deployed the wingsuit.\n-The parachute mechanic is still wonky as hell, causing you to take random fall damage even on successful deployes/landings and causing you to die from scraping mountain sides. And considering the entire game is mountains this time...\n-Animals in cages will glitch and growl/roar/scream over and over and will NOT shut up.\n-You literally can't walk three feet without being attacked by some form of wildlife.\n-I feel I should reitterate, literally three feet. While trying to scope out outposts, I've been attacked by animals while doing so about 7 times now. Bears, wild dogs, wolves, a leopard, and so many eagles...\n-EAGLES.\n-Like FC3, animals are angry, fearless, and indestructable, with an insatiable taste for human blood.\n-Even if you think water is safe to jump into, the demon fish will appear and find you. They'll always find you.\n-Enemies all twitch like they've just shot up crack moments prior to your encounter.\n-Enemies will sometime glitch out of your arrow's trajectory mid-shot like I really am playing Skyrim with guns.\n-Enemies are f**king psychic. If you fire and miss one, even using a silenced weapon, they will ALL. INSTANTLY. Know where it came from.\n-Visual detection feels 10x more jank than FC3. Trees do nothing to stop their vision, bushes seem to work only about 75% of the time, and 1/10 times an enemy starts detecting you, he'll do so instantly.\n-Trying to melee enemies in open fighting. Have fun trading blows and making the mandatory sacrifice of 2 health slots.\n-Even at max health cap with all damage perks and full body armor, you're still done in 3 shots.\n-Enemies as tough as you are, reinforce stealth game play, but the stealth doesn't feel as up to snuff to pull it off.\n-We're still stuck on this "you can heal via this time consuming animation that you can't sprint from danger while doing and only really succeed in prolonging your death as you make your way to cover, attempting to navigate terrain through this damage-blurred screen while being constantly shot" mindset FC2 established and 3 did little to improve on.\n-Like FC3, you can't do said animation to heal 1-2 bars of health. You MUST waste a syringe to heal if you have one on hand.\n-All land vehicles handle like they don't have tires.\n-Ubisoft promised open world co-op. All we got was dissappointment.\n-You can't do missions in co-op and venturing out from your partner a certain distance teleports one of you to the other. An obvious left over from the console version.\n-Playing co-op means dealing with UPLAY.\n-UPLAY.\n\nOverally, I have actually liked the game so far minus a few hiccups. Now the reason I don't recommend it is, I find Far Cry 3 an overall better game. If you feel keen on playing one, just go play it insted, you won't be missing much. And I assure you it'll be worth the time when  you do.","January 5","false","43.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Repetitive gameplay, and perks that I don't necessarily want. Irritating controls, and a great lack of PC functionality. This is truly a console game at best. Never before have I had such a nightmare with mouse configuration, and in an FPS game that is something important.\n\nBesides mouse difficulties, this game has a boatload of other issues.\nFor some AWFUL reason, my game is capped at 30 FPS - even though I have ample VRAM and a capable GPU.\nAnd for those of you who might think that this problem is beacause I have a low end PC, I will tell you that I still see this framerate cap with low settings and the lowest resolution; I cannot figure out this issue.\nEvery time I look at the 30 FPS my eyes bleed. Now 30 FPS alone is not too great, but it is bearable. Sadly, Far Cry 4 stutters beyond reason, so the 30 FPS hardly looks it.\n\nThe gameplay is rather boring. Aside from the few unique little missions, where you may end up in an interesting situation, liberating outposts over and over again is not my idea of fun. However, that is something common in Far Cry games, so you can't expect anything else.\n\nI was looking forward to this releasequite a bit, and now having played it I am sorely let down.\nIf you want to enjoy Far Cry 4, then buy it with LOW expectations, and maybe you won't have such a bad time.\nOr be smart and don't give Ubisoft your money.","November 23, 2014","false","2.2"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","22","38","0","2"

The fourth installment of the Far Cry series ditches backstory in favor of plopping you down in a massively vertical mountain environment, knifing bandits, killing animals and people with a bow, and ambushing enemy strongholds with C4.  Maybe that's what really matters.\nIn the end, Far Cry 4 is worth playing if you loved the tagging, bagging, knife throw takedowning, and .50 caliber sniper rifling of Far Cry 3 but with more mountains and these cute little choppers you can drop grenades on rhinos from.

Lets hit the basics:\nGraphics are demanding but outstanding.\nSound, well once you turn off the music you can hear a bit more. But overall good so far.\nStoryline is there and slowly unfolding as I play, not too fast and doesnt feel like it will take forever to complete.\nAI is very well. I shoot a guy throwing a molotov and he bursts into flames. They seem very dedicated at following you and trying to catch you on fire.\nWorld is open world and I have caught myself saying, man thats cool a few times. When you jump into your vehicle and follow a person that out of know where gets rammed by a rhino....thats part of the cool factor you look for.\nAnd how about this, since they allow you to fire from your vehicle with sidearms they have coded in a autopilot for most the roads. So you can focus on the gas pedal and the trigger. Easily to turn on and off.\n\nAre there bugs? Yes. Over populated with them? No.\nThis game is playable and enjoyable.\n\nIn the end, my only complaint is alot of the simple details got dragged over from far cry 3. Not a terrible thing, but there was room to improve it.

It could do a lot to improve the game, but instead it only adds a thin layer on top of it.  Some of the characters around you are funny, and it seems to be a bit better at creating characters I find interesting, rather then being surrounded by mopy emo people... for the most part.  It trys a little too hard though sometimes and instead delivers more hollywood characters then people I'd believe to be in a setting.  It might be a little too critical.  Also it has half the map locked away until you progress through half of the quests.\n\nPeople also say the wild life is really super duper hard, and the bases are punishing, but they never really seemed like much of a challenge to me.  Bow + arrow + range & highground = undetected win on compounds (even the strongholds,) and the wildlife seem to just have more HP.  The rhinos are a bit hard and take a lot of punishment when you first go up against them, but after you realize how the AI works and how you can work around their attacks they become just as easy as everything else.\n\nNow to the fun stuff.  It's a hell of a lot of fun doing co-op with another friend.  I was laughing almost the whole time as we did silly fun things.  It's the kind of co-op Farcry 3 should have had.  Take the map, take all the sub quests (not the main ones sadly) and have at with a friend.  It's a hell of a lot of fun.  What would make it better?  If the game basically did what diablo 2 did when adding another person into the mix.  Make more enemies spawn or make them harder, because in the end having a second player just makes opening up the map, or taking out outposts/strongholds easier.\n\nHowever the fun isn't in the challenge it's in doing dumb stuff, and crashing in weird ways and killing both of you by maybe panicking and firing a rocket launcher at your feet.  It also opens up more dialogue from a character called Hurk, who is the character the person joining into the game will be.  Who is like the main character, but funny, has really great lines, and...... well..... really would have been more fun if he was the main character instead of the bumbling, want to help, coy Rambo mic kill everything.  Which is weird because why would Rambo be coy?\n\nThe single player campaign is nothing to write home about.  It's basically Farcry 3, and there is some nudity in the game but it doesn't really add much to the game other then "and then there were more painted boobies... and a very very very brief shot of your characters crotch," as opposed to when Farcry 3 used it to make a powerful statement.  So basically just expect more Farcry 3.  Yet when I played it with a friend and laughed for hours, and hours.\n\nWhat does the game need?  In co-op I'd love it if I could just explore the whole entirety of everything on the games map instead of being restricted to half of the playing field because I didn't progress through the whole story.  Then allow me to reset the map so we can take those outposts all over again.  Also when outposts get attacked and I just walk away?  I should probably have to retake them instead of nothing happening which takes away from the tension of the event.  Maybe I don't want to save the outpost?  Maybe I want to go and bow the crap out of the guards who retook it?  Ever think of that Farcry4?  Anyways it's a solid game and I'd say play away.  It will be fun, but when you co-op that is when the game will really shine.","November 23, 2014","true","38.5"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

If you're into stealth-first open world shooters, this is it.\n\nI'm marking this as not recommended game because of the single save slot. This is a stupid "feature" at best as it accomplishes nothing good and potentially lots bad. You can often work around these by backing up your save files independently of the game, but why do I need to do that? Again, there's no advantage, no sense of "fairness", etc. There's really no death penalty in the game, so there's nothing that a single save file does for game play.\n\nWhat a single save file does in a long open world campaign is leave you at risk for corruption. This is particularly bad in this game because they've got a bug that will completely end your campaign that occurs at the very end of one mission just as you transition to a new area in game. I was 40 hours into the game (I tend to do many of the side activities before advancing the campaign missions) when I was bit by this. Many others have been bitten.\n\nIt would be an annoyance if you had multiple saves available. But with a single save AND the fact that it executes that save for you at various points means they built a game designed to have a lot of people abandoning it because they have no desire to repeat the grindier bits in the game.\n\nBack up your files independently and frequently, especially before the "Willis" missions.\n\nSingle save is built for a world where there are no bugs. That's not the world we live in.\n\nI am also marking this not recommended because Ubi forces you to sign into another system in order to play the game.

The visuals, mixed with all of NVIDIA's signature GPU effects(fur, new shaders, etc..) give Far Cry 4 the best visuals of any game I've played(all Assassin's Creed games including Unity, Shadows of Mordor, BF4, and the list goes on).

The story itself is bland and barely worth paying attention to.

Everything from the skill levelling through to liberating outposts and even switching towers to reveal the map, are all present and correct. So does that mean it's just a big, fat con and totally not worth the money?\n\nWell... no. I love the Far Cry series and 3 was brilliant. That Ubisoft have pretty much shrugged and said 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' is entirely understandable. That they charge full price for it is kind of a low blow, but it's still worth every penny. The game plays smoothly (had to knock graphics down from high to make it smoother on my very mid-range PC) and there is some scenery pop-up, but the game is still beautiful. You get to the top of a peak, survey the land from your feet to the horizon and can go anywhere, anytime, in anything, for any reason. Get bored with the main story? Do a side quest. Get bored with the side quests? Take an outpost and then reset it (nice!) to do it better. Bored with that and want to drive a truck off a cliff, bail out as it plummets, deploy your wingsuit, fly down above an outpost, pull the parachute and drift to the ground taking potshots at the guards with your pistol? Yep, you can do that too.\n\nIn addition, the core gameplay has a few more bells and whistles too. Auto-drive allows you to sit back and relax, take in the views and all that good stuff while the games does the driving. It'll also take the wheel while you focus on shooting. Few things more satisfying than haring off in hot pursuit of someone, getting close and flicking to autodrive while you wait for the perfect head-shot.\nAlso worth a mention is the gyro-copter which is just so much fun to zip around in, as well as the rippling wave of explosions from firing a mortar, the far less gullible AI and charging around on elephant because, well, why not?\n\nIt's just FC3 with another 10-20% of 'stuff' thrown into the mix, but on every level of the game. Vehicles, enemies, weapons, missions, side-quests, story, Hurk, places, people, plot and on and on. Evolution not revolution is the order of the day here and I'm glad of it. Add in the 'worth the price of admission alone' map-maker (I've spent hours just playing around in that on past FC games) and there's arguably way more value in this than Call of Duty: Rinse & Repeat 7 or whatever.\nIt's a wonderful game with a decent (so far) story, some fine voice casting and a warped sense of humor.\n\nLove it.","November 18, 2014","true","122.2"," 58 of 109 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","58","109","0","2"

The graphics are just ok, the combat is just ok, the story is just ok.\n\nUnfortunately, while it does nothing really well, it does quite a few things poorly: Cutscenes are unskippable, and if you fail or die on a mission you'll have to repeat them. AI (human and animal) is hilariously bad. Random karma events are annoying. The first hang-glider you get in the starting town is placed such that it unavoidably hits a tree immediately upon launch. Press and hold "e" to do do anything, then lose control and wait through an overly dramatic 2-3 second animation to complete before regaining control. This was so irritating that, once when the game skipped these animations because there was not enough room, I was really unbelievably happy. Grappling and climbing can only be done in predefined positions, all of which are very conveniently located and are all indicated by the same pile of very convenient ropes. This makes scaling towers so tedious that it's much more fun to just land a helicopter inside the top of the tower. You can do that of course, because the rotor hit detection is virtually non-existant.  Carefully aimed sniper bullets and arrows sometimes go right through a target without any explanation, while other times, enemies will die after spraying bullets vaugely in their direction. Graphics are nothing special - flying over mountain vistas should elicit some sense of awe. Instead you just realise how low res the heightmap and terrain textures are, and how out of place the static rock and mountain assets look. Despite a relatively beefy system, LOD pop-in happens all the time. What makes this worse is that it is implemented by fading in high-poly models with this weird dissolving effect. Unfortunately it happens so often and at such short distances that it's just annoying.\n\nGood things: Big game hunting endangered animals with a mounted machine gun so I can use their skins to make a new wallet.

Let's find out!\nAs a previous Far Cry player, Far Cry 4 blew my mind. I'm the sandbox-type 'a guy, and I had a lot of fun playing this game.\nSince I haven't really gotten into the story very much yet, I'll leave that part out. Anyways, it's a Ubisoft game, as expected the mechanics... mostly stayed the same... but that's okay, it's a pretty solid engine!\n\nWhether you're out hunting random animals to forfill your crafting dreams, conquering towers, exploring the map, driving around - it gets hardly boring... surprisingly! I found myself just driving around the map for a few hours, hunting animals, rescuing random people, running into random quests... it somewhat reminded me of the Elder Scrolls Series, which is surprising for me as TES is one of my all time favorite series.\n\nA lot of customization is behind the glorious world of Kyrat, for you to make your perfect adventure, combat or hunting kits. I was in love with the animal AI, as well as obviously the graphics! I heard alot about performance issues, but fortunately I never experienced anything like that (I will list my specs below)! I was very satisfied with the game, and definetely recommend it.\n\n\n9/10\n\nOriginally posted by ysarts (Specs):GTX 980\ni7 4790k @ 3,9ghz\n32GB Vengeance RAM\nCooler Master V8\n120GB SSD + 3TB ext.","November 7, 2015","true","27.1"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","16","28","3","0"

I really truly wish there was some sort of 'refund' option with PC games. It's such a shame too because ultimately there's a good game somewhere in here.\n\nThe main issue is this being poorly optimized for PC. There are visual glitches and bugs galore. I've only played this for about 6 hours so far and can say that the majority of this time was spent trying to get the visuals to work properly so that I can actually see what I'm doing in the game. So far here are the issues I've personally run into on my current gaming rig with the latest drivers and having tested this game on all the different settings:\n\n- Missing Textures\nStraight out of the gate, as soon as I made my way outside into the (supposedly) beautiful outdoors, there are missing textures, painting parts of the ground black. Reloading the save made these textures come back, only to find some others disappear later.\n\n- Black Shadows\nThis is meant to be an HBAO+ issue with SLI setups. However I don't have an SLI setup. Changing the setting to SSAO doesn't fix this problem. It might for some people, but not here. At first I thought this must be an issue with the colour - maybe I needed to down the contrast and up the brightness? Not the case. Not sure what's causing this. At night time the game it is unplayable - you cannot see anything except for the silhouette of the tops of trees, the sky and the mountains.\n\n- Pixelated close-up shadows on all settings\nNot sure why this is happening but the shadows do appear very pixelated on characters faces on all settings in cutscenes.\n\n- Dark sky\nMaybe this is the way the game is supposed to look, but I doubt it. The sky is a very dark blue, making the surrounding mountains and clouds appear very light in contrast during daytime and night time - which isn't a big deal. But it does appear quite strange and looks nothing like the screenshots of the ps4 and xbox one versions.\n\n- Water reflections turn purple.\nAgain must be a missing texture problem.\n\nThere's more issues I can list on here but I'm sure you get the general idea.\n\nThis isn't a bad game. Most of these issues are not reflective of the gameplay or what is in here content-wise. And maybe there are people out there who won't mind these issues. But when you're paying the same amount of money for a PC version of a game (or in the case of us here in Australia, MORE money) which turns out to be an inferior version... the logical conclusion is don't spend your money on this game.\n\nWait until all of this gets ironed out in patches and drivers updates if you really want to play this on PC.

Quite an amazing game and not without distinct similarities to FC3 but, being part of a franchise that is to be expected. Definitely one well worth playing.\n\nAlthough I believe there are quick ways to complete the game, it took me some 80+hrs as I wanted to achieve and experience as much as possible the first time through. You are able to linger with endless side missions and activities and be entertained for hours on end and simply take in the scenery, which is limitless.\n\nThe player is introduced to numerous new and I must say somewhat strange animals and will be constantly taken by surprise. An early experience I had was while simply trying to find my way around I was hit from behind and my screen was showing streaks of blood and all you heard was grunting and the thumping of the ground! Manageing to get away and turn round I saw a 'Rhino' heading directly at me and before I could take stock of the situation.......I was dead!!!!\nIn the early parts you have nothing on board to stop one of these and as you need them for upgrades, it's best if you take them on later.\n\nBe prepared to 'Bitten' and 'Clawed' or' Stomped On' by every imagional creature possible from in front, behind, above and below as you can never relax. Oh, did I leave off being shot at constantly and/or run over (even by friendlies)!\n\nThings I did not particularly like is the reference and use of 'Drugs' once again, I see no need and I did not particularly like the missions associated. I must admit I did form a sort of warped sense of warmth towards 'Yogi and Reggie'...........Well, they are two dopeheads that really are harmless enough I guess but every mission you do for them can only be done after you have been doped to the eyeballs. The fact that I totally dissagree with any sort of 'Recreational Drugs' doesn't help, completely unnecessary considering the amount of other things you can do in the normal course of gameplay.\n\nGraphics are great, money is easy to accumulate (maybe even too easy), vehicles are mostly as per you would expect with the great introduction of riding elephants and using them to go into battle is a stroke of genious. But the best of all is the 'Buzzer', a small helicopter, gyrocopter, call it what you want. You can fly it almost anywhere and even engage bad guys from the air as well. Not only that you can sit back and enjoy the ride and the scenery....Beware of flying too high!\n\nGameplay is a little crazy, by that I mean you don't really have a plan to follow or instructions of where to go or when to do it. This is intentional in as much as there are (4) different endings dependent on how you go about missions and which individuals you chose to support whilst performing said missions. The question....."What do I do now"? Is one you will ask yourself often, I guess the more times you play, the simpler this will get. (Doesn't matter just keep doing what you want).\n\nThe endings (bear in mind I have only completed once), well certainly the one I chose left me wanting. The word 'FIN' appeared and I said to myself...."Is that it'? For the first time (that I have seen anyway), is an option you have to 'Skip' the credits and I can only say that this is a good option. Then though, you appear back in the game as if nothing has ended at all, I went everywhere looking for something I missed but no, that was it! I now have re-activated the outposts and am going through them one by one. Next move will be to buy and download the 'DLC's' and start again.\n\nThis is a great game and I would rate it 8.5/10 and excellent value for money.\n\nCheck out my screenshots for an idea of what to expect.....Happy gaming.","February 3, 2015","true","263.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

I think if I played this first I would have liked it alot more and would have likely completed it. It's a beutiful game but way too repetative for my liking.\n\nAlso I don't like that the Multiplayer wasn't very well supported. Getting into matches took too long and there were very few people playing. I would have liked to have bots to play agains if anything. I know that's not the point of a multiplayer, but atleast you can get familiar with the maps while you wait for real players to join. Half the time people didn't know what the hell they were doing and were just goofing off, so it just wasn't fun and only tried it a few times.

Nvidia gameworks kills GPU performance, even on Nvidia's older GPUs and AMD's GPUs prior to GCN 1.2. Hilariously, the Tonga-based AMD Radeon HD 285 performs better than the older, more powerful R9 290 in some presets ( as it has better tesselation performance that Nvidia Gameworks relies on at trashing it's competition).\n3.

The storyline is not quite as strong, but it might have been irritating to go through the same routine as Jason Brody. Some of the side weapons like bows, the wingsuit, C4, and proximity mines, are a lot more fun to use than the basic assault weaponry. The game even does proper stealth where a far-off explosion does not give the enemies full knowledge of your position, and just leaves them confused and searching. Be careful about simply going with the easiest weaponry (you can get a lot done with just a handheld grenade launcher and a helicopter) as you may quickly bore yourself. Go the challenging route!\n\nCo-op is a great addition, although the netcode is not often perfect. Be careful about using explosive arrows while in a co-op session - I encountered a glitch where switching to your explosive arrows causes one to automatically be taken from your extras (so switching back and forth causes arrows to disappear into nowhere)","November 29, 2015","true","51.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It was not what Ubisoft had promised or led us to believe. 1. They said you could explore the himalayas but the only time you can do that is in some of the campaign missions. 2. In another one of the trailers they were showing off a fortress and it looked good, but in game the outside of the fortress was completely different than trailer. (it looked crap in comparison.)  3. They also said that there was going to be things like rockslides, avalanches, ect, when the only one I saw was at the beginning of the game that was scripted to happen. 4. There are so many mulitplayer bugs, I couldn't mention all of them, but it's somewhat playable. Overall the game is decent, but there was a lot of false advertising.

The story is lackluster especially compared to the previous entry in the series, and the characters a lot less interesting. Open world co-op makes an appearance but I do miss the FC3 L4D-esque co-op missions. The optimization is not nearly as good as the previous game, too.

Despite having many friend message me saying "why the ♥♥♥♥ are you playing this ♥♥♥♥?" and things similar to that I found the experience pretty enjoyable. The story itself is somewhat boring so I found it to be better to just cause as much mayhem and chaos as possible. It did bother me when I couldn't do certain things in the game without completing the boring story but powering through it isnt that bad. But the story may seem cool when you think of it in the perspective of your character being a total badass who started a revolution in some awful 3rd world country all by himself. The side activities are somewhat short but it's more enjoyable when you're doing it with your friend... Well, when you're not being disconnected from your friend. Just to make sure this review does not drag on, Farcry 4 has it's memorable moments but when the game is over it all feels so short lived so try to make the most of each moment.

(Yes, I'm a Far Cry fan boy)\n\nPros:\n-Just like Far Cry 3\n-The guns have been improved with some new and welcome ones\n-The story, while not being as tense as Far Cry 3's was wonderful\n-Troy Baker's voice (Pagan Min, he also plays Joel in the Last of Us, the Joker in Batman games, and plenty other roles)\n-The world is a lot more alive with more activities to complete (A completionist's paradise)\n-RIDABLE ELEPHANTS\n-The challenge it offers at certain parts of the game (I personally played and beat FC4 on Normal)\n-The characters are well-voice acted, well lip-synced, and have all very unique personalities\n-The choices in the main game allow you to follow Sabal or Amita's decisions (I went all out Sabal)\n-The Arena, an interesting place where players can fight animals and the Royal Army\n-CO-OP (#1 Most Requested Feature) IS FINALLY HERE! THIS IS A BIG SELLING POINT!\n-OPEN-WORLD\n-The gadgets, like the Grappling Hook and Ziplines\n-Fortresses (and Outposts), which are like Outposts but a LOT HARDER\n-Continued support and missions via the Season Pass, which promises 2 more campaigns along with a few Day 1 bonus missions\n-The environment is BEAUTIFUL and detailed\n-The LONG Campaign. It took me about 20 hours to beat it, so I'd average 16-24 hours depending on difficulty. That's a LONG campaign. (Compared to Call of Duty)\n-Keys of Kyrat. While only avaliable on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, it gives you 10 keys to invite a friend into a Co-op game even if he doesn't own the game. It lasts 2 hours per key and you can kick the other person out whenever you want. (MUAHAHAHAHA)\n-Battles of Kyrat. The "Multiplayer" mode of this game. It adds some cool gamemodes, like Outpost, where a team defends an outpost while the other attacks. Demon's Mask, which is like a Capture the Flag, and Propaganda. Also, the Teams are a LOT different. One of them are the Golden Path. They have wepaons, vehicles, and mortars. The other, Pagan's Special Forces, which use Teleportation, Bows and Arrows, and even SPAWNING IN EAGLES, BEARS, AND TIGERS. They also use Elephants as their main vehicle of transport.\n\nCons:\n-Lag if you don't have a (Educated guess) GeForce GTX 780+ (So I recommend it for consoles due to reliability and framerate)\n-No promised "Blood Dragon" like DLC, but the 2 promised Campaigns make up for it\n-When it ends. ;(\n\nRating:\n10/10\nFar Cry Fan Boys (Like me):\n9000/10\n\nIt's EASILY worth the $60.00 price tag, heck, even the $120.00 one of the Kyrat Edition, which I'm planning to buy for the PS4.","November 22, 2014","true","40.1"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","25","47","0","9"

Steam loads the game. What a wonderful age we live in, right?\n\nFar Cry 4 (or Far Cry 3.5) is a game where you... where you... hmmm... You know, I can't quite remember what your goal is in this game, the story was frankly completely forgettable. All I remember is you play as a cardboard cutout of a character and you need to go to an island to dump your mum's ashes on a mountain. You get stopped by a man who looks like he should be a judge on one of those reality shows where they critique a celebrity's dancing skills but is also a psychopath (so exactly like one of them), he knows your mum, he wants to show you where to spread her ashes, but you ♥♥♥♥ off before dessert is served only to be accosted by two Indian fashion models who for some reason you do whatever they want without question.\n\nThe protagonist (let's call him Ajay Ghale, to give him a bit of personality out of pity) does whatever he's told by whoever wants him to do something, like some kind of super limber, super deadly automaton that disregards every law of Asimov's robotics. You kill people, drive, climb, wingsuit (which this time you just buy from any shop, which kind of takes away the reward factor), get attacked by eagles who've noticed that you haven't used a healing syringe in a while so they kindly take away two bars of health, on your quest to overthrow the flamboyant dictator who rules this island, because... you have to? Seriously, Ajay has no horse in this race, he could just not get involved with all this conflict, but for some reason he does, and there's no motivation to it whatsoever.\n\nAnyway, you get to ride an elephant, which is pretty sweet (it reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work), and Hurk is a beacon of personality in this otherwise wooden world. I played co-op with Gary and he was crap, so I sent some incriminating pics to his workplace to get him fired. It worked. You can't do any main missions because... reasons. But you can take over outposts, do side missions, and both get mauled to death by honeybadgers.\n\nIt will be the last UbiSoft game I get in a while though, because my contempt for them as a PC gamer is now greater than their contempt for me (and others).","February 14, 2015","true","45.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The story tastes like cardboard, with a blank-slate protagonist with absolutely no character (as opposed to Brodie, from FC3, who had a wonderful character arc balancing simultaneously blossoming strength and psychopathy), and tone that jumps madly about between serious and silly (rather than managing to combine the two, as FC3 did).\nHunting has been UTTERLY RUINED. You go to the spawn area for the animal, throw some bait, and literally 2 seconds later, the animal shows up to eat it, and you shoot it from the perfect safety of your vehicle mounted machine gun. No fun left in it at all.\nEvents and animal attacks are constant to the point of being incredibly tiresome. You can't travel even a short distance without a karma event popping up - save this guy, kill that guy - and there's not that many, so the same ones keep on coming up. It's often quite hard to stealth attack a base because random animal encounters are so frequent that you'll be trying to silently snipe someone and be attacked by yet another bloody honey badger or pack of dogs. And eagles? Don't even get me started.\nMaybe if you've got an extremely bad case of ADHD and can't stand a single moment without something attacking you or needing to be attacked, you might find this an improvement on FC3.","November 28, 2014","false","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you so much as touch the game while loading up through the gratuitous loading advertisements, it will CTD.

Jason Brody at least has to save his spoiled friends from being sold into slavery, and skirts the line between hero and crazed homocidal maniac.\n\nI also remember that I've been spoiled by Ziggy's Mod in FC3. To log into FC4 and see the ugly HUD and unrealistic gun limitations (really, I can only have a silencer OR a scope? Once I put on one of these the other doesn't work?

Wait until Ziggy or someone else drops a mod for this game and then play it. Hopefully in a few months the stability and Uplay integration will be sorted out.\n\nDry story. Lame gun limitations. Ubisoft--a swing and a miss.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThe game randomly CTDs, is always the top window, preventing you from tabbing out to use other programs, and uplay is of course buggy as all hell.

Steam loads the game. What a wonderful age we live in, right?\n\nFar Cry 4 (or Far Cry 3.5) is a game where you... where you... hmmm... You know, I can't quite remember what your goal is in this game, the story was frankly completely forgettable. All I remember is you play as a cardboard cutout of a character and you need to go to an island to dump your mum's ashes on a mountain. You get stopped by a man who looks like he should be a judge on one of those reality shows where they critique a celebrity's dancing skills but is also a psychopath (so exactly like one of them), he knows your mum, he wants to show you where to spread her ashes, but you ♥♥♥♥ off before dessert is served only to be accosted by two Indian fashion models who for some reason you do whatever they want without question.\n\nThe protagonist (let's call him Ajay Ghale, to give him a bit of personality out of pity) does whatever he's told by whoever wants him to do something, like some kind of super limber, super deadly automaton that disregards every law of Asimov's robotics. You kill people, drive, climb, wingsuit (which this time you just buy from any shop, which kind of takes away the reward factor), get attacked by eagles who've noticed that you haven't used a healing syringe in a while so they kindly take away two bars of health, on your quest to overthrow the flamboyant dictator who rules this island, because... you have to? Seriously, Ajay has no horse in this race, he could just not get involved with all this conflict, but for some reason he does, and there's no motivation to it whatsoever.\n\nAnyway, you get to ride an elephant, which is pretty sweet (it reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work), and Hurk is a beacon of personality in this otherwise wooden world. I played co-op with Gary and he was crap, so I sent some incriminating pics to his workplace to get him fired. It worked. You can't do any main missions because... reasons. But you can take over outposts, do side missions, and both get mauled to death by honeybadgers.\n\nIt will be the last UbiSoft game I get in a while though, because my contempt for them as a PC gamer is now greater than their contempt for me (and others).","February 14, 2015","true","45.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I can run medium to high settings at around 25-30 FPS using the X51 i3 by Alienware but ultra you tend to get some lag. The new nvidia graphic make this game look just great as well. I bought this game upon release and wanted to wait for all the DLC to be released before I typed this review. Let's start with the campaign. The story line was not as good as FC3 but was still good in my opinion. I only played though the campaign once and only plan on doing it once. It was long and the cut scenes could not be passed. You had no choice but to watch witch I hate to do while gameing. You can take different paths while playing the side of the golden path. You have a dude and a chick, the chick wants to defeat the royal army by anymeans and the dude want to defeat them by playing by the rules and doing the right thing. These two different views crash together and you are left to pick a side on the side you are already fighting for. I helped Amita out more in hopes she would give some ♥♥♥♥♥ to AJ But that selfish ♥♥♥♥♥ only thought of her self. O ya and I killed Min at the end also. I could not wait to kill his gay ♥♥♥. You also have a whole host of side missions from hunting to delivering good to the golden path. The arena mode is really fun too. Endless waves of animals and troops give you somthing els to do. Ever since the first FC I have been hoping for a helicopter to fly around in and three titles later I finally got it.....the buzzer woopty ♥♥♥♥♥ doo. This thing suck cant fly to the top of a mountain for ♥♥♥♥. The multi player was ok nothing great but it has it's moments. you choose a merc or a supernatural hunter that has the ability to call upon animals and magic. Since the hunters only get a bow but have invisibility when crouched the mercs get all the guns and the gamepay can get pretty fun. Escape from Durgesh DLC was good I am currently in the top 500 and wanting more. The valley Of the Yetis was the last of the DLC and not as good as Blood dragon but another great game in its self. Killing yetis is a blast. My favorite part of the game is and always will be the map editor. Creating maps is what I do best ;) 9/10","March 30, 2015","true","264.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(There are 2 parts of the map, the second part you will unlock by completing main missions. It´s still so huge)\n+ The content .... There is much things you can to do, craft, hunt ouposts or some higher fortresses, hunt animals for skins you need to craft some upgrades for you guns, inventory, ammo, etc. side missions, secrets where you can find some good stuff - money! much money!\n+ The coop - you can play this game in coop you and your friend so max 2 players, but it´s still ton of fun... Warning: in Coop mode you can´t play main story, just some side missions or hunt more difficult outposts (fortresses). So don´t buy it, if you want play this game only in coop. But still there is much to do with your friend!\n+ The editor ( Same choice to create your own map like in FC 3)\n+ Optimization - for my first 16 hours I still didn´t noticed some larger drops of fps. In some areas i got FPS drop under 60, but it was still very well playable! Everything Ultra almost 70 - 80 fps with my Gtx 970 + I5 6400 8 GB ram DDR3.\n\n\nCon:\nWhy con instead of cons? Because there is just one.....\n- Ye it´s Uplay, usually happens to me if i want play the game, it is still sending message to me, your acc is blocked for 10 minutes for repeatedly bad login even though i wasn´t try to log in there... So WTF UBISOFT, Delete your ♥♥♥♥ Uplay and leave it just for steam.. Thanks. BTW: after 10 minutes still it was sending this message to me, so i had to wait  around 30 minutes i could get into game.

I have to start by saying how Far Cry 3 was one of my all time favorite games.  So when I heard that Far Cry 4 was only a slightly better version of 3, I was mildly disappointed but still pumped to play.  The map (in standard open world fashion) prevents you from accessing the second half until a good 30 hours into the game.  I was having the time of my life - driving elephants into enemy encampments, lighting forests on fire etc... UNTIL I crossed that freaking bridge.  The bridge is the barrier between the two map sections and there is a big badass mission to take that bridge.  I'm mid mission, and I kill everyone on/around the bridge.  Reinforcements were called...........waiting........waiting...........waiting.  TEN MINUTES LATER I finally accepted the fact that the game broke mid mission.  Whatever no big deal, reload and do it again.  SAME THING HAPPENED.  Reload again.  It broke again but I opened and closed menus and then it magically fixed the game.  Kind of weird, whatever it's a Ubisoft game this is to be expected.  Little did I know that I had just released a shtttstorm of game breaking bugs that makes Alpha Protocol look like a modern day masterpiece.  Reinforcements just don't come anymore. EVER. You can sometimes see them frozen at the edge of the map and kill them to proceed.  Half the time mission waypoints don't load.  I "fixed" this by opening up my map and closing it.  For some reason that makes waypoints show up.  When you get to the freaking waypoint, most of the time they won't even activate SO YOU CAN'T PROCEED WITH THE MISSION.  Know how I fixed this?? BY LEVELING UP. That's right folks, I started saving levels up just so that I could proceed with missions.  Why does this work?? I have no freaking idea.  What happens if you don't have level up points? You'll just be sitting there twirling your thumbs until you die.  Not video game die, real life die BECAUSE YOU'LL BE WAITING FOREVER.  I can't beat Far Cry 4.  I've NEVER had that happen with a game this popular.  Hell I could even beat Alpha Protocol.  This game will forever be the worst game I've ever played solely because it's not a game, it's a half-cooked Beta masquerading as a game.  Ubisoft has way too many great franchises that they're driving into the ground.  We need to let them know that we're tired of their blatant lack of interest in their products, employees (see disgruntled Ubisoft employees post about how horrible that company is) and worst of all their blatant disrespect towards their fans.","October 30, 2015","false","39.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's story was very limited, and thus the context and motivation for your actions were lacking. It's saddled with a number of half-implemented mechanics, and fully-implemented but frustrating and repetitive mecahnics. However, it was laden with an incredible atmosphere, a genuinely reactive world, and (most amazingly) the landscape of the game felt real, not built. You felt like you were actually watching the setting African  sun filtering through the dust and the trees as it fell over the still river water at dusk. It's a mental image that I cannot forget.\n\nNow there's a few reasons I bring up FC2. A lot of people don't enjoy it. and I get that. It can be frustrating and it's not the most accessible or guided experience. BUT, what it does do is it plops the player in a big sandbox, gives them limited resources and intelligent and dangerous enemies, and says 'make your own story'. And because the game refuses to spoon-feed the player, and in that need for the player to adapt to the changing circumstances around them, FC2 allowed a constant creation of 'this one time when I was playing Far Cry 2...' moments. It aschewed OTT collect-a-thon busywork. It aschewed the asinine tower-climbing that has become that crumbling pillar upon which Ubisoft's games stand. It gave the player a bunch of rather vague mission parameters, a jungle, some fire, some deadly enemies, and a bunch of fairly underpowered weapons and said 'good luck'. And it was exhilirating. It was exhilirating to be forced into a cat-and-mouse stealth battle with a number of men whose clothes matched the surroundings. I was exhilirating to be unable to flush them out of hiding because you were in green grass and green grass won't burn. It was exhilirating to have to use your hearing to locate enemies because you're under a canopy and it's too dark to see them. It was exhilirating having to turn your eyes away from the road to look at your map only to look back at the road and see an enemy vehicle coming your way, knowing that if you don't get to your gun fast enough that you might die. It tested your skills as a player. It forced you to focus and made a man out of those that took the gunplay for granted.\n\nThen came FC3. And all of a sudden the HUD was filled with markers and minimaps and text, and you could see enemies through walls, and the map was littered with garbage that you had to collect or else you wouldn't get the achievement that said you collected all the garbage, and the entire map was the same and recognising your location by it's appearance was all but impossible (but that didn't matter because you had GPS to hold your hand), and the enemies all wore the same bright primary colour because there's nothing more tactical than making yourselves visible from the moon, and once you cleared an enemy stronghold they were gone for good and you'd effectively progressed by making the map less fun. Hurrah?\n\nI was excited for Far Cry 3. I lined up to play a pre-release build at a video game convention, and I bought it and played it and finished it and it was okay. And then a few years later I got a better graphics card and I reinstalled it, and I uninstalled it again within 2 hours because once you've finished it, going back is like returning to the second grade.\n\nAnd then Far Cry 4 was released. And I didn't get it. Because it was more of the same, wasn't it? Because I was bored by FC3 and the obnoxious characters and the obnoxious hand-holding. For the record, I suck at Dark Souls - I'm not the world's best player and I don't relish a punishing experience - but the 'winning formula' that Ubisoft had struck upon with FC3 failed to capture my imagination. I didn't hate it. I still remember the first time I played it through. But the gameplay failed to challenge, and the story failed to engage, so the game itself failed to give me a reason to return. But I love the series because of its potential. Because even when it was Crytek property I loved the conceit - an open-world (of sorts) FPS sandbox in an exotic locale. I loved that at one point Ubi had created a set of reactive mechanics that, together, created an experience that was greater than the sum of it's parts. So I bought FC4 (on sale of course). And...it was fun. At least, the first play through was fun. The hand-holding wasn't as obnoxious, the game looked better than FC3, the characters still grated, but the story wasn't COMPLETELY devoid of heart. The game was still using collectibles as a substitute for meaningful content, but at least those collectibles unlocked weapons for you to use. The game was full of predators that add a degree of unpredictability to the game that I felt was severely lacking in the 3rd installment, and your plans for stealth can often go awry when a stroppy leopard stumbles into the mix. The enemy strongholds can be reset, or contested, which means that danger is never ENTIRELY eliminated from the equation. It's a better game. It's fun.\n\nUpon replaying you can fly over the land and see how uniform it really is. Lacking still is variety in the terrain. The landscape is little but a bunch of locations connected by a series of roads, with nothing much that stands out in between. This place is not lived in, it's not real. It's a 2D game board on a table with a carboard prop every 5 squares, and a bunch of plastic army men stationed here and there. The enemies are still painted day-glo, just in case you forget where to shoot, and most of the missions involve going somewhere, killing something, and/or collecting something else. There's a re-hash of the FC3 mission in which you can burn a bunch of plants, and there's a single contemporary song in there somewhere, because feelings are like cold hard numbers, and Ubisoft have a steadfast belief in the simple arithmatic formula of 2 x (memorable moment) = 2 memorable moments. There's also a bunch of side-missions that involve taking drugs, because that was a thing they did in a different game that people bought.\n\nBut...it's fun. It easy to pick up and play and you're rarely far from a firefight. There's enough unpredictability to make it feel a little different each time you log on (because UPlay). It's got a little more lustre in it than FC3 the second time round. It's no FC2, and it's still adhering strictly to Ubisoft's slogan of 'video game, the video game', but it's almost, ALMOST, a compromise between the accessibility of FC3 and the dynamic engagements of FC2.\n\nIt's not a bad game. It's not a game-changer, but did you expect that? Get it cheap.","January 18","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I mean seriously, if you freaking fail right after getting a mission or something you have to watch the whole cutscene again...  Like seriously???!?! And the story itself is not that exciting either, you are some dude that just goes around and tells everyone how he is a tourist while simulataniously literally leading a rebellion.\n\nGameplay mechanics are dumb, there are animals everywhere and they freaking making it almost impossible to go around on foot until you get a skill that takes a while. The ability tree is boooooooring. Half of the skills are literally you can carry 3 of this, now you can carry 4. Or you have 3 life, now you have 4. I guess the stealth skills are cool if you were doing CQC combat which you almost never do since everyone has a freaking rifle or a shotgun and can randomly see you. Another game with lame stealth mechanics.\n\nOf course the AI is completely braindead again.Like I said they can randomly see you and are hive mind since as soon as one knows where you are everyone knows. And difficulty doesn't make them smarter, just more of a bullet spounges.\n\nVehicles are pointless again since basically either you control the territory and no need to drive, or you don't so there is a freaking patrol or a vehicle every few feet.\n\nAnd then the freaking towers, boooooring.

Also, the game is terribly optimized, but looks great if you can run it above minimum settings (spoiler: you can't, or the micro-stuttering will kill you while you sleep).

For example just to give you a picture of the situacion you might encounter i personally had trouble gliding at first but you get used to it now the problem is a phenomenum i would call gliding /running when you are running an you jump of a ledge you might just want to grapple something or fall to the ground again but no since you were running with shift a lot of times since you use shift to open parachute you will sudenlly open it and crash into a wall depleting all or almost all you health wich leads me to another problem why the ♥♥♥♥ did no one in the whole uplay team thought " hu ,maybe we could let the player customize the parachute opcion or change it for control since you dont usually crouch in the middle of air" no because uplay does not have that style another example is why the ♥♥♥ do takedowns almost seem imposible? And this is because since the new far cry enemies seem to be perfect gun-butt attakers like they do this like ninjas especially the heavy he wields it like if he wielded his penus so naturally then another problem one of the few that far cry 3 also haves why do our faction does not have a single especial except snipers like they are ak-47 wielders or snipers wielding a dragunov not anything else not even a shotgun guy also the factio that has this new unit i call arrow-magician who basically hypnotizes animals against you and uses arrow fire and normal is the faction belongin to the "bad guy"who explicitly hates traditional stuff and said anyone doing anything religius is subject to dye so if he hates traditions so much why he uses arrow ancient language speaking atakers this seems very traditional to me dont get me wrong i love the pagan character as a buddy but not as an enemy he should be the guy who helpes you kill the ones you are fighting with  but not the bad guy is more we discover he was actually kind of good at the end so explain me why make a game orientated just so you know you fighted all the time just for the wrong side? i could see this from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime game or something like that but not from a major franchise.  Lets keep adressing issues except for the new dlc where you get to play a big mission in co op all the other is small ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions in co´-op also let me tell you something idiots my friend now has dlc gun i dropped on the floor in order for him to grab it and he didnt pay for it so why allow the friends of players to grab their friends exclusive guns one could see this as good but it isnt since it is another reason why the price tag of the seson pass is not worth it since there is 2 mission dlc and the new durgush or something prison dlc wich is not working properly on steam i have rage quitted this game many times know but this time i decided to do justice another thing that hasnt affected me a whole lot but is pretty annoying and a fact that makes this worse than far cry 3 is the fact you only get 1 save slot and you while on a mission have an out of bounds area too small so you might experience things like going out of bound you will lose all your progrees example you are in a mission to collect pakeges so you go you kill guys you loot them you see a ton of loot crates you loot them you collect the first the pakege you save you go for the second you get killed and then you lost all the money from the bodyes and the crates you are reespawned back into the crate place so you lost the soldiers money and time looting the crates so wtf why did i save it manually if it wont even car eabout that?\nFinally i do recommend this since it is an far cry 3 retake(cant believe i say this after complaining of the fact that people think this) wich has some improves but in some aspect it is just damn worse.

You can pass a statue, fly over a mountain, and see the exact same statue, down to the coloration. Most encounters are boring, the same 3 vs 3 fight over and over, or an eagle you don't see coming. It has moments that are exciting, and it tries to open up the world with (clunky) flying and grapples but feels slowpaced compared to the movement in most free-running games.\n\nEnemies all wear the same red outfit. Bright red, in a jungle. The "good guys" always wear blue. That level of stupid is on display in almost every facet of this game, with the exception of the cutscenes, which are well done for the most part and seem completely out of place because of it. Towns and villages look decent as well, but they are each as pointless as the other, existing solely as places to be rescued, assaulted, used as a quest hub/refill station, and then completely ignored.\n\nThe map is covered in question marks, suggesting you explore and "unlock a part of this unique world" blah blah blah but when you get there chances are it will be a stone hut that looks like the other stone huts you found.\n\nUbisoft used to be one of my favorite game companies. I didn't care too much when EA went to crap, as the only EA title I cared for was Crysis. Seeing Ubisoft slowly go downhill with Assassins Creed, Far Cry, Anno, and other series has been saddening, and this iteneration of Far Cry only verifies that the problems are now company-wide.\n\nI waited to buy this on sale, but, I was still disappointed. I knew not to get my hopes up, but even those low expectations weren't met. This isn't a Far Cry game. It's COD in Tibet, with an open world map, and unless you like your entertainment generic and built to entertain small children, it's terrible.","March 15, 2015","false","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/durruti/recommended/298110/","durruti","Durruti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/durruti/","391 products in account","This game has so many problems with USB peripherals, it's mind boggling.  It's on patch 1.8 and it doesn't work with either a Logitech G13 nor an xbox 360 controller. Either one of them plugged in and the game hangs until it's removed.\n\nThis is the only game out of the 364 steam games that I own that IS NOT compatible with my G13.  This is also the only game that is advertised as supporting controllers that does not. Far Cry 2,3 & Blood Dragon all work fine with both peripherals.\n\nI've researched both problems quite a bit trying to figure out how to play this in a way that's comfortable for me and what I've come to find out is that A) it will not work with the G13 at all, might as well throw it against the wall. and B) I need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 if I want my 360 controller to work.  This is a huge problem for me as my gaming rig is an HTPC that I run through my TV exclusively.  I make due with games that don't support controllers by using a small lapdesk and the g13, but in this instance I will need to rework my entire space to support a f*cking keyboard.\n\nFor the past year Ubisoft has released awful games using dubious marketing tactics.  After Watch Dogs, AC Unity and now my experience with this, I will not be buying Ubisoft titles anymore.  I'm done.  If I absolutely must play a Ubisoft game I will acquire it through other means, but Ubisoft will not see another dollar of mine.\n\nEdit:\nI've set up a desk near my TV and hooked up a monitor and keyboard just to play this game. I'm still upset about the awful USB bugs in this game but I've now spent 16 hours in game and feel I can now actually comment on the game itself.\n\nFar Cry 4 is absolutely beautifully crafted.  When I first got out of the intro, I was taken aback by just how beautiful the world is. It felt like the first time I had seen Skyrim or Columbia in Bioshock Infinite. I've just started getting into the story so I really can't comment on it's quality. I can say that Far Cry 3 gave you a much better excuse for getting involved in the conflict there than thise game gives. I do feel that the story in Far Cry 3 set a pretty high bar and that I don't expect 4 to match it and I think that's fine.\n\nThe game play is very similar to Far Cry 3. I love Far Cry 3 so for me the gameplay is great. There are a few new additions which dial up the fun abit. Riding elephants, using bait, fortresses and a few new varieties of side quests are all welcome additions. You shouldn't go into this game expecting a huge evolution in gameplay similar to the evolution going from 2 to 3, it's more of a refinement of the Far Cry 3 gameplay. That's fine for me, but apparently upsetting to a number of reviewers here.\n\nThere are a few things that do bug me, in addition to the USB problems. The game has crashed on me twice now for seemingly no reason. This, along with the USB issues really get under my skin as the game has been out for 4 months and it's been patched 8 times. There is really no reason for these bugs to still be in the game, aside from Ubisoft's incompetence. The geography of Kyrat can get quite annoying.  It's a mountainous region which makes traversing the map on the ground a bit of a pain. The game does give you mechanics that help like a better waypoint gps, a grapling hook and the buzzer vehicle, yet it's still annoying anyway. The hunter class enemies are also annoying. They attack from behind cover using a silent bow, making them very hard to find, and they seem to just start attacking you without any notification. It can be frustrating trying to break combat with hunters when you can't find them and therefore get a handle on their line of sight.\n\nThen there are the birds, they will litterally come out of nowhere, attack you quickly and fly away and they will continue to do this until you kill them or take off from wherever you are. They are fast, small and airbourne which makes them difficult to kill. Additionally, you don't get much ammo at the beginning of the game and most of the early weapons don't have silencer addons available. You can very easily unload a majority of your ammo on the birds while simultaneously attracting any enemies near by. I learned the hard way, several times, that the best thing you can do is just gtfo and hide. I can't figure out why Ubisoft decided that including these sky demons was a good idea. It breaks immersion as it's very difficult to imagine the average himalayan native is a victim of a half dozen unprovoked bird attacks everyday. At first I thought the feathers they dropped were used in crafting, but they aren't. They don't advance the story in anyway whatsoever. It's a poorly thoughout mechanic and serves no purpose other than to annoy the hell out of you. At this point Ubisoft should really just patch them out of the game.\n\nIf I had known about the broken peripheral support I wouldn't have bought this game. Now that I have it I'm trying to make the best of it and enjoy it as much as I can, however it can be frustrating. Now and again I can still manage to get immersed in the game and when I do I'm generally enjoying it as much as I enjoyed Far Cry 3. Far Cry 4 really has the potential to be a great game if Ubisoft cared enough to fix the issues it has.","March 15, 2015","false","139.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Over_Clocked/recommended/298110/","Over_Clocked","Overclocked","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Over_Clocked/","146 products in account","There is only one reason I can think of to recommend Far Cry 4, and that's if you're low on sleeping aids and need something to lull you into a blissful slumber. The game is boring as hell, for the pure and simple fact that the designers just weren't thinking about all the game breaking mistakes they made that cause it to be an easy cake walk where you simply slog your way through the motions.\n\nLet me explain how the process of Far Cry works. What typically happens in a Far Cry game is that you are given the options to complete missions, find loot, and use it to buy weapons and upgrades. Alternatively you can activate towers in order to make the weapons in the game free. How liberating towers works (or rather how it's supposed to work) is that you travel to a tower, fight off a dozen enemies guarding it, figure out a way up the tower, get to the top, and press a button. After which you are rewarded with free loot at the top for you to scavenge.\n\nThis was a fun and interesting challenge in Far Cry 3 because you actually had to do all those steps I just mentioned in order to activate them. But for some brain scouring reason, Farcry 4 just gives you a personal gyro-copter right off the bat. They're just lying around for you to get in and pilot at the start of the game.\n\nSo here's how the game play of Farcry 4 goes: You turn the game on, get to the first outpost, find a gyro-copter and then you win. Because after that I never, EVER encountered a single challenge in the game.\n\nThe towers you liberate are supposed to be challenging obstacles that makes you weigh the benefits of spending money on weapons, or overcoming the challenge of activating the towers to unlock them for free. But where is the challenge now? I have a gyro-copter. Now I can just fly to the top of the things, press the button and fly to the next. There are seventeen in total and I had liberated ten of them this way within the first twenty minutes.\n\nSo now that almost all the weapons in the game were free and the loot at the top was mine for the easy taking ten times in a row, the only thing I had to worry about spending my money on was upgrades for the weapons. And let me tell you, once you fully upgrade the sniper rifle you may as well just shut the game off, because you already won. Now all you have to do is slog through the chore of winning.\n\nLiberating camps is easy as hell when you can just pick enemies off from a continent away, and most of the actual in game missions can be completed from a distance as well. Occasionally you have to fight a ground battle, but the enemies are so interchangeable and predictable that I was picking them off with the starting, non-upgraded shotgun and got by just fine.\n\nAn exploration game just isn't fun when you can just fly to each destination undisturbed, and a shooting game isn't fun when you're basically just lay in a beach chair picking people off from the next town over. Sure you could limit your self to not using the copter or the sniper rifle, but why on earth would you hand the player those things and then say "Just don't use them if you want to have fun?"\n\nIt was particularly hilarious when I was given "Tail the target" missions. "Oh, bet you won't be able to keep up with this guy as he's weaving and bobbing around dicey roads" the game said as I rolled my eyes and just followed him high above in my helicopter, waiting for him to stop his stupid car. I was then supposed to eliminate him and the guards surrounding him in order to obtain a blood diamond. So naturally I parked my copter a good sniping distance away and easily picked them off one by one like cardboard ducks at a carnival, after which I parked my copter outside the cave I was supposed to enter.\n\n"Okay, now get the blood diamond. Good, now take it back to the dealer. UUH-OOH! We just spawned six bad guys outside your cave! Bet you can't fight your way through them!", the game said as I rolled my eyes, got back in my gyro-copter and made my way to the buyer, looking down at the enemies shaking their fists at me pathetically as I flew away in safety.\n\nAnd then the game had the audacity to give me a mission where my destination was a league away. In that instance I was apparently supposed to trek through the wilderness and tundra to get there, but again, my handy dandy personal copter was sitting right there, so I just had my self some coffee while I held the forward button for twenty minutes until I got there and hilariously noticed from above an elaborate rock climbing set up I was apparently supposed to have use in order to get up there. You gave me a helicopter you guys! Stop pretending that I'm ever going to get somewhere any way else.\n\nThe unbelievably short sighted design decisions in Far Cry 4 made everything that was fun and challenging in Far Cry 3 a complete waste of time. When you have to go out of your way not to use what they gave you in order to have fun, you're just playing a broken game. If you have Far Cry 3 and loved it, I say just play that again. Don't bother with this broken, boring slog.","January 10","false","11.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

The real positive to this game is its world and the lore that surrounds it. The environment is visually beautiful and the audio is immersive. It got me hooked the moment I started. The story, however, is lacking compared to Far Cry 3.\n\nIt was harder to relate to this story and to feel a connection to it. The villain could not compare to Vaas in Far Cry 3 and that is what I felt the story lacked the most; good protagonist and antagonists, but bad villain. The story also felt a bit too short and the ending was lackluster.\n\nI had fun playing it.

I love open world games. Games that you can just detour from the main quest and do whatever you want how you want.\nThis game has it all.\nYou want to just go hunting with a bow? Go ahead.\nYou want to catch a spooky fish with a grenade? Go ahead!\nYou want to fight a tiger with a knife? Be my guest!\nYou feel like a Rambo and want to blitz an enemy camp? You can!\nYou want to play sneaky and smart? Always an option.\nYou want to take a pictures of Himalayas? Sure.\nYou want to ride an elephant? Yeah you can ride elephants in this game.\n\nThis is what I love in Far Cry - game dont force the play style on you, I spend hours just roaming around and looking for trouble. Trying different ways how to approach the wild animals or enemy towers/camps.\nI can play like a crazy gunman and go full loud, or try more intelligent way trying to eliminate the enemy without being detected.\n\nThe game word feels authentic and bigger than in FC3. Graphically game is simply gorgeous and you can easily immerse yourself in whatever role you try to play.\nAnd of course gun play is spot on, and game gives you powerful arsenal of toys to play with. (yes, I used my grenade on a unsuspecting family of badgers...)\n\nThankfully game plays pretty good with M+K and performance on my rig is surprisingly smooth.\nI cant really comment on the story, its pretty much the same thing you know and love from Far Cry 3 - liberate the place and fight kind of funny, crazy villain. I like it so far, nothing ground braking but its solid.\n\nOverall Far Cry 4 is based at the same core mechanics that you know from Far Cry 3. But the new setting and amount of stuff to do makes it even better in my eyes. There are small helicopters, some sort of rock climbing, wing suits and much more added.\nIf you like open world games this is a must have in your collection.\n\nBiggest con - whoever put this pack of rabid eagles that attacks everybody every 10 minutes in to this game should be fired!","February 8","true","15.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However when it comes to an open world game Far Cry 4 really falls short compared to sandbox kings like Skyrim. Skyrim had varying landscapes, individual quests at every turn and side quests that felt as rewarding and well-crafted as the main story. Far Cry 4 has none of this. A lot of the side quests are mind-numbingly repetitive and liberating outposts and climbing radio towers quickly becomes an annoying chore. This is why in only 30ish hours I have finished the main quest line, (which has a poor ending) and I now feel no desire to explore the never-ending jungle full of identical hostage rescue missions and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eagles that attack on sight. Compare this to the hundred or so hours I spent in Skyrim just playing through side-quests alone (excluding mods!).\n\nNegatives aside I would say definitely pick this game up later in a 50% sale. Play it for the amazing graphics, soundtrack, boobies and fun primary quest line but don't pay top dollar for it like I did.\n\nAlso Uplay can go f itself.

I guess i will have to wait for Flawless Widescreen to launch an update for what was supposed to be Ubisoft's job.\n\nFrom the in-game content, there is absolutely nothing new compared with Far Cry 3. In fact, i think Far Cry 3 have a better story. This game only add a very few more weapons and a gyrocopter. Even the in-game mechanics are the same as far cry 3 (climb up a ♥♥♥♥ed up tower to disable the radio thing, use a zipline to go down, kill a pig to craft the same stuff as in far cry 3, assault camps to use them as spawn point, etc). These aren't bad features, but for that price? No ♥♥♥♥ing way!\n\nIt would be acceptable if this game were produced by a small indie company, but its not. Right now, its extremely overpriced for its quality.\n\nI HOPE that in the future they will patch this thing, so can give a big positive review. When this happens (IF this happens) i will upvote this one, but right now i'm not buying any other ubisoft game again (i heard what is going on with Assassins Creed: Unity).","November 26, 2014","false","40.0"," 37 of 71 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","37","71","0","0"

Ожидая эту игру я точно знал что получу, и игра полностью оправдала мои ожидания.\n\nИз плюсов:\nВ игре невероятно красивый мир, первый раз поподая в Кират ты такой думаешь - Дак ведь это Скайрим!!! Однако получив свой первый ствол, все асоциации отпадают сразу, невероятное внимание к деталям акружения, разнообразные храмы руины, статуи, везде развешанные флажки, пряпки, неписи же ведут себя обыденно как и обычные индийцы, ходят полуголые ракрашенные красками и курят что-то сидя в кампании макак.\nОбыденные фишки от Ubisift так же из серии FarCry захват аванпостов, любимые всем колокольни(вышки), много очень много разнообрвзных необязательных заданий,\nСюжет интересный, не то чтобы прям достоен какой либо премии но на 4-ку, местами дает немного поаргазмировать от происходящего на экране.\nТак же в игре появилась, какая не какая нелинейность. ~3 концовки. Причем получить одну из них можно в первые 15 минут игры=D "-Не уходи попробуй крабовый рангун"\nПерсонажи все персонажи, чертовско хорошо проработаны, видно что над этим сильно запарились, их просто нравится слушать. Амита, Сабал, Пол, Нур, Аджай, Пейган, Еги и Реджи, Лонгин, Херк все круты обсолютно все, даже если они появлялись на считанные минуты, они запоминались.\nГеймплей все что я могу сказать, он есть в этой игре и его дохрена. Невероятная фауна, чего только стоят орлы и медоеды, вы от этих тварей еще испытаете столько боли, что тигр или медведь вам покажутся домашними зверушками а большая стая волков так пустячек. И не как нельзя не упамянуть слонов и носорогов, это просто машины для убийства врагов и уничтожения техники. В Кирате вас будет старатса убить абсолютно все, любая божя тварь, будь то солдат или рыба в озере.\nЧто до основных врагов, солдат Пейгана ребята поумнели, стали хорошо видеть, хорошо слышать, замечают потерю бойца, реагируют на обстановку, когда их много они рашат а когда мало стараются зашкерится или обойти со спины. Так же добавили пару классов врагов по сравнению с 3 ей частью.\nКуча транспортных средств от вертолетов и разнообразных машин до костюма крыла который позволяет в любой момент карабкаясь по скале (Да в игре офигенная система скалолазанья.) взмыть воздух як птица и забрать пару врагов словно орел=D\n\nИз минусов, они не кретичны но все же:\nТот же костюм крыло, он немного кривой и ГГ всегда норовит его открыть с небольшой высоты и разбить себе чучоло об ближайшее дерево или стену. А бывали моменты когда ты зависаешь в воздухе и не теряешь высоту летаешь вечно пока не врежешься в гору.\nВ некоторых местах зайдя в здание вы можете увидить такое чудо Кирата как прозрачные стены, "Нанотехнологический Институт Кирата" посторался видать. Было это всего 2 ва раза.\nТак же иногда очень редко зависает HUD и не отображает некоторые елименты или некорректно, но такое бывало тоже пару раз за ~40 часов игры.\n\nНу вот мой вердик пожалуй:\nДобротная игра для неоднократного прохождения по хардкору.\n\nИ помни , если услышал медоеда и орла доставай свой гранатомет или РПК иначе эти твари выпустят тебе кишки ведь им на все на♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!","December 5, 2014","true","37.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I chose to purchase this so I could play co-op with my friend, and the game is utterly broken. There's a load screen for EVERYTHING (including the main menu before you're even in game), they're extremely long, and almost every single one results in a black screen forever unless I ctrl+alt+delete. That seems to "fix it" and let me continue playing. Hardly playable.\n\nFurthermore, inviting a friend to my game results in yet another extremely long load screen resulting in a black screen, and multiplayer errors out and disconnects randomly, resulting in, you guessed it, black load screen forever. Worse still: I've lost my progress twice now due to multiplayer. The second time I made a point of saving the game before inviting my friend to play co-op. He joined. It black screened, then errored and he disconnected immediately, resulting in another load screen booting ME to the main menu (it does that even if you're the host). My progress was lost again somehow even though I saved before even inviting him.\n\nThis is what I get for paying for the game instead of torrenting it. Lesson learned. I'm asking for a refund then pirating it.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic, I love it... When I can actually play it. It's not worth the frustration given how broken it is right now.

Indeed, it's open-world in nature, plenty to see and to do, lots of fun things... but rife with bugs even quite a while after the launch. I have constant graphical issues (latest stable nVidia drivers, no issues in other games,) issues with saves randomly deleting ammo on load (in addition to ammo deletion when returning from Shangri-La,) odd control and keyboard issues, and more. I can't recommend this game in this state on PC. It was not a finished product and, maybe sometime in the future, it will be and I can play without frustration that I face now.  However, I'm not hopeful at this point. It's a shame I paid for a finished, playable product and got something maybe 75% of the way there. I type this having exited the game to restart due to textures randomly failing and being completely unable to see in the game.\n\nRelease a full game or don't at all.

The graphics are not just better, but the entire world is too.  Even though I am sure the map is smaller than 3's, the new verticality makes it seem bigger.\nThe characters are a lot more likeable.  Instead of an psycopathic pirate who dies half way through, Far Cry 4 features the colorful dictator Pagan Min, who will have you questioning whose side is the good side.\nGameplay is also better.  The Gyrocopter, grapple hook, and weapons add more first person fun than I ever experienced in any previous Far Cry.\n\nOf course, not everything is perfect:\nThe crafting system is still here, though items are easier to craft now.  Syringes autocraft, but require a skill to do so.\nSkills are also still here, but require skill points to level up instead of leveling up as an achievement.  Skill Points are spent like currency, where all the first level skills cost 1 point. second level 2 points, etc.\nThe missions aren't always as great too.  There are missions that will require you to hunt, fetch, and diliver, but with mountains in the way of checkpoints, traversing through Kyrat is more fun than Far Cry 3.\n\nThat last (and best) thing about Far Cry 4 is the ability of customization.  The HUD is completly cuztomizable, bing able to choose what to show, what to hide, and what to limit.\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the settings also allow you RESET OUTPOSTS.  Personally, the biggest problme with FC3 was once I had taken over all the outposts, there were no more pirates to kill, which meant no more game to be played.  In Far Cry 4, if you have liberated all outposts, you can reset them and take them over AGAIN.  And again.  And again.\n\nAt the end, Far Cry 4 is the best this series has seen so far, but there is still room for improvement for Far Cry 5.\n8/10","November 19, 2014","true","53.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do not recommend using a game pad because there's virtually no aim assist. You will miss constantly. Mouse for the win.\n\nAs for the SEASON PASS. I Paid 90 bucks for nothing. Literally I have nothing extra that other's do not for the 60 dollar version. I don't know if this is a bug or something but I see no extra missions or benefits for season pass... Don't even bother.\n\nPvP Multiplayer. More like. Sit in the bell tower and let the enemy team win. Also, why is there no voice chat? There is no communication possible in your team. You have an option for a Friends tab but you can't add anyone through matches or invite them that way. At least, no way I have figured out.\n\nNot like i'd want to invite people who literally spend all their time in 1 point on the map and don't even try to win anyway.\n\nPvP is Golden Path vs Rakasha. And is not ever straight up PvP. It's objectives and you take turn as Golden Path in 1 round, and Rakasha in the next. Basically it's stupid because they are very biased. RPGs vs bow and arrows... RPGs win.","November 22, 2014","false","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can however tell you that this is an amazing game. From it's stunning graphics to it's gameplay, this game is surely one of my favorite. Now I don't normaly review things so I won't be able to provide a detailed analysis about the game, but that doesn't mean what I say about it isn't meaningful.\nThe game really does have a beautiful landscape. You could just drive, fly, swim, or walk around and take in all of the beauty. There are lakes, mountains, forests, islands, caves and each of them are incredible. It doesn't end there though, because you can see all the wonderful different kinds of wildlife this game includes. Tigers, jaguars, wolves, elephants, demon fish, not to mention if you get the DLC than you will get mauled by Yeti's! (That is, of course, if you  actually play the Valley of the Yeti's campain)\nNow, the gameplay. I really enjoyed playing around in this game. Deciding if I want to either use stealth to kill my enemies, or go on a more explosive route. Both ways give you a wide selection of things to use, for example you could use a bow and arrow(Silent, but deadly) or you could go full out and use an automatic grenade launcher(A much louder way to go). I personaly enjoy doing a bit of both, being stealthy until I get caught then blowing everything to bits. Now this game is not unlike Skyirim in the way that you can focus on the main mission, or go around playing all the side quests(You can also just run around doing whatever the heck you want, granted you need to get farther in the campain  to unlock more of Kyrat).\nEven with all of this I feel as though you should just check the game out yourself. I often find that I disagree with people on how good movies, games, and shows are, so I recomend watching some youtube videos of the game to see if YOU like it. Thank you for your time. : )\n","March 29, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You deal with quests in different approaches like slow, fast, hard or in stealth. There are manny quests, different side quests and a lot collectables. There are nice water places, like falls, rivers or springs. Nice mountains and a very good background.\n\nBut there are some things they could have done better.\n\nThe enviroment looks often the same especially the trees. The trees and bushes have the same density everywhere. Where are the plains, the forests or single tress or small groups of trees?\n\nAfter a while, when you got the AI of the NPCs, it becomes easy. I mean, an easy beginning is always not bad. But I have expected more. E.g. a hostege situation or a fortress. If I kill one, OK. But after the second sniper kill, I would call reenforcements, or kill the hostages, right? A stealth appraoch means no one sees my attack. Isn't it so hard to tell the AI to send two men after a noise? Or even harder an additional sniper whatching these two? This would have been really hard to solve. By fast shooting, good hiding, using mines or C4....\n\nAnd the story... OK. But why not summarizing your decisions over the quests in a final video (e.g. Fallout). I would have been a nice reflextion of what I did and how it changed Kyrat. And where are the atvantages of collection all the letters and such. A final quest for this like "Hey you found all the letters. Now the story makes sense and we can go to the secret cave..." And there are manny caves, nicely hidden, containg only loot cheast.\n\nAll in all... about all the little improvemnts, and I could continue on this... a bit more "love" to that little extra could have made this game extraordinary.","December 1, 2014","true","83.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I came into this game having not played the other games in the series. I was instantly blown away by the great looking world. The  combat was very fun, and the variety of weapons made it fun to find different ways to kill people. The controls were fluid and I never once felt like I died from bad control. What I don't like is the healing system. Having to hit ctrl to heal was monotonous. If I didn't have a healing syringe i was stuck waiting behind a wall waiting for the slow healing animation to finish. After running out and killing a few enemys I was stuck behind a wall again healing. Driving cars around Kyrat is fun and its fun to listen to the radio and hear what they say. The stealth parts were the worst as you had to very slowly crouch evrywhere and stop for a minute to wait for a guy to turn around and kill him. It slows the game down so much that it makes me not want to play. On the otherhand, parts where you and the golden path charge bases is always fun and gets your adrenaline going. Pagen Min is a great antagonist as he's fun to watch/listen to when he's there, I wish he talked more in the story than he did. Amita and Sabal are forgetable characters and I personally didn't like either of them. There are many missions that are available like yogi and reggie were you get high and run for a few minutes then it's done or Hurk where you have to collect these monkey statues (my favorite) and Willis which is are the worst missions. The most dislikable character and some of the hardest and unfair missions in the game. The Golden path missions are very fun and had the most action. Whether your in Kyrat, Shangri La, or the Himalayas it looks amazing!!! The ending was a little dissapointing but the atmosphere of the game was great. The crafting system worked well, even though I didn't use it much it was very useful when I did. The different skills you can learn add to the experience (The extra Health bar is the best in my opinion). Overall Far Cry 4 is a great experience, is it the best game of 2014? No, but it is a great game to the Far Cry franchise and made me want a Far Cry 5. Anyone can have fun with this game as there is something for everyone. Far Cry 4 receives a 8.2/10.\n\n-Infinite","March 6, 2015","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To be blunt I believe the story line of this game is lacking and not as interesting. Far Cry 3 is a way better game in storyline. I personaly think they just made the same game twice and added a few new features with a diferent plot, but it can be forgiven, who would want to stray to far from a previosly sucsusful game. I if I were developing a sequel to a legendary game, I would make it as similar to that game as possible.","January 17, 2015","true","41.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/recommended/298110/","Zanduar","Zengineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/","480 products in account","Far Cry 4's mechanics don't stray very far from how Far Cry 3 worked. You've got outposts to liberate. You've got radio towers to unlock. You've got animals to skin. You've got bad guys to shoot. Like Far Cry 3 the easiest path to take is usually going from point A to point B through the jungle. Why? Because every road and town is filled with things that want to kill you (most of the time). The animals in Far Cry 4 are much stronger than those in the previous game. You can and will die to animal attacks and luring animals for your benefit is a standard tactic in this game. Out of all of the animals the worst animal is the eagle. As soon as you're attacked by one you'll quickly learn why every NPC is scared of them. If you see a bird with a predator label shoot it. Next in the line of evil comes wolves, who will attack in packs and often are relentless in their pursuit of you despite (or because of) killing all of them.\n\nThe largest change between Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 is really the terrain. The mountainous regions make navigating difficult and turn what should be a short trip into a long one simply because you needed to change your elevation. It also makes outposts and other enemy strongholds more difficult to take because they have natural barriers. Generally when viewing an enemy outpost from a distance your vision of the area will be obscured from below and above making tagging enemies or taking stealth shots much harder. And stealth is also one of the big changes between 3 and 4. It is rather difficult to take down outposts completely silently and knocking out alarms will give you the "no alarms" reward. The game gives you a chance to replay outpost captures without losing control of the outpost but unless you really need that stealth capture to unlock one of the later skills there isn't much point to it. However it should be noted that the A.I. of the enemies remains strong whether you are trying to sneak in or capture the base through sheer force.\n\nThe RPG elements of the game are rather generic. Some require certain achievements. Some require being so far along in the story before they'll unlock. Spend experience points to increase your health points. Spend experience points to heal a little more.  Most of these are on the elephant side of the skill tree which deals with using herbs to make power-ups. Power ups do actually take time to make and you should stock up before going into battle. However I really only found the hunting power up, which allows you to see all enemies, to be useful. On the tiger side of the skill tree you have various takedowns and other combat oriented skills.\n\nI enjoyed this game but I couldn't help thinking "This is a repackaged Far Cry 3". I was actually disappointed by the amount of "pop-ups" and textures fading in. I was expecting beautiful landscapes on max settings and was instead treated to trees and mountains popping into existence and appearing slightly better as I got close. I was very disappointed with the main narrative. You play the role of a young male on a trip to fulfill his mother's dying wish of taking her ashes to her homeland. From the moment you land you know this is not a good place to be. Now the game introduces the laughable "big bad" Pagan Min who gets a lot of overacted dialog which continues throughout the game even when you aren't doing a task related to the main story at all.\n\nAs for the main story there are several endings which I will not spoil but I will say that the idea of choice in the game has almost no weight towards what happens in the end. Sure the narratives are slightly different but there are basically one of two endings that the average player will see and neither is rewarding. The main character is a generic white male. His voice actor is good but the character is not well developed. His backstory is repeated over and over again in the game and this is possible because there is so little of it.\n\nWhile I recommend the game I do not recommend any of the DLC. Both of the "expansions" are made of very linear maps with little to no gameplay changes outside of your hub. In one of the DLCs you have a base that can be upgraded and needs to be defended nightly but actually defending it isn't that fun. Either you'll be well defended enough to take out the waves of enemies with ease or you won't be and you'll probably die from a rush of enemies. In one of the DLCs you get to see Yetis. These are nothing more than giant tanks and while you might get a bit of excitement from having to hide or run from them unarmed, you won't be too worried if you see one in the wild. The DLC weapons are half decent when you are just starting the game but will quickly be outclassed. The HURK DLC is just a few missions in a different zoned area and your ultimate payoff is a harpoon gun that is really only good for laughing at corpses pinned to walls. Unfortunately you'll have to be rather close to use it.\n\nIn summary: This is Far Cry 3.5. The groundwork of the game series is still enjoyable but so little has changed that it seems to be missing that "WOW" factor that makes a good game into a great game.","May 2, 2015","true","83.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a fun little story and entertaining characters.  Some of the best experiences though are the ones that you create yourself such as rhino hunting with a grenade launcher from the back of an elephant.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monthorian/recommended/298110/","Monthorian","Eucalyptus!!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monthorian/","67 products in account","I want to start out by saying that I never played any of the Farcry games before this one, so I have no nostalgia to influence my review.\n\nThis is one of the best games I have ever played. The open world was done perfectly, you can just roam around and hunt or hunt down the royal army, you can try to capture outposts or do missions. This game feels extremely open, there is so much variety to the game. You can do almost anything that you want to. You can play any way you want, whether you like to play stealthy and toss rocks to distract guards while you sneak up and give them the work or you can just run in guns-a-blazin' with a huge variety of weapons.\n\nThe campaign was pretty fun, the missions are slightly more linear than the open world because if you stray too far from the zone, you get sent back to a checkpoint. The story was good and made you make some hard decisions. You can support Sabal who is all about maintaining tradition and morality or you can support Amita who is all about progress and preparing for the future but does not care about morality or religion/tradition at all. You get to make lots of choices in the game, you can kill certain targets or let them live.\n\nThe side missions are really cool. You can talk to Rabi Ray Rana and destroy propoganda centers, while he rambles on about all kinds of things. (He really cares about you, from the weapons you use to the water you use to clean your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) You can talk to Mr. Chiffon. He wants you to make all kinds of fashionable equipment that is also the highest tier of each equipment piece. To do this you have to hunt rare animals which are very tough to kill. There is even a funny joke when you do the honey badger one.\n\nThe weapons in this game are really vast. You can change the attachments on them to show your preference. You can pick some low-caliber silenced weapons and bows if you want to go stealthy or get some LMG's and rocket launchers if you want to go ham. There is even a harpoon gun if you get the Hurk DLC, it can pin enemies to walls and send them flying off cliffs.\n\nThe characters in this game are amazing. Hurk is my favorite character, I feel like whenever I see him the "America, ♥♥♥♥ Yeah" song from Team America: World Police should be playing. He is a badass dude and is pretty funny, you get to do missions with him in his DLC and can adventure with him in Co-op. (Player 2 is Hurk) Rabi Ray Rana is really funny, he just blabbers on for like 5 minutes every time you take a mission from him. The stuff he says is pretty funny, he talks about bidets and his pet... something. Pagan Min is a great antagonist, he calls you on your walkie talkie all the time just to have a nice little chat with you, and he REALLY wants you to eat crab rangoons.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 10/10, I have played through it twice. It is one of the best games I have ever played and I get so much enjoyment out of it. In all my time playing I still get those moments where I do something badass that I haven't ever done before and I just sit there with my mouth wide open for a minute and then I have to call one of my friends up and try (and fail) to explain how awesome it was. I always wish that I recorded my playthroughs.\n\nThank you for reading my rather long review, I hope it helps you decide to buy the game. Totally worth all the time you will put in. Please leave me a thumbs up if this helped you at all. :D","December 4, 2015","true","87.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Expect a more polished experience this time round in the open world of Kyrat, a fictional region of the Himalayas. From overrunning isolated Outposts high up in the frost bitten summits, to storming regional Fortresses amongst the dense woodlands & lakes of the Himalayan lowlands, the stunning scenary you encounter are worthy of a snapshot or two. The missions on offer range from low key assassinations & hunting for furs using stealth, to full out frontal assaults on installations using heavy ordinance. The sheer variety on offer here from weapons & skills to be unlocked, to the ever changing story arc made by your decisions make this game a memorable one.  The main villian this time round is psychopath Pagan Min, who's a character with genuine charisma worthy of a place in a Bond film, but is woefully underused.

Mainly on outposts.\n- Nice optimization (at least for NVIDIA users).\n- Wildlife is dangerous and annoying XD (I like that)\n- Is not as longer as FC3 but it has very nice missions!\n- More guns, memorable side quests, random events and more activities and ways to travel ;) (oh that little helicopter <3)\n- Music variety and unknown great artist from other cultures ;) Listen to this :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmHHXNP6uGU\n- Of course those weird moments / missions under the influence :P\n- The map editor\n- The alternative ending ;)\n\nCons:- I hate seeing AMD people having problems during the first weeks of this kind of games. I'm not AMD user but I find this kind of partnerships don't help (to the whole market at least).\n- Weak plot twists (FC3 was too good for me)\n- At the beginning some guns are so annoying to accomplish a good long distance shot ¬¬\n- The engine works great but it has some popup problems and a few fun glitches haaha!\n\nFar Cry 4 is a worthy sequel. If you didn't play FC3 you SHOULD play both. Doesn't matter the order for me (aside a few little details) ;)  It was good to have a good Ubisoft Montreal game after ACU fiasco.

Personally I liked this one more than FC3 because this character relates more to me than the party boy  in the previous game. I came to scatter my mother's ashes, got caught by an insane dictator, then got caught in the whirlwind that is a civil war between 2 factions.\n\nPro's -\nReal nice FPS/RPG, not as much development as the last game but still enough to enjoy leveling up.\nMore content than you can shake  a stick at.\nStory is worth playing through including the side story of Shangri-Lah.\nBeautiful graphics and scenery, never get tired of seeing the snow capped mountains.\nUsing bait to lure animals to do your dirty work is somewhat entertaining.\n\nCon's-\nEnemy's AI may seem a bit dull.\nIf you are always doing stealth and trying to knock out fortresses, a silenced sniper can pretty much do them all undetected.

There's also less drug fueled boss fights that take place on a magical disco floor. Those are the obvious downsides. On the plus side there's still hallucinations, and the combat is a bit smoother with more options, and the ability to move bodies regardless of how long they have been dead for.

After the cinematic and first 3 hours of gameplay  i thought\nbuying this was a dive into the toilet , but gladly after 10 hours or so doing all the quests and sidequests the game actually opened up and so did my perception of it . Far Cry 4 doesnt hand you out its full story right away . When you start out the story seems bland and 08/15 *saw it ,played it* style. But hell continue it and chapter and subchapters open , and you find yourself craving for more.I wont go deeper into the story side of the game would be a shame  to spoil it,\nbut if you wanna have numbers  its an solid 8 outta 10\n\nFor the fight/gun/npc  mechanics  i strongly suggest you play this on the hardest mode...even for the mainstream casuals out there because in my opinion its the only way to enjoy the game to the fullest...trust me this isnt a Darksouls style hardcore mode.\n\nthe Graphics are superb , enemy AI ist good to almost very good. Some weapons later in game are way overpowered ,\nwich makes your own hero killing stuff like Satan on Crack (but hey maybe its just me being once good at a game) so that was somekind a letdown even on hardcore mode\n\nConclusion : worth it YES\nEnjoyable: Yes\nEntertaining : YES!\nChallanging : good to YES\nStory :YES\n\nShortcomings: UI Wheels  ...i just hate them\n+ a bit heavy on stealth play ... can occasionly be a pain in the a..\nsome seriously OP weapons\n\nVerdict : Worth every penny\n\n\n","December 14, 2015","true","91.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Months after release, this heaping pile of suck still launches into a black screen.  Forums rife with stickes urge you to run dxdiag reports, send system information, unplug controllers, verify cache integrity, what a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Stay clear.  You've been warned.\n\n***UPDATED REVIEW***\n\nFinally came back around to this and it was patched to playable status, ONLY IF all the NVIDIA stuff was turned off.  I think I managed to get away with using the nvidia hbao+ and it didn't crash, but every other feature caused display driver crashes to desktop.\n\ni7 4790k @ 4.4GHz with a water block and a GTX 980, SSD drives all around.\n\nThe game itself -\n\nIt's the same formula as Far Cry 3, so you know what you're getting if you're a fan of the series.  It has excellent mission and mechanical polish, and I did thoroughly enjoy the story line as it played out through completion.  There is a LOT of fluff, as is standard for your Ubisoft open world formula, but they gave everyone enough variety to taste.  If you want a 100 hour experience, it's here in the form of the 100%.  If you want a 30 hour experience it is also here, and it feels just right.  If you want to slam through the main mission structure you'll probably run through it in 15 hours.\n\nI did enjoy my time with it in the end, but it is still endlessly frustrating that flagship video hardware and AAA title integration is this dysfunctional in 2015, but in context this is a trifiling matter.  There's a delicious buffet to choose from in this game, and that shouldn't be totally disregarded simply because one or two of the things I was hoping to enjoy weren't on order.\n\n7 / 10 , You'll enjoy it, just don't expect all the visual effects to work without issues.  Still a gorgeous game, but some things are still a bit broken.","January 11, 2015","true","72.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Same with the enemy Ai, aton of improvement, there smater,faster,more dinamic and just plain better. The story line is awesome, 10/10 would beat in 15min again ;D!! The choice between the 2 "Golden Path" was a shocking decision i did not expect to make, the tower are also alot better, not just a simple circle to jerk around in (hehe), and the world is awesome!! and huge! The addition of the buzzer made me trow myself at a wall due to the amount of awesomeness, the voive acting is also very nice, the mouth matches up with the voice an un-countable amount of time, its very nice and finished, i do wish you could get another heli besides the Buzzer, faster, stronger etc..\n\nThe could be better and could be worse, i enjoy the new game modes alot, but i think they should add a couple more standard ones like TDM, S and D etc. and an easy way to play with your friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monthorian/recommended/298110/","Monthorian","Eucalyptus!!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monthorian/","67 products in account","I want to start out by saying that I never played any of the Farcry games before this one, so I have no nostalgia to influence my review.\n\nThis is one of the best games I have ever played. The open world was done perfectly, you can just roam around and hunt or hunt down the royal army, you can try to capture outposts or do missions. This game feels extremely open, there is so much variety to the game. You can do almost anything that you want to. You can play any way you want, whether you like to play stealthy and toss rocks to distract guards while you sneak up and give them the work or you can just run in guns-a-blazin' with a huge variety of weapons.\n\nThe campaign was pretty fun, the missions are slightly more linear than the open world because if you stray too far from the zone, you get sent back to a checkpoint. The story was good and made you make some hard decisions. You can support Sabal who is all about maintaining tradition and morality or you can support Amita who is all about progress and preparing for the future but does not care about morality or religion/tradition at all. You get to make lots of choices in the game, you can kill certain targets or let them live.\n\nThe side missions are really cool. You can talk to Rabi Ray Rana and destroy propoganda centers, while he rambles on about all kinds of things. (He really cares about you, from the weapons you use to the water you use to clean your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) You can talk to Mr. Chiffon. He wants you to make all kinds of fashionable equipment that is also the highest tier of each equipment piece. To do this you have to hunt rare animals which are very tough to kill. There is even a funny joke when you do the honey badger one.\n\nThe weapons in this game are really vast. You can change the attachments on them to show your preference. You can pick some low-caliber silenced weapons and bows if you want to go stealthy or get some LMG's and rocket launchers if you want to go ham. There is even a harpoon gun if you get the Hurk DLC, it can pin enemies to walls and send them flying off cliffs.\n\nThe characters in this game are amazing. Hurk is my favorite character, I feel like whenever I see him the "America, ♥♥♥♥ Yeah" song from Team America: World Police should be playing. He is a badass dude and is pretty funny, you get to do missions with him in his DLC and can adventure with him in Co-op. (Player 2 is Hurk) Rabi Ray Rana is really funny, he just blabbers on for like 5 minutes every time you take a mission from him. The stuff he says is pretty funny, he talks about bidets and his pet... something. Pagan Min is a great antagonist, he calls you on your walkie talkie all the time just to have a nice little chat with you, and he REALLY wants you to eat crab rangoons.\n\nAll in all, I give this game a 10/10, I have played through it twice. It is one of the best games I have ever played and I get so much enjoyment out of it. In all my time playing I still get those moments where I do something badass that I haven't ever done before and I just sit there with my mouth wide open for a minute and then I have to call one of my friends up and try (and fail) to explain how awesome it was. I always wish that I recorded my playthroughs.\n\nThank you for reading my rather long review, I hope it helps you decide to buy the game. Totally worth all the time you will put in. Please leave me a thumbs up if this helped you at all. :D","December 4, 2015","true","87.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The need to hunt different animals to craft weapon holsters and other items from animal skins (If you're against animal cruelty.. then you will die!)\n- The storyline is vast and will give you hours upon hours of gameplay. There are also many side quests that will keep you entertained if you by some miracle get bored of the other parts of the game\n\nBad;\n-None\n\nBuy this game whilst it's on sale.

I know that critics say that the prequel is better on character development and stuff but this game is better based on environment,missions and small details like skills. Overall this game is a must have with one noticable con, the game ends and thats it. It isnt like Far Cry 3 where you go home or stay. Far Cry 4 makes you king but then nothing changes. There is no noticable change in  Pagin's army nor the Kyrat movement.

It's now on my list of best games i've ever played.  It has mind blowing graphics, balls to the wall action and an addictive hunting and crafting system.  It has a fun little story and entertaining characters.  Some of the best experiences though are the ones that you create yourself such as rhino hunting with a grenade launcher from the back of an elephant.  This game ate my brain for a solid 2 weeks until I pretty much exhausted all there was to do.

The landscape is wonderful. The inventory stacks herbs rather than filling your backpack up quickly. There are lots of weapons and new items. There are honeybadgers!\nThe graphics are gorgeous and the load times fast. I played Farcry 3 mostly on PS3 although I played a fair bit on PC too. Farcry 4 runs great on my 270x GPU. So far Im very please to get the game at $35. People complain about Uplay but all it does is open up another window, its pretty unintrusive.","March 14, 2015","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You and your mother fled there to the US many years ago, but now that your mother is gone, you are here to flfill her dying wish.\n\nOn your way, you get stopped and kidnapped by the dictator, Pagan Min. Pagan seems to be a Psychopath who wants to crush the rebellious "Terrorists" and wants your help. The Terrorists, (The Golden Path) raid the temple where you are being held and free you, and bring you back to the village. From there, you can go on many different missions, buy and trade items and guns, and roam around a massive world.\n\n\nPros:\nAwesome storyline\nGreat cars/vehicles\nUser created maps of choas and lag\n50+ guns and grenades and equipment\nfun to  play with friends\nextremely (wellllllll) intellegent AI's\n\n\nCons:     (Keep in mind i can play Just Cause 2 on max settings at 80 Fps)\n\nCompared to many other big games of this time, the game plays wonderfully. If you decrease your resolution from 1980x1080 to 1366x70, your fps will increse by 20 at least. I play on medium with textures and fur on ultra, and run 35-50 fps constant.\nYou cant record unless you have a super computer due to the requirments\nMight want to take breaks every few hours or so to prevent overheat... although not likely.\n\n\nBottom line:       99/100","February 15","true","114.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a different location and some minor gameplay improvements (like you can now shoot while driving). Story is alright, nothing special. The arena is a good addition for those that just want to shoot things (wave based pit fighting). Co-op works pretty well, but it would be nice if you could co-op through the story. Performance is a good deal worse for this game though; I was able to run Far Cry 3 on max settings at 1080p ~50-60fps.

I'm not AMD user but I find this kind of partnerships don't help (to the whole market at least).\n- Weak plot twists (FC3 was too good for me)\n- At the beginning some guns are so annoying to accomplish a good long distance shot ¬¬\n- The engine works great but it has some popup problems and a few fun glitches haaha!\n\nFar Cry 4 is a worthy sequel. If you didn't play FC3 you SHOULD play both. Doesn't matter the order for me (aside a few little details) ;)  It was good to have a good Ubisoft Montreal game after ACU fiasco.

I had this game on Xbox 360 and it consumed many hours and days of my time, to no regret. I have seen many reviews stating that it's too similar to Far Cry 3 which therefore somehow makes that a bad thing. Wrong. This game still has the great "freedom & base survival" aspect to it, with a whole new country to explore.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing Far Cry 3, or similar games such as Skyrim then you will love this game.\n\nGood points;\n- The leveling system and the complexity of the skills that are available for different classes and different weapons are vast\n- You can essentially fully customize your weapons (from reticle, silencers, magazine size, scopes & customize paints)\n- Graphics are amazing if you have a machine capable of running it\n- The adrenaline feeling that as you're wondering around the island you could, at any moment, be attacked by a lion or rhino and fight for survival!\n- The "hunt & craft" aspect of the game. The need to hunt different animals to craft weapon holsters and other items from animal skins (If you're against animal cruelty.. then you will die!)\n- The storyline is vast and will give you hours upon hours of gameplay. There are also many side quests that will keep you entertained if you by some miracle get bored of the other parts of the game\n\nBad;\n-None\n\nBuy this game whilst it's on sale. Even when it's full price it was 100% worth the buy!","February 11","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know that critics say that the prequel is better on character development and stuff but this game is better based on environment,missions and small details like skills. Overall this game is a must have with one noticable con, the game ends and thats it. It isnt like Far Cry 3 where you go home or stay. Far Cry 4 makes you king but then nothing changes. There is no noticable change in  Pagin's army nor the Kyrat movement.

The open world has more to explore and many more tasks to preform. The co-op is the best ive played this year hands down. My favorite weapons are the bow which is great for silently clearing out outpost (the machete takedowns are far less powerful) and the grenade launcher which causes absolute chaos for your enemies. The vehicle combat is WAAAAY cooler thanks to the new vehicles (particularly the gyrocopter) and the ability to use sidearms while driving (did i mention grenade launchers are a sidearm?) also you can ride elephants. The elephants can crush enemy vehicles and troops like they were made from sand! The wingsuit is accessable earlier in the game which is nice for traversing the mountain terrain, also you can use grappling hooks though only on certain ledges. My only problem is the wildlife, Farcry 3 had wildlife but it wasn't nearly as annoying as its predecessor. Eagles will fly from the sky and attack you for no reason while your trying to clear an outpost, ruining any attempt at stealth and taking a good chunk of health, packs of dogs will follow you for miles and rip you to shreds, fighting them is essentially impossible because they spam attack you so much you cant even let a shot off, the only fun wildlife is the bears and tigers, they dont have major advantages over you other than being fast and deadly, thats what i want from wildlife NOT unfair, random attacks that spam you and cant be blocked (you can't even stop an eagle from attacking you and as stated dogs and wolves wont give you time enough to attack). Over all the game falls flat because of its lack of driving force and annoying wildlife. Still clearing outposts and attacking convoys is more fun than ever before. 8.5/10","December 20, 2014","true","128.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a well written story that makes you feel like your there. The amount of content that this has is ridiculous. ( In a good way) Much more than Far Cry 3. The game is extremely well optimized. Runs as good as Far cry 3 if not better. Much more guns than FC3 as well, all unique.\n\n-The Co-op-\n\nThe Co-op includes everything you would image a co-op to have. Separate side missions. Almost flawless compatibility and everything the singleplayer has except the singleplayer campaign. How the co-op works is, you go into the menu and press invite freinds. The uplay overlay will open, and you invite the friend you want. Extremely easy. Whoever is host will have the same progress as they did in the campaign. So the content he/she unlocked in the singleplayer will be transferred over to the co-op, which is a feature I like alot.\n\n-Battles of Kyrat-\n\nThis game mode is a 5v5 versus match, with a variety of game modes. You can pick from different maps, and upgrade your charter with the ingame points you get for scoring or getting kills.\n\n-Community Maps-\n\nCommuity maps are the maps other people make with the Far Cry 4 editor. Some can be good, and some not so much. But I had fun with them never the less. Pretty strait forward.\n\n-Map Editor-\n\nThe map editor is basically a simpler version of a full game engine. You can't make your own models, or textures (as far as I know) but it still isn't to restricted. You can still make some incredible maps. You have almost all the assets from the full game to use. You can change the water level, add npcs, change the skybox, and the ambient sounds, grass, trees etc.\n\n-Opinions-\n\nSo far this game has been amazing. The only really downside is some bugs here and there, but then again it didn't come out to long ago. It's a great game, and I highly recommend it.","January 14, 2015","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only downside is there is not much else to do besides the story and claiming outposts/propaganda towers. (Which there are a decent amount of them). Despite what people say about the story being terrible I actually found it quite enjoyable with the fate of Kyrat in your hands. You must think and decide who you want Kyrat's next leader to be. Both have very different values and goals so choose wisely, and in combat if you choose chaotic shoot em' up or stealthily cutting your way throught the enemies or a mix of both your bound to have an awesome time doing it.

The game is an amazing game with great graphics and gameplay.\n\nBat things about the game:\n*The game is the story line is more or less just meh. Has boring characters with unskippable cut-scenes.\n*This is one of those games that have little to no replayability. Once the campaign is over, you just have to go around collecting boxes to get that 100%.\n*Co-op is dumb. You dont play the campaign co-op, all you can do is liberate the towers, which aint that hard or fun to do together.\n*Having to install uplay is not necessary a bad thing, but its an extra step to play with someone online.\n\nThat being said, those are really the only bad things about the game. Gameplay is solid and fun. It has its unique characteristics with its own world. I recommend buying it at the current price. The DLC is not really needed, as it mainly just gives you OP weapons (pay to win). So I say the game is worth the $40 is asking atm, but I would wait for it to go on sale again, the sweet spot is at $30 if you can get it at that.","February 18","true","34.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only downside is there is not much else to do besides the story and claiming outposts/propaganda towers. (Which there are a decent amount of them). Despite what people say about the story being terrible I actually found it quite enjoyable with the fate of Kyrat in your hands. You must think and decide who you want Kyrat's next leader to be. Both have very different values and goals so choose wisely, and in combat if you choose chaotic shoot em' up or stealthily cutting your way throught the enemies or a mix of both your bound to have an awesome time doing it. I give this game 8/10. This is one pretty awesome game and i definetly reccomend it.","April 6","true","91.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've played Farcry 3 before than it's basically the same game except with a different setting and characters of course.\n\nStory  The overall plot is what exactly what you would expect from a Farcry game. In other words, you're a tourist trapped in a region of war. As the tourist, you have choices to make as you help the rebellion take down the mighty king (antagonist). Overall, same old same old plot. I completed the story after about 20 hours (according to Steam).\n\nGameplay  Along the way, there's plenty of side stuff for you to do such as take down enemy outposts (you can go guns blazing or try to be stealth about it), do other takedown side missions, use your wingsuit, go hunting, customize your weapons, enjoy the scenery etc.\n\nSound  Overall, amazing music and sound effects. All the guns sound great.\n\nGraphics  The game looks amazing, see the screenshot below for example.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=698419863\n\nPerformance  I have a 3570k @ 4.1Ghz, GTX 780 SC, 16 GB of RAM, @ 1440p and perfomance was better than I expected on Ultra.

The other villains in the story, while not quite like Buck (good and bad), were very well done.\n\nDifferences between Pagan and Vas, spoiler free.  Pagan is much more...sentimental than Vas ever was.  And that's good, it makes him compelling and makes me want to know more about him and why he's  such a fascinting evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Yet there are a few things wrong with him, unlike Vas.  I don't fear him, at all, which is good cause it makes him more Hannibal Lectorish.  But, you know, kinda a let down after the intense fear and rush that is Vas.\n\nWhat kills the game, story wise, is Amita and Sabal.  I despise them.  They're boring, they make me WORK, I don't feel like a liberator with them I feel like a mercenary stuck between two ♥♥♥♥♥♥ managers.  At least Citra was a compelling option and character for an ending.  And their endings (don't worry I'm spoiler free) are...lame.  It's really bad when I spend the entire  gme thinking, damn I really want something, anything else than what I'm forced to do for this exciting yet forced story.\n\nPersonally, the next DLC should be a third option for the game ending (make it worth that season pass price) like Fallout New Vegas No Gods No Masters, or simply ally with Pagan himself.\n\nGameplay, smoother than 3, but the side quests are SO BORING.  Main story is okay, but god damn I hate the side quests.  So tedious, uninteresting, and LONG.   Cept the fashion quests and SOME of the Thanka quests (not all because again BORING), play the game to see why, that was some excellent level designing.\n\nOne other major complaint, other than weapons, LOOT IS LAME.  Unless you're upgrading your gear or trying to get a specific weapon, there's really no incentive for side quests.\n\nThat would be one thing to compliment, as usual, some of the best level designing I've seen in a game.  Love the weapons, love the vertibird, and the environment is perfect.  I could spend days being a primal hunter (ahhhh get it?)\n\nI will say this, for ubisoft, for a PC port, not bad.  No major problems and very few crashes.  That being said, it's pretty bad I have to say that about a Triple A game producer.  Yeah I remember Assassin's Creed Unity, and while I think Assassin's Creed is boring and haven't played a single one past three I WILL NEVER LET YOU LIVE IT DOWN.\n\nAll in all....hard to quantify this result but would definitely give it a 7.7/10.  Pretty good game, could be better, but worth a play through.  Work on day story tho.\n\n","May 29","true","78.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As it stands though, out of the "box" this game is broken, thus the "no" recommendation. I believe in due time and multiple software patches it'll live up to it's predecessor, which is why I also want to give a "yes" recommendation too.\n\nI see its potential, but as it stands now it's not worth the price of admission.\n\nWhat kills me is that many of these problems are obvious if this game had any semi-rigorous beta test: Key binding failure, lock-ups on loading, doesn't play nice with certain USB peripherals. These problems presented themselves to the public as soon as the software was unlocked. Why weren't they noticed at testing? Were they only testing the console editions and skipped the PC?\n\nImmediate and catastrophic failure of the software generally means there was a failure at the business level too. Ubisoft has failed it's customer base again with this failed launch and the problems with their Assasin's Creed: Unity fiasco. This title was clearly rushed, and possibly skipped beta testing, to meet an arbitrary market date. Based on what I've seen in the forums here and at Ubisoft, their lack of responsiveness and clear hostility towards making a good product, I highly recommend waiting to purchase this, and any other Ubisoft title, until it's market proven and on deep discount.","November 18, 2014","false","247.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful and the cut-scenes are very well done (although a "skip" button would be helpful, especially later on when replaying). Game play is similar to FC3 but that's not a bad thing.\n\nWhat makes the game essentially unplayable at the moment is the inability to save when you want to and the tendancy of the game to not restore checkpoints on reloads. This means you are replaying the same bits over and over for no reason.\n\nWorse is the complete stuffup on keyboard movement. There is simply no way to step backwards (seriously Uplay, seriously?) and other keys just plain don't work which leaves you stuck on ropes with no way to go up or down.

It ran smooth enough on my R9 290. The story in this game is superb and I rather enjoyed Pagan Min's unique personality. The graphics are top notch, the sound its top notch. There were a few bugs here and there and framedrops every now and again but that could be because it's not optmized for AMD graphics cards.

What worked in FC3 is carried into FC4 with a handful of improvements, a beautiful new environment, and some of the most stylish characters in the franchise. I doubt you will find another villian like Pagan Min anywhere else.\n\nWhile parts of the story and game fall through and is sometimes disappointing and confusing, it does not cease to impress and entertain, and is ultimately a fun game to play. Especially after ubisoft's poor track record, this game is a breath of fresh air & possibly a step in the right direction.

Everything you could want from a game was there. But the storyline itself was awful. It didn't really have any build to it and you'd find yourself hunting animals or doing side quests rather than the story line because it was so dry and content deprived. The game itself is great, and i bet it would be particularly fun playing with a friend in co-op. However, if you are a gamer who likes a good story line like me and likes to be able to connect with the characters.

The FC3-story itself wasn't extremely good, but basicly ok and lived by the great characters. FC4 also tries to create some interesting characters, but fails to compare to FC3 yet again.\nSince Farcry 3 was an excellent game, Farcry 4 copy pasted nearly everything over and reskinned it with a new story arc. As sequels go, the motto "If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it" seems to work here. Great game, but no replay value.

People say it is too much like Far Cry 3, but I say Far Cry 3 was a great game, but Far cry 4 is an AWESOME game. It literally improves every aspect of the game. They might not be changed, but they're definitely  improved. For instance, the general UI/HUD/Menus are all way better; swapping weapons is smoother, controls are better, menus are cleaner. The graphics/atmosphere are waaay better. The shading of this game is, in practice, much better, and the color scheme is infinitely more appealing than the straight greens/blues of Far Cry 3. In this one you'll see every color, and none feel out of place. The whole world is vibrant and so beautiful, in a way not many games can claim to be. The only one I've seen challenge this level of atmospere and world beauty is The Witcher 3, which is one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nAlso important, are the additional tools of this game. Not all are necessary, but...this game is meant to be fun, not practical. If you want practical, play Far Cry 2. I think its a blast to charge an elephant through an enemy base, or to fly a helicopter into an enourmous fortress, or to stealth through a level using my throwing knives.\n\nThe game just feels better in every way, it's things you notice only when you go back to play 3. Like how you can't shoot out of cars in 3, or how you can't move dead bodies. Or ride a ♥♥♥♥ing elephant. But when you notice them it's hard to enjoy 3 as much.

Damn it Ubi, give us Restart button just like in sidequest!\n\nCon :\n1. Dear Customer, So you got 16:10 monitor? Well, ♥♥♥♥ you! Here's black bar on top and bottom for you. With Love, Ubisoft.\n2. Forget the story.. it's silly and plot holes everywhere, maybe bigger than the plot itself.\n3. Too much to do.. My first 50 hours I played to be perfect, completing every side quest, activities etc.. then I got tired and don't remember what's the campaign is about. After that, I just rushed it to the end. Don't get me wrong. It's repetitive but fun. I guess too much of good things could take you away from the story.\n4. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate any 'spititual mission, where you kill demons, in a dream, shang-rilla, or high on drugs. whatever.. I just don't care.\n5. Out of place characters.. Yogie and Reggie? Hurk? Longinus? and that radio DJ thats talks too americanish? Hell, almost every of them!\n6. Am I the only one here disturbed that this country "Kryrat" is nothing like a country at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/witide/recommended/298110/","witide","WITIDE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/witide/","374 products in account","this was good fun, but it has its drawbacks.  it's a ubisoft title, which means (like other ubisoft titles around this release) you'll be doing a lot of climbing towers to unveil parts of the map, finding lots of collectibles, and raiding strongholds of your enemy.  i'm not certain this is a bad thing, since the formula seems to work and it's fairly fun and easy to play, but it's not a totally original experience if you're searching for that. :)\n\nthe game will lead you through a decently interesting story to what i felt to be a satisfying enough conclusion.  a few hours into the game, the world map size will effectively double, and the new area will be full of more difficult enemies.  i found this to be a nice but somewhat anticipated surprise.  exploring the map was fun during my downtime, just walking around and finding things to climb up and find collectibles and secret areas.  there are some very pretty vistas in this game.\n\nthe wingsuit was a blast, when you find the right tall mountain to jump off of to go to your next destination.  i would often find myself fast-travelling to a tall place instead of a nearby place, just to fly part of the way there.\n\nthe vehicle takedowns are nice and smooth.  the auto-drive option is also very nice if you're doing a lot of back and forth. you can appreciate the scenery or take a drink while you're en route to your destination if you'd like.\n\nthe co-op, while implemented and certainly entertaining with a friend, i did not find to be particularlly complete.  you cannot do story missions while in co-op, you can only raid strongholds that you have not done before.  you cannot redo strongholds you've already done in either your singleplayer or multiplayer game without resetting all the strongholds permanently.  you can find collectibles and climb map discovery towers as well, so there's plenty to do, but once you run out of stuff there's not much more to go on in co-op.\n\ni would have really liked the ability to go on story missions with a friend and both advance our game together.  even if this seems to break the narrative of a single man changing the country, i think i could live with that in exchange for doing it with a friend.","June 17, 2015","true","57.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been playing this game a lot lately and overall, I really enjoy the game, great move up from FarCry 3. A few things I don't necesarilly like are: There being mingames that involve racing, I bought the game to shoot people and blow ♥♥♥♥ up, not race. If I wanted to race I'd play need for speed. Another thing I didn't really care for is the mini games that involve giving up the weapons I've spent countless hours unlocking and customizing for a plane ♥♥♥ shotgun or Ak-47 that I can find absolutely everywhere, why kill someone with a knife when I can eliminate 5-10 of them with my Buzzsaw in about a second. Also, the missions where you are forcefully drugged and sent into a world of pointlessness where you kill the same people over and over, I don't even know what drug would do that to you. Last thing I didn't care for is the missions that forced me to be blindsided by an enemy and having my gear removed from me, then spending the next hour trying to sneak around to get it back, not fun. Altho, it may seem as though I have alot to complain about but, for me there is too much to list that I DO like. Love this game!

If they make another one it will be very hard to top this.\n\nIf you thought far cry 3 was good far cry 4 fixes everything wrong about it AND does everything better. Pagan Min, the best Antagonist/Protagonist(depends on how you view him) I have ever seen, even better than Vaas. The enemies range from kamikazeing into you to strategically drawing you out of cover with a grenade, still not that many enemy types though. Shooting while driving is a new thing, except its hard if you don't have auto-aim on and you can only use side arm weapons like pistols. Lots and lots different of side missions to do if you finished the campaign. Karma is new for it give you discounts and unlocks weapons and skills. Map size is pretty dam big and driving has become smoother than far cry 3 (but sometimes I can't stand the radio guy). Flyable helicopters, throwing knifes and grappling are new. Super amazing graphics(what a time we live in!)\n\nWhen you skin animals you get bait which you can throw to attract predators to kill enemies. But there are also a new enemy called hunters that can only be tagged for three seconds and can charm predators to attack you, plus there is a whole new strategy for taking camps because the harder ones now have, mortars, machine guns, heavys, snipers, hunters and pyros.\n\nThere are large amounts of weapons to unlock, with some of them being even more ridiculously over powered then if far cry 3.The choices in the game are a great new feature, for you have to decide between two people both of which have major faults.\n\nThe plot is a bit weird because you come to deliver your mom's ashes to this place and to get there you turn into a mass murdering, animal slaying warrior that everyone solely depends on.\n\nPagan Min's character and personality is some of the most intricate design I'v ever seen, and I would say he is one of the best character's in video games. Him plus some of my favourite weapons like the grenade launcher, crossbow and the machine pistol makes this a hard game to top for me (now if only they had some more melee weapon, like a katana) 9/10","April 3, 2015","true","74.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Beautiful graphics at Ultra (playing on i54690, GTX 970, 1080p)\n2. Game mechanic that works really well.\n3. Conquering outpost/fortress/rescuing hostage/assassination is so fun. I did that fully on stealth (undetected) using arrow/takedown only. Yeah everytime I'm spotted in outpost/fortress, I commit suicide to restart. Damn it Ubi, give us Restart button just like in sidequest!\n\nCon :\n1. Dear Customer, So you got 16:10 monitor? Well, ♥♥♥♥ you! Here's black bar on top and bottom for you. With Love, Ubisoft.\n2. Forget the story.. it's silly and plot holes everywhere, maybe bigger than the plot itself.\n3. Too much to do.. My first 50 hours I played to be perfect, completing every side quest, activities etc.. then I got tired and don't remember what's the campaign is about. After that, I just rushed it to the end. Don't get me wrong. It's repetitive but fun. I guess too much of good things could take you away from the story.\n4. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate any 'spititual mission, where you kill demons, in a dream, shang-rilla, or high on drugs. whatever.. I just don't care.\n5. Out of place characters.. Yogie and Reggie? Hurk? Longinus? and that radio DJ thats talks too americanish? Hell, almost every of them!\n6. Am I the only one here disturbed that this country "Kryrat" is nothing like a country at all. No asphalt road, no economic, no housings, a 'city' in Kyrat is just a few houses.

Not only do the inability to heal bugs plague multiplayer, in single player vehicle missions are extremely difficult to complete because half of the time they bug out. I've had cars fly in mid air and when I got out the game crashed. It's also possible to drive vehicles into safe areas (cities) only to have the car freeze and become permanently immobile. This is only scratching the surface when it comes to the amount of bugs I've encountered. I'm waiting on a patch before I ever go back to multiplayer.\n\nAnother issue with the game is its illusion of choice ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and its anticlimatic villain. When it comes to selecting a side to fight for, you don't even know what decision to make as both seem reasonable. Only after the mission do you get to hear the other side's reasons as to why you're a terrible person for making the decision. When it comes to the main villain, let's just say he kills people that you couldn't possibly care enough about. Pagan definitely didn't have enough character development and the final confrontation felt rushed.","December 8, 2014","false","34.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is a complete slide show and the only way I can hold 60 FPS is to turn everything to low and turn off every option  that can be turned off.  The mouse movement in the game is some of the worst I have ever seen.  This game is a clunky stuttering mess.  Any thing less that 58 FPS looks horrible with vsync on or off.  Anything above 60 which is rare, the game tears massively.  The performance in this game is the  worst I have seen from any game in my steam library or otherwise.

Most games, even small indie productions, have worked flawlessly. When bugs or crashes have occured they have been few and far between.\nAfter having played Far Cry 4 for exactly 9.5 hours I can honestly say I have never been this disappointed in a game I bought from you. Even though the game seems to be on par with Far Cry 3 in production quality it is completely unplayable. Black screens, grey screens and random crashes during the most trivial gameplay occur constantly. I waited for the patch that was released today with great expectations but it did nothing to solve the crashes. 12 minutes after starting the game today it crashes to the desktop.\nThere is nothing to blame in terms of hardware. All other games from you work without a glitch. All software, Adobe CC 2014, AutoCad and multimedia perform without any errors.

The open world shooter platform is fun, the vehicles in the game are pretty interesting (other than they all go the exact same speed), and the grappling hook in a mountanious terrain makes running around and exploring worthwhile. The weapons and the customizations with them are also entertaining, but the skills leave a lot to be desired (I ended up having stacks of 10 skill points saved up because I couldn't spend them due to some skills requiring mission unlocks).\n\nThe characters in the game are for the most part good, but there's also some dialog scenes and character development that have their WTF moments. I would say in all the missions were relatively entertaining, albeit very adult in nature. The in-game currency is also valuable as you use it to buy weapons / ammo, and it is possible to run out of it, but not likely.\n\nWith all that said, lets get to the bugs / oversights in the game (and I'm sure I'm missing a lot too).\n\nFirst, you can't easily switch weapons after starting a mission. So if your mission requires that you need a rocket launcher to take out a vehicle, there's no real way to get one other than trekking back to an outpost to switch weapons to a rocket launcher, which isn't fun at all, or sometimes impossible if you die and you are at a checkpoint which wont allow you to go back.\n\nSecond, the keybinds don't make sense for someone with keyboard and mouse. Like, you can press and hold Q, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and bring up the weapon select popup window, but you can't bind individual weapons or slots to any of those keys... makes no sense. The game was designed with a controller in mind, but they could have put in the extra 2 hours of thought to do it better. I could be wrong on this, but if it is possible, it's not intuitive at all.\n\nThird, I'm going to go into a lot of multiplayer issues, and this section is pretty long. To start, how the hell do you make a multiplayer game that has no chat. I know there's a voice chat feature, but I've never been able to get it to work. I've only had one guy talk to me in game, and even though my binds are correct and my mic works, I couldn't talk back to him. If this one feature worked correctly, or if there was text chat, the game would be infinitely more enjoyable. It sucks when you're playing with someone and you can't discuss tactics to conquer an outpost of complete a mission. Huge oversight / mistake. This makes the game quite frustrating in practice. Next up, lets talk about the FOV when riding as a passenger in a vehicle. I don't know if this bug is due to me having the FOV cranked up to the highest setting, but whenever I ride as a passenger in a vehicle, unless I am zooming/scoping a gun from the passenger seat, my FOV changes to something like 180, and it looks like I'm viewing the game through an extreme fisheye lens. This makes me pretty nauseas when it happens, and vehicle travel is essential in the game. This leads to another common problem... half the time in multiplayer, my keybinds wont work... example: I can't enter a vehicle, there's no little popup to let me get in the vehicle, and if I press the key to normally get in a vehicle, I can't get in it. I have to completely restart the game to fix this sometimes, and with the way the game is setup, you can't just start playing with the same person again, it's off to search for another partner in matchmaking and hope it doesn't happen again. This bug happens about 50% of the time I play coop, which is stupid. It's not limited to entering vehicles... I've had my camera key stop working, the key to switch weapons stop working, almost every every in-game bind stop working except for maybe WASD, thats about it. Hugely disappointing. Then there's the ammo bug, where you'll enter a game with full ammo in multiplayer, and then have a fraction of that ammo available. So you go and refill your ammo (which is quite expensive), and then have the same thing happen again the next game. I realized after paying a ton of money to refill my ammo and saying forget it, that if I waited for a long enough time in game, my ammo would magically appear. Pretty frustrating to say the least.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say the game was probably not worth the money. The bugs / game oversights I mentioned above really turned me from someone who liked the concept of the game into someone who isn't a huge fan of the devs / ubisoft for what they left out. Just the lack of multiplayer chat is a gameplay dealbreaker, and tie that in with the bugs I listed and the ones I forgot about, and you get a half-baked game release. I'd say still get the game if you like what you've seen in trailers / gameplay, but wait till it goes on sale and hope they fixed the bugs.","December 2, 2014","false","55.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But Far Cry 4 fixed what Far Cry 3 did wrong, the small things such as balancing issues, but they also added a completely more emotional storyline. It begins as a small mission to scatter your mother's ashes (which, if you wait for Min for 13 minutes at the beginning instead of leaving, you can do), but then spirals into a mission to kill him to free Kyrat and its people.

The purpose of THIS review is to give me an opportunity to organize my own thoughts about it. I have played all Far Cry games on PC (Far Cry and Far Cry 2, multiple times. And don’t forget the awesome Far Cry: Blood Dragon). Far Cry 4 is very similar in concept to Far Cry 3 – both very large open world games in which the protagonist, (unskilled, inexperienced, unequipped) struggles against the brutal tyranny of a charming psychopath. Although I enjoyed Far Cry 3 from beginning to end, Far Cry 4 got off to a very rocky start for me. But first the good stuff.\n\nThe implementation of stealth is very well done in this game. I say this after just finishing Crysis 3 in which there was no stealth. In Crysis 3, if you weren’t cloaked while crouched and peeking around a corner, you would be instantly fired upon by soldiers or aliens a half mile away. Ridiculous! Not so in Far Cry 4. And you really need to be stealthy in Far Cry 4. The good news is that stealthy behavior pays off a lot. Don’t need no freaking nano suit.\n\nElephants. One of the most fun elements of the game, riding elephants. You have to pay for this as a skill. So, work up to it. Elephants are a very safe and practical way to move across the map. Encounter an enemy patrol, no problem. Run the elephant into them and melee with the elephant’s trunk. You can destroy oncoming enemy vehicles head on. Loads of fun. Elephants also provide great protection against the multitudes of predators that menace the landscape. And even while dismounted, nearby elephants act on your behalf with close encounters involving harassments by enemies.\n\nShangri-La missions. Although the main story is fine, I especially enjoyed the five missions to Shangri-La. I hadn’t read about the game beforehand and I was very surprised by these missions. I especially appreciated the expose’ and enactment of the battle to wrest control over Shangri-La from the forces of evil. I was joined by a svelte ally for most of the missions. Arena style battles here and very, very challenging. Yet beautiful and enchanting.\n\nGhale Homstead. Reminded me of the Hearthfire DLC in Skyrim. You need to find this location, and it takes some doing to get there. Once established, you can pay for upgrades. One of the best upgrades is the option to purchase a buzzer – little gyrocopter. Buzzers are awesome ways to travel and scout out unexplored territory, but they are hard to find as just random drops. But once you own one, just fast travel to the Ghale homestead and climb in.\n\nDJ Rabi Ray Rana. I really enjoyed the mindless chatter coming out of the radios. I know some players hated this guy, but I loved him. He injected some interesting and positive energy in what was otherwise a dreary and hopeless existence. Most of all, I loved the music that accompanied his show. I am still looking for a playlist of his music.\n\nWeapons. As always, there are amazing weapons choices, but (as always) you have to build up to them. My favorite sidearm was the Auto-Cross. This is an automatic mini-crossbow. It is a silent one-shot killer and it is indispensable in the times before acquiring a silenced sniper rifle. I loved this thing and I never stopped carrying it. Still carried my bow, but for long-distance silent kills, the Auto-Cross excelled.\n\nGrappling hook. It was awesome. Easy to use (after some practice). Never glitched.\n\nLore. The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional country nestled between India and the Himalayan Mountains. The game’s setting is filled with ancient lore and beautiful traditional art from the region – paintings, statues of hindu deities, and shrines. The value and importance of the region’s beliefs and heritage becomes a critical consideration later in the game. I chose to preserve it.\n\nEthnic origins. It was pretty obvious that the Adherents and soldiers of the Golden Path were of Indian (or thereabouts) descent and the Royal Army was of Chinese origin. Accents and even expressions in native tongues revealed this difference. Somewhat mirroring the ongoing struggle in Nepal between natives of Tibet and Chinese from the north.\n\nNoore’s Arena. Meh. Hunger Games style battles with supporters tossing in resources for you. The public address commentary is sensational and perfectly captures the depraved sentiment of the event. But after a few rounds, the arena becomes a grind to unlock weapons. You make a little money but not much. In order to unlock the much coveted Bushman silenced assault rifle, you need to achieve level 10 in the arena. I chose not to. It would be hours of formulaic running, gunning and healing. Not for me.\n\nNow, some of the problems I had with the game. Let’s start with the main quest. In a word, fragmented. On reflection after finishing the game, the main quest seemed uncohesive, not pulled together. It kinda just went… “wherever.” For example, it seemed that after completing a main quest challenge, then afterwards for a time, there was nothing. No more challenges, no place to go. I suppose this “down time” might have been intended to give me a chance to explore the vast map, but I just felt a little too much set adrift. Then suddenly a new main quest challenge would pop up on the map. I eventually got used to this and it was fine. But overall, the story and action did not naturally cohere. It’s like reading a book and finishing a chapter. Then turn the page and there’s nothing but a blank page and several more after that. Then after a few more blank pages, you discover the next chapter.\n\nHere is an example. As you might expect, there was the obligatory betrayal and imprisonment episode. Not surprising. But after the escape (which was a big ordeal and a really hard challenge), there was nothing. No response or comment by the antagonist. No, “I’ll get you for escaping my prison!” One day I was in his prison. The next I was out. And life just went on as if it had never happened. Lame.\n\nFlying and falling glitches. One of the iconic activities of Far Cry games are the hang gliders. But I was conditioned to stop using them in Far Cry 4. Often I would just die immediately after deployment. I mean instantly. No collision, just falling and death. Wingsuit too. Jump off a cliff and hit the control to deploy the wingsuit (Shift key in my case) and nothing. No wingsuit just falling and death. The only device that worked reliably was the parachute. They really screwed up this joyful mechanic in this game.\n\nDogs. In some regions, the landscape is “hounded” by packs and packs of wild dogs. To the extent that it becomes boorish. Each pack has four or five and each dog takes nearly a full clip from an assault rifle to kill. There is just no way to walk terrain in these areas. Always need a jeep or an elephant. Which sucked because I prefer to walk most of the time. Thankfully, most regions don’t have dogs but they were present in enough places to give me a sad. In the S.T.A.L.K.E.R, games there were dogs too, but one headshot would kill them, and THEY were mutated super dogs. So, the implementation of wild dogs in Far Cry 4 was dumb.\n\nOverall and despite some minor complaints, Far Cry 4 matched and in some cases exceeded its predecessors. The landscape is the most beautiful I can remember playing on. The bot AI was masterful. The choices I have as a player are enormous. Stealth, grappling hook, Auto Cross, elephants, buzzer, Shangri-La and I almost forgot, Yogi and Reggie help make this game very worthwhile.\n","January 11, 2015","true","136.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As the saying goes "if it's not broken don't fix it."\n\nNow there's plenty to like about this game I mean for one it's set in a fictional Himalayan country a cross between Nepal and India, it screams culture. The story is great with the awesome new addition of making choices it's light but still works, playing solo missions took about 16-18 hours. There's also coop free roam and side quests which take up a whole lot of time as well, it's hard to say how long it takes but I have spent more than 10 hours messing about with friends, so the length of the game is more than good. There's tonnes of user and graphics options to mess with which is really good to see, the keyboard and mouse work perfect fully rebindable and so does a controller but that only has presets. There's a bunch of the good old stuff to see here too like hunting, crafting, weapon customization etc with a few new things to see here and there, some of the new things to note down are choppers, grappling hooks etc. The soundtrack is awesome and so are the sound effects for everything else. The voice acting is great too my favorite is Sabel voiced by "Naveen Andrews" from the show Lost. They nailed the navigation down it's simple and easy to follow and they even added an auto drive feature for cars. Lastly the map is huge there's just so much going on, different zones for different things there's even cool little instances to go to the Himalayas and stuff like that.\n\nA few bad things I didn't like though was firstly the game starts of it's cinematics in full screen then right after the prologue chucks all of them into a black bordered mode small gripe which annoyed me. I really liked the new villain Pagan Min he wasn't Vaas but he was still damn good, it's just a shame he doesn't show up much at all in the game... Now with all the options this game has it was a little odd to see that the game only has a master slider for volume which is fine but it would have been nice to have more options.\n\nIt's not the perfect game and I can't blame it, after all it did come out after Far Cry 3 and that would be hard to beat. If you just want something more after Far Cry 3 then this game is right up your alley it scratches that itch and gives you everything you'd want from a Far Cry game.","August 28, 2015","true","32.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

They are probably what makes this game pop and what makes battles/skirmishes so fantastic. The graphics and textures are amazing on all settings, and just like explosions color settings make this game truly an artistic masterpiece. The gameplay does have quite a similar likeness to the previous game. But it looks and feels different. The weaponry is very bold and even looks, sounds, and feels good. The missions are very unique and are not even remotely similar to others. The characters are very real and each have a personality of their own. (Except for the usual infantry/rebels)  I also absolutely love the new addon's in FC4, such as the special weaponry, mini heli, riding elephants, etc. Overall this game gets a 8.6/10and is easily worth the $49.99","March 14, 2015","true","75.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"
