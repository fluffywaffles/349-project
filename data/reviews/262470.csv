As far as I can tell (I'm just about an hour in right now), the storyline is pretty much stock fantasy, but I wouldn't come to a game like this looking for complex moral judgements and deep allegories for our time. The characters are all fully voiced, and the acting is pretty good. The character art is fantastic. The level designs are easy on the eyes as well.\nConsidering the price vs. the amount of fun to be had in this game, Rollers of the Realm is a pretty good buy.\n\nOn another note, I'm finding the gameplay somewhat reminiscent of Wizorb - if you've played this game, RotR is probably right up your alley as well.","November 18, 2014","true","5.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","1"

Just a note, i didn't finish the game, played through half of it.\n\nNow I'm not a major pinball person, only playing the space pinball game that was pre-installed on Windows XP, playing it when i should have been doing my school homework, and that was just a fun score-based pinball game, but with Rollers of the Realm, it has a focus on story, characters, with abilities and damage/healing numbers. Also, your balls are your characters, with good voice acting (fully voice acted by the way), and with different looks, size, and physics.\n\nNow from what I've played, and the future levels I've yet to finish, and the extra replayable content after that, priced at 10$, i see this, as a person who only played a digital pinball game years ago, as a good purchase if you're into pinball games, with this one having a considerably big, and arguably good, different approach too it.\n\nShamless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","November 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/262470/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","Rollers of the Realm is a pinball RPG.  Sorta...  Basically, instead of plain pinball tables to play, you've got these areas that look like a village courtyard with flippers and bumpers on the sides of it. You use Mana points to enable certain special abilities, and gain mana by bumping into various targets on the field. There are also people milling about as obstacles or enemies.  Depending on the story, bumping your ball into people may attack them or it may merely rob them of some gold.  In some cases, enemies sap you of mana points.\n\nYou start out with the lowly thief with a heart of gold and her trusty dog sidekick.  As you play through the story new characters are added and you have the option of hiring other characters (once every 4 levels). Each character has their own special ability, and you can use these abilities to add extra balls to the table, or prevent the ball from draining from the playfield (depending on character). There's also a store to buy new equipment which adds to your character's abilities.  Thankfully you can return to each level after completing the story part and attempt to farm some extra gold.\n\nThere's also two levels of difficulty...casual and challenge mode. I had originally thought that challenge mode would remove the ability to change the ball direction with the analog stick, but apparently this is not so.  I guess the enemies are just tougher and the traps may be easier to set off.\n\nTraps?  Well, there's at least one level where after a certain number of times the ball hits it, the barrier will disappear leaving a way for the ball to exit the playfield (thus "killing" your character).  Thankfully, you can easily revive them later in the game, and if there's no immediate danger (enemies on the playfield) losing the ball doesn't kill your character off.  It also seems to revive characters between levels so it's not like it kills the character off for good or anything.\n\nThings I like about this gameIt's Pinball! Though the focus is more on story than score\nIt's got RPG elements.\nThe art style is cartoony, but it fits the medieval theme well enough\nThe music does a good job of staying in the background while still accenting the action in the game\nThe voice acting is pretty good.\nYou can change the difficulty at any time\nThings I didn't like about this gameThe story and characters are a bit cliche at times\nA few of the characters voice actors don't say exactly what the subtitles say (minor quibble)\nCasual mode is maybe a bit too casual. I'd like a bit more challenge without it being a drag\nChallenge mode is still pretty casual\nAll in all though, the game is good fun and worthy of spending your time on.  If you're a big fan of a challenging pinball game, well, this is a bit too soft, but if you're a fan of pinball and you love a good story, then check it out.","September 4, 2015","true","5.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/262470/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","Rollers of the Realm is one of those games that seems to be based on a dare.  "What if we combined an RPG with a Pinball game," which needless to say is a rare thing to see in games  Much like Puzzle question and other fusion games before it, pinball or no, the real question is "does the fusiion work?"\n\nThe short form?  Rather well.\n\nRollers of The Realm has the characters represented as balls. Some are small and fast,others big and slow.  Some are easy to put "tilt" on, some can't be redirected so easily.  All of them have a unique special ability.  Surprisingly, this works, and allows you to develop a lot of strategies, and solve puzzles by . . . forgive me . . . juggling the right balls.\n\nThe game is as such - go to an area, enter a board.  There you can find all sorts of things you have to deal with to win -  enemies to attack, obstacles to overcome, puzzles to figure out environments to navigates, and other challenges to face.  Ramming a character into an enemy attacks it.  Striking some objects raises mana to use special abilities.  Some characters can even derive mana or gold from some targets in the field.  And there are seemingly inaccessible areas that you can get to with the right combination of characters, wits, and flipper-usage.  There are also keys to find and treasures to unlock.\n\nBy the way, characters who exit the field often die (until ressurected) and flippers can be damanged.  So you don't always have time to just sit there and try things over and over, and losing a ball can be very traumatic to your strategy.\n\nSurprisingly it works - it's a pinball puzzler with some resource management and combat-like elements - and, of course, boss monsters.  It also allows for bite-sized play as any one board doesn't take very long, and they can be revisited for more loot and exploration.\n\nAt it's core, it's pretty clever, but there's also an actual plot and character backstory.  Nothing epic, but it adds to the game as characters have motivations you understand - and as this is a game that is representing characters as colorful spheres, kind of needed.  The voice acting is decent to good, and thankfully lacks overdramatic elements - plus the characters sometimes make witty remarks during play that provide more atmosphere.\n\nThe game does lack in a few areas - character status screens are minimal and special abilities aren't always well explained.  Font choices on status screens are also a bit tough to read.  A few boards are rather dull or their layots not always clear.  Documentation is virtually nonexistent (even though, yes, it's basically RPG Pinball, so its a bit simple).\n\nHowever, these are minimal criticism in that, for $9.99 American you get an excellent fusion RPG that makes its seemingly insane premise work well, nicely done visuals and character portrayals, and enjoyable pinball puzzles to solve.  A precice game that delivers exactly what is promises, does it well, and throws in some surprises.\n\nA definite buy for fans of unusual RPGs and game mechanic experiments, and something to consider for a gift for people with a taste for the unusual.","November 21, 2014","true","2.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

I pick it up, poke it 'til most of the fun comes out, and move on to other work or play. Most of the time, I don't really feel like a game would be worth reviewing--I'd either be one of the many, or I wouldn't be able to review it in a positive manner.\nRollers of the Realm made me rethink this, for 2 major reasons. Now, I'm a pessimist at heart, so I'll start with the lesser reason first:\nThis is not a long game. Normally, I wouldn't have an issue with this in an indie game for $10, but I draw the line here. I'm just beginning to feel like I know what's the what in the game, only to discover my playthrough is over 90% complete, and I STILL don't know what the handy hired help skills do. So let this be an illustration: the amount of gameplay here is small, but the depth is huge. They set out for RPinballG, and they succeeded. Clever/smooth mechanics, and they succeeded. Graphics that don't leave you frustrated halfway through with mind numbing repetition? success.\n\nNow, why is being short an issue to me if this game has so much going for it? It's actually because of Reason #2: The levels, the gameplay, every second of my first playthrough of this game was one thing: exquisite (okay...there might've been a little corny voice acting...but what fantasy game doesn't have it?), and lo and behold, I go back to see some of the unique levels/scenarios again, but find them to be locked (all bosses except the final ones can only be defeated once each playthrough). In case I haven't been clear: I want the story to go on, I'm actually interested in these characters which aren't just cookie-cut archetypes. I'm interested in a puzzle that challenges my MIND, instead of my reflexes...(some of them were close), but most of all, it seems like Phantom Compass mastered the mechanics they wanted to use, applied them well, but hasn't gotten to use everything in its bag'o'tricks yet.\n\n--\nEagerly awaiting DLC/Sequel!","November 20, 2014","true","13.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The concept is what originally caught my attention. A combination of pinball and RPG elements, how is that going to work? Well, it probably shouldn't, but in this case it does.\n\nThe quirky pinball characters are unique and even funny. There's great replayability here, too, as you'll need to decide which character, or ball, is best suited to a task, considering width, height, weight, and special abilities, like healing, increased damage, or special attacks.The graphics are beautiful, and the controls are responsive. There is a challenge to some of these areas and puzzles, too, so experienced pinball players and puzzle enthusiasts should find plenty to appreciate here.\n\nIt's evident that a lot of time and attention went into the detail for the characters, environment, clothing, speech, and story. The outcome is a very consistent experience that's easy to get into and enjoyable. Gamers of all ages should consider giving ROTR a try.\n\nOne thing that I want to point out is that there is an interruption in flow as new goals are met or characters are introduced for the first time, and that can seem awkward at first. However, that interruption is part of the story and RPG aspect of the game, so it's definitely necessary, and it's easy to get used to. Afterward, the pinball gameplay is uninterrupted, and players can revisit areas to obtain loot or treasure they might have missed, without repeating the story. This is certainly not a negative, but it is something I noticed that others are very likely to experience. It was awkward for me at first, and I wondered if I was going to be able to enjoy the pinballing aspect of the game. I hung with it, though, and soon that wasn't even a consideration.\n\nI'm fascinated by this game, and I applaud the developers for taking such a bold risk by pairing these gaming elements into one cohesive experience. I intend to play this game again, and I hope to see more.\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","February 21","true","37.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Unfortunately,  I don't think this game is going to make pinball fans or those looking for an RPG happy.\n\nFor starters, there's just not much there in terms of what you'd expect from an RPG. You can buy some upgrades that make very little difference to how the individual balls perform, and you cand spend a bunch of gold on buying another party member. That's about all. It's very thin if you're looking for any kind of character customization, which could be forgiven if the other aspect of the game - the pinball - was stellar.\n\nIt isn't. This game's idea of a good pinball table seems to be stationary targets that you have to hit over and over - and over and over- and when you finally "kill" one, another comes out to stand in the exact same place. Instead of interesting shots and modes like you'd expect in any real pinball table, you get to bounce off these targets a few inches from the flippers again and again. Honestly, the weakest tables in Pinball FX are more entertaining.\n\nLike I said, I like the concept. I hope either these developers or someone else gets to take another crack at it, and before they do I hope they play some better pinball tables.","December 25, 2014","false","2.8"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","26","40","0","5"

They've added a checkpointing system to alleviate it, but the last boss is just insane compared to the rest of the game.\n\nSee, for most levels you're able to use any of your characters, because they all have different uses. In the last stage though, there's a series of three different levels, each with three boss enemies - and only one of your characters is capable of dealing significant damage to them.\n\nFor the first two bosses, that's fine; you just clear out the board a bit, then pull out the special character and poke them until they die. If your special character dies, it's no big deal; you can just gather mana with someone else and revive them. It's not fast, but you make consistent progress.\n\nFor the third boss, though, you just can't do that. This boss has two special attacks: he does something which causes a lot of damage, and he does something else that drains your mana.\n\nThis means that instead of the normal repertoire of six or seven characters, you've only got three that matter: the healer, who restores your health; the ranger, who is immune to mana drain; and the special character, who's the only one that can significantly hurt the boss.\n\nIf any one of those three dies, you're boned. Healer's gone? Well, you're going to take a lot of damage, which means you're more likely to lose another character. Special character dies? Now you're playing catchup, because the person who does the next-highest damage to the boss deals 1/5th the damage. Ranger dies? You might as well give up. You're going to have a really hard time building up enough mana to restore another character, because there's no mana charms on this stage and to reach the mana gathering spots you need to go around the boss.\n\nAnd going anywhere near the boss is super dangerous - if you ever make the mistake of hitting him head on, he smacks your character with a friggin Chaos Dunk and they go flying straight into the middle gutter. It's really, really hard to recover from that.\n\nOverall though, this is a great game - it's just a pity the difficulty went from Super Mario World to Dark Souls over the course of one boss.","December 13, 2014","true","6.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

It's a fun, unique, and interesting game.\n\nThe boards are fun and complex always with multiple flippers on each side.\nEach might have different goals like some you might need to use the Thief ball to bump into the backs of peasants to collect some gold, others (quite a few) you defeat enemies, or you might need to make it to a different part of the board as part of the story.\n\nThe characters being represented by balls of different size and materials works well. They feel and play diferent, so where the small almost-too-fast Thief does a ton of damage from behind (much less from the front) and gets knocked around by the flippers easlily, the Knight is big, slow, heavy, does a fair bit of damage from any angle and can occasionally knock down enemies briefly. Meanwhile there's also the Ranger who pasively fires arrows when near enemies, or the Farmhand who wrecks objects and knocks over enemies easily.\n\nAll of the characters (balls) have an activate-able ability. The thief has an extra ball in play (her dog), the Knight blocks the balls from going down between the flippers for a short time. The character/balls can also be upgraded at the Port (a shop) buy buying them. Some may increase damage, lessen the special ability mana cost, modify their special in some way - usually making it stronger and/or last longer.\n\nOn a personal note: My favorite has to be the Barmaid, a hire-able side character who's good all around and can be upgraded to be able to heal the flippers on mana gain when her special is active which happens to make her more agile and do more damage to begin with.\n"Not the kind o' spoonin' you were expectin'?"\n\nThere is some limited bad, however, in that several stages feel SUPER frustrating because there's too many enemies crowding the flippers so all your balls bounce off of them and in the hole. Perhaps the Farmhand is the character I was supposed to hire first so he could bowl through them.\nAs of yet, if you use a controller with vibration there's no way in game options to turn off the rumble so some stages I needed to take a break until my hands stopped being numb.","February 18, 2015","true","15.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As far as RPG elements, one can buy items that buff certain ball types (rogue ball steals coins and backstabs, knight ball can fight and defend, etc) at an in-game store. You also grind EXP to level characters. This is about as RPG as the whole thing gets.\n\nStory is alright so far, but nothing amazing. As a pinball fan, I honestly don't care if the story turns out one way or the other. So no big deal at all there.\n\nExperience and gold are gotten by hitting targets, or sequences of them, and hitting enemies enough times to vanquish them. As hinted at before, one has use of different ball types, or party members, to accomplish various goals. A rogue can backstab and pickpocket innocents by hitting them from behind. A knight would be a better choice if one is facing an angry mob of baddies, and so on.\n\nGot this in a bundle, and I've seen enough to know that this will be a solid game. Avoid if you only want a quirky RPG game, because this is all about pinball with a hint of RPG. And that's just fine, because a similar system (albeit match-3 and not pinball) worked out pretty well for the first Puzzle Quest game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Atlus\n-Pinball\n\nCons:\n\n-None worth mentioning if you like pinball.\n\nRecommended.","May 14, 2015","true","5.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

WIth little dialogue, the creators gave these little balls more character and development than most "character-driven" AAA releases. There are a few moments that removed me from the game (the Baron's chamber sees a large difficulty spike out of nowhere, you can't see hired swords abilities before you spend the 5000 gold, some enemies take an extraordinary amount of damage, and most of the voice acting is poor but not terrible). I bought this game for $7.50 and it certainly was worth my money. I hope it sees more development.

It takes the party building. character progression,  and narrative, of RPGs, and put it into a pinball setting. Each ball represent it's own character with it's own traits, stats, and specials. Each pinball table plays out more like an RPG quest than a traditional pinball table, where quest goals, and some times navigation are designed with precedence over classic pinball score attack.\n\nThe game looks great overall. Each table / environment are well detailed and stylized in the expected RPG motifs, with some pretty impressive art design and lighting. Though some of the character profiles, the 2D illustrations, I found to be not quite as strong as the 3D models. The sound design is what you'd expect from pinball games, but throw in some grunts as you hit enemy mobs, and other classic RPG sounds when you do RPG things.\n\nAs a game on it's own it's pretty enjoyable. The mixing of 2 very different genres itself grabs attention, and certainly playing an RPG based pinball game I was ecstatic at first! But as I played more I realized, through the blending of 2 genres, certain aspects of both were lost in the process. The character progression in the game is very simple when compared to other RPGs, while the tables are less exciting and creative than other pinball games due to it's need to be designed around a quest, or a goal, rather than score attack. So as a game on it's own, it's enjoyable, but when compared to either of the 2 genre it's blending it can leave a player wanting.\n\nOverall Rollers of the Realm is a very curious game, that the idea of blending pinball with RPG alone should turn some heads. It's enjoyable in it's own right, but might not hold it's own when compared to either of the genre it's blending. But if you are looking for a pinball game with RPG elements, there's not too many other options out there, and you could do much worst than Rollers of the Realm.\n\nPros:\n- A very interesting blend of genres\n- Good Looking Pinball tables\n- Enjoyable under it's own merit\n- Easy to learn, very accessible\n\nCons:\n- Good game overall, but doesn't excel as either an RPG or Pinball\n- Simple progression system\n- Some Awkward tables","January 31, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But instead of the standard bouncing off bumpers and hitting targets, you will be bouncing off the scenery, hitting enemies and plundering loot.\n\nWhat could be just a cute skin on a pinball game turns out to be rather more than that though. For one thing the levels are a lot less complex than what many newer pinball games are like, but what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in variety. Throughout the game you'll be traversing "tables" on the theme of caves, castles, forests and cities. Sometimes even multiple things in the same table with some nifty transitions.\n\nThe different characters are different balls, instead of being just a reskin though, they differ in abilities. The knight is a larger than regular ball, but he does a good deal of damage to enemies and obstacles he hits. The rogue however does very little damage (unless you manage to hit from behind of course), but is very agile. Agility is handled in game by being able to veer the ball left or right. The agility score of a character determines how effective this is. You can actually roll the rogue up slopes after some upgrades if you really want to.\n\nI've mentioned combat a few times now, and that's because most of the levels will focus on either hitting an objective or two, or killing all the enemies before proceeding. Apart from being able to knock your ball away, enemies can also damage your flippers, causing them to grow shorter and shorter if you let damage stack up. Some characters will be able to heal them however. This means you'll be trying to find the right character to attack with, and swapping to a healer once in a while when your flippers are getting dangerously short.\n\nSwapping characters is as simple as holding a ball in one of your main flippers and pressing the swap key to cycle through your available characters. Should a character die (down the drain marked by a skull), you'll have to play with another one until you've gathered up enough mana to resurrect a characters. There's a good deal of them, and yet in the later levels I've found death coming so swift I've had to restart a map on more than one occasion.\n\nThe storyline of the game is nothing too impressive, but they've managed to at least give a sense of purpose to why you're in the map you are, and why you must achieve the goal of the map. Generally they're well voice acted, though one or two characters have had a few lines which felt not quite as well acted.\n\nMy biggest problem/gripe with the game going in was that it looked to be rather short, packing in 6 chapters (unless this "final chapter" is a ruse and there's a bunch more). Regardless I've enjoyed the time I've played the game, and at €10 it's hard to expect more. This is a game I could see myself buying expansion DLC for if it became available.\n\nPros:\n* Rather unique, not many other games have mixed pinball with combat and quests in this way\n* Good looking colourful graphics.\n* Runs well, I've yet to encounter any actually problematic technical issues, even on my modest notebook. (edit: It seems some integrated graphics chips has some texture issues, my system running throttled at 1ghz dual core and intel HD 4000 worked smoothly)\n* Controls well, what with the agility and the amount of flippers on the tables and fairly good physics, you rarely feel you're losing because of sloppy controls or bad physics.\n* It's cheap, always a good thing\n\nCons:\n* Nearing the end combat might feel like it's getting a bit repetetive\n* Length, it doesn't seem like the longest of games, but for the price it doesn't feel too short either.","November 24, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Fact is, until I copied over the CD key I didn't realize it was even in the bundle to begin with. So when I say I didn't really expect much from this title, I really didn't expect anything out of it. In fact, I thought, "It might take my mind off of things for a few hours." One weekend and part of a Monday later, and I just finished this thing (would have been much sooner except my laptop lagged on a couple of levels, forcing me to redo them).\n\nThe game had me from the opening sequence. I felt for our poor little orphaned protagonist and I loved the knight. The story properly foreshadows the ending, while simultaneously creating a believable set of events that lead to it. I really never felt whiplashed because the characters leap into some complicated scheme that makes no sense in the wider context of the story (which happens all too often in video games). Everything occurs in a way that properly makes sense and is believable for the cast we're dealing with.\n\nAnd while we're talking about the cast the one liners the characters spout off were both mildly funny and never grew old (and I don't think they would after hearing them a thousand more times). All of the elements of the game tell us something about these characters, their hopes, their dreams, and how they live: From the drunken knight to the fiery barmaid, which for me, is how it should be in gaming. I even grew teary eyed during a few dialogue sequences, which considering how this is more of a short story than a Final Fantasy esque novella, it was really quite impressive. I was quite attached to a fair number of the cast by the end. I should also mention that the cast was quite diverse and didn't feel at all cookie cutter, which is refreshing.\n\nThe game play feels like it is well balanced for the most part even though the campaign never really just completely devastated me. I did have moments where I used most of the main cast, though I did end up completely ignoring the last two characters and the majority of the hired hands (maybe due to the OPness of the Farm Hand). However, I think pushing the real limits of this game are reserved for the arena, where getting to the higher scores requires mastering the more 'squishy' characters and properly using the whole group. That being said the two easier characters in the game had to of been the Farm Hand and the Knight. If you want a more difficult game I suggest avoiding those two when possible. Though maybe do a few rounds in the arena with them, their one liners are pretty awesome.\n\nThe pin ball mechanics played well with the story, plot, and level design. It was actually sort of surprising. It was quasi-JRPGish, but not in a way that made you feel like you were going down a hallway (it honestly didn't occur to me until I started to write this review just how JRPGish this game really is).  Additionally, I felt fully engaged with what was going on combat wise which was partly due to great visuals, voice acting, writing, and 'action' despite the fact that the majority of targets were stationary. The last pinball game that I played did feel very 'abstracted' as to what was 'said' to be going on, so it honestly caught me a little off guard as to how well this game played.\n\nThat being said, there were issues. Primarily there isn't a lot of depth in leveling. All leveling does is unlock more bonuses and characters, so for those of us who like to power game by min-maxing characters or developing specific strategies (leveling wise), there isn't a lot there. I should also point out that while the story is very well written (4 out of 5 stars in my book) it is extremely short. I spent, I want to say about 12 hours finishing up the campaign, if that, which from where I'm sitting just makes this game all the more impressive. It might also behoove me to mention some of the characters are particularly well ignored. The Alchemist and Farm hand don't get a lot of dialogue in the main story (a few short lines north of zero). These are less big thorns in my britches and more me just being honest with people looking at this game. The devs have turned out a well polished ball of a game (hehe, I shouldn't do puns).\n\nI really do hope to see more games released by these developers. Not only was this project an amazing game that seems to respect the intelligence of the audience, but it also does it's part to create a very equal caste from a diverse set of backgrounds. It doesn't force anything on us, but there's a part of me that feels that good writing that doesn't force people of other backgrounds into race/gender stereotypes, bad guy only roles, and/or quasi-inferiority to other, more (culturally) privileged main cast members is something that really needs to take the gaming scene by storm. Though that might just be me (I hope not). Either way, I want to see more games like this and more games from this developer.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nPros:\n+Wonderful (but short) story that is fully fleshed out, both touching and mildly humorous.\n+Amazing diverse cast of characters that you'll grow attached to: Almost every element of the game gives us a chance to explore the personalities of our party and fall in love with them\n+Unique RPG battle system whose core is a pin ball game: Which is a lot more fun than it should be\n+One liners that never seem to grow stale and help us explore the personality of characters\n+Game play is well balanced for the most part\n+Arena offers more extended play for those that wish it\n\nCons\n-Extremely short story, which might be a problem for some\n-Leveling and RPG mechanics are rather simple\n-Some characters are especially ignored when it comes to writing\n-Some characters are kind of OP (looking at you Farm Hand)\n\nTo Devs\n-Keep on keeping on (AKA, moar!)","May 25, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's just lovely to see a creative pinball-based game after so long.\n\nThis one mixes in a little bit of RPG elements, but not an awful lot, and strictly nothing you have to pay too much attention to. It's all about making the ball go where it needs to go, and there's a story to go with it. The story is nice, if not terribly original, and the characters are charming. Around the pinball tables are different kinds of stationary targets that award "mana" to use with special powers, moving/attacking enemy targets that block paths and attack your flippers, piles of money, chests and corresponding keys. The tables are varied and often consist of several playfields. Oh, and you can swap between different balls (RPG characters) that are of various sizes and other properties, and special powers that ranges from reviving to setting enemies on fire or launch additional balls into play. You can also directly affect left/right movement of the ball to get into difficult spots.\n\nThe game is perhaps a bit short, with gameplay of about 4-5 hours or more (on casual difficulty) depending on your skill and how much time you want to spend on collecting money for upgrades. On the other hand, I've played shorter games that were a lot less satisfying. The game ran surprisingly well on the fairly low-end hardware I was using at the time, but in a couple of levels the performance was noticably worse than average. It's probably not an issue for newer/better hardware. The game supports Xbox 360 compatible gamepads out of the box, so I chose to go that route.\n\nNot much to complain about. It was a game I enjoyed, and will warmly recommend, at least on sale. I just hope they add some additional DLC content or a sequel, because I'll likely buy it!","December 24, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This RPG-Pinball game is the best possible combination of the genres.  I personally don't like pinball games very much, but the abilities of the balls (characters) compensate for the "luck" element in pinball.  Instead of "tilt" there is a no-penulty ability to influence your balls slightly left or right.  How easy this is to do is based on the agility stat.  Different balls are good for different jobs, and you can switch when the ball is resting on a flipper.\n\nThe maps are great, well designed screens that are pinball tables that look like - well not like a table but rather a scene suited to the story.\n\nThis really is an example of a well thought out game.

I think the reason I'm writing about this is because I wasn;t really expecting much from a pinball rpg, but the game is great. The voice acting is high quality and well delivered. The story starts a little slow, but is suprisingly engaging. The chracters are a bit generic fantasy fair, but develope through out the story and are well fleshed out.\n\nThe game mechanics are really solid. Probably the best non-tradition rpg I've ever played. At its core its ofcourse pinball, but the various properties of different chracters(balls) lend themselves to different roles. RPG Mechanics help to define the chracters strengths and differences, and ofcourse let you lean on the style of play you enjoy.\n\nAs for the mechanics themselves enemies serve as destroyable bumbers(essentially), different characters deal damage, and losing you ball will kill the character. But by amassing mana(points vaguely) you can revive characters or activate special abilities. Run out of characters and well you lose, Defeat all the enemies and or the boss and you win, or whatever other objetive a stage may have (collect x gold, break the statue). Ranged enemies and mages can damage your flippers, but your healers can restore them by collecting mana. The end result is a game that while starting off slowly and easing you in(early on you can't even die in certain sections), but ends up evoling into a hectic struggle to keep your characters alive and your flippers healthy. You learn when to switch your character for the different sections of the level and you probably end up replay the levels a few times.\n\nThe end of the day the game is on the lighter side, but has a good amount of depth and is throughly enjoyable.","November 6, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/recommended/262470/","tartrazine","Tartrazine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/","1509 products in account","Despite being poorly made, this is still a fun pinball RPG... if you play on "casual" so that you don't have to constantly repair your flippers. An important tip: several characters have multiball abilities. Don't use them, and don't waste gold upgrading them! Unlike a normal pinball game where you only need to worry about keep one of the identical balls in play, secondary balls in Rollers are weak, the character still dies if its main ball falls into the drain (and it's often difficult to tell the balls apart in battle, especially with the Rogue's balls' dull colors), and secondary balls can't activate special board locations that advance the level. That last point leads to some almost buggy situations where, for example, on a very long board you can get a secondary ball up to the distant top of the board but the camera won't follow it. The only good part about multiballs is that the some of the Ranger's extra balls stick to enemies, so they're good for dealing with enemies that hang around right beside your flippers.\n\nOh, and the game makes it sound like Arena levels are good for grinding gold. They're not. You don't get to keep most of the gold that you earn on Arena levels, so just stick to grinding on old campaign levels.\n\nThe levels and enemies are so blocky and ugly that it looks like a port of an N64 game. I know that this is a low budget Canadian game, but there's just no excuse for a modern game being this hideous. (It even got $221,784 of funding from the Canadian government - where did my tax dollars go?!)\n\nSo instead of creating challenge with intricate, well-designed levels and creative enemies, what does Rollers do instead? Enemies wear down your flippers until they're nubs, that's what. I could understand if there was a rare special enemy who could briefly deactivate your flippers or even delay them, but shrinking your flippers is just a bad, frustrating game design crutch. Having reliable, full size flippers is the one thing that you should be able to count on in a pinball game.\n\nI'm fine with hunting for a secret exit once in a while, but the game fails to tell you basic stuff like which button activates a flipper. (It's tough to remember in the heat of "battle", especially when the flipper points straight down!) On a level where you advance up to another screen, falling back down the drain should return you to the lower board, right? Nope. You just die.\n\nBalls and character are often needlessly difficult to tell apart. Some of the balls have textures on them, so it should have been easy to visually distinguish them, but it's like they were deliberately made hard to tell apart. It was almost shocking when the game finally gave me a deep red ball.\n\nRollers is even terrible at giving you clear information in the item shop between levels - items have a wall of confusing statistics, and their flavor text isn't differentiated from the description of what they actually do. I guess the Canada Media Fund didn't give them enough money to afford italics? When you get a new character, the game shows you a summary of his abilities, which you NEVER get to see again. The wording on upgrades is so unclear that I'm still not sure if the monk can heal flippers by default, with an upgrade, or not at all.","August 17, 2015","false","13.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","7"

Just like in real pinball the game is sometimes unfair and your ball is busted so you will die a lot. You will have to grind for money and xp.\nWhen they boasted they're financed with help of a government pool I'd almost closed the game again as such games tend to be bad.\nNo steam cards, only one save slot so it's really kept simple, you can customize controls though.\n\nHowever I still had fun with the game and the concept is quite unique. Your party characters are the balls, you can upgrade them they have different action skills, passives and feel to them. I had to play levels several times to win on "challenging" but I like it that way. I guess it's easier on "casual" difficulty.\nIf you like RPGs and pinball chances are you can kill a few hours with this.","May 16, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justgravy/recommended/262470/","justgravy","Gravy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justgravy/","418 products in account","I would not recommend this game to anyone that is used to playing pinball games such as Zen Pinball, or any 'classic' RPG style pinball tables such as Pokemon Pinball, Sonic Spinball, etc. .\n\nWhile this game tries to capture the spirit of previous games in the genre it completely fails to do so. Let's begin with some of the positives. It has some good voice acting, and an interesting design overall. Who wouldn't be stoked for an RPG pinball game? The RPG elements are incorporated into the playfields (more on that in a moment), and the idea is interesting.\n\nI don't believe the execution was very good however. To begin with the most glaring issue, the controller support is awful, and feels terrible. A patch was issued so that some players not using Xbox style controllers could even play, but even with my 360 and Xbox one controller it still plays poorly. The menus feel horrible with a controller, there is no 'dead' zone, so the selection is bouncing all over the screen. On top of this there is a mechanic where you can select party members once in the game. This mechanic again suffers from the lack of dead zone. So you're trying to swap characters with a quick flick on the stick, and you just keep bypassing them in the list, hoping that you'll make it there eventually. There are also unbound keys by default, so only the flippers and launcher/special ability button work on a controller. Consumables cannot be used straight out of the box.\n\nOnce you get past the less than stellar controls, there are the mechanics themselves. You have some control over the ball when it is moving in regards to shifting its motion left or right. This is not done via bumping the table, but direct control on the ball which was extremely odd to me. After getting to the third area I've realized why they did this, and it's the biggest failing of the game. Almost every single level turns into a shooting gallery where you are attacking characters that stand in the middle of the playfield. There are three main types I've encountered: Guys that throw things/shoot arrows at your flippers, guys with shields you can only hit from behind, and guys with swords (sometimes with large healthbars), that try to knock your ball out. I wouldn't mind this if it wasn't the main mechanic for all but a few scant bonus levels but it happens all the time, and sometimes there are multiple waves of these enemies. It turns into 'get up around the side, try to cheese it by bouncing around on top of a guy using ball control, hope you do enough damage to kill them'. It's a poor design decision that leads me to believe they were unable to come up with more unique mechanics and tables that would enable such mechanics.\n\nThis frustration and boredom of the tables continues due to the size of most tables, they're very small, sometimes there are a few screens worth of areas, but often times those sections repeat mechanics. Additionally there are issues where special character abilities don't work, for example the knight character can block the main area between the flippers so you don't drain the ball, but the ball can bounce AROUND this area, and still drain, totally defeating the purpose of his special ability.\n\nWhen looking at this game in a vacuum it might seem okay, but when you compare the mechanics here against older games in this genre, or even Zen Pinball tables, you can get more bang for your buck with a single table than I've played so far here (almost completed 3/6 chapters).\n\nThe physics feel bad and floaty, the tables repeat WAY too many of the same objectives (hit this thing, kill those guys), and it just doesn't feel great, especially with the poor controller support, which to me would have been essential for this sort of game.\n\nI can't recommend Rollers of the Realm even on a sale, if you enjoy pinball you're not going to enjoy this game, it's boring, repetitive, and not challenging in a way that feels rewarding.","December 4, 2014","false","1.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Now, given the title, brief half glimpses of screenshots and the icon (which is usually all I get with these games, by the way) I had assumed I would play an hour in a typical indie RPG game of some sort.  I was somewhat taken aback by the fact that this game is, indeed, and RPG, but instead of the typical RPG format, it is a digital pinball game.\n\nNow let me give you a few facts first.  One: I am actually rather fond of pinball.  One of my side projects is a decent sized digital pinball machine, flipper buttons and plunger and all, which has gone through at least two full wood revisions.  Two: I am actually rather fond of most RPGs.  I am actually planning to buy a next gen console solely for being able to play Kingdom Hearts 3 (no shame) and if you look at my play history, the amount of time I have spent playing Tales of Maj’Eyal far outstrip most of the other games in my collection.\n\nThese things being said, I am rather disappointed to admit that I find this game to be, well just kind of blah.  The pinball physics are interesting at times, but mostly are reminiscent of the tiny half size table top pinball machines you see in little kids rooms.  The RPG elements add a bit of a twist, but really just serve to try and keep your attention by choosing a different ball at different times, whereas for the most part you can get away with completely avoiding using any of the rpg elements if you have a decent enough skill with the flippers.  In the end, neither side of the game are attractive enough to me to be worth putting a lot of time into.  I will admit that it at least kept my interest long enough that I didn’t feel I had to slog through the minimum 30 minutes, but beyond that, I just can’t recommend this.\n\nGame’s Fate: I like pinball, but nope.  gone.  Its nice, but not worth the HD space right now\nBuy/No Buy: If you like pinball, especially digital pinball, maybe.  especially while its on sale, but at the 10 bucks it usually goes for?  nah.\n\nPersonal note:  also, apologies for my shame.  Not even two weeks in and I missed a review day.  Though admittedly I missed it to go see Metallica in concert, so not too upset about it.","February 8","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'd say it deserves, at the very least, a positive or very positive rating. If this was an indie with a lot of negative reviews, I'd have probably left a "Thumbs up" do want to provide a less-than-rosy review highlighting the flaws. Personally, I think this is more of a "casual puzzle" game than pinball, really.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend skipping this one if you are playing with a mouse/keyboard. It works a crapload better with a controller.\n\nThe most glaring problem I see with Rollers of the Realm are the poor, linear table designs. Most pinball I'm used to have longer-than-wide designs *for a reason.* That vertical progression is a key element of pinball. Finally hitting that "secret" and seeing what it does is part of the pinball mystique - Rollers of the Realm is easy for even a novice. Many of the reviews mention the lack of replayability, this is why. Understandably, Rollers of the Realm decided to do wider-than-long tables with transitions to higher part of the table. I'm guessing this is because 16:9 monitors are standard and they wanted full-screen capability. I'd have preferred a narrow, but tall design personally. Really, it just feels like you're playing on a really short table all of the time. The tables feel far more linear and less replayable than the typical "pinball sandbox" you're used to.\n\nThe second problem is that "death" is semi-avoidable. You have a cleric class who can revive your party. All you have to do is get enough mana to do-so. I suppose you could create your own "no reviving challenge" to combat this mechanic.\n\nMechanically, it works fine. Nothing is wrong about the execution of the game. You collect point and gold from bumping into things. If you hit an enemy enough time, you defeat them. There are a "obvious" puzzles to acquire a key which can be used to open treasure. What I don't like is that there are a TON of worthless bumpers that exist just to "get you down the next corridor." Basically, you have to follow a linear path to finish a level then have the option to end it or continue playing. I really wish you could toggle "free play" so the "DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE" was disabled every time you accidentally triggered the end of a level.\n\nRPG wise, it's extremely light. There is story and different classes - that's about it. It's really more of a series of medieval themed table than an "RPG crossover." You also have "characters" or pinballs with different functions. For instance, enemies slowly wear down the health of your bumpers. Solution is to use a cleric to repair them. It does add an element of gameplay, but could have been do much more.","December 31, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hockeyhacker97/recommended/262470/","hockeyhacker97","hockeyhacker97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hockeyhacker97/","979 products in account","Let me start by saying on real pinball tables I always prefered the older tables where you could control the launch via how far you pulled back the spring, and the buttons for the flippers you could somewhat control how hard you hit the ball, when tables switched over to the push button to launch and the flippers felt less controllable I didn't care for them. And that is how most all computer pinball games have felt to me, like they have all had the basic concept of pinball but lacking that feel and control of older pinball tables.\n\nDoes this feel like pinball of old? No, not at all, but it does feel really good. It contols smooth, the tables (or level's have you) all feel interesting, and its all around a good feeling game with some interesting mechanics to help it feel fun to control, unlike most digital tables and newer pinball tables.\n\nGiving the game some RPG like mechanics is an interesting twist, and I enjoy the different abaliities the different classes have and how you switch between them. I think the only real negitive thing I have to say about this game is that the buying upgrades to make your classes stronger to "fight" harder enemies feels purely like a way to make people go back and play older tables again to grind some gold to add how long it takes to complete all the tables.  While it does give reason to play tables more then once as you go through the story it also makes previous tables more trivial as you get more and more stat upgrades, so it is kind of a double edge sword of forcing replaying slightly old tables while at the same time reducing the reason to play even older tables.\n\nAdding RPG elements into a game just to add RPG elements can often end up being bad, but in this case it feels pretty good with how the different classes feel and what they do, its almost as if someone looked at Runespell :Overture and went "hey turning poker into a RPG when done right can feel really good, lets see if we can turn pinball into a RPG in a similar fation to Runespell Overture", and it worked out, it doesn't feel like a mechanic tacked on to have a  gimick, it feels like a legitimit mechanic with a purpose in the game to make it feel more enjoyable to play.\n\nWith that said, if you even slightly liked older pinball tables, or like the concept of digital pinball but don't like how most of them you don't feel like you have any real control, definitly give this one a shot.  At no point have I had a point where my death has felt like a "quarter eater mechanic" of having no control of the outcome, every death has felt like I just mis played it... And yes that is how I feel about older pinball machines compaired to newer ones, the older ones gave you better control, but as arcades started going away and as the fewer people playing pinball got better, they changed their controls to be "quarter eaters" much like how older video games where designed to have cheap deaths to eat quarters, on older tables I could play a single ball and earn extra balls for longer then all 3 balls of newer tables.","December 7, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemies can damage the flippers, but there's a healer that can heal them - and raise the dead heroes. Heroes die when you sink their pinball.\nOf course, you should collect gold to spend in the shop and open treasure chests for even more gold or magic items.","May 17, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like pinball games a lot and I'm a huge fan of the RPG genre so when I had an opportunity to play a demo of this game at Momocon I was intrigued. When I saw it discounted during Steam's Summer Sale I bit.\n\nI don't regret this purchase, and I don't think I would even at the current listed price of $9.99.  Rollers of the Realm is a fun combination of both pinball and RPG. The characters were enjoyable and the storylline was simple and not terribly original, but honestly better than what I expected from a pinball RPG.\n\nThe game play was usually enjoyable. I say usually, because the level design is pretty inconsistent and some levels are far less fun than others. There is an art to designing a good pinball table. One which the designers didn't study too hard because they hit upon the basics of a good table rarely enough that I suspect the better tables were more accidental than deliberate.  Only a few are actually awful, but the majority of tables are just kind of "Meh." They're mostly very simplistic and don't have much variety to them. Pinball machines tend to be hella elaborate.\n\nSome characters are more fun than others as well, with half my roster comprised of characters that I never used unless all the cooler characters died.\n\nWhich brings me to my biggest complaint about the game. Because enemies damage your flippers pretty quickly later in the game, I was required to play the Healer far more than I would have liked to. While there's a few other characters that can heal the flippers, the Healer is really the only one that can do it well enough to be worthwhile.  This greatly reduced my ability to play the other characters and really frustrated me since the Healer doesn't even have any fun abilities to use while playing her. No multi-balls, no ranged attacks.\n\nMinor annoyances were the game being fairly miserly with gold and a sequences of levels that without warning locks you out of grinding the previous levels for more gold and experience until you beat them (with a x3 annoyance multiplier when combined with the fact that when you lose a level you don't get to keep anything from them).\n\nUltimately, this is a fun and fairly unique game that could have been much, much better with some better design choices. It's worth playing in its own right, but I dearly hope either a sequel or knock off comes along and improves on the formula.\n\n","July 26, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't even..." and buying this game just to see what it is like since the screenshots seemed nice, I was pleasantly greeted by some nice voice acting and presentation, and inmediately entertained when I started playing this well-crafted game.\n\nI tip my hat to the devs who got the balls (pun intended) to mix two genres as disparate as pinball and RPGs with such taste.\n\nIt is however beyond me, how the game manages to remove most of the fun in the later stages, when the gameplay forces you into an either boringly defensive gameplay, punishing you with not being able to use the skills you spent the whole game building up if you ever miss a hit. This leads to some frustration as it artificially prevents using certain playstyles which also happen to be where the most fun is.","February 6","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics actually works really well, the different characters have a different ball weight, and play quite different... there are quite some mission with secret treasure... and the story is quite entertaining. There is also a challenge mode where you need to get as much points in either 5 lives or be as fast as possible to reach a goal, with 3 achievements each... quite challenging! Was well worth the money.","February 4","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story and voice work are charming and the gameplay is fun. This won't scratch a real pinball itch though, there just isn't a big table like you would want. Also, once the campaign is done, the grind to unlock the rest of the items is a big turn off. More challenges with better rewards would have been nice. Overall 7/10 pretty good game.","December 23, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great game for both fans of pinball and casual gamers. And some RPG thrown in to boot.\n\nThere is never any doubt about your goals and objectives at any given moment. Admittedly, the secondary flippers are often difficult to see, but a quick flip of the buttons reveals them. Sometimes you have to slip under a flipper to reach your goal.\n\nTake it from me, if you want a game you're looking forward to playing, this is it.","April 17","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles take some problem solving, and it's satisfying to get the difficult-to-reach treasures in each level.  The only thing bad about this game is the horrible voice acting / dialogue / story.  But if you're only concentrating on game play enjoyment... this is a very fun and unique game!  My only other gripe is that there's not enough content.  There should be a wider variety of treasures, instead of just a couple per world.  The game is way too short, and could definitely use an expansion that continues the adventure and loot that you can get.  Just get better writers and voice actors next time.","April 27","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
