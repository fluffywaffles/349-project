This game is a buggy mess as of 19th of March 2016. Game Breaking Bugs. Will update if they ever patch it.\n--------------------------------\n\nI usually do not write reviews but after seeing a few people on my friendlist having this game on their wishlists, I am compelled to give you my opinion of the game as of the 19th of March, 2016.\n\nTrulon: The Shadow Engine is turnbased RPG based on a new novel by an  "award-winning"  author who wrote a trilogy from the Shadowrun universe.\n\nRich storyline? GREAT!\nSurely the plot and characters are the strongest points of this game...\n\nCategory        Verdict                Graphics/Visuals        As you can see on the screenshots from steamstore, it is a mix of 2D sprites on a 3D rendered map. The art style is inspired by typical JRPGs/Anime but it differentiates itself with colour gradients to give it a three dimensional-shading effect.\n\nDespite how it looks on the screenshots, the animation of the characters when they're walking around is particularly jarring. The characters have 4 walking animations which are all diagonal. Since you'll be moving up down left right most of the time in this game you will see your characters sliding around as if they're snowboarding. It probably won't look so bad if the background is also 2D. Adding an up down left right animation for the main character will solve this issue.\n\nBattle animations are done pretty well with the pixelated close-ups of your characters performing the actions. Only two characters have separate animations for attacks or special actions. Cards are fanned out in the bottom left of the screen as if you're playing poker, which is a nice touch and adds to the gameplay(more on that later).\n\nI have a feeling the studio was pressed for time and skipped making some sprites and animations.                Sound/Music        Ambient music of world map/city/town is orchestral with emphasis on the strings instrumentals most of the time. Battle music sounds like it came straight from the Naruto anime, especially with koto and electric guitar riffs mixed with the studio drumset beats.\n\nThe lack of variety in the the background music really makes it repetitive.\n\nThere is no voice acting, despite the trailer.\n\nSFX of impacts, cards, and inventory all add the the experience without getting too distracting                Gameplay        Trulon is both linear and short with no replay value. You can finish this game a within 7 hours (My hours are higher due to gamebreaking bugs).\n\nMost enemy encounters occur where groups of enemies are dotted around the level and you walk towards them to initiate the battle. You can even walk around the enemies and avoid the battles. This aspect will be familiar if you've played Chrono Trigger.\n\nThere are also random enemy encounters if you are walking around on the world map. An option will appear to let you skip the encounter, which is good if you just want to progress faster in the storyline.\n\nThe characters are also very linear and forgettable since their personalities hardly change at end game. I can't even remember their names. Each character is suited to a cliche role for rpgs such as the tank/aggro, healer, high damage dealer, and disabler.\n\nAs  you can see, the story and characters are pretty weak even though it is based on a novel by an award winning author.\n\nEach character has their own a deck of cards and equipment slots for you to manage. There is no difficulty setting for the game but the enemies get tougher in big jumps. Despite what other reviewers may say about enemies being too OP, the game's difficulty is balanced in my opinion since you are encouraged to optimize your decks and equipment to deal with different enemies. The game never throws an enemy at you without giving you the chance to change your gear. I have very different setups when I fight against a solo or group of enemies.\n\nAn optimized deck will turn a tough fight into a walk in the park.\n\nThe battle sequence itself is the best part of the game. It is very satisfying to test out differently optimized decks to inflict multiple status effects with high damage combos. Click, drag and drop is how the cards are played, similar to playing Poker Night at the Inventory. It would be better if there's an option to skip some of the battle animations but since the game is pretty short, it isn't a biggie.\n\nThis game uses an Autosave system. You will not be able to freely make multiple save files for the same session (unless you directly head to the AppData\LocalLow\Kyy Games\Trulon folder and manually do it yourself).              Bugs        This game is a mobile port from iOS and Android. The bugs in this game isn't an isolated incident as you can see if you check out this game's community hub. Invisible enemies, story scripting bugs, pitch black maps with no where to go.\n\nI had to restart my game because one of these bugs wouldn't let me progress.\n\nThere is one minor bug for only the underground sewer level where the frame skips periodically.\n\nThese bugs should've been found inhouse by the devs by simply playing through it themselves.\n\nThis game isn't early access. It is a full release game with game breaking bugs for $20USD!\n\nAre you kidding me?!?!\nConclusionDespite the satisfactory visuals, BGM, SFX, battle mechanic, and deck management... This mobile ported game has a weak  and forgetable story and characters. This game is short with little to no replay value.\n\nWorst of all, this game is infested with bugs, some of which are game breaking that you are forced to restart or download someone else's save file.\n\nIt's totally not worth the $20USD price. You can get this game for $5USD on iOs/Android.\n\nMakes me wonder what opinions they have on PC gamers on steam to justify charging four times the price for a half-arsed mobile port.\n\nI'm tempted to make a pun about Kyy  and Headup involving KY lubricant and  REDACTED	... seriously do not get this game right now unless you want to feel violated by Kyy from behind so hard that you beg them to apply some KY jelly!!!!","March 19","false","14.6"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","52","59","2","8"

Seeing "unique card combat system" is what initially got my attention. The combat system was more simplistic than I expected and there weren't many types of different attacks. I expected the Mage to have more attacks than just a generic magic attack and expected the Thief to have "Thief-like" abilities, not yet another Mage.\n\nThe main reason why I can't recommend this game is that there are a couple areas that you re-visit, but the storyline/quest items re-trigger causing weird bugs. I was forced to restart the game on several ocassions.\n\nAfter reading other reviews, I can see how it started off as a mobile game.

The Mayor of the village needs a monster hunter to resolve this situation straight away. As your father (who is the master monster hunter) has been injured in your last battle, you are now the one who needs to step up. Where has this eruption of beats come from? Or, who is behind it?\n\nTrulon: The Shadow Engine is an RPG / TCG style of game. You will be playing Gladia, the daughter of a great monster hunter.  As you travel along your journey, you will find quests and will be rewarded with experience points upon completing them. Some of the quests will involve interesting puzzles. Experience points will go towards your characters so they can reach higher levels and so on and so forth. You will meet other characters who will join your party, and you will need them, let me tell you.\n\nAs you visit locations you will notice chests lying here and there; open them and you will get additional cards for your deck, or mechanisms (upgrades) for your characters. Make sure you collect the Gaudium Orb - this orb will regenerate your magna and will also give you some experience points too.\n\nThe combat phase is turn based but you will use deck cards to activate action from your hero. As you level up, you will face stronger enemies and some will be able to knock down some of your characters with only two turns if you do not have the right deck of cards. At the end of each encounter, and of course if you are the winner, you will be rewarded with experience points. Every here and there you will be prompted to investigate an area. You will be able to accept or decline the search. Sometimes you will face tough foe but other times you might find some great goodies, which will be totally up to you whether or not you investigate them.\n\nThe graphics in Trulon: The Shadow Engines are great - you will swap from pixels (moving around the map) to nice 3D graphics in specific locations. In terms of the control, it is a point and click system and it works fine. I have not encountered any issues with the game so far.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good Story-line in a Steampunk world\n-	Good, colourful graphics\n-	Over 50 cards to use\n-	Good number of upgrades\n-	Interesting puzzles\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n-	No trading cards\nTrulon: The Shadow Engine is a well-structures RPG/TCG game with a good story-line in a steampunk world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/433840/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1468 products in account","Introduction\nWith some gorgeous art style, that really suit the type of game genre, Trulon: The shadow engine strives to be a different type of RPG game with some interesting features. It is a card based RPG based based upon a book by Jak Koke, writer of the Shadowrun trilogy and The Dragon Heart Saga.\n\nGameplay\nBased upon a book by Jak Koke, Trulon: The shadow engine is set in a steampunk universe where a young hunter called Gladia has discovers a plot to poison her homeland, from using the mechanical machines from the Kingdom of Maelon. After finding out about this plot and reporting it to the queen of Tripudia and realizing that they won’t do anything, she decides to set out on her own journey to find out who sent the machines and to stop their plot. This game features 4 playable characters that you will meet across your journey in a few locations that you will come across in the course of playing this game.\n\nTrulon: The shadow engine strives to be a unique type of RPG game. The gameplay is based upon a basic card based battling system with a turn based system and some RPG elements thrown into the mix. Attacking enemies are fairly straightforward, you click on the card you want to use and then click on the enemie(s) you want to attack. There are about 50 cards in total for you to discover over the course of the game, with each one having a specific function to them. Some cards are physical and can attack from one enemies, to multiple enemies, some of these can then either add or take away a buff on your character with could ultimately win you the battle. There are also defensive or magic cards that you can use on your character to avoid an attack for a single turn. It’s very easy to pick up and play, all of the cards are self-explanatory so there isn’t much learning involved in this game, most of the time it’s up to luck of what cards you draw and the strategy of when you use your cards. Unfortunately, there isn’t all that much variety in the cards each character can use, therefore it’s not a very in-depth system that other types of cards games do have. There are a few ways that you can obtain new cards, you can acquire these cards from opening treasure chests, obtaining them from quests that you have completed or from battles that you win. Creating your own deck for each character is rather simple and straightforward, some cards can only be equipped to a certain character in the game. A unique mechanic about this type of deck creating is that there are different types of mechanisms that you can quip on your characters which will add special bonuses during your battles. Some of the special bonuses include being able to set your enemy on fire, the damage repeats over time, adding defence for the next turn or increasing your attack power for your character. There is a nice variety to discover and create so you can build a pretty wide amount of unique characters throughout the game.\n\nThe game has some really nice joyful atmospheric music when you are in the cities, and then when you are in the battle the music jumps to a little bit more serious and sometimes intense music. Although this is nice and all, sometimes this can get a little repetitive and therefore you end up not wanting to listen to the music at all whilst you play the game. Adding a bit more variety of music to the game would makes this game shine a bit more, but other than that the music is fairly nice for the first couple of hours playing the game.\n\nThe art style of the game to me give off a sort of retro feel to it. The graphics for each of the characters are well done, and seem to be polished to be the finest that it could possibly be. All of the areas that you go into seem to be really vibrant in their colours and give off the atmospheric sense that you would imagine. From the day towns to the night cities, the art style really shines throughout the game as you play through it.\n\nPros\n+ A unique type of RPG mixed with a card turn based system\n+ Very easy to pick up and play\n+ Very nice art style to fit the genre\n+ A simple point and click game\n+ The dialogue of the characters is well written\n+ For the first few hours the music is really fitting no matter where you are\n+ Story is interesting and fun, along with a few optional side quests\n\nCons- No trading cards\n- Not much variety of cards for each character to use\n- Only way to save is to save and exit the game\n- Music can get a little repetitive after a while\n- Asking a bit of a heavy price\n\nResult / Final Thoughts\nIf you can get past the heavy price, and the music that gets a little repetitive over time, the game itself is definitely worth the money. The characters and story are interesting, as are all of the people you meet along the way on your journey. The art style is very vibrant in its colours and gives off a sort of retro feel to the game. The combat system in the game is a really nice change from the classic RPG battling system. Would definatly recommend this game.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","March 21","true","2.3"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

The look and tone of Trulon is bright, colourful, soft looking, but its story is something a little more complex than one side good, one side bad, but it is a game that's lacking a bit of punch\n\nTrulon: The Shadow Engine is a mix of traditional JRPG gameplay with card battling and deck building. There’s an overworld, the occasional random battle, levelling, even items to equip. The levelling in particular makes a real difference to characters, gaining a level can make challenging areas bearable. I have to admit, there were a few areas where I felt the need to go and gain a level or two, the simplicity of the early game is, every so often, rocked by spikes in difficulty\n\nThe card system and deck building are where the depth of Trulon comes in. Winning fights may earn you a card, which can be equipped to selected fighters. During battle you’ll be presented with a handful of cards from your personal deck, plus a couple handed to you each turn by the game, these are essentially your moves. Certain characters can only use certain cards, Gladia for example never learnt a healing move, but she was my go to if I wanted to cause a lot of damage, conversely Valencia can alter enemy stats, even get them attacking each other. you have to be careful though, the cards coming from your deck can only be used once per battle, burn your stun moves, dodge moves, or even healing moves too early and you could be in real trouble.\n\nCharacters can be equipped with perks, activated by special cards, that, as well as attacking/healing/whatever, will also bestow an affect on you or the enemy. It may be that using a card will give you some HP back, set the enemy on fire, or even let you pull another card, but once you spend enough time with the game you begin to build these perks in to your strategy, thinking a couple of moves ahead. That’s not to say combat is without its flaws. Because you don’t have control over which cards are in your hand you can find yourself screwed, if you need a heal spell and all you’re getting is defence perks the fight can be over pretty quickly. Which is another problem, later on, especially when you’re fairly comfortable in terms of victory, fights can feel like they take an age. It’s hard to know what could have fixed this, but fairly routine fights can feel like a bit of a trudge to the point I was avoiding some of the random encounters.\n\nTrulon’s one big problem runs right through everything it does, namely that it doesn't engage you. It lacks punch, something that shakes you out of the automation you've slipped in to from the combat. Some more dramatic music would help, or at least changing up what’s there, particularly if someone is low on health. More in the way of animations too, graphically, while it’s nice enough, it can come across a little flat. Also displaying how close people are to levelling up at the end of the fight, make it so I feel like I'm making progress, pull my attention back to the game.\n\nThe story too needs something. It's not a bad tale, two nations suspicious of each other, it hints at something more, something bigger. It will be interesting to see if the 'phony-war' angle does feature in the upcoming book, certainly there's some apt parallels to be drawn from the naive populace. That said there's a lack of drama to how it's delivered, a handful of still pictures, one-paced text. It's hard to care about it. Especially true for what happens to the characters, there's no meat behind them, they just kind of exist, despite playing through the game you still feel like you've learnt nothing about them. Not a huge problem in and of itself, but it is indicative of a greater problem\n\nI don’t want to be too hard on Trulon though, it’s good, surprisingly good. I expected a quick knock around of an rpg, superlight but easy to burn through, what I got was a decent challenge, with moments of real strategy. While the limitation of cards can come to the forefront, not giving you the hand you need for example, when you chain together a huge series of moves, combining your party’s efforts in clever and powerful ways, you can really see the potential of Trulon. For example, I equipped one of my characters with a perk that meant she could be triggered to have another turn, combining that with ‘Haste’ for extra turns, raising stats, stunning enemies, then using other characters with cards that dealt more damage to stunned enemies. Rinse repeat for a few turns, then freeze the enemies with one of my other characters, ‘Shadow Dance’ the next turn to draw attacks that will be dodged... When the cards fall your way you can wreak havoc.","March 1","true","20.2"," 16 of 38 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","16","38","0","0"

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Trulon: the Shadow Engine is a console-style RPG in an original fantasy steampunk world, with combat based on a battle card system using cards you collect as treasures throughout the game. The game has previously been released on mobile devices and now it's come to Steam.\n\nYou play as the young Gladia, in training with your father, the great monster hunter. Your father was recently injured, however, so you must investigate a recent outbreak of monsters in the village near your house. In typical console RPG fashion, you follow along this main plot line as it twists and turns, and as you do you gain levels, abilities, and treasures by beating up monsters and doing simple side quests for people you encounter along the way.\n\nIf you've played any console RPG from the last 20 years you'll have seen most of it before, but Trulon does it well. It looks nice, the battle system works fairly well, the music is pleasant, and the plot is interesting enough given the original steampunk-style world.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Trulon is pretty. It has a last-gen cartoony console feel like many mobile or Wii RPGs, but it does look nice. The engine is 3D, but the screen is fixed in a high isometric viewpoint. A number of post-processing effects seem to have been added or improved for the PC release and although graphical options are limited, from my experience if you have an even half-capable PC you shouldn't need to turn anything off.\n\nCharacter and monster graphics are a bit more cartoon-like than the world around them and look a bit like they've been pasted in, but the effect isn't too distracting, and the big-eyed anime-style characters are well drawn. Due to its mobile roots, Trulon's interface graphics are quite big and easy to select.\n\nSound - Background music is pleasant and sound effects are decent. There are no voices. Sound overall is nothing remarkable, but is solid.\n\nGameplay - If you've played any console or high-end phone/tablet RPG then you'll be familiar with Trulon's gameplay. You talk to people to and gain and complete quests in 'safe areas' like villages, move to the world map to access other areas (perhaps triggering encounters on the way), and move to dangerous combat-enabled areas to complete your quests and advance the story. Trulon is mouse only, and you only need one button: everything is controlled by moving the pointer and left clicking or dragging.\n\nBattles can be a bit annoying as you have only limited battle cards available to you at a time, and even with only a small number of cards in your active card inventory you can still find yourself waiting for turn after turn for one of your most useful cards. The battle system works well enough; just prepare to be a bit frustrated on occasion.\n\nCharacter progression is automatic: when your characters earn enough experience to go up a level, they do, and their increases in statistics are shown to you. Customisation is limited to equipping them with up to three pieces of gear (each with different beneficial combat effects), and choosing which battle cards each character has equipped.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have about the gameplay is that there is no map. A world map showing discovered locations and the routes between them, as well as your current location, would have been a very useful addition. Local maps for each of the quest areas wouldn't have gone astray either, as some of them are just big enough to mean that I forgot where I was on occasion.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Original and interesting game world with fantasy and steampunk roots\n+ Big, colourful graphics and pleasant atmospheric music\n+ Easy-to-use interface\n+ Achievements to make it a bit more interesting\n+ Great writing! Very few, if any, grammar errors\n+ The game allows you to reconfigure your equipment loadout after losing a battle, before trying again\n\nCons:\n- Very short: only 'over seven hours' according to the Steam game page\n- Combat can be a bit frustrating when you just can't get the cards you want to appear in your 'hand' and have to keep retrying the same battle\n\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Trulon: the Shadow Engine is a great game. I've had a lot of fun with it so far and I expect to finish it very soon. The game world is interesting, the characters are mostly likeable, and the game is fun and not too stressful to play. I look forward to Kyy's next foray into game development, hopefully set in the world of Trulon.\n\n8/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","March 1","true","6.3"," 28 of 66 people (42%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","42","28","66","7","0"

The story is paper thin, and the characters aren’t given any real development. The combat system is inventive and embraces the charm of MTG and other tabletop games, but bogs down the experience with unnecessarily boring and repetitive animations. The game was designed for mobile gamers, and the developers have done very little to port it over to PC. The game just has an aura of laziness, where easily identifiable problems are ignored for the sake of simplicity. While I won’t say gamers shouldn’t pick it up, they should know about these problems before picking up this game that falls short of being exceptional.  I can only barely recommend it.","March 2","true","18.6"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","12","33","0","0"

It’s a pretty run of the mill JRPG with a somewhat interesting combat system, yet there’s something about the look, music and general theme that I really enjoy.\n\nThe most interesting part of Trulon is the combat system. While it has your normal JRPG non-sense it takes a book out of Collectible Card Games by making the abilities you used based off a card deck. Your deck can be as large as you want, but you’re limited to 4 cards in your hand at any one time, after every turn you draw new cards and the action continues. Outside of your deck you have two ‘Wild Cards’ which are randomised cards (to an extent), meaning you’ll never been in a situation where you cannot do anything. This allows for classic card game situations, where you can set up awesome wombo combos, be incredibly unlucky or top deck that card that is the difference between victory and defeat. Overall it’s a pretty solid system, though early on in the game with a limited card pool it is a little stale.\n\nThe game controls well, looks nice and has an easy going soundtrack. It makes the experience very enjoyable and even easier to digest. There’s something nice about just running around, exploring the world and finding new monsters and new loot. The only thing that takes me out of this enjoyable experience is the slow and repetitive combat animations, and when you use another window the game pauses. There are a lot of situations where I’m waiting for the NPC to do its turn, or I’m sitting through a loading screen and I just want to tab out for a second to check out some news or social media, this time does add up, and it's just frustrating when I need to sit through this combat sequence that I have no control over.\n\nIf you want an enjoyable JRPG style experience this is the game for you. The interesting card system mixed in with the pleasant setting and atmosphere makes for an enjoyable experience. There might be no ground breaking gameplay elements, or a story that makes me question my existence, but it’s just nice sometimes to kick back, with a drink in one hand, while I slay monsters with my squad with the other.\n\n\nVideo Gameplay/Review - https://youtu.be/qUhAyxlYyrg","March 1","true","4.0"," 15 of 40 people (38%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","38","15","40","4","0"

Music is mediocore but not annoying. Storyline is fun and entertaining, has kept me moving forward and entertained even though it isnt very complex. Character devlopment isnt very difficult but has just enough RPG elements to it to make it fun.\n\nThe battle card system is fun and kind of unique, have had several battles where i had to change what type of cards or who was holding them to win the battle, so it ads a little strategy to it. no perma death or anything, lose a battle and restart again to try and beat it after making some changes.\n\nThere are fun map quests to find items or skill enhancements.\nThere are also standard storyilne quests that drive the story and the game so it is linear in the fact.\n\nThe only thing that could be added to the game to make it better is a large overview map and some descriptors for the card skills. Without a map sometimes it took a little while to figure out where i was going for the next quest.\n\nOther than that I have really enjoyed the game so far.","March 1","true","5.3"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","4","19","2","0"
