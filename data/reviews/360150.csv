While the game itself is unchanged(which was orginally pretty good) the idea doesn't really work. This game was built as a top down game not a 3rd person shooter, and it's apperent in the game.\n\nUpdate: Aiming has been somewhat fixed since my review. Not fixed entirly, but it's better.\n\nAiming doesn't work in 3rd person like it does in top down. Using a bow and arrow is almost impossible. Each shot actually shoots one or two feet away from it's intened location when aiming at moving targets. Now I understand that if I was moving then there'd be a change, but if I'm standing still the arrow should go where I aim it(or atleast close to it). The thing that gets me is that it works perfectly fine on stationary targets. I aim at the head and the arrow goes into the head(even if the zombie is moving up and down while eating something on the ground), but once they start moving you better pull out your melee cause there's no telling where the shot will go. I shouldn't have to compensate for a target  moving directly at me.\n\nThe animations also feel off. Again, the game was made top down not as 3rd person so that explains it, It doesn't excuse it, but explains it.\n\nOverall the game feels like an Alpha. It needs some more polish before I think about starting it up again.","July 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 136 of 178 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","136","178","5","4"

Personally, I feel this is WAY better than the top down mode.\n\nNow, for those who are still confused on aiming... Do NOT try to lead anything. Not ever. Even if they are 100 yards away, you time your click so that it is RIGHT when their head (or whatever you want to hit) is on the dot. Even if the arrow looks like it will miss, it won't, and you will get head shots every time provided you can aim. This is directly due to the fact that this game was originally a different perspective, so impact prediction is not the same as a game in which this was planned. Just remember what I've told you and you'll see it is no problem.\n\nThis was honestly one of the best surprises for a game I've already owned that I've had in a very long time.

After about 45 minutes in... well, you know how some develpoers take a mobile game and just slap it on PC with little to no change? This is kind of the same idea, except it was a top-down shooter turned into a 3rd person shooter. It shows bad.\n\nThe original was a top down shooter, thus all the derpy melee animations were forgiveable and controls worked as it was. This is basically a move of the camera with a few control tweaks. Aiming is attrocious, so don't even bother trying to use anything ranged for headshots, so that's half of the weapons are a pain to use. In the original, it'd lock on to headshots after aiming at an enemy for a while. Now, in addition to the fact that to hit anything, you have to aim somewhere to the right of everything, but since most zombies hobble back and forth so quick, headshots are a pain, unless they're unaware you're there.\n\nAlso, now you have to tote around flint all the time to light fires. In the original, you lit them as soon as you got your first skill and they stayed lit. Now, not only do you need flint to light them as a consumable, but the rain will put them out. I'm not sure if I like this or not... yet... I haven't played this enough to decide. I CAN tell you I don't like the fact that the inventory, skills, etc screen doesn't pause the game, as it takes several clicks to combine things or use something. While this is happening, a zombie can easily get a cheap hit in, especially at night with the crawly ones. (Which to keep away witht he flashlight, you need to walk in an occasional circle to keep them back, both in the original and this one.)\n\nThe game could really use a mini-map or compass. Since the original was top-down, it's easy to tell north from south, but now to decern which way you're facing, but here you have to check the map. A small gripe, but it's tedious.\n\n\nAnyways, I hope the devs plan on putting some effort into a patch, now that I can't get a refund because it's passed 14 days. (Forgot I had it pre-ordered and got busy.) I would've gotten a refund right away and hoped they did better later, but hey... they got my money. Can't do anything about it but wait now. It's a shame, because I like how the new persective looks and I liked the first itteration just fine.","July 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","28","51","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infinitysuns/recommended/360150/","infinitysuns","Infinitysuns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infinitysuns/","795 products in account","Since this standalone is nearly identical to the original game, I think it would be fair to judge it based on three points:\n\na) the new camera angle (what it introduces, how it feels, whether it is solid or flawed),\nb) the pricing (i.e., whether the new camera angle justifies a standalone that costs extra money, and whether this extra cost is fair or not IMO),\nc) the look of the game/graphics, now that the camera angle has shifted (more on this later).\n\nFirstly, the developers try to sell the new camera as "a deeply immersive point of view." That's about it. It seems like a relatively minor change at first glance. All this means is that the camera now looks over the shoulder of your character rather than from a bird's eye view. Surprisingly, however, the new camera does affect the original gameplay in a few subtle but noticeable ways: for one, you are more or less tied to the same field of vision of your character. You can't see beyond walls or bushes that surround your character, unlike in the original game. Another subtle change is the new three-dimensional factor, as in the fact that you now need to aim like in a FPS. Of course, if you're more into flashy visual effects, the killmoves and gore are a tad more fun to look at, but don't expect much and don't expect the feeling to last long. All in all, calling the new camera "deeply immersive" might perhaps be a bit of an overexaggeration, but I think the developers have at least delivered on this point.\n\nNow, onto the cost. I'm sure many of you bought this standalone at 70% off (for me, that's $3.29 CAD). This is more or less what the standalone is worth, and this is what it should normally cost. Unless you're huge fan of the original and/or want to support the developers with more money, this standalone (which is, at best, more of an expansion, and in actuality more like DLC) is NOT worth the full price ($10.99 where I'm at). Although the standalone's new content is good, there's simply not enough content to justify any price higher than $5. So, as long as this standalone is on sale for 50% off, consider my review a recommendation. At full price, however, consider my review a positive one, but also avoid this standalone and buy the original game instead.\n\nLastly, onto the visual look of the game. The quality of the textures is more or less on par with the original, but the new camera angle also affects how the textures look now that you're so much closer to them. In some spots, you can see that they are quite blurry. That said, you're probably not going to get the game (the original and/or the standalone) for how it looks, so these grievances are quite minor.\n\nI imagine with mod support, though, this standalone will become much more impressive.

That is until I restarted the game after having quit it, only to discover that many of my inventory items had disappeared and worse, the skill point I earned from leveling up was gone.\nWhat is the point of removing unused skill points when you quit the game?  What is the point of removing inventory items when you quit the game?\n\nThe actual gameplay is a lot of fun, but this issue of missing items when you restart the game is just infuriating.  Was anyone else annoyed with this situation?\n\nWould I recommend still getting the game?  Yeah.

Once you learn the controls and how to aim you can venture through the islands without too much trouble. Being able to see off into the distance and sniping zombie hordes before they get to you makes things a lot easier. The story, setting, crafting and missions are all solid and entertaining.  As far as individual games go I am having fun with it and would recommend it.\n\nBut.\n\nAs far as sequels, remakes or what ever this would be called this falls short in comparison to the original. This is the original game from a different camera perspective. The story, island layout, quests, crafting and generally everything in this game is exactly the same as the original more or less. This shows through as you progress through the game. The maps, area layout, enemy AI and spawning seem to be the same as they were in the original. Unfortunately the original was a top down camera angle game so those elements were designed with having a 360 view around your character. Without that perspective you can easily find yourself swarmed at times with nowhere to run. If you played the original and were a fan of the top down version do not go into this expecting the same experience. The game play is fairly different with a greater need for spacial awareness of your surroundings and where you are.\n\nSo to summarize\n\nAs it's own game it's entertaining and I recommend it. If you were a fan of the original go in with an open mind and be ready to learn new tactics.","July 12, 2015","true","17.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This game is WAY BETTER now than diablo-alike original one.\n\nWhat is different: camera (and related, perhaps rendering sea further) and targeting, e.g. critical hit is not a holding right mouse button longer, but indeed a clean "headshot" (shot into head huh).\n\nFinding valuables are harder now. Only knowing "here must be a herb" helps, plants/sticks are totally invisible in the grass. It would be unbelievable hard to add some sort of highlighting.\n\nOtherwise game is not improved even a bit. No way to rewind nights (afk works, but it's my precious time). Same crappy consolish UI without separate hotkeys for different invtentory tabs. Same "intelligent" respawn, you may find your way back cut by complete respawn of whole area of map while it was cleared right few minutes ago.\n\nThey could "improve" their original game by adding this as an option, but they decide to sell it, so both crap games are on the market now.

So now my playing experience goes a bit like this:\n\nGame loads me into starting point of 3rd island in the night with no charged flashlight and 2 minutes of food left.\nKill the 3 night creatures that always attack immediately; use up precious time and health doing so.\nPick up the raw meat that's sitting just in front of me, tantalising but deadly till cooked.\nRun to the beach - kill some things, pick some mushrooms - beef and mushrooms for supper, yum!\nFind the unlit fire on the beach that I need to cook supper.\nSeconds of life left, time to light the fire that wil let me cook the meat to feed me as well as keep the night creatures at bay. Things are looking up, I'm going to survive after all!\nCan't light the fire. Need flint. Had flint before but I used it up when lighting my last fire an island ago. Apparently flint burns like matches.\nTry using a molotov cocktail to light fire - to no avail. Seems spraying burning petrol across a pile of dry firewood doesn't cause it to ignite.\nStand in despair looking at my unlit fire and deadly uncooked meat, watching last seconds of life drain away due to inevitable starvation.\nMake a run for the interior of the island to try to find flint. Die 5 seconds later.\nLast thoughts are "how did I light that molotov?"\n\nProblem is you can save at certain points, or rely on checkpoint saves, but only your last save is stored. If I want to restart I need to go back to the beginning.\nOther problem is that in the original version I dont remember flint finding being an issue - fires could be lit when found if you had the skill, and that meant food and some protection from the dangers of the night.  In this reworking the lack of fire is a killer.\n\nBut forget those minor quibbles - the original game was just a joy to play and this brings a whole new enhanced experience to it - and as an owner of the original it cost less than a pint.\n\n10/10 - would endlessly repeat last two minutes of frantically rubbing two sticks together.\n","July 4, 2015","true","17.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The game NEEDS more graphic settings especilally for lower end PC's like mine because my system can only run it at around 16-23 fps at low settings. NOT GOOD..\n2. If the developers want to incorporate online to the game, the graves are not the way to go. The graves of other players really get annoying. There are some players whose names are so long that it creates this log black box that can't be blocked off, meaning it gets in the way of whatever you are trying to see. If theres a way to turn that off please let me know. With this perspective of the game, Mulitplayer would be AMAZING. It already looks like a multiplayer game.\n\nThose pretty much my only complaints. This is a great game, its really fun to play. Its one of those games that you can't just run in there and expect to kill every zombie in your way, like a hack and slash. Its a game that requires precision and well-timed strikes. Otherwise you'll only end up getting killed.

So now my playing experience goes a bit like this:\n\nGame loads me into starting point of 3rd island in the night with no charged flashlight and 2 minutes of food left.\nKill the 3 night creatures that always attack immediately; use up precious time and health doing so.\nPick up the raw meat that's sitting just in front of me, tantalising but deadly till cooked.\nRun to the beach - kill some things, pick some mushrooms - beef and mushrooms for supper, yum!\nFind the unlit fire on the beach that I need to cook supper.\nSeconds of life left, time to light the fire that wil let me cook the meat to feed me as well as keep the night creatures at bay. Things are looking up, I'm going to survive after all!\nCan't light the fire. Need flint. Had flint before but I used it up when lighting my last fire an island ago. Apparently flint burns like matches.\nTry using a molotov cocktail to light fire - to no avail. Seems spraying burning petrol across a pile of dry firewood doesn't cause it to ignite.\nStand in despair looking at my unlit fire and deadly uncooked meat, watching last seconds of life drain away due to inevitable starvation.\nMake a run for the interior of the island to try to find flint. Die 5 seconds later.\nLast thoughts are "how did I light that molotov?"\n\nProblem is you can save at certain points, or rely on checkpoint saves, but only your last save is stored. If I want to restart I need to go back to the beginning.\nOther problem is that in the original version I dont remember flint finding being an issue - fires could be lit when found if you had the skill, and that meant food and some protection from the dangers of the night.  In this reworking the lack of fire is a killer.\n\nBut forget those minor quibbles - the original game was just a joy to play and this brings a whole new enhanced experience to it - and as an owner of the original it cost less than a pint.\n\n10/10 - would endlessly repeat last two minutes of frantically rubbing two sticks together.\n","July 4, 2015","true","17.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Want more of that?\nWell, don't play this game.\n\nAnimations are laggy, slow, look like stop motion. The aiming is absolutely terrible.

This game does not translate well to a 3d-perspective. Playability is dismal and leaves one wondering what is wrong with their keyboard. Targeting and striking is not precise and requires a fair amount of guesswork. You almost get the enjoyment of playing a game while being drunk, but without being intoxicated at all; it's the game, not you. The remainder of the game feels like a shadown of How to Survive or rather a beta test that needs work.\n\nBUT... that's not really the problem with this putrid game.\n\nDo you like Lagzilla? Do you? I don't. I could understand frame-rate issues if the details are set high and the PC is not up to it. However, a significant delay between pressing a key or button (1/2 second or more) is simply inexcusable. It is not limited to movement or attacks either, this wonderous feature also applies to mouse movement, rotating the camera, and even, as an added bonus, navigating the menu! Want to exit the game and be done with it? Well, be prepared to fight the interface to be free!\n\nOne of the charming aspects of this games 2d predecessor is the witty animations and narrations, subtly echoing the inane deliruim of the Pip-man character from the Fallout series. While these ran perfectly fine in that title, they don't here. Instead, we partake in a garbled mess of interlaced vomit smeared across the screen. If you think changing settings will fix this, think again. Perhaps you're the ingenious sort who fiddles with his computer and updates video codecs with great skill and precision. Well, fooled you twice, no dice for you! Perhaps you can just watch the original videos on some Youtube Lets Plays and fast-forward to the needed footage. It's not like you paid for this game or anything.\n\nIt's sad, really. The publishers did fair job on this games predecessor, How to Survive: Storm Warning Edition. It wasn't perfect, it wasn't even a 8/10 title, but it was acceptable, fun, and (most importantly) FUNCTIONAL. In this version, while we get to get a annoyed-parrot's eye view of the action, the daunting task of making the game work properly was clearly not a priority. In fact, it wasn't even on the list... not even the To-Do-When-Everything-Else-Is-Done List.\n\nIt dissapoints me to pay money for a game and find that the publisher has taken an "Up yours" attitude towards its customers. The development clearly went straight from alpha directly to publication. There is no excuse for this rubbish.\n\nDo not buy this game. Look at the screenshots, smile, and wonder "What if?". In fact, don't even accept this title for free or as a gift.\n\n-2/10 (yes, that's a Negative two)","December 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/360150/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","TLDR at bottom.\n\nThis version takes every problem from the first game and amplifies them to stupifying proportions. It still has a lack of direction throughout, combined with a awkward crafting system. Now the fact that items never had an object glow and most of them blended in with the rest of the game is strikingly apparant in third person. Finding things isn't hard, but only if you have played the game previously. This game is, for many reasons, a extremely bad way to make a game for newcomers. It is too heavily inaccessible for new players, too clunky/janky, and the lack of direction will just confuse and turn off all new players. I hadn't played the game in forever so I forgot to pick up a piece of flint on the beach to light a fire. The game does not tell you to do that so I went to the forum and of course right there on the first page someone else had posted about it and I had to use that information just to learn to pick up a piece of flint to start a fire. Probably the stupidest problem yet though is the way night time affects you now in third person. I will just list below the lame-brained ♥♥♥♥ I can think of as I go.\n\n- In third person you get to see how laughably bad the graphics, animations, hitboxes on enemies, hitboxes when firing ranged weapons, and combat are. Zooming this game in was a bad idea. The top down version is far, far superior to this, but still not a very good game anyway.\n- Combat was doable in the top down version because of things like a reticule over the enemies head when you hover the mouse over them and as it got smaller, homed in so you could get a headshot, alowing you to get a few headshots before you got rushed and had to switch to melee. Now, that is gone, and ranged combat just feels horribly awkward.\n- With the top down version, you could see all around you and in the dark when the night creatures came up behind you, you could turn around and shine your flashlight on them. Now of course because it is in third person, you can't see behind you so those night creatures can now just casually come right up behind you before you have any clue and dmg you.\n- It still has items that seemingly never combine with anything else and are useless (white herbs, blue herbs, etc)\n- Zombies can still do a awkward circle-slide move around you, which I have seen in many sloppily coded zombie games, making you take unavoidable dmg while dancing with them.\n- Healing herbs are, like they were in the first version of the game, incredibly rare until later in the game. That was tolerable then, but now with new problems I'm going to list next that make you take dmg way more often in third person view, it is a bad problem.\n- Guns: Forget about firing a weapon at zombies if they are anywhere near you. The hit detection is so bad that when a zombie is near me and I fire the shotgun, it just misses while the zombie has a awkward movement to my left-front side and does dmg to me. If I want to hit it now, I have to aim at a wierd straight-down-left-of-center angle because firing directly into it while it's close feels like the bullets are just clipping through it, because they are.\n- Bow: same goes for the bow. As the enemies get closer to you, even if you are aiming directly into them, arrows miss. The only way to really kill anything is with melee. It wasn't like that in the reg version. Aiming was good and even had a reticule that would power up while on a enemy's head allowing you to get headshots occasionally. Now, you are required to use free aim.\n- Free aim is a mess because of slightly unresponsive mouse movement. Your view does not snap instantly with your mouse movement, it takes a fraction of a second to catch up and feels like mouse lag. I saw other people post about it in the forums as well. It feels uncomfortable to say the least.\n- When you are low on health you walk very, very slow, basically drag your feet, and since there are no healing herbs early on, this is a big problem. Unless of course you like traversing a game at 1mph.\n- I could go on, but this is long enough already.\n\nTLDR: Like I said, rather than introduce a fun new way to play, the third person view just zooms in on the already existing problems, magnifying them into worse and even new issues. A third person survival game that comes to mind in comparison (albeit without zombies) is Tomb Raider, which is infinitely better than this in every possible aspect. If you want a real zombie survival third person game that is actually done well and feels like a real game and not a janky awkward bad-hitbox mess with lack of direction and a poorly executed crafting system like this game, State of Decay is a very good game, far exceeding this game in every aspect you could possibly think of.\n\nLike i gave the top down version, thumbs down. That I gave a 5/10, so to be fair this would be a 4/10 at best. I paid $3 for this, and that was $3 too much.","July 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","4"

Yes, sure, maybe it was actually time consuming making this "new" game, but this is a dlc for the first game. This is in no way a game of its own, and is not worth the $10.00 it is after pre-purchase. In fact, the only reason I bought it and was even a little bit encouraged that this was going to be somewhat of a good game, was that I generally liked third/first person shooters. In this game, it hardly feels like it's any different to the real one. At least it was $3.00 to buy before it came out. If you haven't gotten the real game, and you are looking to get one of them, get whichever one you think you will have the most fun with; I personally prefer the original because of its originality. Hey, it's not a bad game though, once you get past the super linear, unclear-in-direction gameplay. Also, have fun trying to aim while being chased.

Why?\n-Third person view makes it more difficult because you do not see what is behind your back, that is why you must always remember to check your back (as you do in other FPS's and/or TPS's).\n-Crafting stays the same compared to the regular H2S but it adds durability, which is a bit annoying (it makes it almost impossible to craft and use two triple boomerangs), but also adds a more realistic touch to the whole game.\n-The aiming mechanics could be a bit improved to add realism to aiming because it is disturbing, that when you shoot an arrow the zombie already goes out of your aim circle but you still hit him. It could be improved so that you would have to plan a bit ahead.\n-For all you whining little B******/C****, the flashlight mechanic is great. I haven't seen a battery holding flashlight not to run out of juice exactly when it is least needed, so this is why you must always carry a shotgun to fend off the crawlers at night, when you run out of juice.\n-Last but not least, i've read quite some reviews saying, it is imposible to find items/fruits/ammo on the ground. If you were able to find them in the overheadview game, you will find them even easier here, because you are closer and should be familiar to the looks of items. And even if you haven't played the original, belive me, it is no problem.\n\nAll-in-all the only real negative point for this game is the missing multiplayer and co-op option, and i belive that it will be added in the future.","August 9, 2015","true","5.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

What  I like about this game so far. The view looks good and makes it feel more alive rather then the over head view. It comes with almost all the DLC of the original game. I did not own any DLC of the original game. The game does look more alive thanks to the 3rd person viewpoint however that also shows the ugly side of the graphics that were sort of hidden by the older view point. The enemies you have to kill are slighty  Fugly.  The textures just dont have a lot of pop to them.\n\nThe fighting is mostly good. Getting a critical hit on a zombie is a good feeling. The bad feelins is trying to figure out when to press the A button for an insta kill on a zombie. It  feels  very finiky and sometimes comes up and sometimes never comes up. Its annoying. This is for melee weapons only. The aiming for both melee and ranged weapons is  a mixed bag. The bow felt weird to fire. I missed a lot of easy shots for whatever reason. Just to add some more thoughts on combat. When they changed the view point they should have changed the way to aim a lot more then they did. Arrows and throwing bombs felt very off and often I would miss an easy throw with a bomb thanks to no guide on where it would land. Annoying.\n\nI would say if you didnt like the first game your probably not going to like this game. I should mention one big thing that is sure to annoy some people. The game has no multiplayer. The original game did have co op. This one does not. I do not mind this but some may. I think if you enjoyed the first one then you may like this one as well. Just depends if you like the 3rd person view point or not. I think for the low price of $3 dollars for originial owners is a nice deal.  I think the higher price for people who do not own this game could be a mixed bag. After playing this a lot more I am more inclined to say that people who have never played this are going to have a MUCH harder time enjoying this game. To me its a lot harder even on the easy mode. Easy mode to me feels like hard mode. Not to mention the bug with the stick you carry it breaks on the very first mission. That to me is a very big bug in the gameplay.\n\nThe fighting is good but I still feel like it could be improved on a little bit. Melee and ranged weapons feel a little off to me. That being said my rating for people who own the original game I would say its a good buy. I think for people who do not own this its a mixed bag and I would rate the game a 7/10. Good but not great.  I didnt give it an 8 or higher because no co op and other small issues I detailed above. Over all I recommend the game to previous owners.","July 5, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's a basic third person shooter with some wonky aiming mechanics, mostly awful quests, but has some good ideas with the crafting and survival elements and anything dealing with Kovac.  Don't go in expecting something on the level of State of Decay though.  It's a much cheaper game than that.\n\nAlso to note, my review is only in regards to this version.  I did not play the previous top down original, so I can't compare.","July 10, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The store page is cristal clear on the content.\nI have the original and I'm really enjoying this second playthrough.\n-----\nEdit. I was too quick to write about the game. Aiming is terrible and doesn't work at all. In the orginal version you had enough time to aim and do some headshots, in this game the aim is not assisted, i.e. the bullet or arrow goes straight were you are aiming.\nProblems :\n- zombies come to contact and your weapon becomes utterly useless as you CAN NOT aim at objects next to you ;\n- zombies come in groups, every time you need to free a shelter they are so numerous you will inevitably die ;\n- zombies spawn every few seconds ;\n\nThis is a poorly developped game.","October 9, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes place on a tropical island upon where you wake up on the beach surrounded by 'zombies' of various makes and models.  You must then fight your way through the undead and the elements by crafting, looting and clearing.  The idea holds up pretty well, even in the dirge of zombie-themed survival games simply because this one has more of an action-adventure feel.  It's fast paced, gives you plenty to shoot at and crafting is simple and intuitive.\n\nThe survival mechanics are pretty basic: drink water, eat food and get some sleep/caffine each day.  There's not much to it and it's pretty forgiving so I'm not sure it really adds much to the adventure, but at the same time it doesn't detract from it either.  The crafting, on the other hand, is actually done quite well.  Instead of a 'gather materials/find bench' approach, you actually combine parts into the finished product.  I really like this approach.  You don't put items in a grid or follow a recipe, you simply combine parts until you get a finished product.  The order you do so is usually pretty lax too, so it serves as both an intuitive interface but also as clever inventory management as most things can be broken down again.  Since you are limited to combinations the game accepts, it's perhaps a bit limiting since that serves as your guidance for doing so, but I found it more interesting than the typical crafting offered by other games.\n\nThe game itself is a 'update' from a top down twin stick shooter, and personally I think both versions work alright, though the world itself was clearly built from an overhead perspective so there is a conspicous lack of things such as indoor areas.  Additionally there is a clear distinction between 'paths' and 'walls' and the perspective does make the island feel a lot smaller.  However, the translation to 3rd person works.  The biggest issue I ran into is simply trying to shoot an enemy very close to me.  You'll absolutely want to switch to your melee weapons in these types of scenarios as the game does not have any aim assist, shoulder swapping or range compensation.  It's a small hiccup though, I found it to be just as or even more enjoyable than the original.\n\nThe debate on whether it should be it's own product or a standalone aside,  I think this game has gotten a far worse rap than it deserves, it's functionally and technically sound.  It's recognizable among the endless hordes of similar titles thanks to some off-beat humor and despite being mindless fun, has quite a bit of content and challenge if you are up for the harder modes.  If you are looking for a decent single player zombie survival experience with an action adventure feel, here you go: it's cheap, fun and not in early access.","October 12, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's 505 games for you. A bunch of lazy devs who make games that have so much potential yet screw them over. For example Naughty bear, that game was great but they failed to make it good for many reasons like repetitive level design, small array of weapons, and some other issues. But what am I talking about, is this a Naughty Bear review or a How To Survive: Third Person Standalone review. Well I'm just going to list the pros and cons for this game for the heck of it.\n\nPros: Love the third person view, better then the top down view in the original game.\nThe crafting is okay.\nThe combat is okay too.\nAnd I don't know what else.\n\nCons: No co-op, the original had co-op why not this version of the game.\nSprinting is so bad. You run out of stamina in one second or two. No joke.\nThe zombies still look ugly looking. Like a bit low res to me.\nThe animations suck. They are cheap.\nThe camera is garbage. Trying to aim and hit a zombie is hard.\nAnd a few minor stuff I can't remember.\n\nIn conclusion, it sucks... Want to play a good zombie game? Play Project Zomboid.","January 21","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
