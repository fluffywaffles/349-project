Looks like it was rushed into release with all that it brings. Technical issues (seems like the game suffers from a memory leaks, as it started to lag/freeze and act unresponsive after an hour or so into playthrough) and poor AI being the most critical. Some gameplay mechanics and GUI are also not thought through well enough. On the bright side - game looks really well, nice GUI and unit textures, maps look great, game is really appealing visually. It also has some interesting gameplay mechanics, like carriers, naval warfare, supplies.\n\nThe game is certainly good, but it could use some additional 3-4 months of polishing and debugging.","November 26, 2013","true","0.8"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","49","68","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/258240/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","In the days of WW2 the combined allied forces faced off against a ruthless foe. A force which sent dozen of allied units to the gates of Hades with little effort. Battalions of tanks, squadrons of aircraft, sqauds of infantry and fleets of ships were all reduced to rubble. An enemy created by the gods to leave nothing but chaos, madness and destruction behind. A force which knew no mercy, showed no mercy and expected none in return. What is this force you ask? Game Balance...\n\nOn the surface, Tank Operations: European Campaign may seem like a decent turn base RTS game set in WW2. It is not until you actually start playing the game that you find that things are wrong.. very wrong.\n\nPlot is cliche and nothing you haven't seen before. You play as the American forces during World War 2, sent to the European front to defeat the Nazi occupied Europe.\n\nGameplay is unbalanced. In the campaign, you start of with a few starting units. You can build new units such as infantry, tanks, aircraft which will become useable next turn. As a turn base game, your units have limited 'moves' each turn. You can create new units like infantry, tanks, aircraft etc via buildings or ships. Some units also have special abilities (which need recharging afterwards) such as improving sight or damge. One of the my biggest gripes (as mentioned previously) is balance, which is shown by the fact that your units do pittiful damage, compared to enemy forces. To demonstrate this, in the first mission I had a two fleets of ships. I sent my landing force composed of tanks and infantry into the beach head. I immediately targeted the coastal guns to help defend my navy. My units did abissmal damage to the gun, but I thought it would be ok after I shot at it with my ships. After doing the later and ending my turn, the coastal gun (which somehow managed to survive 3 tank shots, 1 infantry attack and shots from 3 of my battleships) regained most of it's health (WHY!@!) and it along with a handful of tanks and infantry managed to decimate my force. By mid way I had lost most my ground forces, my aircraft badly needed repairs and my navy were being blown up to smitherines. Yet, I still was unable to eliminate a SINGLE coastal gun. This was honestly quite frustrating and made playing a chore rather than being fun.\n\nSound is decent, if mediocre. Weapons (ie. tank, ships, aircraft fire) sound decent, but nothing special. Music is forgettable. Voice acting is quite poor.\n\nGraphics arent that great. I personally don't mind the artstyle in these kind of games. However, the lack of animations (while moving) is quite cheap.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun, challenging and FAIR game, look elsewhere.\n","April 15, 2015","false","1.0"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","28","34","3","0"

In a lot of ways it's like a turn-based RUSE, but with much more realism and time to think. I have read a lot of negative reviews that say the game is too hard. Oh, poor babies! You think invading Axis Europe was easy? Hell no! So you can't take out the shore batteriess with ships or artillery? Maybe that's exactly what they were desiogned to resist! Oh no! What ever will we do? How about you use your dive bombers? Now there's an idea! This is exactly what makes the game great! You absolutely HAVE to rule the skies before even attempting a land-based advance. My only real criticisms are:  management of your aircraft squadrons is a bit messy, and generally a warning needs to be displayed if aircraft are low on fuel. Also, There needs to be a warning that tells you if you have forgotton to move and fire with any unit when you press 'next turn'.There has been a lot of talk about the following exploit: You can send in one unit followed by a group of ten, attack the enem,y with the lone unit and lose it to their counter attack. Then you can defeat the enemy unit with your ten and recieve no counter-attack. This is not a massive problem, but it xcould be fixed by allowing units infinite counter-attacks (ammo permitting), with exponentially decreasing effectiveness.\n\nPeoiple that are having trouble with operation Torch should think themselves lucky they are not trying to invade mainland Italy. Wow. Once you crack it, though, it's very reqarding. This game is a 'just one more turn' epic that will devour weeks of your life.

Several images are still in german. The number of unit types available and the unit balance is very poor.

For example: You must keep your veichles with fuel and ammo and to do that you must have fuel and ammo trucks wich is easy picking for the enemy. This  idea was most certain good on paper but in game its just painfull anoying. And one more thing your bombers must return to base after each bombing run but germans can bomb 2-3 times, how is this fairplay?\n\nIn some turns you cant see what hit your tanks? They just explode maybe hit from a tank far away?

You cannot move the naval units so they are sitting ducks for powerful artillary bunkers that are nearly impossible to destroy.  In the first scenario if you land an artillary unit or fuel or ammo truck the Axis bunkers with extreme range immedialtey kill it.  The infanty are very weak and die quickly.  And to top that off the game runs so slow.  I don't have trouble with speed of any other steam game I own but this one moves like molasses.\nSAve your money and buy something else.  I may come back to it if they ever tone it down so you actually have a shot of winning.\n","December 3, 2013","false","12.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Sorry, there are just far too many superior\nturn based "WW2" strategy games on the market right now. If you've already played Panzer Corps, Order of Battle Pacific, Panzer General and others than perhaps pick this one up for a cute playthrough.\n\n6/10\n\nI recommend buying the game on sale.

In my opinion, this is not accurate.  If one reads the history of this operation, there was some resistance put up by the Vichy forces but nothing like what I have seen in the scenario.  Also, why can't the ships be moved?  They are too vulnerable to the shore batteries and should be able to be moved farther away for protection.   Another thing that has me concerned is that the description of the Mark III tank is "heavy" which is not true.  The Grant tank had a larger gun than the MK III in 1942, especially in this theater of war.\n\nOverall, the gameplay seems interesting and I'll continue to play.

This...is not one of the better ones.\n\nThere are a lot of reviewers saying that the game is unbalanced, and a couple saying "oh, you're just using the wrong units!"  Having spent two hours and plenty of experimentation on the first mission thus far, I can tell you - it's not the units, it's the balance.  My biggest issue with the game is actually the extreme lethality - you're annihilating the enemy's units every turn, but they're also annihilating yours, and it's mostly a matter of who can spawn more fresh units onto the field faster.  So it gets very grindy, very quickly, as you build a mess of new stacks, hurl them at the enemy's airbase (which is apparently located in a bunker, as opposed to the nice neat (and more accurate) mechanic of Panzer Corps where you roll a tank in and capture it), do a little damage, wipe out the enemy nearby, get wiped out by their counter-attack, lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nBecause of this, you have no real incentive to preserve your own units - knowing that the next force to come over the hill is likely to blow them away anyway - so you just sort of fling them around mindlessly.  Manage supply lines?  No need, no one's lasting that long anyway!  Which sort of defeats the purpose of a strategy game.\n\nMaybe if it were getting more polish, or if there weren't so many better options on the market.  But it's sitting in a genre that's already saturated with good titles.  No reason to pick this one up.","May 22","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
