A life full of danger, fear, regret and melancholy.\nWhen the game takes you by the hand the only thing you can say is "WOW! this world is beautiful!"

This is the story of Nihilumbra, a puzzle based 2D platformer from Beautifun Games.\n\nThe game follows a vey narrative series of events travelling from the cold Icy hills through the forest, the desert, the volcano and finally to the city. Each location brings with it new challenges and a new skill to brave them. These skills come in the forms of colours, paints that can be spread around the environment at will. The first colour you obtain is blue, allowing the creation of ice. Then comes the green followed by the brown, creating bouncy and sticky surfaces respectively. From the volcano comes red, the ability to burn some things and  supercharge others. Finally there is yellow, the ability to create conductive lines to transfer power from energy sources to unpowered machines. It's the combination of all of these that will let you progress and aid in your escape from the void.\n\nThe gameplay is well established as you play, with a "tutorial" for each new colour. The levels are relatively easy on the first play through but after finishing once there is a new "Void" version of the levels, being more difficult and involved. The controlling of the colours is intuitive and easy to do, and if you make a mistake it's just as easy to undo your moves.\n\nThe visual style is fantastic with detailed painted backgrounds and foreground objects that have a parallax effect. When applying colours it is always easy to distinguish. The soundtrack is one that is extremely well fitting and only adds to the atmosphere. The voice over is a crucial part of the game and it wouldn't be the same without it. The tone of voice is one that makes the player feel safe while traveling and discovering.\n\nOverall the game is solid and everything seems to work as intended, some sections seem to be reliant on trial and error. There is a large difficulty curve between finishing the first playthrough and starting the second, it could have eased into it more.\n\nIt's has a good bang for your buck and the only thing I would like to see is a level editor with steam workshop integration. Other than that it's a great game.","November 27, 2013","true","2.9"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","63","72","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/recommended/252670/","kekmet","kekmet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/","501 products in account","One of my all-time favorite games. Nihilumbra is a side-scrolling puzzle game, where you control the lone protoganist, Born, guiding him through five varied realms. Born is alone, too- aside from the enemies in the game, which are few and far between, every landscape you travel through seems abandoned, deserted. It adds an apocalyptic feel to an already stark and melancholy game.\n\nBorn starts out with very few tricks up his sleeve- he can jump and move inexorably to the right, and the enemies he encounters are deadly. As you progress, though, you pick up new skills that allow you to alter the landscape around you- colors you can paint on the world to allow you to slide, bounce, stick, and more.\n\nThere's really two parts to this game- the story mode, which is relatively straight-forward but still retains a challenge, and the mode you unlock after beating the story, which is devilishly hard. The controls seemed fluid to me, though they take some getting used to- one hand moves Born, while the mouse uses the various colors to guide him along. The game rarely rushes you, and when it does, it's considerate enough to provide enough checkpoints to prevent too much repetition.\n\nThis seems to be Beautifun's Freshman game for the PC, and I am definitely looking forward to where they'll go from here.","February 8, 2014","true","14.0"," 47 of 48 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","47","48","0","4"

Main mechanic (besides moving your character) is altering game physics by "painting" 5 different colours (with different abilities, which are unlocked during main campaign) on almost any platform.\n\nCampaign is short (~3 hours) which is basically a preparation for the harder mode (The Void, ~2x harder and longer), which is unlocked after beating the game for the first time. In this mode, you'll need to employ platforming skills and brain cells a bit more. Good thing is, almost any level can be finished with different approach (using different colours which adds to replayability). Beating the hard mode will unlock a change which will give you the reason to put few more hours into the main campaign from the beginning (this feature completely change the mood of the game, which is dark/depressing by its setting).\n\nSteam achievements are not very difficult, most of them will be unlocked naturally by going through both playthroughs. Some requires higher platforming skill and exploration, but nothing impossible for 100%.\n\nFair price, decent length, good game. I was pleasantly surprised.

If you have neither, you probably won't get very far ;)\n\nBasic options include choice of seven languages and separate sliders for Music, Sound, and Voice, plus mono or stereo sound and mouse sensitivity.  The game automatically adjusted itself to my widescreen, and graphic options include choice of screen resolution, Enhanced color effects, HD textures, VSync, or Automatic settings (which was my preference)\n\nAs with most games of this type, you don't just save at any time -- there are save points.  Just touch the globe -- the small lights (aka checkpoints) that will "forgive your mistakes" -- to save your progress.  These are nicely spaced, so don't worry!\n\nUnlike most of these games is that we have multiple profiles to choose from (three of them,) so we can switch profiles if more than one person wants to play the game at once.\n\nIf you hit Esc. during gameplay, you'll see a button that says "Resume Game" and three symbols:  A compass, a swirl, and some gears.  Clicking on the gears will take you to the game settings, the middle button (the swirl) will take you back to your last checkpoint (you can cancel if you didn't mean to hit that button!) and the compass will take you back to the maps page, and from there you can get back to the main menu by clicking on the arrow at the bottom right of the page.\n\nWhere to start?  Well, I guess at the beginning would be best!\n\nThe game very clearly shows us how to play, without being annoying in any way.  The instructions are seamlessly introduced by our narrator, who stays with us throughout our journey, giving us new information and telling us the story.  What a wonderful voice they chose, and such an interesting way to progress the story!\n\nThe controls are basic to start with -- the arrow keys or W-A-S-D and space bar to jump. I recommend using W-A-S-D, as later in the game it's nearly impossible to continue to use the arrow keys whilst managing your colors!  As we progress, we discover colors which allow us to affect the world around us.  The game teaches us to use these colors very clearly, so don't worry!  Each color has a different effect, and I don't want to ruin any surprises, so I'll just mention the first two:  The only color we have at the very beginning is purple, which is unusable until we discover other colors, for it allows us to erase any colors we place or find.  Soon we will learn how to use blue, which creates an icy surface where it is placed.  NOW we can use the purple, if we so desire. ;)  Each world area we visit teaches a new color ability, and all told, we have five worlds and five colors:  Blue, brown, green, yellow, and red (though not in that order.)\n\nSo how do we use our colors?  It's really very easy.  In the top right corner is an orb showing your current color.  Click on it to open up your color palette (see the first picture in post #1 for a visual.)  Choose whatever color you need for the current situation you're facing.  To place the color, simply hold down your mouse button and swipe the cursor over the surface you want to coat.\n\nYou have a limited amount of color to use, and sometimes it's necessary to remove the color you've placed to complete the current puzzle.  To do so you COULD click on the color palette, choose purple, and click-and-drag the areas where you want to remove it... OR, you can do it the easy way and simply right-click-and-drag. :D\n\nDuring my second time through the main story I discovered that we can easily and quickly change our color by simply using the scroll wheel on the mouse!  Whee~!  Happy day!\n\nThe experience is really the driving force of the game.  It's one thing to watch someone play it, and something else to actually sit back and do it for yourself.  Take your time.  Discover.  Learn.  Let yourself be immersed in this beautiful and deadly world.  You could power through all the scenes and ignore all of that, but you'd really be missing out.\n\nThe primary focus of the game is discovery.  Find your way through the worlds without being damaged or reclaimed by the Void.  Nihilumbra is very story-driven, and for the most part, we have plenty of time explore and figure out how to solve the puzzles.  Towards the end of each world, the Void will advance, leaving us with only a certain amount of time to get through the final screens.  The use of the scroll wheel to change colors makes a big difference in the difficulty level, but even if you're doing the point-and-click method (which I was the first time through!) it's still doable.\n\nFive colors, five worlds...  Before I knew it, I came to 'The End' and was watching the credits. *cry*  I felt so wistful, wishing that it hadn't ended so soon, wishing that there was more...  Two hours is all it took (the second time 'round,) yet I felt that it was still worth the asking price.\n\n. . . except that it wasn't 'The End' at all!  It turned out that this was only the beginning of my journey in Nihilumbra, and the true challenge still lay before me.  Now the 'Void Mode' was unlocked, and the focus of the game changes.  We've finished with the main story, but still have much to do!  Every single save point from the main game is now a complex puzzle that needs to be solved, and all puzzles must be completed to have true closure for the story.  There are no save points during these puzzles, and I can tell you for certain that you will die -- over and over again -- before you're able to figure things out.  The story-driven, take-your-time adventure is over, and is now filled with one complex, mind-bending puzzle after another.  Though I had a couple of "how the heck am I supposed to get past that?" moments, I was able to get through the main story without even thinking about about looking at a walkthrough.  The Void gameplay, though?  I couldn't figure out the very first screen! Mahaha~  I admit that I've had to look a couple of times, but I've been finding great joy in figuring things out on my own whenever I can.\n\nAm I finished with the game?  Not even close, but I'm enjoying every moment I spend playing. I can't even begin to tell you how beautifully-done this game is.  The combination of story with narration are poignant and thought-provoking, leaving us with a lot to consider, and I found it equally moving my second time through (the main story -- still working on the Void section!)  The music is beautiful, though I found it better to have the music and sound effects half the volume of the narration.  For me, it was the perfect balance.  I really loved everything about the game, and I can't recommend it highly enough!

No thanks!” You might say. But wait! Not all portable titles are games with simple yet addictive mechanics looking to take your money. Nihilumbra is a neat little puzzle platformer from Spanish developer Beautifun Games. You take control of Born, a creature created by The Void, who escapes to the real world. Relentlessly pursued by that which created him, Born treks across new and strange environments, discovering what it truly means to be alive.\nHe isn’t the only being from The Void that has crossed over however. Every now and then you will encounter a new enemy, each more dangerous than the last. These, combined with various environmental hazards provide much of the challenge outside of the platforming. The jumping itself isn’t complex, but as the game progresses you will discover new colours which can be painted on the walls, ceilings and ground of the levels. The game has five separate worlds, and there is a colour tied to each of them.\nThe Frozen Hills grants you blue, a colour to make surfaces icy, helping you run faster or push previously unmovable objects. The Living Forest gives you green, allowing you to make surfaces bouncy. The Ash Desert provides brown, which makes anything you paint it on sticky. The Volcano grants you red, which heats up surfaces to burn objects and enemies alike. Finally, The City unlocks yellow, which conducts electricity, allowing you to link electrical objects together. Thankfully the controls translate to keyboard and mouse perfectly. Painting is as simple as left clicking and dragging, and doing the same with right click acts as an eraser.\nAlthough the game is 2D, the first two colours in particular have a very Portal 2-esque feel about them. You will be using momentum to jump and bounce your way to new platforms, and although it sometimes lacks precision, it isn’t all that frustrating. You will often use multiple colours in the same puzzle. For example you might use yellow to activate a powerful electromagnet, lifting your enemies into the air. Using brown on the floor in front of you allows you to walk along underneath them without being attracted yourself. There are a good amount of well thought out puzzles here. None of them take particularly long to figure out though. The game as a whole is not all that hard, and can be completed in a few hours at most – an unfortunate leftover from the fast paced mobile platform it was born on.\nNihilumbra employs a simple, yet effective art style. Each level has its own colourful theme, often attempting to give you a feel of the heat of the area. The icy areas are very blue, and the volcano is red, for obvious reasons, but this also related to the story. As Born uncovers new colours he begins to feel warmer inside, as if The Void inside him is being filled. The main character himself begins as an amorphous blob, but upon entering the real world he decides to change himself to try and blend in. The first thing he encounters is a scarecrow however, so you spend the rest of the game naively jumping around as a cute, raggedy old shadow creature. The character design of the Void enemies is good too, with weird plant creatures which launch projectiles at you, and a huge snail-like thing that erases any colours it slithers over.\nAt the end of each world, there is a fast paced platforming section where you are being chased by The Void. Ever encroaching from the left of the screen, you simply have to stay ahead of it and reach the end. These are some of the weakest sections of the game, as it shows off the lack of accuracy the platforming has at times. Switching between colours quickly is cumbersome, especially when attempted at speed. I would have liked the action to pause when bringing up the colour menu, as I often got caught out without the colour I needed. Thankfully the game is liberally checkpointed, even in the normal levels, so you never lose much progress. These checkpoints also seem to return all of your colour to you. It feels as if you are using some sort of resource when painting, but this was never explained, and I never ran out, so I can’t be sure.\nAll in all, Nihilumbra is a short, but fun, puzzle platformer. The puzzles you encounter aren’t all that difficult, but they do require some thought, particular in later stages. The platforming itself isn’t all that good, but the unique painting mechanics make up for it. Mobile games are becoming more complex, and simply better overall, and it is nice to see that some of the higher quality ones are making the switch over to PC.","September 10, 2015","true","11.3"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","40","42","2","0"

There are plenty of games with an art style similarly atmospheric, others that use colour or shadow as a gameplay mechanic. What about Limbo? Contrast? Why entertain this indie game when you can play those?\n\nIt certainly isn't the first platformer to capture my heart, but there is something undeniably special about Nihilumbra and it would be a crime to dismiss its own merits because you've met your quota for indie games this year.\n\nNihilumbra is a bleak but beautiful puzzle-platformer, stunning in its simplicity, that struck a chord with me in an emotionally cathartic, personal way. I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\nYou are Born, an adorable creature from The Void, who spends the game fleeing because The Void wants you back where you belong. Home. The darkness. Born must run from the all-consuming Void, adapting to his new and vibrant surroundings in the real world, encountering enemies generated by The Void, with ever intensifying (occassionally timed) puzzle-solving. His desperation to escape inevitable capture at the clutches of this nothingness is not unlike struggling with depression and it resonated so powerfully with me I was all the more encouraged to keep on going. I was compelled to help Born live.\n\nThe story mode's puzzles are splendidly straightforward― yes, this could be a turn off for some― but it does allow for appreciation of other aspects of the game, such as:\n\n• The story itself. Nihilumbra becomes less about the puzzles and more about the message behind the storytelling, which is profound in an uncomplicated sort of way.\n\n• The somewhat unique gameplay mechanic of using colour to traverse platforms and solve puzzles. With a flick of your mouse you can coat the floor with red to burn away the shadow of a skeletal monster or propel yourself with icy blue across a previously unconquerable gap.\n\n• The art. You can enjoy it in game or from the concept art section of the main menu, which unlocks as you finish each level. The enemy design is fittingly simplistic but interesting as well, with an Edward Gorey flair.\n\n• It boasts a sublime soundtrack, which is understated but accompanies the game well.\n\n• The narrator's voice is flat (deliberately, I believe, but I might be wrong) and ominous. He often points out the obvious and it reiterates how dire a situation Born is in. Although there is an option to turn the narrator off or lower the volume, I much prefer the game with him. He adds to the sense of despondency, but I realise this is a matter of debate.\n\n• The aptly named "Void Mode" which unlocks once you've completed the main story. This mode is tough as nails. I would argue that you haven't truly experienced what the game has to offer if you haven't subjected yourself to the teeth-grindingly frustrating (but ultimately doable) Void Mode. It is much more unforgiving and a decent challenge for those who thought the main game was a breeze.\n\nNihilumbra is well worth the asking price and it's a steal on sale. If nothing else, it's an easy, ethereal endeavour that should only require a couple of hours of your time to show you it is not a game to be ignored.","December 19, 2015","true","16.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

If you choose blue, the terrain becomes slippery; green makes it more springy; brown makes it sticky; red burns things and yellow conducts electricity.\nThe game appeals more to a much younger audience but I am still glad I purchased it.

It's an unique game. One that I really enjoyed. It's a puzzle platformer game that's light on the puzzles; you have to use one or more of 5 colors to paint the landscapes and that way solve these puzzles. Paint the landscape green to jump, paint it brown to stick to the ground or use stealth, paint it yellow to generate electricity etc. At the beginning you'll use only one color, but after a few levels you'll be combining two or more colors in order to advance. The puzzles are never hard and even the most casual gamer will know how to solve these.\n\nThe voice acting is ok-ish. The narrator has a boring, uninteresting voice. I think no voice acting would've worked better in this case.\n\nThe graphics look okay for the most part. The environments are just perfectly fine, but the character you control as well as the enemies around you seem to lack animation frames. It all looks really basic and wooden in motion. A terrible shame. A few more frames would've definitely benefited this game. I didn't get immersed into the game and I think it's because of this. It's just too obvious. Anyway, enough about the animations.\n\nNihilumbra is a clever game that all gamers can and probably will enjoy. If not for the gameplay, then most likely for the story it's trying to tell.

A puzzle-platformer at it's core, it is immersive enough to make you forget that you're solving puzzles or dodging strange other-wordly creatures but feels more like a story that you're enjoying and experiencing.\n\nI don't play many puzzle games and I still loved it so don't overlook this game because of the puzzle factor! I found the puzzles to be just right - they were sufficiently rewarding and never too frustrating to solve. The platforming is pretty straight forward and enhanced by some of the unique abilities the protagonist acquires (eg: being able to shoot a sticky-mud thing onto walls to cling onto or shooting bouncy grass or ice to reach sections otherwise inaccessible. There's some nice creativity at the core of this game.\n\nOnce you complete the main story (arguably not quite a 'story' in the traditional sense but still immensely enjoyable...) you unlock a harder version of the game - same areas with more complex puzzles. These, I safely avoided due to my aforetold indifference to hardcore puzzle games but that does add good replay value and may strike a chord with the puzzler in you.\n\nIn all - this is an excellent Indie title. You can even try the demo from the developer's website I believe if you're on the fence.\n\nPS: IIRC I spent more than the 3.5 hours reported by Steam on this game (probably spent offline) but in any case this is a short game without any doubt, so bear that in mind.","July 24, 2015","true","147.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

Then again, it's probably a good thing because strong narrators require excellent writing and voice acting. That didn't stop the people behind Nihilumbra from taking a swing at it, and luckily they paired their efforts with a very solid puzzle platformer.\n\nYou play a sentient piece of the Void, the nothingness that inevitably consumes all of existence. As you progress through the many regions of the world, the unnamed narrator describes how your little Voidperson learns of emotions and hope and all that jazz. Especially in the early game, the narrator has a real bad case of never-shut-the-hell-up-itis, delivering some seriously overwrought lines almost every single screen. While many of them are the tiresome "You are nothing" or "They are coming" sorts, the writing does improve the further you get in, which was a welcome discovery.\n\nThe actual platforming revolves around painting the world with the colors you find. Each region you travel to grants you a color to use, such as the blue from the snowfields that makes surfaces icy and slick. Levels are laid out in a way that eases you into learning how your new color works, showing you how to combine it with other colors, and then tests you in auto-scrolling escape sequences before moving on to the next land. The puzzles are all clever and fun to solve without being repetitive or all that challenging. Interestingly, the game keeps giving you new powers right up to the final stage, so there's always something to look forward to.\n\nThe reason for this is a Void Mode unlocked once you beat the game, which consists of remixes of the base levels. In stark contrast to the originals these start out incredibly hard and only grow more ludicrous. If I have one complaint about Nihilumbra, it's that there's really no Normal difficulty. The base game is practically a two-hour tutorial, and Void Mode is the Dark World from Super Meat Boy. I doubt that most will have the patience to plow through Void Mode, but honestly the two hours I spent in the base game was enough to make me happy. The art is clean and creative and the platforming, while a bit floaty, is a good match for the color gimmick. For charming or challenging puzzle platforming, this one fits the bill just fine.","February 17","true","2.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It begins with you falling, the world having been twisted into something surreal, yet oddly soothing. You don’t stay here long, but it was within these brief moments that I was able to collect the scattered thoughts swirling around in my head that I had previously been unable to make sense of.\n\nThese scenes represented to me what Nihilumbra was on a conceptual level. They’re beautiful, empty, and meaningless. The reason I was finding it so hard to take something away from Nihilumbra was because there was nothing there. It’s a gorgeous experience filled with expression, but its aesthetics are simply a mask with nothing underneath.\n\nNihilumbra tries relentlessly to carve out a philosophical core within its narrative, but it comes across as venting the poorly formed ideas of someone who has given up on the world rather than something profound. The writing feels forced and lacks any impact, obnoxiously attempting to make you feel something - anything - by simply stating those feelings as if that is somehow enough to bring them into existence. Ultimately the constant reminders that I was supposed to feel guilty or scared only caused me to become despondent and annoyed.\n\nThe detached way in which Nihilumbra handles morality makes it feel as if it doesn’t really care. It wants to come across as deep without having anything to actually say, filling its world with empty words that bounced off me as quickly as they reappeared.\n\nEventually I simply tuned the writing out and attempted to focus on the puzzle designs instead, yet doing this only brought out how similarly hollow and disinteresting those elements were too. Controlling various elemental powers which can be painted on the environment should provide endless interesting applications, but Nihilumbra never even scratches that surface. It provides you new tools at a steady pace but never a creative way to use them.\n\nPuzzle designs repeat the same basic ideas the entire way through, often requiring no forethought as the answer is simply a slightly altered version of the tutorial. Nihilumbra isn’t just easy, it’s numbingly repetitive and unstimulating. The only time I felt challenged was in navigating the interface, which while not terrible tended to feel awkward and more suited to its touch-based origins than a mouse and keyboard. But then as if to mock me, completing the game unlocks “void mode”, which far from the simplistic main game radically raises the difficulty with cheap trial and error level designs. This doesn’t in turn make them any more engaging however, as the only thing being tested is your patience and how quickly you can move your fingers, rather than your puzzle solving skills.\n\nNihilumbra is such an exquisite game to look at, that it’s disheartening to see such lovely artwork was wasted on an experience that only manages to dull the senses. It functions, but provides no incentive to spend even a few hours to complete it. Playing it felt almost like it was actively pushing me out, unintentionally but forcefully, as if despite having outrun the void pursuing me it had already devoured the game itself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QDzcjqDf7E&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 25, 2015","false","2.1"," 55 of 96 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","55","96","7","4"

And I hated it.\n\nThe narrator never shuts up. Potentially, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But he has nothing to say. Almost EVERY screen he has some mundane remark to make. In the few instances the puzzles actually DID take multiple attempts to solve I just became even MORE infuriated because every time I freaking die, I have to come right back to YOU NEED TO KEEP RUNNING. RUNNING AND RUNNING AND RUNNING. WHAT IS THE POINT IN RUNNING? WHY MUST YOU KEEP RUNNING. BUT YOU MUST KEEP RUNNING. I just wanna yell at the guy. Oh my god. Shutupshutupshutupshutup! RAAAA. ok. I'm ok. ♥♥♥♥. Now that I think about it, I shoulda checked to see if there was a option to mute him. Doubt it.\n\nAnyways,\nIN TERMS OF AESTHETICISM  the game has some kewl concepts, but aside from the kewlness value of piggy backing onto other things that do a "void" concept with more success (lovecraft, D&D...uh, any other horror or fantasy game with "cultists" in it) that's about all the game has going for it. It reminded me of Party of Sin in terms of stale-ness. Then again, it DOES manage to incorporate game mechanics better than Party of Sin in admittedly sleepily easy puzzles to solve. But while we're on the topic, without spoliers (idk why I'm avoiding spoilers, there's nothing to spoil anyways) I did play the game through to the end with a pessimistic curiosity to see if the story would go anywhere, but...well...it's about as deep as The Grinch. Original, not Jim Carey version. There was not much to that ending. I would have been disappointed if I wasn't just so glad to finally finish the damn thing so I can delete my files and transfer it to my "Uninstall Hell" tab in my library.\n\nIN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY: At the beginning of the second level, I realized that this game not only had a narrator constantly jibber jabbering almost SOLELY to "fill a void" as it were [heeheeheehee*snort*], but that the gameplay was going to be extremely formulaic. Namely: 1) FIND FLOWER 2) TRY OUT POWER [three: we just gotta, like...become one with nature, mee-unn] REAL3)BACK TRACK SHORT DISTANCE 4) LEARN 2 OR 3 THINGS POWER CAN DO 5) RUN [AKA walk] FROM VOID. There are five (if you don't count the void) levels and they are almost exactly the same except for the new power added each level and...I guess volcano had rising lava and darkness in it. Now that I think about it, the whole game felt almost like a tutorial of itself. They held my hand so firmly that it's all sweaty and gross now. Eeeugh. The ONLY reason I didn't permanently scrap this game after the first five minutes of the second level was because I still had cards to drop and by the time I got to volcano I figured I might as well see if the ending was any good since I'd gotten this far (It wasn't. See above.)\n\nI have not played the after story puzzles, which based on accidentally clicking the first one I imagine may actually be challenging, but...I'm done. I'm done with this game. I beat the story. I put in my two hours and am thoroughly dissatisfied enough to never play again.\n\nI'm not a pro gamer by any means, but story mode was easy. Very easy. And given how shallow the plot is I think if I were to recommend a target audience for this game I would suggest...middle skoolers. Or anyone who just wants to play a spooky shadow guy in a video game more than anything else. To anyone potentially interested I STRONGLY recommend maybe watching a stream or something before buying this to see if the narrator irks you as much as he did me or if the repetitive gameplay still looks fun enough that you'd still want to rinse and repeat for two hours.","January 1, 2014","false","2.8"," 42 of 75 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","42","75","3","0"

Basically, you take control of a being created by "The Void", who is searching through the world, trying to discover what he is and where he belongs. Along this journey, he takes control of many different elemental powers, which makes up the basic gameplay. This may sound like an overused story with a basic platformer, but the game is extremely charming and a load of fun.

The only downside that I can see with this game is the brutally punishing difficulty curve, via Void Mode. You basically go from a game that even young kids could play with relative ease, to a game that I doubt the developers themselves could beat with ease, but that's not necesarrily a bad thing, especially to anybody who wants a good challenge and added replay value. Just be prepared to be left floored by some of the especially challenging levels. Overall, this is a game that I really enjoyed playing through, and I recommend it to any platforming fans that are looking for a good side-project.\n\nRating: 7.5/10","March 2, 2014","true","12.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Basically the main character Is born in the void. He then leaves the void to live and see the world. However, the void follows him, creating monsters to slow/end his journey. He moves from location to location, damning each one by passing through it.\nNihilumbra is a platformer/puzzle game. You spend most of the first campaign running and jumping with no combat ability. You never get a direct face to face combat option but you get a way to kill enemies. I think this adds to the appeal. Nihilumbra has some great platforming and some seriously challenging puzzles. Sometimes both are required.\nThe gameplay involves color which you use to change the surfaces around you by clicking the mouse. During the main campaign the narrator will speak about what you're doing and question the nature of it.\nI loved the nihilistic tones and questions of meaning. Existing only to stay alive. Destroying things by your existance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/252670/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","This game is a mixed bag from first glance. Honestly, the first half of the game is very dry and has copious amounts of needless narration. The narration is so rampant that you have to sit still each screen just to hear it, and honestly little is being said. To borrow from Shakespeare: the narrator speaks an infinite deal of nothing. It left a bad taste in my mouth as I felt the world could speak for itself in most cases. Less narration is more in this sense; the only reason why Bastion got away with gobs of narration is because there were interesting things to say, which were said in colorful ways. Do yourself a favor and drag the narration volume slider all the way to the left. The text alone, ironically, is more immersive since the narrator ends up getting cut off mid-sentence during normal play.\n\nThat said, the second half of the game is good. Don't get me wrong: the story is interesting, but the color mechanic is the real star of this game. The initial game is mostly a tutorial, while the void stages allow you to get creative with solving the problems ahead of you using the five colors you acquire during the main game. Many puzzles can be solved in multiple ways, some of them probably in ways not intended by the developer. However, I ran in to two major problems.\n\nFirst off, there's some collision issues in the game, and often they can break puzzles entirely. In some cases, they are surmountable obstacles, such as the player's character getting snagged by the terrain. Those same snags, though, can send the player bouncing in different directions when using the green color. It's frustrating to be punished by the game for using the powers as intended.\n\nSecond, bullet collision is absolutely broken when vsync is on. It took me a while to figure this out, but my experience was tarnished by it. Several puzzles required bouncing bullets using the green color, and often those bullets would inexplicably implode before hitting a target. Some of the collision is off in the game, such as metal boxes, but turning off vsync at least allows the player to finish the game.\n\nI definitely enjoyed the second half of the game way more than the first half, so take that with a grain of salt (and maybe wait for a sale), but I can still say this game is decent enough for someone looking for an interesting puzzle/platformer hybrid.","January 8, 2014","true","9.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Game.\n\nI am one of those people that really loves the narration.  It reminds me of Portal mixed with this cool flash animation I once played.  The artwork is awesome, and I love the color scheme.  It was a lot of fun to play.\n\nNow for a more in-depth review:\n\nMain Story: This is a really nice indie puzzle game, and the feel is similar to Portal.  The concept of the colors is nice, but it does get repetitive the further you get into the game.  Accept that you'll die a few times on some of the levels because you won't be prepared for what's coming.  The puzzles are simple, though.  If anything, play through the entire main story.  It's short and worth trying.\n\nVoid Mode: Void mode is hard!  I'll give them that.  It's a nice challenge, but at times, it seems to be a little too difficult.  You have to have the timing just right to get through the levels.  As void mode goes on, you'll notice that some levels are super difficult and some are super easy.  It feels like the developers might have been running out of ideas as it goes on (or just gave up - the cave levels on void mode are super easy).  I got through the entire thing without help, so it's doable.  Just accept that you'll die many, many, many times to get through it.\n\nSecret Language: If you get to this point, it is worth playing through the main storyline in the secret language.  It appears just to be the developer's rant mode.  Some of it is really stupid, but some of it is really funny...especially the end.  The one thing I didn't like is that they assumed that you are most likely a guy playing.  Ummmm...no.  I find that slightly offensive since I'm a girl and a gamer.\n\nAchievements: They are super reasonable and at just the right difficulty.  I'll admit I did look up which level the Easter egg was hidden (though I didn't look up where in the level).  I would have eventually found it if I replayed the entire game again to look for it.  I saved that achievement for last (after already having played the game through three times), and I was being lazy.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game.  I don't think it's for everyone, but it is a fun way to pass the time.  Yes, it's worth the cost with or without a sale.  :)","November 27, 2014","true","15.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Firstly, the narrator is ever present, and rather than relaying a plot through environmental storytelling or immediate presentation, Nihilumbra consistently relies on the narrator's explicit descriptions. Second, the writing is extremely cheesy, constantly explicating and repeating how the protagonist, addressed in second person, is supposedly feeling as well as the considerations the game wants the player to make about the protagonist's relationship with and impact on the world. Mechanically, most puzzles are extremely easy, many solutions are given away immediately and explicitly by the narrator, and the same dynamics act as solutions to many, even subsequent, puzzles, making the levels feel like flavored repetitions of the same scenarios with no new challenge. New mechanics and dynamics are not explained through level design but rather explicated by the narrator, and the level design itself is not particularly clever although this is mostly insignificant due to the omnipresence of the guiding narration. In short, the awkward narrative explication of story, mechanics, dynamics, and solutions combined with repetitive puzzles and resulting low difficulty overwhelms the otherwise interesting mechanical potential and renders Nihilumbra a rather uninteresting game.","April 20","false","0.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Just the fact that I've bothered to write a review with a recommendation should make obvious the fact that I got more than I expected. While the gameplay itself is cool (puzzle/platformer with a twist), the animations are great and the music isn't half bad either, what got me really interested is the story, or better yet - the storytelling.\n\nThe way the game is being presented somewhat reminds be of Bastion. You're introduced to a creature you know nothing about (the character you play), running from a mysterious enemy while discovering new worlds and developing along the way. Just like in Bastion, the narrator's script and voice acting make the game really easy to get into, and so far it seems like it's not getting old too quickly, either, as the game introduces a fun, original aspect of learning and using abilities.\n\nThat element, as in "the twist" I mentioned on the first paragraph, is the use of "colors" as abilities. Every color represents an ability with specific functions, and you have to figure out what colors you need to use in order to solve a puzzle, defeat an enemy or deal with any other type of obstacle you encounter. The first color you discover is blue. When you "paint" a surface blue, you can run faster on that surface, allowing you to gain more momentum and jump farther than you could without it. As you advance to new worlds, you discover more colors which in turn, give you new abilities. Sometimes it's necessary to combine two or more colors in order to solve a problem, as the puzzles become more and more challenging as you get farther in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is really fun, and I recommend it to anyone who likes platformers. Definitely worth it!","December 31, 2013","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If there was a "Meh" recommendation option, I'd pick that.\n\nThe first half of the game is enjoyable, which I think most of the reviewers agree on, based on their play times.  The story is interesting and the mechanics are fun and easy to grasp.  8 fairly short levels in each of 5 areas, with a new color/ability found in each area.  There's nothing terribly unique or groundbreaking in the game, but it's 5-10 hours of fun if you just play through the storyline.\nOn the other hand, the void mode -- which is unlocked after completing the storyline -- is aggravating.  I understand that it's meant to be challenging, but most of the challenge comes not from the puzzles or mechanics, but from the interface.  My main complaint with this part of the game is with the "window" effect -- instead of a smooth side-scroller, we get a series of screens which are mostly independent of each other, puzzle-wise.  Not a big deal until your screen/window resolution actually impacts where this transition occurs.  Too high a resolution, and critters from the next screen react to your presence.  Too low and you may not see a trap before it's too late.  Not to mention there are a few places where you'll want to sit near the edge of that transition area for at least a few seconds to size-up the next screen (I found 1600x1024 to be fairly good for most levels).\nWith that said, the difficulty also varies wildly, and doesn't present a smooth ramp-up as you progress.  Some late-game levels are easily completable in a few minutes or less, while some mid-game levels requirie multiple retries due to timing/strategy (I'm looking at you, volcano area).\n\nIf you can pick this up for under $5 and like a side-scrolling platformer, then definitely get it.  Otherwise, there are probably better games that deserve your time.","December 28, 2013","true","17.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, where LIMBO is dark, eerie and gorgeously gothic, Nihilumbra revels in the atmospheric use of colour and an inventive, immersive style of puzzle-based challenges. The idea is to find and use "colours" to change your environment to allow you to move through it in different ways, overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. The visuals are stunning, with an oil-painting feel and beautiful rendering. The captions and voice-over in story mode are beautifully done and almost reminiscent of being read a story from a picture book, but with deep meaning-of-life type of stuff going on. I almost felt the need to take constant screen shots to capture the beauty of the "pages"!\n\nMoreover, for those looking for a real challenge, the Void Mode that comes after the main story line will make you weep blood - the puzzles require a serious amount of thought (one of the achievements is to die 10 times in a row on Void Mode, which I achieved with depressing ease and totally unintentionally on my first attempt at the first level!) but that just makes it all the more rewarding when you finally find the solution. I bought this game on a bit of a whim and I'm so glad I did, I love it.

I wouldn't say this game is recommendable, but at the same time, I can see why people like it. So, just read this review instead of simply looking at the thumbs up-icon to the right.\n\nPros:\n1. It has a nice soundtrack. It can get repetitive after a while, but it still manages to create the right atmosphere.\n2. Enjoyable artwork. Of course, that's debatable, but I enjoyed it.\n3. The general idea of manipulating your environment. It's nothing new, but the abilities themselves are rather cool.\n\nCons:\n1. The dialogues. Seriously, can't the voice actor just shut up? The acting actually isn't the problem, that's well done. But the dialogue itself is so atrocious and annoying and pretentious. I don't need a comment on everything there's happening. The game would have been _much_ better without any dialogue at all.\n2. Which brings me to the next point: Too easy. The puzzles are so easy to solve because most of the time you just have to use the one ability you just acquired. Combining abilities happened very seldom and if for some reason you are stuck, the game literally forces the solution upon you through the narrator and the hints. It's a puzzle game, I want to find the solution myself.\n3. The length. I don't have anything against short games, but the game can be completed within less than two hours. Then of course you can beat in the hardcore mode again, but that's not the solution. They could've added more content, really.\n4. The controls. The character is... "wobbly". It's really difficult to land accurate jumps and even more so, when I have to do the same section all over again, because the last checkpoint was two miles away.\n5. The tutorials. Okay, seriously. Why do I need those? Not only do you get to know the different abilities, before you can use them, but there's plenty of opportunities to test them out in the actual levels.

It's a puzzle platformer wherein the central mechanic is covering walls and floors with different substances to give them different properties like being bouncy or hot. It's not very hard at all. I got stuck for a little bit in a couple different places, but it was more not being able to execute correctly as opposed to being stumped as to what to do. It took around three hours to finish. There is a narrator that talks over a lot of the game and is weird. The mumbo jumbo being spewed made me wonder when the narrator was going to start asking me to join the church of Scientology.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NegativeZeroZ/recommended/252670/","NegativeZeroZ","MalikNZZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NegativeZeroZ/","184 products in account","Nihilumbra is both a very interesting and very divided game. It was presented to me as "Limbo meets Portal," but in practice, I found it to be like neither of these things. The unfitting dark creatures roaming about the relatively normal environments felt more like Heart of Darkness, and the emphasis on the "paint mechanic" (there are no portals) gives it more similarities to Tag: The Power of Paint. I was also told that the game made figurative waves on the iOS market, but that is a market so inundated with inane and uninteresting nonsense that the comment meant exactly nothing to me, so I went about my playthrough of Nihilumbra determined not to give it a free pass for standing out from mediocrity. So let's get to it.\n\nI said that I felt that the game was divided. The gameplay is divided into two distinct modes, the story mode, and the void mode. The latter is unlocked after completing the former. The story mode is what you'd expect; it tells the story. The biggest problem people will have with the story mode is the narrator, or more specifically, the narration design. The decision to have a narrator in a game about nihilism is questionable. I'd think silent, empty text would serve the presentation much better, so that's what I went with when I played it. I don't think the voice is necessarily terrible, but I don't think the presence of a voice in this game is necessarily warranted, either. The narration is also triggered by your position on the different screens within the levels, and if you die and return to a checkpoint, the narration will repeat every time, and this can get grating. Fortunately, for the people who will be too lazy to mute the narration, the story mode is almost too easy.\n\nVoid mode is the game's answer to that. It's the obligatory, "you can't spell 'indie' without 'die'" departure from the almost insultingly easy story mode. This section of the game is of a very much "Oddworldian" difficulty. There is plenty of trial and error to go with the more challenging puzzles. You will die in void mode. I've seen void mode criticized a lot, but again, these are (mostly) iPad gamers we're talking about. Fortunately, you are given a reprieve from the narration, but this can be both good and bad. You are introduced to void mode with the promise of closure to the game's somewhat bitter epilogue (What? Did you expect a good ending in a game about nihilism? DID YOU?). While you do technically get that closure, it's accompanied with absolutely no narration or text, so it's a bit of a dull reward for anyone who played through void mode because they liked the story and wanted that elusive happy ending. The only other thing you get (besides the achievements and accompanying bragging rights) is a "secret language," which changes the text of the narration and makes it the complete antithesis of taking itself seriously, so if you thought the story was pretentious garbage, hated it and want some cheap catharsis, you might enjoy replaying story mode for that, but it will just end up leaving a bad taste in everyone else's mouths, especially with the internet memes which have basically already made the "humor" rather dated.\n\nThere is appeal to be had in both the story mode and the void mode, but I think the whole package kind of antagonizes itself. I don't see many people enjoying the whole of the game. Most people will probably heavily prefer one half over the other, and people who prefer the story mode will have to settle with the bitter ending, and people who prefer void mode will have to trudge through the story mode. Whether you decide this game is worth it to you or not will depend on which of those two types of people you decide you are, and whether you feel that you'll only enjoy one half of the game.","January 18, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't know what to expect and really wasn't expecting much. To my surprise, Nihilumbra delivered and turned out to be one of the best and most underrated indie games I've ever played.\n\nStory:You are Born. Born was created from The Void but has somehow separated from it and is now in the world. However, The Void will not allow this and is now chasing Born in an attempt to suck him back into the darkness. In order for Born to escape The Void, he must allow everything else in his path be destroyed.\n\nGameplay:Nihilumbra is a puzzle-platformer. As you progress through the game, Born will be granted new colors, which the player can use to paint the terrain in order to solve puzzles and aid him in his platforming. In total there are five different colors. Each have a different use and create a different effect. Throughout the game, Born will be accompanied by a narrator that will talk to him. It is uknown exactly who this narrator is whether he be Born, The Void or something else. The narrator really gives this game it's charm and gives insight to the world and what is going on. Sometimes he says some really philosophical things and it really adds to the atmosphere. Speaking of that, the atmosphere is amazing. The combination of colors, textures, music and narration sets a very solemn, yet relaxing mood. The main part of the game is very short. It only took me about 4 hours to complete. However, once you complete it, you'll unlock “Void Mode” which is essentially hard mode. Void Mode offers the same levels but with different and much harder puzzles.\n\nConclusion:Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone that's a fan of platformers or puzzle-platformers. It's really unique and highly underrated. Nihilumbra is a very insightful, relaxing and fun experience. That's what this game is. It's more than just a game.

Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer with a very unique looking to it, you start the game being born in The Void and after you escape you end up on a strange world where The Void sends his creatures and it's coming to get you. The plot of this game along with a mindblowing soundtrack is what make them one of the best puzzle platformers of this year. According to the narrator, which identity remains a secret, The Void is one and you can't simply escape the void, he needs you in order to become one and that's why he's after you.\n\n[MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS FROM NOW ON]\n\nYour journey is divided in various environments ,you'll  travel to cold montains, a desert, a forest, volcanic fields and a city. Each of this places will great you an unique power which comes into place in the form of a colour and you can use them by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor on any surface, the montains grant you the blue colour which when used on any surface will make that surface slippery which will alow you to run or slide faster, the forest will grant you the green colour which if you jump on it it grants you a huge jump boost and sometimes is used for changing enemy projectiles course, in the desert you'll gain access to the brown colour which will grant you the power to slow things down or making you walk stealthly and even get enemies trapped in corners, the volcanic fields of course will grant you the red colour which when an enemy steps on it (including yourself) it will start burning and this is the first time you can actually kill an enemy by yourself and last but by no means least, the city which takes a huge role on the story grants you the colour yellow which represents electricity. During your journey you'll not only use the last power you've earned but you'll also need to remember what you've learned before. When you step into the Cold Montains you feel that you're in a different place from the void, it's cold. When you go into the forest you'll start to notice that everything in it is alive, the trees, the plants, and that starts to make you feel alive in some way, because before you were nothing, you were void. When you go to the Desert you immediately notice it's warmer there than the previous two locations and you start to wonder if you're actually starting to have "something" inside of you. After that comes the volcanic fields in which you feel it's even hotter than the desert and you realize your journey started cold, then warm and now hot and that someone makes you think that you're actually becoming "something". And last, the city, which was once inhabited by someone, there you'll start wondering if those people were actually the ones that doomed this world and not yourself, since the void has been consuming everything while it's after you, the forest, the montains, the volcanos, the desert, everything. And so you realize that youre death is inevitable, it wouldn't matter if you kept running, even though you wanted to be alive, there's no life without death and so you let yourself be consumed by the void but... the void rejects you because throughtout your journey you've consumed the colours and each one of the elements and you've become alive, "the void is nothing and there's nothing in you". And so you become free... but the game doesn't end here. After this end you'll unlock "The Void Mode" which is basicly you fighting off the void that has consumed the world in order to clean your conscience.\n\nNihilumbra is certainly not a game for everyone, but if you enjoy a great story, very emotional and meaningful then my friend, this game is certainly for you. One of the best indie puzzler platformers I've ever played. I recommend it 100%, please buy it because I don't think it got the attention it deserved.","December 28, 2013","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Void is trying to claim you and take you back and as you go forward the places you've been get devoured by the Void in a sense.\nAs you progress throughout the game, you gain new, "colors". Gaining new colors adds new gameplay mechanics for you to use. By adding these new mechanics this game introduces a vast variety of puzzles.\nThe story is great in my opinion, but be warned its not a story made to cheer you up.

A platformer somewhere along the lines of Limbo, it's less atmoshperic, but its thought-provoking premisis, coupled with some intelligently designed platforming and puzzles, make it a real gem of the genre.\nThe game's short but thoughtful philosophical interludes are perfectly fitted within the environments that the game has you explore, and it succesfully conveys the feeling of a journey toward maturity, gradually finding out more about the world as it is and what you can (or can't) have an impact on. The narrator's remarks are frequent but never too revealing, thus leaving you the liberty to link and interprete the metaphors for yourself.\nNihilumbra also gradually opens up its gameplay through the aquisition of colours, with which you can change the environment. One lets you create ice, which helps you traverse certain sections more quickly, or enables you to make certain objects or enemies slide and fall, given that there is an initial momentum to begin with. Another is mud, which acts both as a means of slowing down - yourself and others -, stealthily traversing a section, as well as a sticky surface, allowing you to stick to walls or ceilings. Each of the six colours has its unique multiple purposes. The great thing about this is that most puzzles or obstacles you encounter along the way have multiple solutions, so you can do it your own way.\nThe aesthetics are very well designed - the diverse environments look beautiful, yet not majestic. The music used is very suitable as well, and nicely adapted to each of the worlds you explore. However, I think it's used in excess. Sure, since it's not trying to convey an atmosphere as tense and empty as Limbo's , I wouldn't have pleaded for complete silence, but there are some sections of the game which would have benefitted from less rather than more background noise.\nWhile the main story mode is rather easy, and can be completed in around 3 hours, the real challenge here is represented by Void mode. It's a redesign of the original maps, but made much much much harder. So hard that I think the contrast between the main game, where I was never stuck for more than 2-3 minutes, and Void mode, where simply the first level of the first chapter took me around 20 minutes to complete, is a bit sharp.\nOverall, I can only tell you to buy this game. It's fairly priced for the content it offers, it will delight you with its beautiful visuals and smart story analogies.","November 19, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It's really unique and highly underrated. Nihilumbra is a very insightful, relaxing and fun experience. That's what this game is. It's more than just a game. It's an experience to be had.","August 29, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

No time to get immersed into the story, find out how you use your abilities or explore the harder puzzles later on.\n\nIncidentally the music is among the best fitting soundtracks I have come across.\n\nIn one sentence: A very unique puzzle/platformer -but not at all casual-, a beautiful environment and smooth gameplay is what you will get from playing Nihilumbra.\n\n\nIt isn't a sit back game, but it is relaxing. Sounds strange yet that's how it is. The player needs concentration to solve the puzzles and coordination to survive the platforming parts and proceed. Casually clicking and pressing buttons will not get you through.\nThere are no weapons/guns per se, but it is most definitely not without violent encounters. You will die a lot..\nThe whole atmosphere of the game.. graphics, locations, animation, music.. will provide a very immersing experience.. if you let it. Spoken narration follows you throughout the game but it can be turned off, which is what I opted for. I found it more engaging to just read the occasional text while listening to the background music.\nNot to reveal too much, this game can be fairly easy and straightforward in the "beginning" (trying to avoid spoilers here) and at the same time (or rather a bit later) very hard and challenging. It can be short and it can take a while longer..\nAt first it may look/feel silly, pretentious and borderline cringeworthy.. But the more you play, the more it grows on you.\nIt is one of these games that you will remember as an experience even though you may forget the scenery, the monsters, the levels..\nWorth the asking price of 7€, a definite buy when in sale, if you're into this type of gaming experience.","December 27, 2014","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My god is it a wonderful game!\n\nTo put it in perspective: I usually, for almost every single game, play in windowed mode. So I actually went to the options menu, set the game to windowed, and started playing. Even before leaving the Void, I had already switched back to 1080p fullscreen and got rid of all external distractions to best take in the beautiful art direction, soundtrack and voice.\n\nThe setting, while rather depressing in many ways, actually also feels quite uplifting - and I can appreciate that. That the gameplay is very intuitive and enjoyable only supports my belief that I've got a real gem on my hard drive right now.\n\nThanks to the developers for Nihilumbra. How in all the hells could a game like this have been stuck in Greenlight-limbo for over a year?! Valve really need to get their act together....\n\nI will update this "review" later on, when I have played (a lot) more of it. However, I doubt this game can anything but better from there on out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deaks25/recommended/252670/","deaks25","deaks25","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deaks25/","131 products in account","Nihilumbra is a really hard game to review because it's almost impossible to describe properly.\n\nYou play as Born, a being that emerges from the Void & takes on a humanoid shape. You explore the world, gaining colours, each with an ability to help you progress. You 'paint' them onto a surface to activate that ability, whether it's making the surface slippery, sticky, burning hot, bouncy or conductive. You then use these colours to solve puzzles, defeat Void monsters & escape the Void as it hunts you across the side-scroller world.\n\nSounds a bit plain & simple, but it is actually a fabulous little game. The graphics are perfectly judged; pretty but simple, not overblown for a side-scroller. The music is as good as it gets, varied & often haunting & eerie.\n\nThe greatest part is the narration. It's not constant, but what there is, is a real asset to the game. I could never quite tell if it was Born's own voice berrating & encouraging him to resist & fight to exist, an external voice talking to Born, or simply a narrator talking to the player. The narration is presented in what can best be described as a moving picture-book, with the words that are being spoken appearing prominently on the screen in large text. You are able to play without stopping to wait for the text to fade though, which shows sensible design.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging, generally requiring you to make use of the newest colour, but always you have to think about all of them throughout. Even the length is perfectly balanced, with a 2nd play through built in if you haven't had enough, but doesn't necessarily add to the story.\n\nIn fact, I'm struggling to think of much that's wrong with Nihilumbra, aside from the fact that it is a very quirky game that won't appeal to everyone. At a stretch, it's not the ultimate in immersion, but given that Nihilumbra's main plot is only a few hours long, it doesn't need to be. Everything about it feels complete, a game that has fulfilled it's entire starting breif.\n\nIf you are interested in a well-rounded, well though-out & beautifully scripted game that is something totally different, then you will almost certainly get something out of Nihilumbra. I'm really pleased to be able to say I own & have played Nihilumbra.","October 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Though I got it on sale for 1.99, It's surely worth the full 7.99. The game isn't very long. But also not to short. After the credits scene, it unlocks alot more levels, but I havn't gotten to those yet. But it took me a good 2 .8 hours to get that far (It is a puzzle game [kinda] so playtime may vary). Anyways in the game you start out as a baby, but you were born in the void. You escape the void and go to the world. And theres snow everywhre. But you find a flower. You pick it. It gives you a color, blue. You can place and destroy that color at will. You can run fast on that color. You ue it to solv puzzles and whatnot. Then the void comes back for you. And you run, knowing that the void is destroying the world behind you. You still run. And you escape. With that world gone. Then you end up in a forest world.\n\nPlay more to find ALL the colors, and all the worlds. And to see what happens in the end.

So it is a platformer puzzle game with a decent narrative (in story mode). I was not sure if I like it at first, it was okay but frankly it felt too easy once you got the hang of the various colors/skills. Well, until I beat the main game and went into void mode. While some puzzles had me guessing right away what I am supposed to do there were MANY that I went dozens of times because I had no clue and I always died before I figured it out. However after beating the void mode levels you do feel a sense of accomplishment and the checkpoint system is rather fair. So I like even void mode after some consideration since it made me very angry but because I sucked at it, not because it was truly bad. Overall this is a nice game and, even though short, it is quite fun. Recommended!","January 17, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The storyline was interesting and somewhat moving, and the mechanic of adding colors to change the environment was novel. The first round of puzzles weren't too challenging and most people could solve without too much difficultly (without a guide). The second playthrough (or void mode) becomes much more challenging and much more fun in my opinion. I almost wish that it had been the game all along rather than the second playthrough because it has much more creative puzzles. Unfortunately the second playthough drops the narrator and doesn't seem to have any story to go with it, other than here are some more puzzles for you to do. So overall 8/10 game.

Nihilumbra. Nihilumbra is a very original indie platformer that is actually very deep. The narration explains the character, Born, and his thoughts. Of course, assuming that they are a he. It's fairly standard 2D platforming here, except that it introduces the concept of drawing colours across the landscapes. You will use colours to solve the many puzzles in this, admittedly short game's, levels and defeating the many enemies the void throws at you. I won't spoil the lovely narration in the game however, that you can experience for yourself. However, after finishing the main story you unlock void mode. Which is boring as hell. Honestly, the game isn't really suited to dashing about and disposing with various void enemies in different and pretty frustrating ways. I honestly couldn't be bothered with it.\n\nPositive\n+ Great Narrative\n+ Moving Story\n+ Fun Platforming\n+ Colour Mechanics\n\nNegative\n- Void Mode\n- Short Playtime\n\nConclusionA very interesting game, with beautiful artwork and a fun colour mechanic but... void mode is just painfully boring.

In Story mode, the game is easy, but the main point of it is for you to enjoy the game, admire it's landscapes, relax, listen to the narrator, and getting familiar with the game mechanics. Once you finish it (2-3 hours) you'll unlock the Void mode, and here is where the real game begins, with plenty of puzzles and challenges for you to complete. Sometimes is hard, but never overwhelming. And the difficulty is evenly spread through the levels, so all 5 worlds have roughly the same difficulty. If you beat it, there's a cool bonus that gives incentive to replay the Story mode. In the end, this is a nice cohesive game, with good gameplay.","November 24, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is neither a platformer nor a puzzle game initially (more on that later).\n\nYou are a voidling, you escape the void and you're on the run. The void is chasing you with monsters and directly in 1 "boss" level per stage. There are 5 stages in the game, not a whole lot. You can play through the game in about 2-3 hours. It is not difficult. Basically you gain 1 new ability per stage in the form of colours (ice, moss, sand, fire and electricity) with which you have to beat the rather short levels. After you gain fire you can actually kill enemies yourself from time to time. As I said you do neither a lot of platforming nor puzzling. 98% of the stages are self explanatory. Perhaps this is more of a visual and thoughtful journy, as you are accompanied by a narrator, who is almost constantly babbling something I didn't really care anything about, and possibly acts as your inner voice, telling a story about regret, fate etc. blabla. As you are running away from the void it devours the lands you travel, making you directly responsible for the destruction on the earth. Maybe that's the message. After you have beaten the game you unlock "void mode", a kind of alternate hard mode for the game. This is where stuff could get interesting, but I can't force myself to play through it, because here the game really becomes a puzzle platformer and I'm not interested in spending the time for this, but for anyone who is interested in that, you have to endure the normal mode first. Void mode is for you to clean up the void and restore the earth...whatever.\n\nFor a few bucks this game provides some entertainment in my opinion, but it's in the end just mediocre and a bit strange.\n\nBy the way, no controller support, which makes sense, because you have to "paint" with your mouse cursor. Would be difficult with a controller.\n\nTL;DR: nice game, if somewhat strange concept and annoying moral story. Has additional puzzle hardmode after completion. Pick up for low price.","October 1, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much like black holes, really. Somehow, your escape alerts The Void and it starts chasing you. You go from being nothing, having no purpose in life, to grow intelectually through the learning of colors, an interesting mechanism that, by painting them on the game's surface, each one will provoke a different effect on it, ranging from slippery surfaces to making them burn, etc.\n\nIn essence, this game is really philosophical. I thought the message embeded throughout the story was something from the likes of "You are insignificant, yes. But if you stand out, explore, make something different, you will become significant. You will become something." The narrator basically helps to tell the story, as through every section of the game, he says something. The art, background-wise, is very pretty. The models and tiles are nothing suprising, but that's not negative. There's an art gallery that will slowly unlock after the completion of each level.\n\nAs for length, the game is relatively short. But, after you do complete the main story, there's a void mode to be completed, which can take more than the actually storyline, and it is freakishly hard! Also, the game's controls are smooth and easily maneuverable.\n\nOverall, I completed recommend Nihilumbra.

Like the fact that you can't use your mouse roller to choose diffrent colors so in the middle of trying to stop a red color from killing you, you must go to the corner and click the purple and in trying to do that the red color burns you to death. Then you have to go to the last check point which in most cases is very far away from where you were. What makes that more frustrateing is that the check point that would have saved you was two feet away.\nBut then there are some really annoying things about it like the fact that if you die and there is a point where the narrator talk he will repeat it and if you die a lot he will repeat it AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Is the narrator suppost to be my conscious? He would always say stuff like "You should feel bad" "You feel guilt" it was kinda like gauntlet where the wizard says PLAYER 2 IS HUNGRY. Except the wizard only said that when it was necessary not every 2 seconds.\nIt was like the narrator was trying to make me feel bad for this little black thing that had no personality or backstory.And he kept trying to remind you that HEY DONT FORGET TO FEEL AWFUL. Sometimes he would blatenly say something along the lines of you should just kill yourself because you were "ruining" the places you were leaving behind.\nThe puzzles are not challangeing and the monsters in the game make inovative and new ways to solve them impossible and they are so repetitive that you die 3000 times before you can get to the next checkpoint. Sometimes there is a part of the void that is plastared onto the scenery so it is impossible to try new ways to solve the puzzles. The scenery is bland and the game itself is very repetitive. There is no real story at all to it except to run away from the void. No reason to why I want to do this no reason to why I am in the places I am. It was cute at first but then it just got annoying and was no longer fun to play and had absolutly no replay value. It had a lot of potential and I was really excited to play it but in the end it was not worth the money.","January 5, 2014","false","3.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

Once you finish it, the game opens up into a 'void' challenge which is significantly harder than the (easy) main storyline. I didn't enjoy it. It's not a 'revisit' or 'redo' of the original story line levels, but it focuses more on killing void creatures in thos enviroments, rather than exploring and puzzles.\n\nMain storyline took me 2 hours, and i'm not a big fan of difficult platformers, so I had no interest in what may of been a longer definently more challenging mode. Honestly the controls themselves didn't lend themselves to faster paced more difficult platforming/killing, so even if i was grooving on the idea, i can assure you the controls would of kicked me out just as quickly as the narration.\n\nI feel the narrator was relatively unessesary, and many of the lines of dialogue, i really felt were out of place, or didn't mesh well with the story. Honestly, it's game where the narration should really add to it, but more often than not i felt it pulling me out of the game because of lines i didn't expect or just lines that broke the feeling.\n\nI normally go into this game expecting a big point, or big plot or big overarching theme 'redemption' 'exploration' 'overcoming of one's greif' 'growing up' honestly, I didn't feel any particular ONE theme from this game... and that saddens me because it could of been as enjoyable to me as Thomas was Alive if it had one thing and explored it well, rather than trying to touch on multiple things at once.\n\nUnique mechanics, not particularly engaging though, and marred with questionable narration and thematic choices...\n\nGet it really cheap for 2 hours of entertainment, more if you enjoy the more punishing execution style platformers, but be aware the mechanics themselves don't lend themselves well to the platform genres need of smooth, precise gameplay. It's a game that would of benefited more from a longer storyline or a more crisp singular point, than a second challenge mode and shorter story line. The story failed to buy me in, and so I was left, ultimately disappointed.","January 17, 2015","false","2.5"," 26 of 51 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","26","51","0","0"

The simple gameplay feels nice, and allows you to appreciate the beautiful visuals and the simple but intriguing narrative. The Void creatures were creatively designed, and encountering each of them was perhaps what I most liked about the game.

Some of it was very fun. I love to figure out puzzles. But once into the Void levels, it became so frustrating that I considered abandoning the game. Instead I referred to a walkthrough to help out. It was never that the puzzles were hard to figure out. It was the timing that was so critical in some cases. A second or less could make the difference in not getting through an obstacle.\n\nThere were times you needed to bounce so high that the figure you were controlling would go off the top of the screen. This made it very tough to "stick" a landing or bounce just right. There was no way to avoid death repeatedly because you could not see the next screen of obstacles/enemies until you were in the line of fire or off the edge of a cliff.  I could not find any way to change the key mappings/bindings. So, I was stuck using WASD. That means my fingers were in the wrong position to quickly tap on numbers to change colors, I had to rely on the mouse wheel which means cycling through colors which takes more time than desired.  There were times I just left the game up in paused mode because I did not want to replay a prior part of a level (no save nearby). So the number of hours it took me to play is highly inflated with 8 hours while I slept or worked.\n\nFor me, these frustration points were just too many. Yet, as always, I feel good having completed the game. I even played all of the extra levels that get unlocked once the void levels are completed. I actually enjoyed those extra levels and their pithy monologues more than the void levels. Those were hilarious and informative about the game's development.\n\nHowever, I can not see any replay value.

Till now, I didn't know a really good game from Spain, but this really changed my mind. The story is not that impressive, it's just a guy telling you something about life and comments the 'colors' you found, so that's not really a game to shed tears. On the other hand, the game requires you to use common sense, which means you only have to have a piece of brain to be able to pass through the whole game, the skill is not that required, it's more about repeating till you get it. The story line is more for people who want to get into calm mood, but reversed, void mode is for those, who really want to enjoy it and they do not mind repeating one part of game thousand times.\n\nPros:\nNice interface, the game is about void and the UI really looks like that.\nUsage of common sense\nThe enviroment changes progressively, you do not insensibly pass through random maps.\nVoid difficulty is extremely funny\nPlatformer with unique mechanics\nCons:\nIt is way too short - I would like to play, but repeating maps is not that fun. If it had some kind of multiplayer, it would be great. Like you would have a chance to make your map, people would play it and that would be ranked by time, or you could be able to make a whole mod or something, but currently, it was pretty short.\nDifficulty gap - The first difficulty was totally easy, but when I came to void difficulty, but I raged more than when I played Dark Souls, but as I stated above, you can pass through the game with zero skill, it is just repeating and common sense, but if there was some middle difficulty, it would at least make a game longer and people who are not that patient would at least be able to pass it.\n8/10","February 22, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It's just as good as some of the other indie greats like FEZ, Braid, or even Super Meat Boy (except, again, this game is way easier than those). The game makes use an intresting macanic where you paint surfaces with different colors that all have different effects - somewhat reminds me of Portal. If you want a game with logic puzzle like Portal (minus the humor though because this game gets somewhat depressing) and are okay with a short length like Portal then this game is for you.\n\nAlthough I say the game is easy, the Challenge mode after beating the game really is hard, but I still feel like the game is only giving me the difficultys of "Press A to win" Easy, and "Start the game to die" Hard.","March 31, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The puzzles aren't challenging, but they are what they are, a little lite puzzle adventure.\n\nNow, on to the reasons I wouldn't recommend the game. I could not get over the narrator. I'm sorry, maybe it was just me, but it bothered me so much. The line delivery wasn't great and the tone and tambre of the voice seemed purely to rely on being deep and kind-of sounding like a movie-trailer guy to bring any depth to the words spoken. For me, it really irked me.\n\nThen, the story. I didn't like it. It was confusing, a little pretencious, and a little forced. The game felt as though the creator had came up with the idea for the puzzles and bent a story around it to package it.\n\nMaybe you'll enjoy it, have a look over the trailer and see what you think, but for me, I sadly did not.\n\nNilesy","June 17, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

You'll be hearing some guy almost talk to himself and keep switching his opinions of what YOU should be feeling about the situation instead of coming to that conclusion yourself and is incredibly contradictory about 90% of the situation.  He also loves stating the obvious, assuming you have the intelligence of single celled organisms.\n\nGraphicsProbably the only decent aspect of the game.  The sprites have a decent amount of variation, but the environments and overall aesthetic feels like some old mobile phone game to be perfectly honest.  As there's only 4 zones (5 if you include the unlockable Void zone) the variation in art and enemy type is extremely limited.\n\nGameplaySo as you progress, you'll acquire different colors which adds a few abilities to your arsenal (such as blue being the "ice" color, increasing speed and having enemies slip over themselves).  Unfortunately the puzzles themselves are either extremely straight forward, requiring little to no thinking, or so stupidly broken that you end up dying due to bad enemy placement and level design before figuring out how to avoid the scenerio (and even then it still is a bit RNG if you end up falling on an enemy off screen).  Even the narrator will neglect to tell you of a new enemy until AFTER straight up dying to it, and then restate the obvious of what you figured out after passing it, like the game assumed you somehow cheated to get past or something.  Supposedly after beating the storyline, you unlock Void Mode which is supposedly harder, but after getting a taste of the base game's puzzle and level design I can tell you with 100% certainty you will just end up dying 50 times before memorizing a pattern and avoiding it.  That isn't skill or a measure of difficulty folks.\n\nControlsThe controls are honestly either okay or genuinely confusing.  You can use WASD or the arrow keys to move while your mouse is your paint brush of sorts, which seems logical.  Even using the scroll button to cycle through your colors seems okay.  Then you want to get to your color remover, and for whatever reason the game won't let you scroll to it, you need to click the icon on the top right bit of your screen which whips out a large tree branch with all the colors on it, then click the one you want.  Why they only did it for that is beyond me.  Also there is no controller support.\n\nSoundThe music is actually pretty good, IF I COULD HEAR IT OVER THIS IDIOT NARRATOR.  Sure I could turn the voice volume down to 0, but I shouldn't have to do that over something that is supposed to be relatively important since every once in a blue moon he will give out a helpful tip.  So I'm stuck with him and his irritating self patronizing voice.\n\nFinal VerdictHow did this get so many positive reviews?  Seriously?  If this game was 3.99 or something I could maybe justify it as an experience, but I got this baby on sale for 1.99 and actually canceled my refund ticket solely because of the fact that I needed to write a review of reason and maybe spare someone from paying the full price, or even buying this at all.  This is a decent phone app game, nothing more (and with no more then 3-4 hours total playtime WITH Voidmode unlocked it is not worth the mileage either).","June 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","2"

In your luck, A voice assists you on the way, Telling you of the void and it's creatures. Who this voice is exactly, We never know, It can't be a voice in our head because our character does not know these things until the voice tells so.\n\nGraphics: Fits for it's lore and stays in a nice place.\n\nI'm not much as a graphics freak so most of the time it doesn't matter, But the graphics are quite nice since they are hand drawn. Since this was a mobile port moved to PC, I feel they did a good job. One thing I do love is how much detail is given to your character. When you push a item, Your "feet" will actually push against the ground to push said object, Pay attention to your character, You might see something new.\n\nPuzzles: Oh wow Look at all the pretty colors..\n\nAck, Most likely the worst part of the game. As someone who's thinking is not quite fast as others, This game can be very unfair as fast reflexes and thinking is needed. Most of the puzzles are very bland and easy to figure out, Some did take many tries for me, But I feel that was more on my part. The color mechanic could have been used much better but the depth of the puzzle do not drop far from the flower. Most of them are pushing boxes to leave on a button or getting past an enemy, Which would have been fine if they had a bit more variety would have made it where it wasn't so tedious.\n\nMusic: Wait? You can only unlock old timey mode AFTER you beat the game?\n\nThe music fits the game very well, but since I was raging more over the puzzles, It was too hard to pay attention. Old timey mode sounds great but I really wish you could have had it for the whole game because I actually ended up prefering it.\n\nFinal feelings: I wish I could play void mode.\n\nI wish there was a "maybe" on recommending games because I feel right in the middle about this game.\nNot sure if I would come back and play it due to the sometimes downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t puzzles, But I do feel the game holds a good spot on my top 50 favorite games, It's empty yes but it's good while it lasts but the end just left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I really can't say I would recommend this game, I mean it's a good indie piece, And the translation wasn't broken up or off-putting but, The puzzles are the core of this game and if the core is bitter, You might not want to take another bite.\n\nRating: 5/10 I'm happy that I got it free but make sure to catch it during a sale.\n","October 14, 2015","false","5.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","2"

The first few levels were pretty fun, getting used to the whole painting mechanic, but once I played with it for a while it got really boring. I tried hard to like this game, but the more I played, the more I didn't even want to finish it.\n\nThe story is cliche to say the least, and the narration absolutely ruined it (yes, I know you can turn it off, and I did). Instead of giving you bits and pieces for you to interpret, it shoves it down your throat. In fact, this game barely even has a story. It's kind of like they wanted to make a platformer that incorporated the whole painting technique and THEN they just kind of came up with some boring storyline just so you would feel like you had a reason to run through these levels.\n\nThe platforming is mediocre to say the least. The screen transitions in this game will absolutely mess you up. In a game where you need to know exactly what is around the corner to prevent your death, you don't get any warnings at all. Most of my deaths in this game were not due to the puzzles being challenging, but due to me not being able to see what I was walking into. You'll just be walking along, get to the end of the screen, the screen will transition and all of a sudden HOLY MOTHER OF GOD AN ENEM- dead.\n\nI also found that sometimes I would breeze past a puzzle using a certain method, but if I tried to do that exact same thing in another spot, it wouldn't work. Like the one part where you needed to sneak past one of those flower monsters using the brown colour. Okay, worked fine. Then on the next level I try it again but NO, it didn't work, I had to use green to jump over it or something. I can't really remember, oh well.\n\nWhen it comes to aesthetics the game is.. alright. There are some really nice looking parts in the game but I found that a lot of the background and level design just looked very dull. I think there was only one point in the game where I was walking through the forest across the fallen tree near the waterfalls that I actually said "Wow, this is nice looking and unique and my eyes like it!" other than that the environments were forgettable.\n\nThe gameplay gets VERY repetitive. You find a flower. You get a new colour that has a different power. You learn how to use the power. You go through the level using the power in very self-explanitory ways. Run from the void. Repeat. The game really just tells you what to do half of the time, the other half is you sitting there saying "what the hell, this should clearly work but it doesn't for some unknown reason".\n\nOverall I think I got about 2 hours out of this game, and I was definitely taking my time. I thought maybe I was missing something the whole time, but it was really just that shallow. I'll admit I haven't tried this void mode things yet, but I doubt I will since the main story bored me so much. This game is not worth $10. I repeat, DO NOT WASTE $10 ON THIS. If you're even thinking about buying it, look for a half off coupon or something. Oh jeeze, the more I type about this the more and more I come to dislike it.","January 25, 2014","false","3.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Severe pacing problems left me bored and unwilling to complete it.\n\nFirst impression: I won’t say review, because I will not be finishing the game. I made it to the third area (Ash desert) and it still feels like I’m in the tutorial. The game holds your hand despite not offering anything resembling a challenge. I assume that it becomes more interesting later in the game when you have more abilities that can interact. Moreover, I do not question the benefits of letting the player get used to the basics first and gradually increase the difficulty, but why let the game go on so long before doing so? While many games are able to present interesting challenges with a single mechanic, this one had not presented anything interesting even by my third ability.\n\nThe game looks good and the narrator is competent. Unfortunately the narration, which otherwise would be the game’s strong point, feels like it is trying to force me to feel something rather than letting me feel it. Rather than explaining what Born is feeling or thinking, it is saying that I am Born and “You are sad, you feel guilty, you will not escape.” In contrast to, for example, Thomas Was Alone, I felt completely disconnected to the story.\n\nThe combination of severe pacing problems and an overbearing narration makes me not recommend Nihilumbra. Sure, it is a cheap game and it looks good, but it is also boring.","December 2, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

If you like the art style and the atmosphere from what you see of the game, and you like 2d platformers, then maybe this will be your thing.\n\nAs far as my opinion on the game:\nThe narration is too much. It's near constant and overexplains things. No subtlety or room for things to breathe. Basically too much talk filling the void that should've only been filled by the gameplay/experience. The void!\nAnd the process of gaining new powers seems unimaginative as another reviewer said. Ok get this power, have it explained to you as opposed to figuring it out yourself, then go back through the same level, hear an explanation of what you just did (oh thanks), then go find another power and do it all over again.\n\nIt also really breaks up the fluidity of the game when you have to stop moving basically every screen to listen to the narrator. That is, if you want to hear everything. Otherwise he'll stop partway through on that clip and start the next one. (I think of Portal 2 here and how they made sure voice clips would always complete before you could end a level, so you didn't have to worry about playing "too fast" for game to keep up with you.)\n\nThe game has its qualities but it has as many jarring problems.","December 21, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

You get 5 colors that change the environment but you rarely need to use more then 1 at a time. And there is nothing about the colors really inventive, it is just there.\n\nThe graphics are just lazy. The main character has some nice animations, but everything else is just the bare minimum to get the point across. The all scary void is just a flat image that lights certain parts in a sequence, reminding me of a Christmas tree.\n\nThe voice actor is bad. Just reminds me of free flash game voice actors. He also reads the wrong word in the game ending making the sentence make no sense. To make that mistake worse, the intend sentence is written on the background, just so you know he screwed up.\n\nThe worst part of the game is the script. It is really bad. It is like the some accidentally grabbed the first draft instead of the final one and no one noticed.\n\nAnd these are all thoughts I had while playing the game, but I decide to finish to see if it would redeem itself.

And I don't mean they're difficult to figure out (that's the fun part of any puzzle game, right?). What I mean is once you do figure out what to do (and that part is challenging and fun because they don't let you take the obvious route), it's almost impossible to time correctly.

If you're looking for a deeply meaningful and complex puzzle game, look elsewhere. The puzzles in the main game are mindless and unfulfilling, barely branching out from their basic mechanics. In "void" mode (Nihil's version of New Game +), the difficulty of the puzzles aren't scaled; the game simply becomes a platformer-hybrid contingent on split-second timing and quick reflexes. Even with the challenges this mode presents, completing stages offer no satisfaction aside from what little can be had with the absence of the narrator.\n\nWhat's left after the gameplay has been stripped away is a watered-down philosophy 101 lesson told by some guy who sounds like he hates his life. The writing is awful; throughout the game, the narrator beats you over the head with how your poor little guy is feeling (spoilers: not good), but instead of creating an emotional rapport with the character, it's just meaningless drivel.\n\nTl;dr: pretty graphics alone don't make a game, and the sophmoric narrator ruins the game.","July 4, 2015","false","7.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

On the other hand, there are like a dozen negative (and I mean, NEGATIVE) aspects. Puzzles and application of mechanics are just dreadful, boring, and repetitive. It feels like mechanics are there, not because they'll be the foundation of the game, but because they'll efficiently waste your time with silly tutorial-like levels (Whole game consists of them, not just the 'mechanic introduction' parts.). Camera is a pain in the ♥♥♥, I won't even try to describe it. Story is non-existent. Narrator is a disaster, it's the exact opposite of the narration at 'Thomas was Alone', where narration completes the advancement of story, while simultaneously making you wonder he'll say next. Instead, you'll just curse at that damn nonsensical boring text-reading voice each and every second (It won't even be catching up with your progress speed.), while playing a more boring game (If you still may play this game despite this review, do youself a favor, and mute the narrator right away. Don't even try getting into game for the first time, thinking like "How bad could it be?", just, don't..). Also, name of the game is Nihilumbra, but both in terms of concept and story, it has nothing to do with Nihilism whatsoever. Creators must've thought like "Void = Nothing = Nihilism", or something shalow like that, just to seem cool. By the way, 'Void' is a purple wave which absorbs everything, more like a blackhole. Last but not least, typography in this game is a ♥♥♥♥ING TORTURE. Trust me, as a graphic designer, I've endured many bad typographies throughout my life, but this game has by far the WORST typography I've ever seen in any digital content. My eyes bleed several times, that huge serif typeface haunted me in my nightmares.\n\nAnd as a result, I consider Nihilumbra as an incredibly awful waste of a potentially above-average concept.\n\nIf you finished literally all the great platformers out there, like Limbo, Braid, Teslagrad, Thomas was Alone, FEZ, The Swapper, The Cave, Trine, Mark of the Ninja, and you are still searching for a platformer, it may barely be OK to buy Nihilumbra on a -%80 sale..","December 10, 2014","false","2.2"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Many of my complaints are mirrored by other reviewers. The narrator's voice is not very well acted, very repetitious, very trite, and just...constant. He shows up with zingers about finding your heart, how anger is dangerous, how it's important to feel sadness, and at times I found myself blinking in disbelief that the lines made it through to the final draft.\n\nThe gameplay is mediocre. It isn't outright bad, but it's just not very fun. You spend most of your time trying out different powers, which will give you the ability to: slide yourself and objects over ground, toast things (including you if you're not careful) with raging fires, make the ground 'bouncy' so everything springs off of it, create electricity to turn on circuits (and thus make puzzles 'run' their active elements), and a few others I'm probably forgetting. That's the thing - the abilities are really just forgettable. Platforming staples like 'bouncy bouncy' need a little twist to make them interesting. Otherwise you are just back to Mario and spring-boards again.\n\nPersonally, I found the story tedious and unoriginal. You play as a sliver of the void, inexplicably cast onto the earth, and running from the 'void' - an understandably featureless foe who chases you across the map on occasion, and summons minions to try and slay you in a few different ways. The rule in this game is Insta-Death, which would be fun and exciting if the monsters were not so often acting in entirely novel ways, reacting unpredictably to tiny mistakes on your behalf (e.g. missing a small spot on the floor with the 'paint-on' effects), or just being RIGHT THERE as you enter a new frame. They also tend to have (IMO) awkward hit-boxes, such that you think you are okay springing over them, only to mysteriously die when you get too close.\n\nI finished the main game in a little over two hours. It's a decently priced game, and I don't have much to complain about here. There is a 'void' mode unlocked after beating the main game, but I found the game suddenly veered from stupidly easy, to stupidly hard when I reached this mode - I never found the game reached that 'sweet spot' for me, between the two poles. I found myself, ridiculously, stuck on the very first 'room' of Void mode, perfectly able to solve the 'puzzle' (jumping over a charging enemy by building a little altitude), and occasionally succeeding (only to die on the next room) but almost entirely unable to execute it.\n\nTrading Cards are a nice perk, and I sold them for an effective $1 reduction in price.\n\nAchievements are what you would expect. About half are for clearing levels and winning the game, or objectives you can't avoid completing. The other are fairly obscure, and I believe there is a handful of hidden ones. Nothing too staggering here, but par for the course.\n\nOverall, I disliked this game, and would probably rate it something like 4/10. It wasn't pull-out-your-hair bad, but on reflection, I think it was not worth the money. A couple hours wasted, no harm done, but nothing I can give a 'thumb up' to with a good conscience.","January 26, 2014","false","2.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladderman/recommended/252670/","ladderman","No","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladderman/","335 products in account","The game consists of 5 stages that take about 15-20 minutes each to complete. So you'll probably finish the game in about 2 hours or less.\n\nIn each stage you get a new color that you click and drag across the ground to make it slippery, bouncy, sticky, burn things, or connect electricity. Honestly I was expecting the game to have controller support with such basic controls. It has none; keyboard only.\n\nThe narration is alright. The gameplay is honestly very boring throughout the first two levels. I was about to give up on the game; I felt no reason to continue playing. I wasn't having fun and it was boring. After forcing myself to keep going it got a little more interesting in the 3rd-5th levels.\n\nOverall a fairly average and short game. The file size is fairly big, about 2.3 gb. I usually expect small 2d games like this to be around 500 MB or less. It doesn't really seem to have any replayability and I have no desire to play it again so I just uninstalled it after I beat it. I got it in a humble bundle for $1 with two other games. I've seen it on sale for $1 by itself before too; so pick it up while it's cheap if you want to. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know unless they really wanted it or got it very cheap.","February 21, 2015","false","1.8"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

E.G. brown makes them sticky, ground bouncy, stuff like that. It's a decent enough concept but the mouse control of it never felt right to me, it's a bit sloppy, as opposed to precise.\n\nThe puzzles in story mode are deadly easy, so it seems that this mode is more about the plot than anything else. You're a creature from "The Void", basically a hellish nothingness, who escapes and discovers the wonders of the living world while your home realm follows you, putting obstacles in your way and fighting to pull you back. The plot is just meh to me. I don't really go for abstract philosophy, and the narrator is deadpan and annoying.\n\nAt a couple hours, with too-easy puzzles, story mode felt like a waste of time. Finishing it opens the Void Mode, which ramps up the puzzle difficulty from 2/10 to 12.

Liking puzzle platformers, I thought this might've been an interesting variant, but due to its simple level design and mechanics, I don't really recommend it. I've only played just past the area where you gain the ability to bounce with green, but I have no real desire to continue even after spending $4.99 on it. I honestly wouldn't recommend this game to anyone above the age of 8. The narrative to me is quite bothersome because of how persistent it is trying to slam some story onto this basic platformer as well as giving some hints as how to solve incredibly simple platforming puzzles.\n\nHowever, this would be a good game for much younger audiences. I don't entirely have the right to say this game is bad considering I haven't finished it, but judging on the first hour or so of gameplay, this game is much better suited for a younger audience.","June 13, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","1"

There were some alright relaxing music tunes.\n\nLevel design didn't feel too great, not impressive or challenging (in story mode; you unlock another mode when finishing the game where you progress through whole new levels and which I played shortly; that mode is apparently harder, but I had no motivation to try that too much). Logic lacks a bit too. Why would you be in a forest and find mechanical devices to block or help you on your way? I didn't remember any explanation for that. I guess gameplay-wise there could have been ways for the developers to make things work the same just with different, more logical and ambiance-fitting objects.\n\nThere is a constant neutral narration throughout the levels. The voice quickly became tedious to listen to, and I soon didn't care about what he was telling as it felt pretentious and repetitive. The game dearly tries to make you feel like you were on a meaningful journey of life and death, but it didn't strike me. There are some lines so dripping with a tryhard-meaningfulness that I couldn't resist to roll my eyes a bit. Or maybe I'm just hardboiled? I don't know.\n\nRegarding the gameplay: You find flowers resembling colors. These colors give you certain powers to draw on surfaces. One color makes you move faster when walking the ground it's on, another makes you (or enemies slower), another makes you jump higher and so on. It's moderately interesting, but not fleshed out too much in the story mode, which is why someone has to get through that first to see the other, already-mentioned second mode in which he can use all these colors to a bigger extend.\n\nI didn't exactly like the progression of the game: There are clear lines between the levels and settings. I think it was first an icy area, then a moderate forest, a hot desert, after that some volcano area and one more special place. In each you find one flower/color. I prefer a less narrowly drawn progression in games, as this is a very "classic" or predictable/"boring" scheme (pick your side) to make someone advance through.","April 16, 2014","false","3.5"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

It just takes a bit more than half the game for it to say anything interesting. The narrator is indeed annoyingly heavy-handed and monotone. He also can't seem to decide if he's trying to be helpful or hurtful. At first I thought he was supposed to be the voice of the void itself but he quickly switched from cautioning you from parting the void to telling you to run from it. Just... What?\n\nWhat I'm here for is the puzzles. I like puzzles. It's a shame that you have to get through the first half of the game (story mode) to get to the real ones. Its an even bigger shame that many of the real ones (void mode) are centered on saying "NO you can't use that color here. Find the other way around this." I prefer puzzles that force me to use all of my tools instead of those that simply stop me from using the most convenient ones. Personal preference but I must admit the puzzles still are pretty good (in void mode).\n\nThe music is nice and the art style is simple and effective. The game has run mostly smoothly for me with only a bit of trouble with brown glitching. I haven't quite finished the game but I've cleared the last two sections  (both living forest and ash desert) in an hour each whereas the frozen cliffs took me much longer in void mode so I'm suspecting that I will be finishing entirely soon with an estimated full time of perhaps twelve hours so I consider this a short game.\n\nIt's worth getting (albeit on sale) if you like puzzles but (and this is a big but) it will take time to get to the valuable ones and the narrator is likely to aggravate those who either don't much care for philosophy or (like me) simply don't like being told what one is feeling.  Gameplay good- storytelling mediocre. Recommended for puzzles and because a few people will really like the story despite the ham-handed nature of it.","December 22, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short this game has a great story and I encourage that you see for yourself.\n\nGameplay: Nihilumbra is a 2D platformer were you must use colors to your advantage. Each color has a unique property that you can use to your advantage whether it's going through terrain, avoiding enemies or solving puzzles. In this game there is no way to kill enemies yourself until later in the game you also need to use your enviroment to help you. Using colors in my opinion was a great way to expand the depth in the gameplay and make it much less simple but not too complicated.\n\nPresentation: The art style of this game is beautiful. It really shows difference between the different levels you advance through and uses a wide range of colors. Not to mention that in this version there is now an art gallery where you can look at concept art, sketchs and level designs.\n\nIs it Good? There is one complaint I have about this game and thats how short it is if you play it fast it could be less then 3 hours of gameplay (not including Void mode).

It just takes a bit more than half the game for it to say anything interesting. The narrator is indeed annoyingly heavy-handed and monotone. He also can't seem to decide if he's trying to be helpful or hurtful. At first I thought he was supposed to be the voice of the void itself but he quickly switched from cautioning you from parting the void to telling you to run from it. Just... What?\n\nWhat I'm here for is the puzzles. I like puzzles. It's a shame that you have to get through the first half of the game (story mode) to get to the real ones. Its an even bigger shame that many of the real ones (void mode) are centered on saying "NO you can't use that color here. Find the other way around this." I prefer puzzles that force me to use all of my tools instead of those that simply stop me from using the most convenient ones. Personal preference but I must admit the puzzles still are pretty good (in void mode).\n\nThe music is nice and the art style is simple and effective. The game has run mostly smoothly for me with only a bit of trouble with brown glitching. I haven't quite finished the game but I've cleared the last two sections  (both living forest and ash desert) in an hour each whereas the frozen cliffs took me much longer in void mode so I'm suspecting that I will be finishing entirely soon with an estimated full time of perhaps twelve hours so I consider this a short game.\n\nIt's worth getting (albeit on sale) if you like puzzles but (and this is a big but) it will take time to get to the valuable ones and the narrator is likely to aggravate those who either don't much care for philosophy or (like me) simply don't like being told what one is feeling.  Gameplay good- storytelling mediocre. Recommended for puzzles and because a few people will really like the story despite the ham-handed nature of it.","December 22, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I suspect some sense of spirituality or religious material as some of the inspiration or perhaps the basis of some elements. Yet, I percieve this more as a metaphysical mirror of the nature of life, death and reality, presented in a way that wouldn't frighten children;  even if the subject matter is a little too deep for them. The somber soundtrack suits the mood of the story very well.\n\nI don't think this game misrepresented anything in the description, however, I was a little disappointed. I don't think it's a bad game at all, just not really for me. Also, really short and extremely concise in every aspect.\n\nI am recommending this review based on the fact that had I really looked at the game descriptions, I might not have gotten it, but there were really alot of positive reviews, probably by alot of people who like very casual games.\n\nWhen they say, "casual," they really mean, "casual." This game really has little to no challenge at all. It has some very simple and very basic mechanics coupled with unusual and original devices, but that I find has been implemented to a very limited degree as far as challenge and stimulation are concerned. It's cute and fun in a way. I only mention that because I find this game to be perfect for any child that can handle simple game mechanics.\n\nI don't dislike this game, but it's really too moderate for me. I think the premise deserves a much darker tone, more intense atmosphere, and much more philosophical literature.\n\nI think if you like children's tales and really casual and simple games, then I do recommend it.","March 7, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems to be a side scrolling platformer, and it is, but toss in a few new elements and a few puzzles and you will have a good time.

You control a being from the void, trying to escape it.  Along the way, you encounter colors which have special properties like bouncy or sliding.  The main story mode isn't really the most difficult thing, Nihilumbra is made to be atmospheric, travelling in an empty world with only danger in the paths ahead.  It's a great game, and if you finished the main story, you can play void mode, which will put your skills and brain to the test.

But after you beat the game, there is a challenge mode that is EXTREMELY difficult.  It even has an achievement called "Hard Mode is Hard." for when you die 5 times in Hard mode.  I got that achievement within 10 minutes of starting the hard mode.  I rarely died in the normal game.\n\nNow, this will give you one of two reactions:  "Ugh, who has time for this?" and "Aww man, I'm gonna be the best Nihilumbra player ever!!"\n\nThe 2 factors I would recommend you consider are:  Do you like dark-coloured existentialist narrative wanderings?

The story is fair as well, although the ending was a little predictable. Void mode presents a step up in difficulty after the main game is complete, and although it's almost at rage game level it's presented more like bonus content. You can skip it if that's not your style. All in all, it's definitely a worthy addition to the puzzle platformer genre, and most certainly worth the price of admission.","June 21, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people seem to dislike the placement of the autosave locations, but there is a reason you can't save wherever. Most platformers don't do it that way for a reason. The narrator adds a little bit of fun to it, and the puzzles progressively get harder and entertaining. If you are very good at platformers, I can recommend this.

The different abilities are given to you gradually and appropriately ramp up the complexity of the puzzles at a good pace.  The game is split between two parts: The first time through and all of the the levels re-done as a bonus hard mode (called void mode) once you complete the game.  The first time through the puzzles aren't all that challenging but serve as warm up as you get used to all of the different puzzle mechanics.  The puzzles are never boring, but walk a fine line between being solvable fairly quickly but also satisfying to do so.  After you get to the end, the void mode opens up and really makes you think and be on your toes.  The puzzles are never frustrating but can be quite challenging.  The story is written such that the void mode makes sense narratively and motivates you to want to finish it to get the 2nd (final) ending.  The void mode levels aren't narrated as the main playthrough is which is a bummer, but just a minor complaint.  Very much worth the complete playthrough!","April 25, 2014","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than simply narrating I found him conveying the players emotions. It quickly became an annoyance at being told how I'm supposed to feel as opposed to leading me to feel that way.

When you are introduced to its world, you can't help but marvel at its art, deep in the frigid mountains to the ruins of a city long abandoned, and you're drawn further in by the awesome music that it emits. It truly tells an interesting tale.\n\nYou are Born. A being that escaped from the Void to see and live a life for yourself. As you traverse Nihilumbra's world, you come across various 'colors', which act as both your tools and your weapons. For instance, Blue is Ice, allowing your character to either move quicker and jump further or to allow your enemies to slip and slide off a ledge to be trapped or to their untimely doom. Each color that you get are often used in conjunction with one another to help solve the game's many puzzles. Puzzles that I found very appealing, and interesting, some of them simple, some of them more complex. It's all about how you analyze the situation and how you yourself are going to utilize what has been given. With a solid control scheme and responsiveness, the game didn't feel it was trying to work against the player, which is crucial for a puzzle platformer.\n\nWhen you start, it gives you a 'Story-esque' tutorial, here is where you learn how to play, what to expect, and how Born and everything around you reacts to your actions. It was interesting actually, and didn't feel as if the game was holding my hand, but rather an introduction. It was a nice touch by developers. After the 'story' as been completed, you are far from being finished. Now, you must right the wrongs that you have done, and this is where the real fun begins. It was a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles, and after completing each one, the accomplishment was indeed satisfying.\n\nOverall, it's a game that is well worth its price. With an overall great infrastructure, and charm, Nihilumbra has easily become one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to those who enjoys puzzle platformers, or to any gamer in general. It's that easy to pick up and play, and easily be drawn into its fantastical world.","January 1, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is nice, not too deep but satisfying nontheless, very rewarding especially towards the end of the first playthrough. Speaking of which, that first playthrough won't take you too long and I felt it was almost too easy (apart from some sections being trial and error but those are far and few between). However, then I "finished" the game and unlocked void mode. Boy was I wrong. Things got immeditely challenging and very satisfying.\n\nConsider the initial story mode as one huge fun story driven tutorial. Once you are done with that, and mastered all the elements properly, its time to really test you and this is where the game absolutely shines. Music/effects are gorgeous and fit really well with the ambient, artistic graphics style enhances the whole experience and enhanced the gameplay.\n\nOn the down sides, movement can sometimes be little bit kludgy, especially when it comes to magnets and jumping of brown  sticky surfaces, but those are really minor quibles.\n\nYou like a good puzzle/platformer mix?

The initial story mode is effectively an extended tutorial with little actual challenge. New mechanics are introduced very slowly, while the plot presented at this point is about what you'd expect from a casual indie game; very forgettable and completely predictable. The atmosphere is pretty nice though, and the voice is pleasant to listen to.\n\nOnce you finish the story you get access to the extended challenge mode; think Super Meat Boy dark world. The mechanics are much the same, but the game tries to add extra challenge by presenting a lot more complex scenarios. Unfortunately for the most part these extended challenges end up being nothing more than timing puzzles or trial and error memorization of where the enemies spawn.\n\nGet this full price if you really like precise timing puzzles.

From begining to end this narrator will try and tell you something about the world your in. At first this is fine but then it  quickly becomes annoying when he does it for every other room transition and then he tries to tell you how to feel  "you feel sadness" then im just sitting here thinking to my self while squinting my eyes "dont tell me how to feel, Mr narrator man". Also I was unsure what kind of narrator he is, whether he was the character experiencing the world or  all knowing omnipresent void in the begining of the game.

Nice nihillistic story with enjoyable storytelling and animation. It's more puzzle solving game rather than platformer at least the first part. In the first part you collect collors in five different worlds. Each color gives you some special ability like you can paint red color on the floor to burn monsters. After finishing the game, which will happen pretty soon because it's quite short and easy, you will unlock challenge mode. In this mode you can go through previous worlds (in any order) which are now a bit modified to provide more difficult brain teasers and rexlex & timing abilities. Problem is that it's not very well ballanced and some levels are really difficult. See, difficulty is not increasing regularly but it's somehow random. At the end all puzzles and challenges are possible to handle ballancing on boundary where it can get bit too frustrating especially if you're not skilled in this type of games. After beating this mode you will unlock special "Secret Language" bonus which gives the game brand new replayability and chance to enjoy something untraditional and funny.

Even though the game design is pretty, lets say "traditional", the puzzles aren't frustrating (until now). Finally i can say: a very intelligent, well-told story.

The voiceover never completely explains certain parts of the story, which keeps a certain mystery around the game's world, and sometimes may make the player consider what side the narrator is on. Subtitles are set to be always on, and are integrated into the game's environment so people can still read the story if the narrator annoys them that much, though I personally enjoyed the storytelling.\n\n\nThe game has a reasonable difficulty curve for the main story, though there were a few puzzles that were a little more difficult than someone would suspect at only 1 or 2 points in the journey. Nihilumbra also features a challenge mode similar to Super Meat Boy called "Void Mode", which has every level from the main story but more difficult and without narration, effectively doubling the game's levels from 40 to 80.\n\n\nVoid Mode provides some replay value to Nihilumbra, and the puzzles range from a worthy challenge to a bit vague. Certain solutions have no origin in story mode, such as bouncing and sliding a crate on the ground between two points so it can hit multiple switches, and will probably result in a player looking up the answer. However, the majority of puzzles have been somewhat reasonable, with some requiring excellent timing and others utilizing planning in advance.\n\n\nThis game is a welcome addition to my library, especially when I purchased it at only $2 during a sale. I look forward to the remaining challenges this game can provide.\n\nFYI: For those curious, the Linux version, which I'm using, works, but the achievements unlocked in-game do not sync with Steam without some work. A solution is mentioned by someone here: http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1u2v4r/couple_of_tips_for_nihilumbra_players_on_64bit/\n\nwhich also links to a dev post on Steam forums for any necessary further explanation.","December 14, 2014","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is like a metroidvania puzzle game that is linear. There are no branching paths like a true metroidvania but story is of more importance than gameplay. That being said the gameplay is well crafted and all the puzzles are solvable with minimal intrusion, this is not like early point and click adventure game puzzles but more of an actio-adventure sort in 2D. The Steam version has an added art gallery and full voice over. THe voice over is nice but is not needed, though having played both versions it was a nice addition, but I still think the voice over work is more like a director's commentary and shouldn't be heard the first time around. It is one of my favorite indie games to come out in the past year or so.\n\nSo yes, buy this game for the experience.

The game lacks a dificulty curve and goes from mind numbingly easy to dreadfully dificult with no real middleground. Many deaths seem to require forsight to bypass on a first try or be up to luck. Thankfully, in the main game this is mitigated by frequent checkpoints and while not so great design wise is quickly forgotten. In Void mode however, the game feels like platformer romhack design in that there is a lot of waiting, needless spikes for precision platforming in long puzzle areas, and the oppening has you face to face with an enemy and flat terrain and is just an awful introduction to the mode that left me feeling "Really game?".\n\nWhile I do have negative complaints, let them not be the entirety of my view on the game aside from aesthetics. I enjoyed the combination of platform and painting puzzle elements and I would like to see more done in this vein without resorting to the void mode levels of dificulty! There are amazing ideas at work here and I think they are more in need of fine tuning and dificulty balancing than being anywhere near outright bad.

When you are introduced to its world, you can't help but marvel at its art, deep in the frigid mountains to the ruins of a city long abandoned, and you're drawn further in by the awesome music that it emits. It truly tells an interesting tale.\n\nYou are Born. A being that escaped from the Void to see and live a life for yourself. As you traverse Nihilumbra's world, you come across various 'colors', which act as both your tools and your weapons. For instance, Blue is Ice, allowing your character to either move quicker and jump further or to allow your enemies to slip and slide off a ledge to be trapped or to their untimely doom. Each color that you get are often used in conjunction with one another to help solve the game's many puzzles. Puzzles that I found very appealing, and interesting, some of them simple, some of them more complex. It's all about how you analyze the situation and how you yourself are going to utilize what has been given. With a solid control scheme and responsiveness, the game didn't feel it was trying to work against the player, which is crucial for a puzzle platformer.\n\nWhen you start, it gives you a 'Story-esque' tutorial, here is where you learn how to play, what to expect, and how Born and everything around you reacts to your actions. It was interesting actually, and didn't feel as if the game was holding my hand, but rather an introduction. It was a nice touch by developers. After the 'story' as been completed, you are far from being finished. Now, you must right the wrongs that you have done, and this is where the real fun begins. It was a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles, and after completing each one, the accomplishment was indeed satisfying.\n\nOverall, it's a game that is well worth its price. With an overall great infrastructure, and charm, Nihilumbra has easily become one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to those who enjoys puzzle platformers, or to any gamer in general. It's that easy to pick up and play, and easily be drawn into its fantastical world.","January 1, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is nice, not too deep but satisfying nontheless, very rewarding especially towards the end of the first playthrough.

However, then I "finished" the game and unlocked void mode. Boy was I wrong. Things got immeditely challenging and very satisfying.\n\nConsider the initial story mode as one huge fun story driven tutorial. Once you are done with that, and mastered all the elements properly, its time to really test you and this is where the game absolutely shines. Music/effects are gorgeous and fit really well with the ambient, artistic graphics style enhances the whole experience and enhanced the gameplay.\n\nOn the down sides, movement can sometimes be little bit kludgy, especially when it comes to magnets and jumping of brown  sticky surfaces, but those are really minor quibles.\n\nYou like a good puzzle/platformer mix?

The game takes place in the void and many parts of the earth.

He doesnt understand the world but as the game progresses he begins to learn. The narrations are cool and in my perspective the narrator is like "life", always trying to bring him down and make him feel like he isnt good enough but he always proves the narrator wrong. Its fairly easy, except for a few parts that seem to have no soloution but once you figure it out its fine. There are parts closer to the end of each "world" which are more fast paced and challenging but if you have a friend with you so you can share the controls and do two things at once, it may be beneficial for you when passing the ends of each level.

It's a great game, and if you finished the main story, you can play void mode, which will put your skills and brain to the test.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceReacher/recommended/252670/","SpaceReacher","Spacey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceReacher/","246 products in account","A relatively short game from Spain, Nihilumbra. You are Born. Spewed forth from the Void itself. Without meaning, without light, without hope. You have nothing and are nothing. You travel from one out of five different areas in search of self and life. Soon discovering you aren't the only thing wrought from the Void you hasten your venture even further into the world, bringing to light - colors. Each color has it's own power and individuality to them. Each one is new and fills your character with a sense of wonder. With colors come actions, with actions come consequences.\n\nA proverbial story about the world around you and the importance of self-identification.\n\nYou are Born.\n\nPros:\nArt Style - Almost bland at times, which works well with the story, the further you go in, the lighter and more vivid things become.\n\nVoice Acting - For one voice actor, he did an amazing job. From swelled with sorrow to brimming with hope. You can hear it well in his dialogue.\n\nControls - Using a combination of your keyboard for movement and you mouse for the colors makes for a versatile yet easy to manage control and feel for the game itself.\n\nGameplay - Almost reminiscent of Ori, which I had played before this. It relies heavily on using your new found skills to conform to the world around you without abandoning your previous colors. Mixing two, sometimes more makes for a very unique game play style.\n\nMenu - Easy to navigate menu, settings, options. The menu itself is almost engulfed in darkness which helps to set the mood even more.\n\nMusic - If a game's music keeps up with the pace of what's going on screen, I think the composer or artist has done there job right. This one manages it almost perfectly with some repetition throughout.\n\nReplay Value - After completing the game, you will unlock Void mode, an even more difficult adventure which will punish you even more than the casual campaign. After beating that you'll unlock the special language. The language of kings, bro. Good addition to an otherwise short game.\n\nDifficulty - With a well paced difficult curve, you shouldn't find yourself dying too much, the easier you grasp your new color, the quicker your feet will carry you.\n\n\nCons:\nAdvancing Too Fast - If you journey too fast the dialogue will get cut off. It's better to stop and wait until the dialogue is finished before moving on which felt a bit too tedious.\n\nScreen Transitioning - Sometimes you'll find yourself dying from moving onto the next screen and not knowing what is there or having a projectile thrown in your face. Blindsides you a tad, didn't care much for that.\n\nRepetitive - While the first two levels are nice you will quickly come to terms with the fact that you'll be doing the other levels in a similar fashion. Enter. Color. Void. This could go either way for you. For me it was a con.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend this game if you like indie hidden gems, platforming and a story rich, sometimes puzzling game.\nI got this on sale for three dollars, it currently sits at eight.. which, if not on sale at that moment, I would've purchased.\nWhich ever option you go with, in the end, you'll be Born.\n\n(Side note, I felt like Frozone from time to time "Where is my Super Suit?")","May 9, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is deeper than what is being said by the narrator though.  After the main story there is a "Void mode" which is MUCH more challenging than the first playthrough.

I have to say even after beating the game, the twist at the end, that just so perfectly sends you into void mode, was very ingenious, but as you play you may find it too easy here and there, but don't worry. Once you do manage to advance to void mode, you will find it a lot more challenging (and rage quit here and there).

The initial story mode is effectively an extended tutorial with little actual challenge. New mechanics are introduced very slowly, while the plot presented at this point is about what you'd expect from a casual indie game; very forgettable and completely predictable. The atmosphere is pretty nice though, and the voice is pleasant to listen to.\n\nOnce you finish the story you get access to the extended challenge mode; think Super Meat Boy dark world. The mechanics are much the same, but the game tries to add extra challenge by presenting a lot more complex scenarios. Unfortunately for the most part these extended challenges end up being nothing more than timing puzzles or trial and error memorization of where the enemies spawn.\n\nGet this full price if you really like precise timing puzzles. Wait for a sale if you like platformers and artsy games. Skip it if you're looking for deep or thought evoking challenges.","January 5, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes place in the void and many parts of the earth. A small black blob of "nothingness" escapes The Void and is trying to find out who he is, what he is, and where he belongs while the void is trying to capture him and bring him back. He doesnt understand the world but as the game progresses he begins to learn. The narrations are cool and in my perspective the narrator is like "life", always trying to bring him down and make him feel like he isnt good enough but he always proves the narrator wrong. Its fairly easy, except for a few parts that seem to have no soloution but once you figure it out its fine. There are parts closer to the end of each "world" which are more fast paced and challenging but if you have a friend with you so you can share the controls and do two things at once, it may be beneficial for you when passing the ends of each level. You should definitly download this game if it sounds like something your interested in, but hurry...The Void is Coming for you. :)","January 7, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles aren't overly hard. I was able to complete the game in 2-3 hours and I only got stuck a handful of times - usually because I was trying to solve a problem in the hardest way possible.  By contrast the Void mode, which unlocks when the game is completed is ridiculously hard. I gave up on it after spending 20-30 minutes (and many, many deaths) trying to get past the second screen.\n\nThe music is well suited and definitely helps to instill a sense of urgency during the 'chase' phases.  As many have mentioned, the narration is probably unnecessary, or at least, over used.\n\nIn summary the game is well worth a look, especially if on sale.

Casual - ~2h main story mode where you learn about your abilities and about puzzles. There is narration, feels, thoughts etc. When you finish this mode the game unlocks the "void mode", which is a more difficult mode which tests your understanding of the mechanics. Progressing in the void mode unlocks more stuff in the art gallery, which actually is a nice reward. The art is a strong side of this game. I'm glad you can even see designer scetches when you unlock that.\n\nThoughts:\nI wasn't very comfortable with the controls (and the mechanics). Initial momentum is very important, you don't get much control mid-air.\nLevels are divided into screens. I get a feeling that this decision was brought up very late, as beating some screens requires speeding up from an area on another screen. I wish this game used the classic side-scrolling model.\nThe narrator began to annoy me a little after some time (he sounded a little monotonic). Also after respawning at a checkpoint a few times the narrator reads the same lines every time, which is also getting annoying after a few times.\nArt is an important aspect of games like this. Progressing unlocks more entries in the art gallery, which in my opinion is a good reward (there are also achievements, which add replayability value).\nWhile the story mode is beatable in short time, I'm sure the void mode will take a lot more time to beat as it is more puzzle-and-mechanics based.\n\nSo, should you get it?\nIt's an interesting position. Made me a little emotional actually. The art and music fit well together. The narrator says some things that actually make you think about life and death a little. If you're looking for something like that - go for it. If you're looking for a challenging platformer then I'd recommend something else. This game takes away some control from the player.","January 9, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nevertheless, it has a very well-told, if minimal, story. And it doesn't suffer for being minimal - the simplicity is actually part of what makes the story work.\n\nIts gameplay is simple to learn but it may take some time before you'll discover everything you can do with your powers.

It feels like the PC version was ported to smartphones, not vice-versa.\n\nAfter playing, I would be willing to pay twice the normal price for this game.

The game lacks a dificulty curve and goes from mind numbingly easy to dreadfully dificult with no real middleground. Many deaths seem to require forsight to bypass on a first try or be up to luck. Thankfully, in the main game this is mitigated by frequent checkpoints and while not so great design wise is quickly forgotten. In Void mode however, the game feels like platformer romhack design in that there is a lot of waiting, needless spikes for precision platforming in long puzzle areas, and the oppening has you face to face with an enemy and flat terrain and is just an awful introduction to the mode that left me feeling "Really game?".\n\nWhile I do have negative complaints, let them not be the entirety of my view on the game aside from aesthetics. I enjoyed the combination of platform and painting puzzle elements and I would like to see more done in this vein without resorting to the void mode levels of dificulty! There are amazing ideas at work here and I think they are more in need of fine tuning and dificulty balancing than being anywhere near outright bad.

I found the puzzles to be very predictable and hardly engaging, There was no real rewarding feeling you do not identify with born and the narrator at times is too slow, and can even just be an annoyance. Very short game, with poor gameplay and predictable story, a great example of what not to do in game design. I can clearly see its inspirations and its overall goal however the approach taken was wrong. The ending felt almost like a "what" moment, where in teh beginning it was eluded too, tehn forgotten, then brought back.

When you are introduced to its world, you can't help but marvel at its art, deep in the frigid mountains to the ruins of a city long abandoned, and you're drawn further in by the awesome music that it emits. It truly tells an interesting tale.\n\nYou are Born. A being that escaped from the Void to see and live a life for yourself. As you traverse Nihilumbra's world, you come across various 'colors', which act as both your tools and your weapons. For instance, Blue is Ice, allowing your character to either move quicker and jump further or to allow your enemies to slip and slide off a ledge to be trapped or to their untimely doom. Each color that you get are often used in conjunction with one another to help solve the game's many puzzles. Puzzles that I found very appealing, and interesting, some of them simple, some of them more complex. It's all about how you analyze the situation and how you yourself are going to utilize what has been given. With a solid control scheme and responsiveness, the game didn't feel it was trying to work against the player, which is crucial for a puzzle platformer.\n\nWhen you start, it gives you a 'Story-esque' tutorial, here is where you learn how to play, what to expect, and how Born and everything around you reacts to your actions. It was interesting actually, and didn't feel as if the game was holding my hand, but rather an introduction. It was a nice touch by developers. After the 'story' as been completed, you are far from being finished. Now, you must right the wrongs that you have done, and this is where the real fun begins. It was a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles, and after completing each one, the accomplishment was indeed satisfying.\n\nOverall, it's a game that is well worth its price. With an overall great infrastructure, and charm, Nihilumbra has easily become one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to those who enjoys puzzle platformers, or to any gamer in general. It's that easy to pick up and play, and easily be drawn into its fantastical world.","January 1, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is nice, not too deep but satisfying nontheless, very rewarding especially towards the end of the first playthrough. Speaking of which, that first playthrough won't take you too long and I felt it was almost too easy (apart from some sections being trial and error but those are far and few between). However, then I "finished" the game and unlocked void mode. Boy was I wrong. Things got immeditely challenging and very satisfying.\n\nConsider the initial story mode as one huge fun story driven tutorial. Once you are done with that, and mastered all the elements properly, its time to really test you and this is where the game absolutely shines. Music/effects are gorgeous and fit really well with the ambient, artistic graphics style enhances the whole experience and enhanced the gameplay.\n\nOn the down sides, movement can sometimes be little bit kludgy, especially when it comes to magnets and jumping of brown  sticky surfaces, but those are really minor quibles.\n\nYou like a good puzzle/platformer mix?

A Bit Pretentious and A Bit Overrated.Genre: 2D Platformer with Story.\nDeveloped & Published by: BeautiFun Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nThis is an overrated game. As I sit here and think about my experience with this game, that is all I can think. It got a lot of fanfare when it came out in 2013 but I can’t figure out why it did. This isn't really anything new for the genre and mostly just toes the line of what's come before. Maybe that's just me.\n\nStory Thoughts\nNihilumbra is a 2D puzzle platformer where you follow Born, a being that fled something called “the Void”. You journey through multiple “areas” with various puzzles to be solved. All while being narrated/told what you’re feeling the entire time. The game gives off a feeling of being pretentious, whether that was intended or not. I didn't find the story to be all that new, interesting or even good. It simply existed to talk to me about life, death and acceptance of said life. However, I feel like other games have handled it in a better, less ham-fisted way. As it is, Nihilumbra is all about that point and well, leaves a lot to be desired because of it.\n\nPlatforming\nThe platforming and puzzle solving itself isn’t too bad. It’s just really forgiving with the difficulty increasing slowly and steadily the entire campaign but never getting too challenging. The only challenge the game really creates is switching between the different colors/powers quickly. Outside of that, there was only one puzzle I got stuck on and that was because I didn’t realize I could use the brown color to stick to the floor while a magnet was running nearby. One puzzle out of the entire experience. Not a really good sign.\n\nPC Settings\nSettings are really basic but unsurprisingly so. It has v-sync, some resolution options and that’s about it. But as its a 2D game, it doesn't really need much. So, not a big deal. Graphics are reasonably ok, though I don’t think they’re the best we’ve ever seen in this genre. Not even back in 2013. Sound is passable but there isn’t much depth to it. The soundtrack itself is overwhelming repetitive and you will quickly tire of each area’s new theme. A mute option would have been loved.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI’m not sure how I missed playing this platformer when it came out nearly two years ago, during a time I was all into platformers. Playing it now, well, leaves a feeling of ”mehness” to it. Sorry, I can’t think of another word to describe this feeling and that word is certainly not useful. However, as the game works and there’s nothing inherently wrong with it (other than being overrated/pretentious), I can think of worse ways you could waste two hours of your time. But I can also think of better uses.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","January 7, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing truly incredible, the visuals don't really have a unified style, the environments are a bit samey and the narration seems forced, but in the end, I enjoyed it.\n\nNihilumbra has a fairly unique set of mechanics that make for decent puzzles, the character sprite looks incredible, and there's something very original about the story, becoming more introspective and character-focused than I ever imagined it would be. If I'm honest, I expected this to be sort of a lazy indie game clone: Bastion had narration, Limbo had bleak environments and silouhettes, Tag had paint that covers surfaces and alters their attributes, but there's still something unique and special about Nihilumbra, and that's the story. Even though the story centers around (generously speaking) only one character, and even despite the cliched appearance, I was left satisfied nonetheless.","December 24, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are short but sweet with frequent checkpoints - even if you have trouble adjusting to the controls you never get sent back too far. The music is wonderful and does an excellent job at setting the mood of each area. Although I've never been a fan of auto-scrolling, especially while being chased by an invincible hazard, I found myself looking forward to the void segments the most. They're easy enough that I didn't find them frustrating at all.\n\nOne problem I had is that at times I found myself overthinking the puzzles and making them harder for myself than they really are. The solutions are always fairly simple, and the frequent checkpoints mean that even if you have trouble and die several times you're able to try again almost immediately. That being said, this game is suitable for any skill level and isn't hard to learn to play. Highly recommended.","September 23, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is definitely a puzzle game, and requires either a creative mind or an online guide for some of the harder levels.\n\nIt is twice as long as it first appears, and you very much have to earn your happy ending. Nevertheless, it has a very well-told, if minimal, story. And it doesn't suffer for being minimal - the simplicity is actually part of what makes the story work.\n\nIts gameplay is simple to learn but it may take some time before you'll discover everything you can do with your powers. As a fairly uncreative person, I discovered some abilities entirely by accident and others only with the help of walkthroughs.\n\nThe only reasonable complaint I can imagine is that it is clearly a port of a smartphone game - nevertheless, the port is VERY well done and I find that the controls work better on my computer than on my smartphone. It feels like the PC version was ported to smartphones, not vice-versa.\n\nAfter playing, I would be willing to pay twice the normal price for this game. If it's on sale, there is no reason to not buy it, and I think it's a steal even for the full $8.\n\nOverall 10/10","March 22","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once the game begins, it’s quite clear those assumptions are not without reason, but diving deeper reveals a much bolder game with grander ambitions than the typical modern sidescroller.\n\nVideo Review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jD7gFizUTw&list=PL3DFDLFub9-pGLzqUqejMmyNwvJo5Qz7C&index=1\n\nThe player controls a creature named “Born” as it escapes an empty void into the physical world. As Born progresses, a narrator will explain the futility of the whole affair. The narrator insists the void will relentlessly chase Born down as the “the void must be one.” The narrator argues the world is harsh and doesn’t care what the fate of Born will be. The narrator repeats Born is not a part of the physical world and cannot live there. Born is nothing. It’s all pointless. Born will die. Nihilumbra, as its name suggests, is a game about Nihilism – a philosophy asserting the meaninglessness of life.\nThe message is presented in a brutally heavy handed way. It has the subtlety of a hammer slamming on a nail. Perhaps some will find this off-putting, but the decision to forgo nuance results in a gut wrenching emotional conflict between Born and the narrator. As Born moves through the world in spite of the harsh rhetoric, the narrator can be seen as Born’s internal doubt. Progressing through the world feels like an accomplishment, not only for overcoming obstacles, but for overcoming the narrator’s negativity. Eventually, the narrator will admit Born is putting up a good fight. One of the best scenes is early on, when a set of obstacles tests Born’s physical abilities. Born is not strong enough, nor quick enough, but maybe - maybe Born is smart enough.\nThe Nihilistic philosophy of the narrator is constantly undermined throughout the adventure.  The narrator will present a point in their favor, and quickly offer a counterpoint, countering that point, and then countering it again. The narrator argues with itself, and can be seen as a debate inside Born’s head. While the always in pursuit void is a threat, doubt and anxiety within Born are the central conflicts.\nThe narrator, while maintaining the end is nigh, provides tons of encouragement to push Born and the player onwards. It offers assurances just as much as it offers doubt.  It’s never an unlikable presence and more often than not feels like a good friend and ally. As Born comes across and absorbs elemental powers, the narrator will instruct on how to use them. The elements themselves are typical of this type of game. There is slippery ice, bouncy grass, and destructive lava. Sand and Electricity are the stand outs. With Electricity, the player can create currents sending power to contraptions like elevators and turrets. Sand is the most versatile of them all, allowing the player to slow enemies, withstand fierce winds, stick to walls, and silence footsteps. The narrator will also take the time to explain various enemies around the world. Some chase, some shoot, some will erase elemental powers, and other just suck … quite literally.\nThe game is masterfully paced, presenting these abilities one at a time, but not spending very much time with a single element on its own. The game follows a formula where it teaches an element in a safe tutorial, then asks the player to use the element by itself, and finally tasks the player with using the element in conjunction with previously learned abilities. There is always a feeling of progress and of learning something new with every scenario. Again, there is nothing completely unique about the gameplay, but it is well executed.\nThe only blemishes to the game are tedious chase sequences in which the Void has found Born and attempts to reabsorb them. These moments are used as an equivalent of boss battles, happening at the end of an act and requiring mastery of that acts new mechanics. Nihilumbra’s puzzles are clever, but are never a challenge. As such, the problem with these battles is twofold. Often the puzzles are too easy to solve, leaving Born to wait on the camera to move forward. Alternatively, the full breadth of a puzzle isn’t unveiled quick enough and can’t be completed in a timely fashion resulting in a frustrating death. These sequences are only a small portion of the game, but are definitely its weakest points.\nThe games real strengths rarely come from the gameplay by itself, but rather how the powers, enemies, and puzzles blend beautifully with the story being told. As Born gains new abilities, it becomes clear they are becoming more attached to the world around them than they are to the void giving chase. The narrator notes, Born was nothing when it left the void, but through these learned abilities has definitely become something. With this revelation, the game shifts from being a dramatic depression factory into a somewhat uplifting criticism of Nihilism.\nWhat Nihilumbra does is nothing extraordinary, but it wraps itself in a protective blanket of rich atmosphere and tastefully direct writing perfect for the moody teenager in all of us. Its story and gameplay meld seamlessly with excellent music and art to create a completely cohesive vison throughout its entirety. Nihilumbra knows what it is, isn’t ashamed of it, and preforms with a high grade of quality.","January 24","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s all about trying to escape your fate, and seems like it’ll end with the typical Nihilist “everything is meaningless and hopeless” but you’ll be pleasantly surprised. You control a little shadow who learns about colors, each of which has a different effect: Blueish-white = ice, Green = trampoline, red = fire, brown = sticky, yellow = electricity. You combine these skills as you go along to solve puzzles and try to escape your fate.\n\nLet me preface my review by saying that a lot of the negative reviews are unfair. One of the main criticisms of this game is that the main story is easy, and the so-called afterparty known as “Void Mode” is insanely hard. That’s because they’re thinking of it as one continous game, when it’s not. It’s essentially a “Story mode” where you learn the skills, do some levels of varying difficulty (usually easy to medium), you enjoy an interesting story in an interesting world as you go along. It ends with the words “The End.” You can play to this point and have a wonderful experience, perhaps not one that’s 100% worth the $7.99 asking price, but almost certainly worth $5 and DEFINITELY worth the $1.99 I paid for it on sale. If you’re a hardcore puzzler, then you get BONUS levels with some added difficulty. Yes, the bonus levels are GRUELING, with some colors (i.e. powers) forbidden in certain areas, few (if any) save points, and really tricky timing at times. (Like starting off a level with something directly behind you and chasing you.) To be honest, I played a few levels of the Void Mode and felt a little cheated, because I looked at a level and said “Oh, I know what to do! The story mode taught me this! Oh, wait…I can’t use fire here. Or ice. I have no effin’ clue how to get past these 6 enemies without dying over and over.” A lot of them weren’t about planning or skill, mostly about finding the ONE solution that was correct, whereas the main game allowed some creative thinking and was forgiving with your various options. Each “world” of levels ends with a “You’re being chased by the Void, so solve these puzzles really quickly” which is frustrating at times, but it’s kind of like the Boss battle of each world, so it works, and it’s a nice change of pace I guess.\n\nPros:\n+Great music!\n+Great art – complex yet minimalist\n+Interesting game mechanic with tons of cool powers to mix and match\n+Atmospheric – Each area of the world reflects the color you’ve just learned. E.g. You learn red in a volcano level with steam and lava. You learn the blue/white color in an ice world with howling wild and falling snow.\n\nNeutral:\n~ Voice acting is AWFUL, but I put it in neutral because there’s an option to turn it off. It seems unnecessary anyway, because all the words are on the screen, and the voice ruins the atmosphere by interjecting itself all the time. I turned it off after a few levels.\n~ I’m not a fan of the end-of-the-set-of-levels chase scene, but some people might appreciate the change of pace, so I’ll put this here.\n\nCons:\n- As mentioned above, your experience will either be A) very short if you only play through the story, but will be casual and enjoyable or B) long and grueling, if you play Void Mode. So it’s either a length problem or a difficulty problem, but not actually both. Paradox.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\nStory Mode: 9/10. Fun, casual, but not overly challenging.\nVoid mode: 4/10. Punishing. Not for the faint of heart. Skippable.\n\nTl;dr version: Buy it, if only for the story mode.","February 20","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's cheap enough to be easy to recommend. New game plus is\nfrustrating at times, but it's optional. overall, it's a fun game for killing a few hours with\nvery little invesntment. More information is down below\n\nThe game has issues, primarily due to it being a mobile port:\n\n- The keys cannot be rebound, and you cannont assign custom keys to particular abilities.\n- There are few options, and what options are present are icons instead of text. I had no\nidea what they did.\n- The controls are tempermental at times. If you use an ability too quickly, the ability will\nbe ineffective.\n- some abilites don't look right in some situations  brown can make you stick to\nnothing or inside walls if you stick at certain points . It doesn't effect gamplay\nbut it does look goofy.\n- The new game plus mode can be frustrating. You can easily make small mistakes that\nforces a reset. In particular, pushing boxes into walls will make them unmovable. if you\nhave no way to destroy the box, you are forced to restart. In addition, some enemy\nplacements feel unfair The first level in the void run is a good example. There\nis an enemy immediately on screen, and you have to react fast to avoid a death.\nBecause you can't bind colors to keys, you have no way to quickly select a color. Most\nearly deaths will be because you didn't know what color is needed for the next screen.\n\nThe game does have a lot going for it:\n\n- It's cheap at all times.\n- It can be finished quickly. (2 hours)\n- There is a new game plus mode that adds to the run time and gives more of a challange.\n- The game allows for a lot of freedom with the mechanics.\n- Everything looks and sounds great.\n- It is fun and satisfying to beat the levels quickly.","February 25","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing truly incredible, the visuals don't really have a unified style, the environments are a bit samey and the narration seems forced, but in the end, I enjoyed it.\n\nNihilumbra has a fairly unique set of mechanics that make for decent puzzles, the character sprite looks incredible, and there's something very original about the story, becoming more introspective and character-focused than I ever imagined it would be. If I'm honest, I expected this to be sort of a lazy indie game clone: Bastion had narration, Limbo had bleak environments and silouhettes, Tag had paint that covers surfaces and alters their attributes, but there's still something unique and special about Nihilumbra, and that's the story. Even though the story centers around (generously speaking) only one character, and even despite the cliched appearance, I was left satisfied nonetheless.","December 24, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
