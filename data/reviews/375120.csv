But some of them turn light blue and are indestructable.  There are other obstacles like rocks and moving enemies to avoid or kill.  Making your way through the maze is difficult.  There are dead ends and if you choose the wrong path, the screen is slowly scrolling down and you can be trapped.  Each time it is randomly generated, so don't bother trying to memorize.  Collect gems but don't take too much time trying to get them all or you will get trapped!  Some enemies drop special icons that you use to upgrade your ship.  Also one enemy in the bunch will drop the Emerald that you need to get\n\nThe thing I love about this game is that even if you die you keep all the stuff you collected!  That's right up my alley because I'm not that good at these games.  Use the gems to buy new ships and upgrade the defense, attack, and speed of your chosen ship.  Some ships come with special benefits that are useful on certain planets.\n\nEach planet has the gem collect level and then a boss section.  The boss is typical bullet hell, though not as bad as some I've seen.  When you finish a boss new ships are unlocked for purchase.  You can do the planets in any order.\n\nGraphics:  Nice pixel graphics.  I like how they have the different colored layers in the tunnel to make it look like 3D.  The sprites are cute.\n\nSound:  There is a narrator in the beginning intro scene and at the start of each level he says something.  You can turn him off if you don't want to listen to it.  The normal pew-pew sounds and background music that sounds retro.\n\nController worked fine for me.  I used an Xbox controller on Windows 7 PC.\n\nFinal Thoughts:  Might be a little too easy for a pro shmupper, but nice for us regular folks.  It's cheap!  Nice to see a dev that doesn't over-price their games.","June 22, 2015","true","3.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","4"

The clever way this marriage is implemented though, is really what elevates it beyond the sum of it parts.\n\nIt's not just simply blasting waves of enemies to reach the boss, it's about carefully carving a path for your ship to make it through. When you shoot an enemy of a certain color, it's adajcent color matches will explode in a chain. When the chain finally hits an enemy of different color, it will end and turn that enemy into a crystal which you are not able to destroy.\n\nWhat does that mean exactly? Careless volleys can leave you with a dead end. This principle mechanic for traversing through levels requires you to take precise shots, and plan ahead for survival. Things get even more interesting when other level specific hazards are introduced as well as more traditional enemies. Once you wrap your head around the flow of the game, it's a sublime experience.\n\nThe presentation too is stellar. With colorful, vibrant pixel art evocative of the Super Nintendo era and a top notch chiptune soundtrack ranging from melancholic, hypnotic tones to upbeat, excitement builiding battle music.\n\nThe asking price is so reasonable that it should be a no brainer for most. You should pick it up!\n\nCheck out my video of the game for more details!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twfLbYvgHvw","July 18, 2015","true","6.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adolson/recommended/375120/","adolson","adolson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adolson/","928 products in account","At first, this game is extremely frustrating and difficult. The levels are generated randomly, and they come at you seemingly blazingly fast. In addition to the match/freeze puzzle mechanic that separates this game from other shmups, there are some standard enemies tossed at you at the same time, and they take several hits, which makes for a hectic and somewhat annoying gameplay experience.\n\nHOWEVER... As soon as you lock into the swing of things, you will be collecting gems and upgrades for your ships. If you hang in there long enough to beat a boss, you will unlock more ships with abilities above and beyond those found in the initial two that are available. It is, needless to say, a game-changer, to have the ability to be immune to certain types of enemy bullets, or to have the ability to break the previously-indestructible blocks that impede your path. This opens things up, lets you breathe a little, and have a much better time. I quickly went from my typical 5-minutes-and-I-give-up gamer A.D.D. attitude, to "aww man, my wife is home with the groceries... Guess I'd better quit for now and help her bring them in and put them away."\n\nI am still pretty early on in the game, but I didn't want to wait with sharing my recommendation for this new release. For the asking price, I feel that this is a great little vertical-scrolling shmup, with day-one Linux release and gamepad support out of the box (I am using xboxdrv with a lovely Nexus Gamepad).  The only thing I noticed is that I don't hear sound effects (music is fine), which I will report to the devs and hopefully will be patched.","June 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I enjoyed many aspects of the graphics and sound. Unfortunately, this game has many flaws.   I am not sure if I feel compelled to play it again after about an hour of mild enjoyment (punctuated by frustration - and not the good kind.)\n\n- Each stage is divided into a puzzle portion and a boss (bullet hell) portion.  The controls for the ship for the grid-based puzzle portion, however, are almost identical to the boss portion (normal shmup ship controls) which is not well-suited to action puzzle gameplay.  You constantly have to nudge your ship, and maneuvering into gaps in the automatically-scrolling stage is awkward.  I understand the need to dodge bullets, but I think this problem could have been handled more elegantly.\n- The ship is destroyed too easily by being "crushed".  In fact your ship begins to explode well before hitting the bottom of the screen.  There should be some wiggle room!\n- The stages are randomly generated, and occasionally, there is absolutely no way forward no matter which monsters you shoot.  This happened at least 10 times in my play session.  There is no escape route; your only option is to take your inevitable death.  I suppose the developers thought that not having an Lives made this a non-issue, but I would beg to differ.\n- In the same vein, monsters that shoot at you are sometimes placed in a position where they cannot be destroyed by your pea shooter, which only shoots up.  There are no other weapons in the game as far as I can tell.\n- Shooting-enemies don't stand out.  You can't be hurt by normal enemies but you can by the shooting ones.  Avoiding them is a needle-in-haystack affair.\n- Because you're so busy shooting and collecting gems, finding a powerup or an emerald is 90% of the time a matter of luck.\n- There is very little incentive to get better at spotting these special enemies because of the infinite lives and the fact that you keep everything you pick up even if you die.  But when you really need a powerup to defeat a boss or get through a level, you pretty much have to replay it over and over hoping you stumble upon it.\n- I liked the music and voiceover for the most part, but the pilot banter got old fast.  The cursing is totally unnecessary and just comes across as immature.  The worst of the audio's sins, in my opinion, though, is the use of SFXR or BFXR.  Those tinny, instantly recognizable tweets, splutters, and tinkles killed what the sound had going for it and the sense of Playstation/Sega Saturn era sophistication.\n\nIf it were a 10 star system I would give it a weak 7, but I cannot recommend this game.  The gameplay is just not very deep at all and doing well is mostly a matter of a roll of the dice due to a noticeable lack of polish in that department.\n\nI encourage the developers to make their next game and improve in that area.","September 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It's not luck based, there is actually an entire system in place (it teaches you about it in the start of the game with a short text tutorial)\n\nI can now say this game is great, and I will enjoy 100%ing it.\n\n\n\n\n*****************PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW******************************\n\nThe game would be fantastic if they didn't hinge level progression on a broken RNG battle.\n\nWhen you kill an enemy, there is a random chance they will turn into crystal, making them pure walls and unable to be killed. Because of this, you can block yourself from flying any further, forcing yourself to die and restart another boring ride to the boss that will kill you 10+ times before you get ahold of his patterns.\n\nI've had the walls without escape happen over 20 times, and am taking screenshots for people curious to see what I mean.\n\n\nIt's insanely furstrating to play with this RNG mess, I can't reccommend it.","December 20, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/afroryan/recommended/375120/","afroryan","AfroRyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/afroryan/","1013 products in account","Super Star Path has a cool hook; a puzzle/shooter combo. Unfortunately that hook doesn't really lend itself to being endlessly playable like other puzzle games nor is it an especially challenging shmup. Let me tell you why.\n\nFirst and foremost, there is a huge missed opportunity here; there is no arcade/score attack mode. There is a story mode and after you beat that, there is a boss rush mode. I 100% the game in a little over an hour. Mileage may vary some, but I can't see most people spending much more than that on this game, which is a shame because the actual gameplay is solid and the music and graphics are appealing. I get that the game itself is somewhat randomly generated. I get that it may have been technically challenging creating an endless arcade score attack mode. But without it the game is over so quickly that it's hard not to feel a bit ripped off, even at the lower price range. Heck, I got it on sale for $1.99 and I still feel a little ripped off, and I feel like a bad person for admitting that.\n\nAlso, small aside, but the game has strong cursing in it for pretty much no reason. The pilot will randomly say a few one liners here and there, and then suddenly he'll drop the f-bomb. It's strange, because he also says "heck" every so often, so tonally it just seems like a strange decision. Anyways, if you were planning on letting a young child play the game because it looks like a harmless retro game (which it otherwise totally is), maybe reconsider, or mute it I guess.\n\nLet's talk more about its good qualities. It has a rockin' soundtrack, emulating that 90's Sega Genesis/Megadrive sound. Likewise, the game visually looks like it would have fit right into an arcade in the 90's. The game has the player shooting different colored aliens on a vertically scrolling plain. Whenever you shoot an alien that is in a group of similar colored aliens, the whole group will explode. However, aliens that are not the same color that are on the edges of a chain will be crystallized. What that means is that you cannot pass through them and they can no longer be destroyed. It makes for an interesting mechanic, occasionally turning the game into more of a maze than a shooter/puzzle game, and it was fun navigating through the levels. I died at least a couple times by getting stuck due to poor planning on my part.\n\nIn addition to clearing out a path from the colored aliens, there are also different kinds of obstacles and traps in every stage. It reminded me of Super Puzzle Platformer in that sense. Difficulty ramps slowly, and while you collect gems and power ups (which you keep even if you die), you can plan on buying more powerful ships with better abilities and specs. There is a boss encountered at the end of each stage and would really only give you a hard time if you've never played a shoot em up before. For someone who enjoys bullet hell shooters specifically, these bosses will seem like jokes.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, the main issue with this game is its short length. It has minimal replay value aside from earning the true ending, which I did on my first attempt. To get the true ending you are supposed to collect 3 emeralds across all six levels. These emeralds drop from special black colored aliens, and like gems and power ups, are kept even if you die mid-stage. The game could have been slightly (very slightly) longer if the emeralds were only collected upon completion of a stage, but that isn't how it works. Additionally, when levels are replayed, the level bosses are not re-battled. The stage simply ends and you go back to level select.\n\nThere is a boss rush mode that is unlocked when the game is completed. It has a leaderboard (seen outside of the game itself, through Steam's interface). I got 23 seconds on my second try. That isn't really bragging; it's more of an indicator of how easy the mode is. You see, the ships are all fully powered up, except that they only have one health point, so you can't take any damage. But when you're fully powered up and just spam the shoot button, most bosses are down within just a few seconds.\n\nSpeaking of leaderboards, there are timed leaderboards per stage, which doesn't make sense to me. The level scrolls at a fixed rate, so I don't understand at all why there are speed leaderboards per stage. I don't think the boards are for that though; I think it's for how quickly you beat the bosses encountered on that stage. But since you don't fight the bosses after having beaten them within the stage itself, it seems like a completely pointless feature.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend this game, despite enjoying it in many ways. It's just too short and simple to satisfy on a long-term level, and even at its low price point, there are other similar games that are better worth your money. That Super Puzzle Platformer game I mentioned earlier, for example; it's great and has lots of replay value. This however was just a somewhat amusing distraction that only lasted for an hour.","April 25","false","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Every level is composed of two parts: one where you have to find your way through a maze of enemies (the Puzzle part) and one where you must kill a dangerous boss (the Shoot'em up part).\n\nThe real idea of this game is in the Puzzle part: when shooting an alien, you kill it as well as all the other same-colored aliens near him. However, that also crystalised the aliens near by, turning them into indestructible walls. In order to reach the end of the level, you'll have to cleverly choose which aliens to shoot!\n\nIn addition of this, you can also buy new ships with specific caracteristics (more powerful, doesn't get hit by small bullets etc.) which you can upgrade using gems you can find in the puzzle parts. You'll also have to collect 3 emeralds in every level in order to finish the game. Then, you'll have to kill every boss with only one HP. Good luck on that!\n\nTl;dr: Great idea, well executed, great art style and atmosphere, with the only down point of the game being short.","February 28","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level is broken into two parts. You start off confronting masses of multicolored, stationary aliens as you push forward. Shooting them makes them explode in connected colored chains, but there's a catch - if a chain explosion hits an alien of a different color, it will be frozen solid and become an indestructible obstacle. In other words, you can't go into every stage shooting all nilly-willy or else you will create an impassable wall and resign yourself to death. Once you pass the aliens you go into a boss confrontation, where the game turns into a true bullet hell shmup. It's an odd combination juxtaposing planning ahead and methodically cutting through walls of enemies with frantic boss fights requiring raction time and good hand-eye coordination.\n\nEach level has unique stage hazards that make things that much harder, and there are 10 ships you unlock gradually with increased stats and unique features (immunity to certain hazards, gem doubler, etc). Hidden in every stage are three aliens holding upgrade points you can use you increase your ships attack power, hit points, and speed. There are also three black aliens per stage holding green emeralds as per the storyline, and collecting them all will get you the true ending when you beat the final boss.\n\nIt's a short game. I beat it completely - every stage, every item, all ships unlocked, boss rush - in about 2 hours. Yet I feel satisfied. It's a tight package, with a great soundtrack to boot. Strangely, you can't reassign upgrade points, and there are a finite amount you can get in the game. And some of the later levels feel cheap with an abundance of hazards and chains of aliens you have to hit just right or end up screwing yourself. But I can forgive its faults because the overall package was worth a couple of moments of frustration.\n\nPros\n- Unique blend of gameplay\n- Clean and bright pixel art and color palette\n- Awesome retraux soundtrack\n- Cheap price\n\nCons\n- Short\n- Upgrade points can't be reassigned\n- Cheap hazards late in the game\n- Some of the ships are useless\n\nI'd love to see a sequel expand on this game's concepts!","March 26","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game uses both s*** and f*** very frequently and it stunned me when I first heard them.\n\nSuper Star Path has all of the aesthetics of a great mid-90's shooter: colorful, vibrant graphics; great music reminiscent of a by-gone era; solid vertical shooting; and a unique implementation of Bejewled style puzzle gameplay. Players scroll upwards, shooting everything in their path. But, there's a twist: wisely choosing which enemies to defeat to grant an optimal path is necessary. Essentially, defeating enemies of a common color results in a chain reaction, thus giving you more room to move. But, every enemy adjacent to the last defeated enemy will turn into a crystal, blocking your way. On top of this, each stage has three power-ups and three emeralds to collect. While this may sound tedious, unlimited lives and continues coupled with a great gameplay choice in allowing players to keep everything they've earned (even if they haven't completed the stage yet) make SSP a very balanced game.\n\nThere are a variety of ships to choose from, each granting the player different immunities and power specs (which can be upgraded as long as the power-ups are found.) Simply put, the game has great variety.\n\nBut. During gameplay your pilot will speak and comment on the action at hand. When I got hit at one point he exclaimed, "What the f*** was that?" Another time he said, "I'm too old for this s***" While this may seem dumb and inconsequential, it's completely unnecessary as he repeats it over and over (especially late game where the challenge increases.) No solid arcade shooter back in the day needed content like that to be good. It's abrasive and it clashes terribly with the colorful 16-bit aesthetic it boasts. I sorely implore the developers to patch those words out. Even if the pilot says the classic, "I'm too old for this" and cuts the word out, it would be fine. As it is though, I can't recommend this to everyone because of that content.\n\nSuper Star Path is a fantastic game to play that is limited terribly by the weirdest and most unnecessary inclusion of profanity I've ever seen in a game. Be aware of this when you buy it.","January 30","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/375120/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAn incredibly short sort of color-match puzzle on one hand and a SHMUP on the other. Whenever a boss is reached it's almost as if the puzzle section never existed because of how much of a reflex-incentive game it suddenly becomes. It's even mentioned on the Steam store page that it's short and that it's "more puzzle than SHMUP".\n\nThere's more control over the movement with a controller than there is using a keyboard. Can't rebind the controls but instead they only give you 3 keyboard control schemes and only 2 controller schemes. I've got more problems with the 2 controller schemes because all that they  use and switch around are (A) and (B) which does "Action" and "Cancel" with "Action" being the "Fire" button when in-game. For a game where you can shoot as fast as you press the button I always figured to put that on the left face button (X) but I don't even get a choice on that matter.\n\nThere are 5 missions represented by planets to freely choose from and one unlockable final mission after completing the 5. Each one can be completed in a couple of minutes without having to start over upon death. There's a how-to on how the puzzle works and it's a little harder to actually do properly when put into practice since you're constantly dealing with the auto-scrolling  and trying to stay alive so as not to be crushed by enemies that head toward the bottom of the screen. Once this puzzle section is over though and the boss fight comes then it suddenly becomes a bullet-hell-lite of sorts, almost as if the puzzle section just became irrelevant.\nAll of the bosses hardly vary from one another; their attacks are hardly different from one another aside from some very slight speed, angle, & visual changes and each boss always has one bullet spreading attack that's no different from what the previous boss does.\nIn the puzzle sections for every mission you're supposed to collect three highly limited ship upgrades that you can apply to whatever ship you have and collect these True-Ending-material Emeralds. Once you collect whatever collectibles you find you can die or finish the mission and they'd stay collected so even if you didn't grab all in one run you can go back to the mission and grab 'em. For each mission there are three Emeralds and three upgrades to grab.\nEnemies & such that are destroyed in missions drop currency that's only used for buying new & unlocked ships that have different effects and stats from one another. Ships are unlocked upon completion of already uncompleted missions. The upgrades can boost their stats to a specified max but there are more ships & stats than there are upgrades throughout the entire game so you're strongly encouraged to save them until you unlock the final and higher-in-stats ships.\n\nThere's not much replayability since all missions & bosses are practically similar to one another and it's a short game overall. After beating the base game you unlock a Boss Rush mode where you're pitted against all the bosses one at a time. Whatever ship you choose for that mode can only take one hit of damage but is highly buffed out everywhere else for quicker kills. After that there's really not much else to do with the game.\n\nApparently this game has 15 Steam cards even though it hardly takes around 2 hours to 100%. It's got a cool soundtrack and cool visuals but it seems so lacking even at $4. If you're good you can probably get a refund if you complete the entire game and keep the playtime under 2 hours.","May 24","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
