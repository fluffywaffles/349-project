It also might be the thing with the default settings for the netplay so I guess it's hard to say for me,\n- Performance -> when shooting smoke tends to make the gameplay stutter, which is very bad for the FPS game where you look for rather smooth gameplay,\n- Lack of diversity in weapons -> While you have ability to change terrain on which you play, there are only 3 weapons - Gun,Rifle and Mine... it lacks melee attack which is in every game of this genre,\n- Animation doesn't seem like matching between 3rd and 1st person mode while running,\n- UI needs some polish... It feels like it was pretty much template and it stayed that way, Feels kinda same with background screen being the sky with stars but no object where player can keep his eyes on, I feel like putting the big Ubergame text in the middle instead of lower left corner would make it look better,\n- Offline Documentation view for torque doesn't seem to work\n- default input settings seems to be strange, specifically : Throw button (alt g), 1st/3rd Person Switch mode (f3), no input settings for the weapons on numbers (even to you're able to change them by using "1","2","3")\n- using "3" (which I guess was supposed to be mine weapon?) at the start of the game instead of mine makes me see the assault rifle model weapon with ammo of 1/0 which I can't use. I guess I shouldn't be able even to do that. "0" makes me dequip any weapon I had\n- You could add FPS in general settings for the game (to make it easier to see if you have enough fps and not be troubled by using the hotkeys for the casual players to see if they're playing with smooth FPS\n\n\nAs a player I can't really recommend this game (at least yet), but as a Volunteer project I guess it's still pretty good stuff seeing that it's probably closer alpha rather than beta.","October 27, 2015","false","1.0"," 72 of 110 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","72","110","5","1"

As you play through the current deathmatch game mode you might reminisce about playing Goldeneye on your N64. This game does not need complex physics, in depth kit creation, and kill streak rewards to have fun. It just needs a machine gun, a pistol, and some explosives to take you back to the time before the big name publishers ruined the First Person Shooter genre with their money grubbing approach. You might ask yourself "What is the point?" This is a video game the point is to have fun. To kick back after work or school with your squad, and frag the night away, and this game achieves that. While testing the game for three hours my friends and I had a blast. The game was by far the most fun we have had since the days of minecraft.\n\nThe gameplay is good, but the best part of this game is the developer. Duion cares about his community. He made the game open source and put in a level editor, so that the community wouldn't be restricted to bland proprietary maps like in other FPS games like Call of Duty series. Developers like Duion is why I prefer indie games over games published by the bigger names like Activision, EA, and Ubisoft.\n\nIf you are looking for a new game that is a change of pace from the typical gaming experience, or you are looking for a game to play with you squad either online or at LAN parties I highly recommend this game. If you stick with it through the bugs, and the occasional crashes. I promise it will be more fun than you would ever imagine.\n","October 29, 2015","true","48.9"," 35 of 54 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","35","54","9","3"

I played for maybe 10 minutes and i like it a lot.\n\nWhat I didnt like: This list is a lot longer, when I played for the brief time I instantly noticed how snappy the controls are. The looking is so quick you can turn around just by barely moving your mouse. The editor is also hard to use. Maybe a I'm just dumb but it felt really complicated without any instructions (by the way, there was no tutorial).\n\nVerdict: Buy this game and try it out, maybe it'll get worked on and reach its full potential and no longer be free. Who knows? As of now this game is bad but has some very promising outlooks if the developers stick with it and help the players along with learning the controls.","October 26, 2015","false","0.1"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","28","51","4","2"

The game is brand new on Steam, it's still in its early stages, and of course there is not yet a dedicated fanbase; all to be expected.\n\nYes, the game right now is poorly optimized, and there is little content; such is to be expected with such a new game. Think of it like a child: new and developing, weak and defenseless. You wouldn't so harshly critizize a child before it utters its first word; the same mentality applies here.\n\nOverall, the game has no original concept, but it might be a good foundation for community modding and such, and it has potential like any other early title. All I'm saying is, before posting positive or negative reviews, give it time to grow. As for those looking for a quick shoot 'em up, I'd recommend looking elsewhere until a few months later, unless you're a "have to see it for myself" type of person.\n\n~ For those Unturned, Noblesse Oblige ~\n-D.H.","October 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Like normal with my reviews, i'll score stuff 1 - 10\n\nGraphics: 7/10: The game looks nice, and I can run it at a smooth 100 FPS with my GTX 970 and i5-4460, animations are smooth, but there's alot of grey. no color variance on the one map I played for about 10 minutes before I crashed to desktop.\n\nGameplay: 5/10: There's considerable latency between pushing Mouse 1, and an acutal trigger pull, I don't know if there's considerable latency in actual Ping, or what. But movement was fluid, though I could not crouch jump out of windows like I am used to in games like Gmod and such. Needs more guns though, but Open Source stuff gets more weapons as people create them, so I'm not too worried about that. It play's better than CoD or BF, that's for sure.\n\nSound: 5.5/10: There's no real oomph to any gunfire, but that's fine, and there's no combat music either, but Early Alpha project.\n\nStability: 3/10: I played for about 10 minutes before I crashed, I don't know what caused me to crash, but I did.\n\nMap Editor: ?/10: Have not touched the Map Editor yet.\n\nOverall: Reccomended: I'd say as the game gets more developed, and people start to notice it, it will become better, just give it time and play it off and on so it gets a bigger following!","October 27, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Its way better then @Leafyishere's channel because he is just a cyberbully and I hate cyberbullies so I really like this game because it allows me to express my feelings about cyberbullying and about pacifistism. You may say "WHAT HOW, YOU HAVE TO KILL PEOPLE THOUGH!" and I say yeah but its not real and its not a big issue like cyberbullying. I recommend this game to all the H3H3 peoples even though I dislike him too. This is a very good game and im thinking of recording it on my youtube channel which is Monkeyking0313. There I talk about minecraft and I play free to play games and im thinking of featuring this one in my free to play Friday series. This is a amazingly amazing game and I really hope that other people feel the same way about it. I don't understand why when I start up the game and I click join and its always says 0/16 players it makes me feel super depressed that nobody else plays this game. This game is the "ghetto counterstrike" as some idiots would say but I think its the mlg counterstrike, battlefield, call of duty=Baby. Here are some of my concerns:I feel that if a game were to gain popularity you would have to get a big youtuber to play it like my second channel the Hungryman11. My second concern is that this game should really go more into depth about Pewdiepie, memes, and Germany; You may think that those are  strange topics but think of it this way; If your game says Pewdiepie on the title people will click it because he is a YouTuber. You would also go into the memes because memes are funny. I also said Germany because Germans are very good engineers so it makes sense that they will engineer your game and make it better. My friend said "No, no you gotta write more." I asked "Why" and he stated "Because." so im going to speed type now because I wanna get this review done I think this game has a posititve impact on others and on Gaben himself. People may question and scream at this review but I think they just have never read a long review before. I want this game to blossom into something amazing maybe like minecraft 2? I don't know how you will get the permission from Microsoft to be able to use minecraft but I believe in you guys. I just wanna thank the academy and also my mom for letting me stay up past my bedtime so I can write this review. I hope that you guys actually read this whole entire review because if you dont I will be really upset. Now a few words from my cat tdggbabj,zq3bgtz.d,fkbht4rihltb7d8kf. There you go and I wanna say that if you read up to this point I hope you are a girl because I need a girlfriend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustTrev/recommended/391780/","JustTrev","To Much Pot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustTrev/","62 products in account","So I think a lot was missed during my first initial review and so I decided to go through a second time with this not so harsh.  I really enjoyed the time spending on a map which by the way all of the maps are very "decent" but looking at the map list, shows a ton of them.. I would have stuck with a few maps and worked on them a bit more as far as adding more obsticles or choke points instead of just open planes all over the place.   "But Blooded Cyborg, all you do is camp!"  While that may be true but it gives the level more diversity to explore other areas of a map with more dynamics.  Though sometimes emptyness can be a good thing as far as how a match starts to pan out.\n\nSecondly ther isn't any options for game modes making it very boring to keep playing the same match style over and over again.  A lot of the good developers usually tend to focus on pure mechanics of a game. (How does one even begin to capture flag, or even a simple TDM?)  There are very good examples from early 2000 that I am not going to mention.  So think about game mechanics at this point forward then worry about driving your graphic development further afterwards.  Also add in reasonable achivements or goals, this also adds more replay value to your game.\n\nOverall the texture colors are very vivid and the texture resolutions are pretty standard in terms of no more than exceeding 512x512 resolution base, and the textures are using the mostly used effect known as POM.  Which is a combination of heighmap and bump textures. Fairly used in a lot of commercial AAA titles such as Crysis 3 and etc.\n\nFor the fact that only 1 developer has been working on this, *Clap* there is not going to be a certified list of compatible GPU's or CPU's that will be able to run it.. Not even in your Honda.. No.\n\nMe using a GTX970 with an i5 4440 and 8 GB of So-Dimm memory is enough to run this instantly like   melting a block of ice-cream in the oven. So the game isn't really demanding in terms of graphics.  I would bet a 2nd gen i3 should have no problem running this all by itself.\n\nSo I know this is a long review but I think we all get the point that right now this does have a long way to go and the more time is spent working on this the better it will get.\n\nNew: Play through: https://youtu.be/4xY_iAvSsQc\n\n\nOld quick play/review of the game:   https://youtu.be/ZfuxA0xz4Pw","October 26, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","16"

However, the most detrimental thing currently is how it feels like it is closer to alpha rather than  a beta. With enough development in polish, this could be a really fun game, because people love hosing custom matches with unique maps, etc. There are only 3 weapons, iffy animations, and an unpolished UI. I, personally, would much rather have come across this game as Early Access, but I will still keep an eye on its development. This could be a really cool game if the devs continue to put effort into it. I will still mark that I recommend this game because it is a cool concept and I support it, with hopes it will further develop into a more complete experience.","November 14, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There isn't much content weapon-wise(and maps ar kinda plain), but that is understandable when it's being made by one guy.\n2. There is almost no playerbase. It's really sad, to be honest.\n3. The graphics are... ok.\n4. Awkward controls, but you can edit the controls\n\nEven with those cons, there are at least some pros:\n1. It's actually free, no pay to win.\n2. Open source\n3. Has a built in level editor\n4. Levels are expansive (take that how you wish), but that would be nice if there were more players.\n5. animations are smoooth-ish, and the mechanics work well.\n\nI would reccomend this game if you like free, and you like to play with a few friends at the same time. otherwise, this game has no playerbase whasoever.","March 7","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Given that fact my opinion on the whole game is pretty mixed at this point because of how "MEH" this game feels. I say this game is "Meh" because when I played the game I did the options to max settings to see if I could run the game at those settings. I was suprised to find that the game ran actually pretty horrible for me frame rate wise at 20-30 frames per second and when ever I fired my gun the frame rate dropped by 10 frames. So I changed my settings to Open GL, no V-Sync and the lowest possible graphics settings. Still, I got a pretty low frame rate and even some missing textures. I even went on a server and the game froze and crashed after one minute. I don't know why I can't run it that well because I can run The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim fine.\n\nIt's an okay game and I would say give it a chance if you are interested in it like I was.\n\nBut go in it knowing that:\n\n1. The game is pretty much dead and nobody plays it.\n\n2. This game needs a lot of work for it to go from just an okay game to a good game. Maybe soon when the Developer keeps updating the game it will turn out to be good but for now it's just an okay game.\n\nAlso a tip for starting the game: Bring friends!","May 20","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
