It has everything you need and want. Lots of interesting mechanics? Check. Level editor? Check. Difficulty? Check. Beautiful backgrounds? Check. Awesome music? Check. Post-game mode? Check.\nThis is a game.\nThis is the game.\nThis is ZeGame.","May 27","true","71.3"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","21","23","9","2"

I had a lot of fun playing ZeGame.  btw, the name alone is a reason for itself to play ZeGame :P","May 27","true","12.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It starts easy, but quickly becomes challenging as you progress through the 160 main levels and unlock new cube types to enhance variability.\n\nBasically, you have to move your cube(s) from point A to point B in a 3D environment. Thing is, the cube moves all the way in a given direction until it's forced to stop. If you send it to nothingness, you might lose the level.\n\nThere are many different types of cubes, like solid blocks, doors and switches to open and close doors, teleporters, death cubes, and duplicators. So, as you progress you'll be faced with new challenges.\n\n160 levels is not enough? Don't worry! There's a lot of community-made levels, and they're really nice (and sometimes extremely challenging) to play. You can also create your own levels and share it with everyone else.\n\nOn the side, you also get a nice soundtrack to listen to while you're playing. Still want more? Ok, have some cards and achievements? What else can I say? It's really cheap, especially if you consider how much content you get.\n\nTotally recommended!","May 28","true","30.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The simplicity of design is pleasing to the eye, while the music soothes your brain... Having lulled you into a calm and happy place, it will then make you rage!  After the rage comes the euphoric satisfaction of having beaten the increasingly sadistic, yet clever, level design.\n\nOnce you have conquered the game, you can turn your hand to creating your own devilishly challenging levels and sharing them with the community.\n\nIn short, it is everything you want in a puzzle game! BUY IT. :D\n\n\n","May 27","true","3.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

The concept is simple-yet-innovative, the controls are intuitive, and the design is soothing. When I first downloaded ZeGame, I only meant to play long enough to get a feel for the environment.  Several hours later, I was fully immersed in solving a particularly frustrating level.\n\nLevel progression is well thought out, introducing new concepts in each of the eight worlds, then gradually increasing difficulty as you progress through the world's twenty levels.  If you make it to the end of it, you are left feeling both triumphant and shell-shocked, and you probably don't care that you didn't achieve three stars on every level (there's a time component in the scoring!), or that you weren't able to complete all the levels without 'dying'.  Or you do care, and you're going to be in for quite a challenge.","May 27","true","22.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There are only two things I would change.\n\nFirstly, I would add the option to turn down the ripples graphical effect as this can get quite distracting. Secondly, I would make the teleporter blocks easier to distinguish between because they can get confusing. Maybe adding different shades of the same colour to sets of portals.\n\nDefinitely recommended for a (very) thoughtfully designed, graphically impressive and overall great puzzle game!","May 28","true","4.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Even though I'm not a big puzzle-gamer, I really enjoyed this game.\nI think the main thing for me is the aesthetics; the calm and soft music combined with the amazing visuals.

Some puzzles can be solved in just 10 seconds without thinking about it but there are levels where you are required to plan your way to finish.\nFor 4,99 € you are getting a great game with a level editor and in my opinion it's worth it.\n\nThis game is now one of my favourite puzzle games of all time and I would recomend it to anyone who likes a little challenge.","May 27","true","7.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Strong design, intuitive controls, smooth gameplay, surreal soundtrack, you name it. The puzzle difficulty is *just right*, so that you can play for hours on end without getting bored.\n\nI absolutely love the smoothness of the game's controls, and how easy it is to move around (once you get the hang of it). The backgrounds and audio are very relaxing, inviting you to move at your own pace. The design of the blocks is another plus, carrying just enough detail to look unique, yet not enough to ruin the minimalistic style.\n\nIf you like simple, intuitive, or innovative games, I'd strongly recomming trying out ZeGame.","May 27","true","2.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a very nice, simple but challenging game with world and level selections similar to games like Cut the Rope (where you have a world, then a selection of levels in the world). Currently there's 8 worlds, and if each world has 40 levels like world 1, then you've got 320 levels to break your brain in. There's also a level editor and downloader, in case that wasn't enough. You've got a 360 degree scope and you can move in 2D directions. The controls do take a bit of getting used to (as you sometimes think you can move in 3D but you can't) but it doesn't take too long.\n\nEssentially, you're a little green block and you have to absorb blue ones. Simple, right? It is, until the levels get quite challenging. There's your tl;dr.\n\nHighly recommended.","May 27","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
