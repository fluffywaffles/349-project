"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KinkyCyborg/recommended/362160/","KinkyCyborg","KinkyCyborg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KinkyCyborg/","5565 products in account","The developer of this game was kind enough to provide me a preview copy of the game and also encouraged me to play this game with my 9 year old daughter. At the time of the writing of this review we are about 4 hours into the game and we absolutely love it!\n\nThe tale being told throughout this game is rich and deep with a 'Bedtime Story' feel to it which quickly captivates an audience. I confess that at first I let my daughter take the lead while I watched over her shoulder but soon found myself getting caught up in the story and we were soon taking turns at the keyboard as the story continued to develop.\n\nWhile the game is mostly linear, with clear but gentle prods to keep you on track, you are still challenged to put on your thinking cap and utilize your problem solving skills. At one time I thought we were never going to find our way out of the Spirit World as the scope of it seemed endless but there was an extreme sense of satisfaction when we did!\n\nThe voice over work is fantastic. Hearing Sydney's talk instantly allowed my daughter to identify and relate to her character. While I knew that the developer's real life daughter had made that contribution to the game I was surprised to find even more voice over work from some of the NPCs which further added humor & diversity to the characters. This was a refreshing change that I have yet to see from many of the other RPGMaker titles that are out there.\n\nThe combat system is straight forward but my daughter learned the hard lesson of what happens when you don't save often as her first solo battle did not go well and we had to go back a fair bit and replay a good chunk. She now is in the habit of saving after every single significant gain or achievement. We have also settled on her doing the bulk of the exploring and NPC interaction while I handle the combat. I don't know if it is a bug, or a lesson in precision, but I find as your cycle through your party's combat actions that one misplaced keystroke can cause you to skip over a characters turn resulting in no action which can be costly in some of these battles which are tough! (currently battling the hordes of zombies!)\n\nIn having spoken with the developer and from I have seen in this game so far it is easy to tell that the time & effort put into the creation of this game was a real labor of love. It is good, clean, wholesome family fun that I would recommend to anyone, particularly to those with young children who love good stories. The price of the game is super reasonable and the bonding moments that it is creating for my daughter and I make it so much more valuable.\n\nMy daughter is standing here now, waiting patiently for me to finish the review so that we can continue our journey with Sydney & Snowball and see how the story ends.  :)\n\nI tip my hat to the developer! You have created something very special here. Thank you! We need more people just like you!\n\nBravo!  10/10","February 1","true","5.2"," 62 of 75 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","62","75","0","1"

Ultimately, as a work of art, it's worth checking out, but if all you're looking for is an RPG, I would suggest any of the Final Fantasy games on here before 13, for a little bit less expensive games, there's always a lot of RPG Maker games that boast length and have fairly conventional gameplay.\n\nNow the gamplay is somewhat bland to be entirely honest. It does use RPG Maker default assests, and that does make it's appearance a bit hard to stand out. Remember how I said not to get this if all you're looking for is an RPG? Well that's because you don't have a lot of freedom. Towns end up closing up for good sometimes after their part in the story is done, there's really nothing to buy, no real equipment or party choice or anything. It's actually very linear throughout the game. Another thing is all the fights are scripted. There are no random encounters... BUT, there is apparently a posibility of updates with optional areas and ways to fight when you like, therefore, if you take issue with this, keep in mind it might change anyway.\n\nThe real reason to play Sydney's World is for the writing. Now as this game has mostly RPG Maker assets, there are still a lot of interesting original characters and enemies. These characters are often drawn in different ways to express different tones, different personas each one has. Sydney is drawn all animé pretty with kitty ears to express her innocence, where Nilrem has a much more realistic and menacing form. This, I've found only emphasizes who the characters are, and that's important here. Before I get into that, however, let me bring up the subtle, subtext of the game as a whole. Throughout the game, you end up getting to read quotes from philosopher's and even the man who made the game himself. These were described by the developer as an attempt to answer the question, "Why?". Why do people do the things they do. In a game that was meant to appeal to children, it's very interesting to see human nature really analyzed like this. Is everything we do because we were predisposed to it? Well ultimately, whether you reject or accept it, it's up to you, but it also raises interesting points, including the bias that the scientific community faces.  It can be depressing of course. The best thing, however, is the character development. Each and all characters have their own purpose and their trials all serve as interesting allegories to life. Throughout the game, the king says many intelligent things, however he let his status go to his head and made dire mistakes. Kallell has personal struggles with his own anger, and has to face that his revenge on the elves for what happened in the past is not worth wasting the future. Nilrem explained early on, he does what he does, because there is nothing wrong with it. It makes you wonder what type of person he is. Is he "bad" or does he have the advantage of understanding humanity, knowing deep down that this is how everyone is. Nilrem can actually be argued as the most rational, because an objective "good" and "evil" don't really exist. As a young adult, I found the themes in this game very interesting and worthwhile. If you like this sort of thing, I would recommend playing through this. It starts off slow, sure, and predictably, but by the end it can be mind-blowing. When it all came together, my expectations were surpassed.\n\nTo sum it all up, Sydney's World was a unique adventure, full of literary themes. It's a very artistic game. If you are looking for something a bit profound, even touching in a family way, there's a good chance you'll appreciate this.","February 11","true","11.9"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

To make this game developer used RPGmaker, anyway this game looks very good and have a potential.\nThe story same like a other similar games,  but enough interesting. The game is mostly linear, but still can be enjoyable,challenging and bring for you some good hours.  The cutscenes and art looks very nice. The biggest feature in a game i think its a music and the voices. Music is nice, and yes this game have voice to! Not all character got this, but this feature still a bit unusual for this game style. This is nice refresh for this game genre.\nAlso the other interesting feature of this game is a family friendly style. In this game you don't found a blood or any thing what can damage a children emotional world, so this game can play even a little child's.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+new bright in this game genre\n+family friendly\n+nice voices and music\n+nice art\n+steam trading cards\n\n-no steam achievements\n\nSo i think this game is enough interesting, bringing the new bright to this game genre.

I don't improve my skills or raise my level and I haven't been able to find new equipment so it seems there is no inventory management or traits/abilities/skill point.\n\nThe game is very linear and there's no side-quest, but it's well written and its story seems long enough to give you some hours of entertainment.\n\nMusic ans sound are quite good. Sydney and villains are very well voice-acted. This fact surprise me in a positive way because i've never heard voices in a game of this kind.\n\nAlso the other interesting feature of this game is its family friendly style. There is no blood or violence, there are combats and battles but they dont'show anything so it's a good to choice to introduce young players in RPGs.\n\nThe game has no achievements but drops five trading cards.\n\nGood choice if you like Japanese style role games\n\nPS: Thanks to Shade00","March 14","true","6.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/recommended/362160/","Loganesquire","*Logan*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/","59 products in account","This is an experience. This is not just a game.\n\nSydney's World is an excellent turn-based, story-driven RPG that I highly recommend to everyone, young and old.\n\nThis is not your typical RPG Maker game; you need to come into this world understanding that there is an amazing story to be told here, and that this game is much more than a turn-based RPG.\nThat's not to say there is anything wrong with those kinds of RPGs, ( I personally love them), but before you buy this game you need to understand this is more about the story than fights.\n\nThe story revolves around a young girl out to save her father from an evil wizard from another world.\nThe flow of the game is very linear, but the locations you journey too and the people you meet are very unexpected and interesting. There are many twists and turns, and many different locations to explore, and this really held my interest.\nYou will meet many great characters in your journeys and you will grow fond of them.\nA strong and interesting story is certainly a highlight here.\n\nThe developer wants you to not worry about equipment such as weapons and items, so you don't really need too, but you certainly can.\nIt can be dangerous though, and I suggest saving very often and using multiple saves as the game suggests.\nYou never know what is around the corner.\nYou will find your typical Elixers and Revive Potions, but there is no buying or selling, or upgrading equipment in this game. Most towns and castles can not be entered again either, which I found rather unusual.\nIf you missed anything, that's too bad.\nDue to a lack of random battles, you can not grind for experience, though there are a few places where there are a lot of enemies.\nThis game is not about that.\n\nI found this game to have excellent music and sound effects, and the graphics were bright, colorful, creative, and interesting.\nThere is some very nice artwork here that introduce you to new areas or situations, and there are very well made enemies and bosses.\nSydney and some other characters speak, and other characters don't.\nThis may be the first RPG Maker game I've played that had spoken dialogue.\nHowever, as with most games where there is spoken dialogue, you may find yourself skipping the voices because you read the text long before the character says it. I found myself doing this eventually.\n\nI personally found the lack of battles and opportunities to power my team up for boss battles dissapointing.\nThis IS an RPG maker game at heart, and heavily reducing the core part of the game felt strange to me.\nHowever, if your conservative with your items, and experienced in RPGs, you won't have too much trouble.\nAs I said though, you need to come into this game with different expectations.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game, I had a great time and I'm sure you will too.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a key by the developer for review purposes.This did NOT influence my review in any way.","April 6","true","15.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

As soon as you begin Sydney's World, if it doesn't bring a Smile to your face, then something is wrong. The way Sydney says her Lines is very Precious\nindeed. XD\n\nAll of the Menu's are Hand Made, even the Cut-scenes. Character Pictures, Profiles, and a ton of the Sprites to, so you can tell a lot of love and care was put into this game. It's not like a ton of the other RPG Maker Games that have Flooded Steam where there is all Generic things in them. These are people that have really put a lot of love behind their Game.\n\nEven the Names of the Items made me laugh, but in a good way. There truly needs to be more games like this on Steam. This is how RPG Maker Games should be done.\n\nIt's also Educational as it has been Stated before. Check everywhere when you get the chance because you have no ideal what you'll find. There's References to People that have Shaped our World to what it is today from Emotions, History, Life in General. Even the people Teach Important Life Lessons to.\n\nI hope one day to play this with my Great Niece who also has a Speech Impediment because i know she'll truly love it. I can tell that Families will have tons of fun playing it together. :)\n\nVoice Acting is very Spot On and Professionally done as well. The Voice Actors really Fit the Characters. I can tell you all right now that even if you have no Children to Share this Game with, you will enjoy it, Especially if your looking for a Lighthearted RPG. We have to many Flooding the Markets these days that are all about Gore and other things. Gone are the days it seems for RPGs like this. This Game is a Breath of Fresh Air among the RPG World.\n\nThe Music in the game fits the mood at the Given Situations. Weather it's a Dungeon or a Town, Etc., it fits the mood.\n\nCombat isn't that hard either. It's very fun as well. The Monsters don't look bad either. XD In-fact, some look funny while others look like Real Life Animals that you would see in the World. Others, well,\nlet's just say they would Scare some people. Monster Sprites are even Hand Done as well, so that's another Plus for this Game.\n\nI will admit that with the Maps and Sprites, some do seem out of place at times, but other times they're not. Mostly the Sprites fit the Area and Screen. Some can be Off putting to some though, but it shouldn't be to bad to make the game Unenjoyable.\n\nThe Emotions you will feel playing this game will range from happy, sad, warm fuzzies, and things like that. <3 It truly is Wonderful and it is great.\n\nPyramids are evil BTW. EVIL I SAY!!! PURE EVIL!\n\nSydney is as I already Stated beyond Precious in this Game. If you don't Fall In Love with Her and Her Banter with the other Characters then there is something wrong with you. For parents and Adults alike,\nI truly Recommend this Game Highly to everyone. Sure, it has it's Problems, but they're to far and few in-between to really be a bother.\n\nThis Game has Easily become One of my Favorite Games of All Time and is One Of my Top as well as my Favorite RPG Maker Game of All Time as well. It's going to take a lot to Beat this One. If you all think you know one that can, tell me the Name of it and I will Check it out.\n\nAlso, Remember to Save Often. You'll thank me for it later on. LOL\n\nJust remember this. Use your head and think if you get Stuck. Usually the most Problematic thing can be Solved if you use your head. :) Just take a Deep Breath and do that. Also, my First Favorite Game here of all time I will leave this Review with a Quote from it that will help you all out like it did me for a Few Years now.\n\n\nNothing is impossible. -Marquis De Hoto","February 1","true","19.4"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","13","26","2","3"

Really have to say the game did something that not many rpg maker games dared to do. Take several styles of art from cutscenes to gameplay areas woven around and makes a believable world come to life.\n\nWhile there are no random encounters there are set enemies that drop much needed items when defeated. Which really is helpful considering needed for the several boss battles. By the time i've completed the game i had twice as many revive items as elixirs.\n\nThough what helped in item management besides healing spells. is the encouragement of using buff and debuff abilites in battles. Simple but very effective in this family friendly rpg No complex mechanics that have been lately in today's RPG's. It's nice to go back to a simple time. Reminds me a lot of the SNES/Genesis RPG's Era.\n\nFor one the game encourages exporation and rewards with interacting with characters as well as learning a lot from the world from reading the books. It is worth the $4.99 price tag. You can tell that a game made with rpg maker done right is how the developer put into the game.\n\n\n\n","February 3","true","12.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

One walks about like they would in an RPG and then the story is the main goal of exploration.  Battle is more intellectual like a puzzle, as there are very few ways to level up and no item management to worry about.  There is no grind!  It's quite refreshing wandering on to the next event at your own pace.  If you lose a battle, it's about strategy and not preparation.   It ends up more like a string of boss fights with very few minions.  It makes the gameplay quick, so you can spend most of your time enjoying the story.\n\nThe music is wonderful, with many scenes having their own themes and ambiance.  The quality is top notch, with Korg styled Chiptune tracks evoking feelings of nostalgia for good ol' days.  Dungeons thunder with warm synth base lines.  Fields come to life with exciting marches.  Villages feel welcoming and fun.  Bosses brawl to dangerous soundtracks.\n\nThe pastiche of mixed media in the game is contemporary and international in scope.  One will come across styles of Japanese manga, American comic book art, Impressionist cutscenes, 3D renders, & all sorts of artists making it possible.  It clashes like a home-made quilt sewn by hand over generations.  There's something very beautiful about it all coming together through RPG Maker.\n\nThe story is a Child's Epic.  That word, "Epic" gets thrown around a lot these days, but "Sydney's World" truly is written in the style of a great Fantasy.  There is a living, breathing world here!  There is a History contained in the many books and libraries along the way that make the present world feel realistic.  Themes of Love, Hope, Trust, Valour, Virtue, & Truth shine with intention throughout the narrative.  Sydney never gives up.  She is a true heroine for the age.  The Royal party embodies honour and Chivalry in a time when all seems lost.  These themes are not like an average children's book.  This is more like "The Hobbit" & Tolkien's incredible ability to write without allegory through applicability for the sake of creating a neutral story for all ages.\n\nThere is no staunch teaching here.  The game is focused on allowing the child to read along with Sydney.    The material is all age approrpiate.  This doesn't mean that the story is without thrills, comedy or drama:  there is lot's of that!  Often I would laugh out loud or even tear up a bit.\n\nAs a bitter 34 year old gamer who's played every RPG possible, often not finding them engaging as my childhood favourites, getting an emotional reation out of me is very difficult.  I am in chronic pain.\nThe writing in Sydney's World is powerful enough to take me out of the real world enough that I love the story and forget how much pain I'm in.  I cannot give a much higher endorsement.\n\nSydney is amazing!  The last time I felt this was was about Rydia in "Final Fantasy IV."  They are both so brave and honest.  Faithful to their quests, they are wonderful heroes for kids... and I guess even me.  Sydney will make you want to be a better person.  Her Dad's advice is directly applicable to many problems we all face every day.  The philosophers write the other books scattered about and take the reading level higher.  Later in the game, hidden tomes have college level material that connects all the mysteries of Sydney's World.  The lore is more akin to that of a MMORPG, with many pages to study.  It's quite interesting how the alternate world formed.  It's hard to believe that this much work and care went into the story.  This isn't normal.  This is years of imagination coming to fruition;, a Dad's dream for his daughter, a story for us all.\n\nI feel lucky to have helped work in the last months with some of the art.\nMy work pales in comparisson to all the wonderous work my fellow artists have accomplished.\nMost of my art in game is Parallax Backgrounds.  I also drew the puppy!  Hehehehe.\nThank you for a life changing experience.  I am a huge fan as well as a artist on the project.\nUnderstand that I am biased, but honest.  It wasn't hard to enjoy Sydney's World.  It was an honour.\n\nSydney's World is about discovery in times of crisis, keeping your chin up and putting on a smile, facing the trials of life and prevailing despite all odds.  It is truly an inspiration and great fun.","February 1","true","6.6"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

Sydney and Snowball try to find her Dad, but that mission is difficult for them and the storyline comes with some twists.\n\nAn easy jrpg for young children, but maybe too easy for older kids and adults.\nThis game contains cute drawn pictures, philosophers quotes, and helpful instructions for good manners. The game is very linear and mainly story based. There is no big micromanagement with equipment and level ups. So it's not possible to do big mistakes.\n\nIf you have children and you want a happy little family friendly jrpg with full of humor to begin, then you gonna have much fun with Sydney's world. But if you are an advanced player, who wants a demanding game, then you better stay away.","May 4","true","5.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
