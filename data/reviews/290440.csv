If an enemy gets too close or shoots, it hurts you...\n\n\nABOUT THOSE COMPLAINING MONSTERS DON'T DIE\nThey die from a single snipe with one of the head parts... a suck-in from some fins... waves correctly placed... basically anything done CORRECTLY works, really, yea, just one shot, now go and stretch that net.\n","November 29, 2014","true","6.5"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","0"

Your bombs are affected by your surrounding, which are in turn, affected by your bombs, your movements, and the enemies' movements. This surrounding of yours is very important because it will affect everyone's movement. You can drop absorbtion bombs which will compress the surroundings, dragging everything, bombs, enemies (and you!) into it like a black hole. You can even absorb them to yourself, (be careful of letting them touch your head! Your hitbox is in your head) causing them to follow you in a line and crushing each other. Spin around in a circle, and your enemy will ball up and crush each other to death (or be crushed by the surroundings)\n\nIt's hard to explain. I found this game fun because there's a slight tactic to it. Simply placing bombs at the enemy's location might not work, and you would have exploit the enemy's patterns and your own abilities to be able to blow it up. You can also do the tactic above, carefully compressing the space in the surrounding and forcing the enemy to be squished by the web or by each other.\n\nWell, I liked this game and would recommend it for anyone who wants to try something new\n\nOh, and by the way\nGood luck on bullet hells. It's a Japanese game, of course your enemies will be firing at you from everywhere","April 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

Attention: Qualia 3 is not a shoot em up nor is there any semblance of or association with the classic shump genre.  An outright hoax to appeal to and lure shump fans.\n\nTedius game-play has you placing explosives with a customizable ship in a quasi wire-frame wave based arena.  Conceptually, the bomb induced wire-frame waves damage and will ultimately destroy the evil denizens which in turn drop the currency utilized by the customization system.   The ship customization options cost mucho dinero but you'll un-install Qualia before you customize anything.\n\nThe presentation is rendered in a 1024x768 window or full screen in the same non customizable resolution making windowed play optimal solely for crisper 1024x768 visuals.  For what it is worth Qualia does offer Steam integration, offering achievements and cloud based saving.\n\nUnless you have a desire to watch a wave based wire-frame, Qualia wallows in tedium.

Q3 has the same wavey background but that is where it ends with the similarity. The Sh'mup genre does not fit this game, as there is no real shooting envolved. A better genre for this one would be, Arena Blow'mup and also has some mele and strategy traits. The strategy to this creates a challenging game with challenging bosses and once you get the idea of how the physics of the "wavey" background interacts with the weapons, enemies and player this is where the fun gets started. Combined with the multitude of upgrades will have you playing "just one more time" over and over.

I think most people come to it expecting a fast-paced arena shooter and it's not. It's something a bit different, albeit at quite a slow pace. I think it could do with shorter levels, but on the whole I think it's a pretty cool idea.\n\nDon't come into it expecting Geometry Wars because it's nothing like it.

It's cheaper and the graphics are better.\n\nGameplay itself is like playing in a fishtank filled with a vicous oil - slow, unresponsive and yawnsome.

After spending as much time as I could stand with Qualia 3, I have to ask, who is this for?\n\nSomewhere in the deepest darkest part of the ocean, something really boring and annoying is happening. You're some sort of microscopic organism, and you have to destroy amoebas with bombs. Actually strike that, you don't destroy them with the actual explosions, you uh..smash(?) them with the ripple effect? It's like some interactive visual simulator, but it's also a game. You have a health meter, you can die, and most of the achievements involve taking no damage or finishing stages quickly.\n\nI'm going to lay out what your experience with this game is going to be like. You'll play the first stage, you'll have this look on your face like you just saw a horrific car accident. The cause of the accident was a drunk cat. Do you ask yourself  "Why was a cat driving a car?" or "Why was it drunk?" Before long the questions pile up:\n"Who gave a cat a drivers license?"\n"Was the cat at a bar?"\n"Which bar?"\n"How are the drinks?"\n"Any attractive women?"\n\nAnd then you complete stage 1. No really, I think the purpose of that stage was to wander in circles while trying to ineffectively destroy amoebas with the ripple effect...or???? Nothing seems to make sense but it doesn't matter, because you beat the first stage. You're on the winning road.\n\nFor completing trophies you're rewarded with cash. This is where most of your money is going to come from, so spend it wisely. One of the weapons you're given at first is the ability to absorb ripples. I guess this is supposed to improve the ripples of the bombs you place. Wouldn't it be better to simply have more explosions? So you buy the upgrade that spreads a bunch of bombs over a small area. This proves to be effective in stage 2. You're clearing those amoeba far more quickly than before.\n\nBut then you reach the stage 2 boss, and...that's it. The game is over, pack it up, throw it out the window. Why? Unless you've actually managed to figure out the mystery of the ripples, you'll spend the boss fight doing next to no damage. You'll place bombs like a nutty peanut, create a ton of ripples, but nothing will happen. I looked on youtube for some strats. Sure enough there's a guy that actually speedruns this game. He uses a weapon that creates ripple WAVES. He presses a button and the ripples smash entire lines of amoeba with ease. This thing is 10,000 times more effective than fiddling with bombs. Unfortunately it's really dang expensive. With enough grinding and a few more trophies you could probably afford that weapon, and go on to complete the game.\n\nOr you'll just play something else, something that's actually enjoyable within seconds of pressing the start button instead of not at all. Qualia 3 is an enigma. Who does this appeal to? Is there more to it? Why is it so obtuse? You can be like me and allow the questions to form a mountain, a mountain that eventually crushes your skull. You could also be unlike me and not bother with this game in the first place.","November 12, 2014","false","0.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","9","17","3","0"

With bigger groups it has a decent challenge but when the group is cut down to 3-5 individuals it takes to long to kill. You place the bombs on them directly, on the side or just spam them with bombs or carefully place a bomb on them and they wont die. Takes 3 to 5 trys to kill one in a small group. It kills the paceing of the game for an action game. And I swear they have some sort of short invincibility time after they get hit because of this.\nI dont like the fact that it advertises itself as a shoot em up as the only way to attack is to place bombs everywhere. It's interesting and the only problem I have with it is what I said as above and that placeing bombs dosnt count as a shootemup but you do get shot at.\nI wish this game came with a tutorial because as I said above, you can place bombs on enemys and it wont do a thing when theres a few left. Because of this I didnt know if I was playing it right or not.\nAlso with small groups not getting hurt the same thing applies to 2 bosses I have encountered but worse. They seem to be invincible at times not getting hurt at all only for you to do a small amount of damage. If theres an opening for when your supposed to hurt it I dont know what it is plus I wait 3 or 5 seconds before I spam it with bombs for a good 10 seconds\nNote: The bombs themselves dont kill them its the waves and ripples the bombs make. If you do get this game I find the minibombs to be the worse one to use. Still find it hard to kill them.\n\nGOOD:\nOne thing I do like about this game is the risk reward it has. The power orbs which play as money lay on the screen disappear when you get hit once and the power orbs can increase in value when they gather into one big orb.\nAnother thing I sorta like about this game is that you can make waves with the bombs to try and push them towards enemys,speed up or slow you down.\nThe designs of the player character and the bosses are cool but the main enemys look like cereal.\n\nIn the end if you love these kinds of games and have more patience with trying to kill a couple of enemys that wont die untill the 3rd bombing attempt youll find some enjoyment with this game. I dont really like it but I might play an hour of it per month or just try to see all the levels then be done with it. Not a bad game but not a good one also as I see it. In the end I have to give it a no that I dont like this game. What really kills it for me is that it takes forever to kill a single guy and that takes up to much time for an action game. Fix that and ill just give this a pass. Mabye its just im more used to bullet hell games.","April 18, 2014","false","2.5"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","4"
