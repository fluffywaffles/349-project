In the beginning, you still get some of the "run to the yellow pointer" moments, but you can also take on various side-quests from NPCs to either find something or kill a monster. And once the game gets going, depending on what gates you open, you can have your choice of next destination. And you can take a break on minigame quizzes, chocobo racing, or slot machines if you feel inclined to do so.\n\nThe one complaint I personally have is compared to FFXIII's story (personally I loved it), FFXIII-2 falls a bit short. The time travel trope makes it feel a bit cliché, and I found Noel to be quite boring in terms of personality and back story. Personal opinion, but even if the story isn't your thing, the game is a lot of fun.\n\nIn combat, the ATB gauge and paradigm shifts are back so that will feel familiar. But with only two protagonists, the third slot is filled by monsters you tame. With all the tameable monsters out there, you can really customize your party to your needs, and you have to level your monsters up as well. I was a bit annoyed that neither Serah or Noel learned Faith/Bravery/Haste as Synergists so you have to rely completely on monsters to buff you on that front.\n\nAs for the PC port, the keyboard can be a little awkward with the more complicated constellation puzzles, when the camera gets a little wonky, but it's still possible, if not, frustrating. I've also had the game just close on me once or twice (guessing my laptop was overworked when playing this game for an extended amount of time). Other than that, I have no issues. (Note the DLC doesn't unlock until you beat the story once.)\n\nBasically, the game is a load of fun even if the story fell short of expectations. The story isn't bad per se, but it wasn't great either. That said, the gameplay makes up for it. Still working on those final fragments.","January 10, 2015","true","71.0"," 163 of 179 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","163","179","8","4"

Is the port good? Does it provide graphics options like they promised? Well, people got ahead of themselves. They promised they'd patch FFXIII and release FFXIII-2 with resolutions options a couple of other things. Well, they did. We got resolution options, we got shadow resolution, we got AA, and we got jap audio at only half the size of the original. However, what remains is the multithreading issues and underperformance due to the game not making use of all the PC's power. Well, if I sit back with a gamepad the 30fps (since constant 60 fps is probably impossible for most PC builds) becomes tolerable, I suppose, it's still a pain. Graphically, it's an improvement over the first, but that comes with its own problems due to the optimization. Can't imagine playing without a controller, because the fps ain't as bad when looking from a greater distance (assuming you sit back further with a gamepad like me).\n\nLet's start with a comparison with FFXIII. You play as Serah, Lightning's sister who you never thought you'd want to play as, and probably still don't after going through this game. Yeah, the characters aren't any better this time around. At least it's less linear, yay! The best comparison for the jump from FFXIII to FFXIII-2 is to the jump between FFX and FFX-2. In FFX, they never gave you the airship to travel around until the last act of the game. In FFX-2 they give it to you right away so you can explore. Here it's much the same. Once you unlock a time period and its corresponding location, you can travel there anytime you like and those locations won't bog you down in a tight corridor nearly as much. Course it still has its fair share of linear paths, it's a FF game after all. Combat is a slightly  more polished, the animations feel for fluent and everything is a tad more responsive. Since Noel and Serah are the main 2 characters you'll ever control, the game allows you to train monsters you've obtained throughout battles to act as the third member of your party. It's actually better than you think since you're always on the lookout for better monsters that have good stats and also have good synergy with Noel and Serah in the respected Paradigms you've created. Last note for this section, the camera seems to control better. I had an issue where it would constantly drag to the left or right depending on the location and direction of movement, but that seems to have been resolved.\n\n-----\n\nThe game's side content consists of replaying areas and travelling to other timelines and areas to collect items or skills required to complete quests from other areas. Basically a fancy way of making you do slightly-more-interesting-than-the-average-fetch-quest type of quest. Sometimes, you'll have to reset entire timezones by "closing the gate" resetting all progress you've made (although quests and items collected will be kept). This is largely to repeat "Live Triggers." LT is essentially cutscenes where you'll be given prompts to ask or answer questions with 4 different choices. Each one gives you new dialogue and answering them all nets you a reward at the end of each mission depending on how many you answered and how you answered them. Hardly a deciding factor in convincing you to replay missions over and over however, they are required to collect fragments and for certain paradox endings. Fragments are basically the collectables, but also unlock more content and ahem, endings. Fragments are scattered everywhere and WILL require you to repeat areas and do quests to obtain all of them (160 in total). Wow this really sounds like FFX-2 right now, but IMO it's better. It feels like less of a chore and a grind because well, it's more interesting,\n\nNot the story though, the story just there, no magic happening here. Snow is still the same meathead, Hope is Hope but older and somehow less interesting (impossible, you might say). Noel is better than Tidus, oh wait, every male MC is better than Tidus, hehe not biased at all. Speaking of which, the game has 9 endings. The 8 other variations aside from the original require you to have done certain things throughout the game as well as having the Paradox Scope I believed it was called to change timelines or whatever. Each other ending is really just extra. But again, the gamer OCD all JRPGs tug on comes into play here. The ending of the DLC, Requiem of the Goddess, apparently contains the true ending, which really just sets up FFXIII-3/Lightning Returns with an extra scene. Speaking of which, there's DLC in here. Though it's mainly just outfits and the actual "story" ones are just really shorts battles and stuff.\n\n-------\n\nSO! Do you want to buy this game. Well, do you like FFXIII? Well, this one has improved gameplay and is less linear. It's also less of a grind, still is, but there's more lore to be uncovered and mini-stories to hear unlike the bland side content of the first game. Do the Live Triggers make this into a Dragon Age/Mass Effect game with lots of multiple outcomes and character relationship? Absoutely not.  Is everything so compelling you'll want to 100% the game? Maybe, maybe not, depends on your connection with the game and where it stands in your mind. Is all that DLC definitely something that adds more value? No, not really. Is this a bad game.......no, I would say it isn't. It is a competent game that learns from the mistakes of the first, keeps a bunch of other stuff the same, and doesn't do a lot of stuff worse. I'm not ashamed to say I enjoyed it, and I'll definitely recognize it as a game allowed to bear the FF name. It's far from terrible, just open up a little to it. If you're a gamer who believes FFVII and FFVIII are the greatest and the rest are terrible then this is not for you. If you enjoyed FFXIII then this is for you. If you're like me and have played multiple FF games and have understood this game isn't the "cream of the FF crop " but want to play a AAA JRPG (because wow, there aren't many on Steam), check it out. It's worth its price if you just let go of all that hate, and just play. You'll get mad, you might facepalm or SMH at some of the scenes, you might laugh because something is so stupid, but you'll hopefully have some good ol' fun.\n\nI Like This Game. It's A Good Time.","December 12, 2014","true","40.1"," 240 of 293 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","240","293","11","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/recommended/292140/","gamerlen","GamerLEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/","325 products in account","!!!-THIS IS IMPORTANT-!!!\n\nIf you buy this game, DISABLE STEAM CLOUD SAVES FOR IT! This game and the Steam Cloud don't get along, and it causes the game to occasionally crash when it tries to save. Here's the catch, the game autosaves frequently. This makes crashes more of an annoyance than anything, but also a lot more frequent.\n\nIf you download this game, make sure to disable Steam Cloud Saves before you play it otherwise it'll constantly ♥♥♥♥ up unless you do some deep down work in your game files and move your save file... or start over completely from scratch. Trust me, its worth doing, especially since some of the crashes will take Steam down with it.\n\nEDIT: I changed the save settings and played the game for a solid three hours. As of now I have not had any crashes at all. Trust me on this one guys, the save file thing will fix most of the technical issues here.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow then, as for the game itself. In my opinion, this game takes everything that FFXIII did wrong and fixes them. No more scrounging for bits to upgrade your weapons slower than molasses, no more endless tunnel for the first half of the game, the Crystal Talent Tree dealie is a lot easier to use and a lot more fun.\n\n\nImmediate Changes:\n\nGil and Weapons: Weapon upgrades are a thing of the past. You still collect bits, but the bits are used to make entirely new weapons at the shop rather than simply rubbing them all over your current ones. They're also a lot easier to come by. Also, all enemies drop Gil again as they should have done in FFXIII.\n\nOpen Endedness: In extremely stark contrast to FFXIII's endless corridor first half that got so many gamers up in arms, this time you play Serah and this boy from 700 years in the future named Noel as you go all throughout time and space to unravel the mystery of time paradoxes that are plauging Grand Pulse. You unlock new time periods and locations quickly throughout the game and it feels much more immersive than before.\n\nCrystalized Monsters: So... its just Serah and Noel for your party members, but how the hell does that work? Simple. Serah can crystalize and command monsters to fight for her. Remember those bits you'd gather off monsters? You use them to level up the guys you capture! Each monster is locked into a specific role (Cait Sith is always medic for example) but you can have three ready to fight alongside you at a time. In addition, each monster has their own Feral Link attack where you can use a special limit-break-esque trick with them in the middle of a fight.\n\nCostumes: Serah and Noel both start out with four costumes; their default outfits and three extra ones, and they unlock more as the game goes on (I assume, I'm not super-far yet). Still, makes it more interesting to look at thats for sure. Your little moogle companion, Mog, also gains about two dozen right from the get go. Want a little demon moogle? How about a cat? Perhaps a living sentient moogle plushie? Why not Zoidberg (give it time, it'll get modded in and you know it)?\n\n\nOutside of that, here's the basic rundown.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Game feels much more immersive and streamlined than before, also much more engaging right from the start (I went ahead and downloaded the song 'Etro's Champion' off iTunes after hearing it in the opening bits too, so the soundtrack is solid).\n- If you skipped FFXIII or never finished it then you can watch a 'Beginner's Guide' that tells the highlights of the FFXIII story and what happened through it. It's split up into chapters too so you can skip the bits you already saw if you like.\n- No more scraping together Gil for weapon upgrades. All the monsters drop money now and the weapons are sold pre-made, though you can save up bits and buy custom weapons with special effects (and reduced pricetags since you supplied the parts).\n- The Crystal Tree (Crystalium, Crystalum, Crystalvalium, whatever) is a lot easier to use now and takes a lot less grinding to get the most out of it.\n\n\nCONS:\n- BEWARE CRASHES! Like I said above, disable Steam Cloud Saves for this title. Trust me on this one, its not worth it. The game can and will crash AND burn and take Steam down with it nine times out of ten.\n- Graphics issues may be an issue for some. Personally I'm fine, no issues with framerate or anything, but I know that was a major issue with FFXIII. This game is gorgeous, but it'll make your graphics card sweat it's little electronic balls off.\n\n\nPotential Cons:\n- Combat system is more or less the same as FFXIII. If you didn't like it in that game, you won't like it here. Not an issue for me, but I know some people complained about the way combat worked in the last game.\n- Read the Beginner's Guide if you didn't play FFXIII. The game picks up three years after the ending of the last one, so if you didn't play it or didn't finish it (I don't blame you, I liked it but even I'll admit it dragged like hell for a while) then you'll be lost unless you do that.\n\n\nOverall:\nI honestly feel like this is the kind of game that FFXIII should have been. It takes what that game did right and improves on it, while fixing most if not all of the problems from it. If you have the money, give it a whirl. Even if you skipped FFXIII entirely it's worth trying.","December 16, 2015","true","13.0"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","61","66","7","0"

George Carlin is dead, so he's played by a Moogle. Spoilers: they screw it up so bad and it's hilarious to play through.\n\nThis game is basically what happens when you task a team who aren't convinced RPGs need to be a super-serious endeavor with making a time-travel themed game. There are tiny bookends of "serious story" because it's still a sequel to FFXIII, but this is a game where one character's fiancee has turned himself into a living weapon so he could jump in a wormhole to fight a massive tomato to a standstill for ??? years before you show up. IT AIN'T WAR & PEACE.\n\nMechanics-wise, it's improved damn near every facet of XIII, the battles feel more snappy and the strategy is tight, monster-breeding* is a neat way to handle the third character slot, and in sort of a drastic inverse of XIII, you're basically entirely freeform in how you approach the timeline in this game SAVE FOR ONE TERRIBLE, LINEAR CHAPTER. But that's like... one out of six. It'll be okay.\n\nI cannot recommend this enough. It's fun to play and I laughed at some of the utterly ludicrous ways they take the time travel conceit, especially in terms of sidequests, or the bonus chapters which were DLC on the console and come free here (involving Snow, Sazh, and Lightning, respectively). Buy this game and then just TRY to argue that it's not a parody by the time you're through. This is Chrono Trigger on LSD.\n\n* Technically you do not "breed" monsters so much as you "feed the ones you can't stand to your favorites to make them strong".","February 20, 2015","true","43.6"," 69 of 88 people (78%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","78","69","88","53","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","I'm convinced this game is a work of satire. The plot is so contrived you stop halfway and realize that Square is just ♥♥♥♥ing with you.\n\nHere's an example: there's a machine in the past that kills its creator and creates a future filled with robots. What caused it to kill its creators? Itself in the future corrupted the machine in the past to kill its creators. Why? Because if it didn't force the machine to kill its creators in the past it wouldn't exist in the future as the sole controller of the world. The Machine came from a future that didn't exist so that it could continue existing and create that future.\n\nSomeone wrote that and thought it wasn't ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and self-contradictory. The game deals with time-travel and 'paradoxes', and god damn does it ♥♥♥♥ on the time-travel concept with so much confusion it can only be considered a work of satire. There's also something about a girl who has a title passed down the ages, only that each girl who gets the title looks exactly the same as the previous one.\n\nHey, at least it explains why the protagonists at the end of FFXIII didn't turn to crystal after completing their focus. But holy ♥♥♥♥ does it fill the explenation (which is quite simple) with a ton of confusion.\n\nDumbass plot aside, the game is a huge step up from FFXIII. Sure, it obviously didn't have the same budget as FFXIII, which becomes REALLY obvious when you 'unlock' the same map over 4 times with minor alterations (dark, daytime, ♥♥♥♥ filter, ♥♥♥♥ filter but with red orbs around the map). Assets from the previous game are also reused, like Oerba village and a ton of music from the previous game. But even though this is essentially FFXIII 1.5 it still winds up being miles better and more enjoyable. Two reasons for that:\n\n1.) Exploration.\n\nThe Historia Crux is basically a glorified menu where you select what location to go to. When you go to a location, you'll have two tasks: find artefacts and fragments in the map and talk to people to take up tasks to receive artefacts and fragments. Each map has either 1 gate or more which are unlocked with artefacts, while fragments give you documents to read (if you dont care about the game world then tough ♥♥♥♥). Unlocking a gate unlocks another location to travel to in the Historia Crux. Here's the good thing, though: the artefact required to unlock that gate might not even be in that map. It might be in a different map which is unlocked in the story or through a gate in a different map.\n\nFor example. a woman wants to find her glasses, but its dark in the gameworld due to an eclipse so you won't be able to get them. You WILL be able to get her glasses when you unlock the alternate version of that map where an eclipse ISN'T occuring. Get her glasses there, then go back to where there's an eclipse and give her her glasses.\n\nIn the Historia Crux you'll see how many fragments are in each map and how many gates there are. So you'll be skipping from map to map to map collecting artefacts and fragments and going back to previous maps to fulfil requests. Dude wants some sort of PC equipment? You get it in some tech facility in a different map.\n\nIf it sounds like you'll have to keep up and make note of everything, don't. The best thing to do, really, is to take up requests when you can and just collect all fragments in a map, which come in boxes. Hell, I collected all fragments I could before finishing up chapter 5, and then proceeded to finish it and already had the fragments needed to proceed, which I didn't know I would need. If the idea of exploring maps for items and jumping from area to area is appealing, you'll love this.\n\n2.) Customization\n\nYour third party member is a monster, the same ones you fight in battle. After battle there's a chance you'll ''collect'' one of the monsters you killed. Once collected,  you level him up in the crystarium just as you would level up. It gets a little difficult levelling up monsters at later levels since the materials needed are scarcer, but not all monsters reach their peak that late. Some do so much earlier, and you can sacrifice them to pass on skills to other monsters. The customization and levelling in your third partner presents a level up system that is more in-depth than even the main cast.\n\nand that's about it. It's not hard to be a better game than FFXIII, and this game isn't outstanding since it really plays more like a side-game. Like a handheld title in a series that frequently appears on consoles. It's not the typical Final Fantasy experience in that its production values aren't as high. Like I said, this is like FFXIII 1.5.\n\nBut that's not a bad thing. The game manages to be an enjoyable modern day FF title and an all-around good waste of time. They should've fixed up the ridiculous plot and put the money they put into FFXIII into this one.","March 13, 2015","true","124.5"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","85","50","59","26","0"

The game is not linear, the combat system is (slightly) improved, and the game introduces multiple new systems and features, such as Paradigm Pack, traveling through different time periods, multiple unlockable endings, and throwing Moogles around to your heart's content.\nTraditional world map system is replaced with Historia Crux, a series of connected time gates you can use to access different areas and visit them in different time periods. While the game does re-use multiple areas, most of them feel relatively fresh thanks to visiting them in different time periods. Completionists might also be glad to hear that it is possible to close and reopen these time gates, which allows you to redo any part of the game again after finishing it, meaning that there's no missable content. I found the whole time travel thing a fairly solid system, kind of similar to what Chrono Trigger had.\nParadigm battle system is still around, but this time they have introduced some new mechanics, such as Paradigm Pack, which is a system that allows you to capture different monsters you encounter and use them as your third party member. It's kind of like Pokemon, and there's even a fragment that rewards you for catching them all. It is a nice addition to the game as it's adds an extra layer of customization to your party. One other improvement the combat system received was an ability to change your party leader during fights, which I very much welcomed. The difficulty of the game though, compared to FFXIII, was bit low for my taste, but this is partly redeemed by the Coliseum DLC (included with the PC version).\n\nThe story continues from where Final Fantasy XIII left, except that there's a twist, Lightning is gone. I won't spoil any plot detail,s but I'll give you a brief and vague synopsis of the beginning. If you don't care, feel free to skip this paragraph. The game starts when this guy called Noel (who is from the future) arrives to New Bodhum, meets Serah (Lightning's sister from the original game), and together they set to search Lightning through these time gates, which nobody really knows how they appeared in the first place. (Of course, all this gets explained later and my synopsis is terrible anyway). Of course, this is a Final Fantasy game, and naturally later down the road you find yourself trying to save the world from the villain, who, I must add, is one of the best villains Final Fantasy games have ever had. The story did feel very vague and not particularly interesting in my opinion during the first four chapters (which there is six), but it improves once you reach the fifth chapter.\n\nCharacterwise Serah and Noel are both decent enough main characters. I didn't find neither of them particularly interesting, but they did the job. At least Serah is, in my opinion, much better main character than Lighting was, whom I simply found incredibly dull. However, one character that really stands out is Caius Ballad, the main villain of the game. Once the story develops, it becomes evident that he actually has a very clear and understandable motive for what he is doing, and for a villain, he actually ends up being really likeable.\n\nI didn't personally like the soundtrack of the game very much, but stuff like this is very very subjective, and it seems that there is a great deal of people who really do enjoy it, so your opinion might vary. I'll just say that the game uses lots of vocal tracks, some of which I found actually pretty good, but they just didn't work as background music of a video game very well, in my opinion. Japanese ending song, Yakusoku no Basho, is really good though, and so probably is the English one as it's the same song with different arrangement and singer. One more thing I'd like to point out about the audio side of things is that I didn't really like the sound balance. The sound effects were too loud and background music bit too quiet for my preferences. This of course would not be a problem if the game had audio options, but sadly it doesn't.\n\nUnlike FFXIII, XIII-2 has tons of side quests and content you can do, most of which is quite good (damn it all those Oerba puzzles and Academia quizzes...). The PC version also comes with all the DLC (aside from few costumes). Coliseum DLC has series of very difficult battles against few classic Final Fantasy bosses (there's even Ultros!), which offers you a nice end game challenge after you have beaten the base game. Lightning's DLC is kind of a prologue to the sequel Lightning Returns, and then there's Sazh's DLC, which I sadly found to be a waste of time.\n\nOkay, a summary: Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a solid entry to Final Fantasy series. It has some flaws, but overall it's a good game. However, it's definitely not the best Final Fantasy out there, nor is it a good introduction to the series. If you are looking to get into Final Fantasy games and happened to see this in Steam, I'd recommend to start with, say, Final Fantasy IX, VII, or even V or VI first. Still, it's a good game, and I do recommend it if you like JRPGs in general and do want to give newer Final Fantasies a bash. The story is also relatively standalone, so you can play it even if you haven't played Final Fantasy XIII and don't feel like playing that first.\n\n\nOne more thing. I said nothing about the PC port because at this point probably everyone knows that it's, well, not very good, and there's tons of other reviews that do that already. If you do happen to for some obscure reason care what I have to say about it, you can check my Final Fantasy XIII review, where I rambled about it somewhat extensively. It's not the same game of course, but the port is almost identical, except that it somehow runs still bit worse than XIII did.","January 16, 2015","true","71.2"," 60 of 75 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","60","75","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/292140/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","We all know that the hugely popular Final Fantasy RPG series has had more than its fair share of games, but rarely do we witness direct sequels. As one of those rare games, Final Fantasy XIII-2 takes place directly after the events of Final Fantasy XIII; Lightning vanishes without a trace and only Serah can remember seeing Lightning, while the others believe she is dead.\n\nTrapped in Valhalla, a world where time does not flow, Lightning finds herself under attack by a mysterious warrior named Caius. Knowing the future is in danger, Lightning calls on Noel to find Serah and deliver a message that she must save the future. As the story progresses, Serah and Noel work together to travel through time to restore a broken timeline and determine Caius’s true intentions.\n\nMuch like every other Final Fantasy game, the storyline is vital to your enjoyment. Similar to Final Fantasy XIII, the sequel suffers from a problem with pacing: in the beginning, many players might get lost in the confusion of time travel and easily lose sight of what's actually occurring in the story. Fear not: this confusion is short-lived.\n\nOnce the game progresses further, it becomes clear that although the story is shorter than XIII — story completion clocks in at around 20 hours — it wasn’t rushed. 100% completion can take around 30-40 hours. Details and events begin to piece together revealing more about Serah and Noel’s world and various other characters. While it might take a while to warm up to most players, the story is incredibly well written with the slight caveat that the ending might not be what most expect. To avoid spoilers, it’s difficult to explain why this is the case; however, it should be known that there is advancement via DLC and another sequel, which we should see on Steam in the coming months.\n\nThroughout the game, you’ll only control Serah or Noel in terms of playable characters unlike the six different playable characters in its predecessor. To make up for this shortcoming, you now have the ability to tame the various monsters you battle throughout your adventure and have them fight alongside you. Up to three can be assigned to your party, but only one can be active in battle at a time.\n\nDifferent monsters have different roles and will level up differently. Even more advanced is the incredibly complicated infusion system where you can imbue the passive abilities and skills of one monster into another. These features make for a rich and compelling reason to not only fight monsters along the way but also add a higher level of strategy to battle. Oh, and you can also dress up your monsters with a plethora of different styles of decorations such as hats or tattoos. Of course.\n\nWhen it comes to leveling up Serah and Noel, the newly designed crystarium system is less straightforward than the previous title but offers a higher degree of control over your character's final stats. Instead of each role containing its own cluster of nodes, there's one giant cluster in which you can choose whichever role you want to level up at any time — as long as you have enough crystarium points, that is, which you earn from completing quests and killing monsters.\n\nIn the cluster, there are three types of nodes: small, large and ability. The large nodes will give stat bonuses depending on which role you happen to level up on that node. For example, if you choose to level up your Ravenger (magic attacks) ability on a large node, you might obtain a +6 magic boost whereas if you chose Commando (physical attacks) you might obtain +6 strength instead. Since the amount of large nodes is limited, carefully planning out each character can have huge benefits compared to just randomly choosing which to improve. Once one cycle of the cluster repeats, you have the option to select a bonus, new skill role, bonus accessory points or an additional ATB gauge; the gauge then resets, allowing you to fill it once again.\n\nWhile this all sounds complicated, there isn’t as big a penalty as it might sound for the player who doesn’t feel like planning out all his or her levels. It will reduce the player’s potential, but still allow them to do any task in the game that an optimised character can do, albeit with a higher degree of difficulty. All this complexity doesn’t come without penalty: unlike its predecessor, weapons and accessories cannot be upgraded, a shame as XIII's upgrade system was fairly unique and interesting.\n\nNot in the mood to slay C’eith? Take your chances betting on or racing your own Chocobo. Race results got you down? Relax and put a few coins in the slot machine and try for the jackpot. One of the huge differences between XIII and XIII-2 is the degree of freedom: whereas XIII's progression was pretty limited to where the story took you, here the journey is much more open. If a particular area gets dull or too difficult, it's possible to return to the Historia Crux and select a different time period to explore. The further you get in each area the more fragments and artifacts you’ll collect; artifacts are used to unlock new areas or progress the story in some situations. The collection of mini games and side puzzles offer nice changes in the dark story even though they can be difficult at times.\n\nFor those new to the series, it’s strongly recommended that you play the first title before diving into XIII-2 as the game expects players to already be familiar with the battle system and storyline.\n\nThe soundtrack features more vocal tracks than just about any other Final Fantasy game to date and offers some remarkable tracks throughout the story. From massive orchestral tracks to death metal, the variation in style should give everyone something to like. Some of the songs accompany the story so well that to take them out would in fact diminish a lot of the emotion portrayed in the event.\n\nSquare-Enix did a much better job with the port of this game then they did with XIII. All of the bells and whistles you'd expect as far as graphics options are concerned are there in the game's launcher. This is something they went back and added to XIII recently.\n\nOverall, Final Fantasy XIII-2 offers a lot of gameplay and a great addition to the XIII plot. XIII-2 is probably the best game in the trilogy. Even though the graphics weren’t revolutionary like XIII’s and the slight pacing issue still remains, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is very good. Anyone who played and enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII owes it to themselves to pick this up and continue the story of Serah and Lightning.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 18, 2014","true","90.4"," 91 of 125 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","91","125","0","2"

The performance remains unchanged.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nThe resolution selection does nothing but change the window size while the game is still rendered in 1280x720, making everything blurry unless you have a monitor running natively at 720p (which few modern computer users do). The framerate jumps wildly from 60 to well under 15 almost arbitrarily.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that both FFXIII and FFXIII-2 for PC are NOT multi-threaded applications when virtually 99% of software written today is. This is an artifact from when Square ported these two games over from the Playstation 3, which had an extremely complicated and poorly designed CPU architecture. To minimize writing code (perhaps due to time constraints or inexperience, or both), Square decided to throw the entire game on a single thread.\n\nRegardless, specs don't matter in this case. You could try running this game on a 486 or Cray Supercomputer and you would probably achieve the same results. Kidding aside, this port is VERY poorly optimized.","December 22, 2014","false","13.4"," 61 of 89 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","61","89","6","0"

Everything in this world looks gorgeous. I often found myself just standing still and looking at the scenery in each area. The effects are also fantastic and that is especially obvious during combat.\n\nMusic As a standard for the series, the soundtrack is fantastic.  Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Mitsuto Suzuki have managed to blend orchestral music with techno and dubstep and while that may seem like a  recipe for disaster, it's actually glorious. Every track is unique and memorable and the tone of each track perfectly fits the mood of the area or scene it is played at.\n\nStory The story of the game is mostly hit or miss. Some people like it while others think it's needlessly complex. I for one consider this one of the best stories the series has ever had. I never found myself wondering what's going on. Everything, from world events to character motivations, was clear to me from the moment they were revealed. The main objective of the characters, the world mythos and the antagonist's plan are clear.\nIt basically revolves around Serah, the younger sister of the previous game's protagonist, and Noel, a time traveller who arrives at Serah's time to warn her of a dire future.\nThe game picks up 3 years after the events of the previous game. In the prologue we see Lightning fighting a mysterious enemy named Caius, in a realm called Valhalla, to protect the godess Etro, the one who was revealed in the previous game that liberated the l'cie from their cursed brands. Lightning sees Noel emerging from a time gate and asks of him to seek out her sister Serah and gives him a mission which will be revealed later. She assigns a moogle that can turn into a bow, named Mog, to give to Serah, then opens another game for him and proceeds to engage Caius in combat once again, allowing Noel to escape. Later we see a meteor falling in the village of New Bodhum, one of the many human settlements built around the pillar of the crystalised Cocoon, where Serah resides along with the NORA gang, also from the previous game. Soon after, monsters attack and Noel appears just in time to help Serah, giving her the bow to protect herself.\nAfter the fight, he reveals to Serah and the NORA members that Lightning told him of weird distortions in time, called Paradoxes, taking place and that these distortions would soon lead to the destruction of the world. He said that Lightning needs Serah to solve these paradoxes in order for her to protect the godess in Valhalla, without specifying how one leads to the other. Noel then reveals that the meteor is a time gate through which the duo, accompanied now by Mog, can travel through time using the Historia Crux, the crossroads of time. In their journey they will learn about Lightning's true mission, the motivation of this mysterious Caius and his connection to Noel and the godess Etro and the reason time is distorted. Along the way they'll meet previous characters like Snow, Hope, Fang and Vanille and new characters, all with their own missions and objectives.\nThere's also a time travelling character, named Chocolina, who is the main vendor of weapons, items and materials in the game. She's basically a merchant who doubles as comic relief.\nThis is a very well written story overall and I enjoyed every second of it.\n\nGameplay The gameplay is downright flawless this time around.\n•For the combat, the game uses and expands upon the previous game's battle system, the paradigm system.\nThe paradigm system utilizes the ATB aspect of previous titles in the series but allows you to use multiple commands. •Each character has access to every role and it's up to the player to switch between roles during battle. The player controls only one character during battle, the leader, but you can swap leaders mid-fight, enabling some interesting strategies. There's also an auto-battle command which will automatically select which abilities the character you control will use, depending on their role and the situation they're in. New to this system is the option to choose whether you want your characters to focus on a single target or utilize multi-target spells when using the auto-battle command, allowing for more freedom and customisation. As a result, the battles are faster but strategy is essential to defeat the tougher enemies in the game.\nThere are 6 roles available for combat. Commando (DPS), Ravager (Mage), Synergist (Buff), Saboteur (Debuff), Medic (Healer) and Sentinel (Tank)\n•The character progression utilizes the Crystarium system of FF 13 but expands upon it. Each crystarium stage consists of a linear set of nodes, some small and some large. The player chooses which role to level up by using Crystarium Points (CP) and the available node in the Crystarium stage. Small nodes will offer general stat boosts but large nodes will offer large boosts according to the role you chose to upgrade. For example, using a large node to level up the commando role will give a large Attack power boost etc. This allows for a lot of customisation but caution is obligatory since you can essentially lock a character out of certain stat boosts depending on how you use the large nodes, leaving them under-developed as a result.\n•There are 2 playable characters and 3 slots for recruitable monsters. The monsters start off weaker than the characters but you can upgrade them using monster materials which work like CP works for the main characters. Later on you will learn about monster infusion and hidden monster abilities, which will allow you to infuse monsters with other monsters, giving them their abilities and allowing you to create the ultimate monster. This is by far the best feature in the game because it allow total freedom in how you want to develop your monsters and the results are always satisfying.\n•New to the series is the accessory capacity. Serah and Noel can equip accessories to boost their stats and gain resistances to certain elements or debuffs. However, unlike the previous game, accessories now take up an amount of "space" on a character. This means that if, for example, an item takes up 60 points of capacity but Serah only has 20 available, she can't equip it. The capacity of each character starts of low but can increase as you level up using CP and completing crystarium stages. It caps at 100. In order to use all 4 equipment slots, you will need to customise the items you have  in the shop to make them smaller but weaker or just use them as is and carry less. Sometimes it's preferred to use 4 smaller items than 2 or 3 bigger ones but this depends on the player.\n\nContent The main story isn't the focus of the game. You'll find yourself spending more time doing side-quests this time around. Each location has available side-quests for you to complete in order to gain CP, items or fragments which are basically the most important collectible in the game and can be used to unlock special abilities later in the game. Certain areas consist entirely of side-quests and can be unlocked using Wild Artefacts (used to open optional time gates) and have their own side-plot. There's also various mini puzzles to complete and a casino area in which you can use slot machines, assign tamed chocobos in races for items and money, unlock special abilities using Fragments and later on play Poker and a fun game called chrono bind.\nIn addition to that, there's a ton of optional bosses and after the final boss, you will be able to replay missions and fight tougher versions of old bosses to unlock alternative "paradox" endings.\nYou might also find monster infusion fun depending on how much you enjoy customisation and item farming. Grinding isn't required but it's recommended.\n\nOverall this game is a unique, mastefuly designed experience and I definitely recommend it to everyone. 10/10","September 29, 2015","true","93.8"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","31","39","6","0"

I understand you want final fantasy to be like it used to be but you can't just let that cloud your minds from seeing when square has put out yet another great game. You won't find this game as one of the final fantasy classics, but this game is still very good and shows squares determination to make the game that the fans want to play.\n\nBattle System\nThe battle system of FF XIII-2 returns in a familiar yet more improved in some ways, resulting in my new favorite battle system of the entire series. Fights requires a mix of strategy, timing and a style that makes combat not only fast flowing but oozing with stylish flair giving each victory a satisfying feeling. You're never left feeling like you're grinding away in every battle. Quickly shifting to defensive paradigms when a boss is about to use a devastating attack or debuffing paradigms where you're setting up for the long haul. In fact, there are quite a number of improvements made to the system since the last game that make battles much more enjoyable:\n\n• No longer will the game end when the party leader dies.\n• Paradigm Shift animations are much more brief and in most cases, omitted.\n• Paradigms can be tuned to focus on single or multiple targets.\n• Six classes are available.\n• Summons don't transform into vehicles.\n• Shroud items (like Aegisol) have been removed.\n• TP is gone.\n\n8.5/10 Should I buy this game?

Everyone can agree on this and I'm no exception to that. The whole “let's save Lightning” angle felt forced from the start. I would have taken a game where we play as Lightning the whole way thr- Oh, right, that's what Lightning Returns is about. Anyway, a lot of plot points and major story elements felt forced or like they didn't belong. This didn't hold it back all the time, but it could have done far better.\n\n=Art 9/10=\nOn the PC, this game is absolutely stunning. When you throw all the settings up to max and optimise your graphics settings, you end up with a game that is so beautiful you sometimes forget you're playing a game. Admittedly a lot of people have complained about FPS issues, but I felt that the way it was solved in FFXIII (Editing general graphics settings through my Nvidia Control Panel) solved the issue for me before it even became one. The game played in 60 fps steadily throughout the entire playthrough. If you're having problems, Google around and try to fix it before complaining. It's worth it.\n\n=Sound 10/10=\nMusic and Final Fantasy are synonymous terms for me. Whenever I play any of the FF games, the soundtrack is the first thing I listen out for. What sort of instruments are we leaning towards? What sort of feel does this game want to give me? Every boss fight is unique, every average fight is energetic and every area has a theme that suits it perfectly. I've listened to the FFXIII-2 soundtrack more than enough times as I do other things to know how much I love it.\n\n=Characters 7/10=\nAdmittedly the weakest point of this entire game is its character lineup. Why Serah? Why Noel? Why do I care about them? A lot of the twists towards the end felt both forced and pointless. The Goddess Etro wasn't even introduced in FFXIII and now I'm supposed to believe she's a big thing that's a big part of everyone's lives? No one else seems to know who she is, so it feels a little stupid. Whatever, it's no big deal. I would have rather focused on Hope and thrown a boomerang around, to be completely honest.\n\n=Gameplay 9/10=\nI don't like the way prior FF games handled combat. Sue me. FFVII was absolutely trash with the Materia system. FFVIII's Draw system was only marginally better. FFXIII's system made it so that some characters were only viable because they had skills others didn't. FFXIII-2's Crystarium does the same thing as FFXIII, but makes good on a few faults from its predecessor. Haste and Slow aren't casual abilities to throw around now, which were absolutely broken prior. Your bonuses from stacking multiple Roles into a Paradigm is better, meaning that swapping to 3 SEN's is now a really smart move whenever you see a charge up attack. This game involves more thinking than most people care to admit. For that, I salute you, FFXIII-2. For the record, playing with Keyboard and Mouse is so easy that it's criminal.\n\n=Overall 8.5/10=\nFFXIII-2 is worth the $20. By far. I got 50 hours out of this and I played the hell out of it originally, so I was already on top of where everything was and what I needed to do. A newcomer could easily spend an extra 30 hours and not feel like it's forcing you to grind or do anything you don't really want to. Even if you played the game prior, it offers a new experience to what you might be used to.

Yet here I am, loving the gameplay, looking forward to seeing what's coming up in the plot, pursuing every achievement just as I did in XIII, and able to say nothing but how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a port job this is.\n\nThe graphics are no higher-end than its predecessor, yet I get half the framerate. The overlay doesn't show up for a good while after the button's pressed, some times for up to several minutes.\n\nOn windowed mode, the window will continuously lock itself into being active even when you alt-tab away, leaving the program you switched to on top it but holding your cursor down on the exact center of your monitor, with your inputs affecting both simultaneously. Look forward to either fiddling with the game's menus until it switches back, or trying to close it on Task Manager without being able to use your mouse.\n\nOn fullscreen, the game can refuse to close altogether, not acknowledging a press of the escape key (which is supposed to open the menu to close it,) not acknowledging alt-tab or shift-tab, and not allowing you to open Task Manager, thus forcing you to either power off your device or crash the game by unplugging your display.\n\nThe N7 armor and Assassin's Robe DLC couldn't be licensed to be carried over. Annoying, but excusable. The weapon and accessory DLCs were also not ported over. Not as excusable. Look forward to having to mod this content back in to the game yourself. Though at least it can be done.\n\nCongratulations, Square, on taking a perfectly good game and porting it so poorly that it works the way I need it to about half the time.

It's much better than XIII and has much more -gameplay- elements than it did. It's non linear, has puzzles, lots of minigames, and tons of side quests.\n\nThere are tons of monsters to recruit into your party, and it can get a bit addictive. Some are infusion fodder, and some are great on their own. The trick is knowing which is which.\n\nThe story is much more interesting than XIII as well. The main characters have much more depth and I find myself caring way more about Caius and Noel's stories than anything that was in XIII. Caius is the best kind of villain - one who thinks what he's doing is right.\n\nNow for the bad:\n\nThe only problem I had with the game is that it's too easy to gimp your characters if you don't know what you're doing. The game doesn't tell you anything about the leveling mechanic. Doing it right makes a huge difference, but basically you want Noel to have all of his strength bonuses on the big nodes and all of Serah's magic bonuses on her big nodes.\n\nThe port is decent. The only real problem I had was framerate dips, which can be annoying but isn't really a big deal.","December 19, 2014","true","109.5"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","31","43","0","1"

This is not the case, in fact Square Enix has taken one step forward but two steps back in the performance department with this PC port.\n\nFirst of all, my computer exceeds the recommended specs in every aspect, therefore hardware should not be an issue.  This being said, frame rates are NOT stable and fluctuate between 25 and 60 fps, despite Square Enix promising "60 fps gaming."  Rain is rendered poorly in this game and appears white and pixelated.   The good news is that graphics settings are now adjustable in the game launcher.  The available settings are Screen Settings, Resolution, Sound Settings, Shadow resolution, and Anti-aliasing.  The bad news is that lowering these settings does absolutely nothing to alleviate performance issues.  I've tried adjusting settings via the game launcher and my graphics card driver, to no avail.   No matter how low I set my graphics settings, my frame rate is unstable or is locked at 30 fps in many areas.\n\nOverall Final Fantasy 13-2, while a solid console game, is still not up to par as a PC port.  I thought Square Enix would have their act together by now since they have had experience porting several other Final Fantasy titles to PC.  The shoddy performance is just too hard to ignore, especially since Square Enix promised "60 fps gaming" but actually 30 fps is a lot closer to reality.\n\nSquare Enix should have taken more time to port this game and check for performance issues; I would rather have played a polished game at a later date than a shoddy one at an earlier date.\n\nUntil Square Enix fixes these glaring performances problems, I cannot recommend this game.\n\n*Update* So I have looked into the "missing" DLC issue and apparently the DLCs are included in the game, but for some reason they do not unlock until the game is beaten, which was not the case with the console version.  I apologize for the confusion in my previous review.","December 14, 2014","false","22.9"," 117 of 202 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","117","202","2","3"

Mind you, like last time, I do not own a PS3 so this is my first time expereincing this game.  I will say this game was ten times better than its original.  Not as long in terms of linear play (although the game is still linear but not as linear).  Unlike the last game,you'll play as Lightnings HOT sister Serah and a new person into the mix:  Noel who comes from a ruined future.\n\nThe basic theme of this game is time travelling.  I don't care much for time travel themes because they generally get confusing of where to go next (Majora's Mask / Epherial Phantasia), but the time travelling here is not confusing and it's very straight forward for the most part.  As for storyline elements keyed into the game, one might argue or have issues with it (because of time travelling and all the paradoxes that can happen but that's another disucssion).\n\nThis is the first FF I think I've played were the only party members are Serah and Noel.  However, your third party member is that you tame and capture monsters.  So they took a page from the  Dragon Warrior series (nice!).  Overall done well in terms of leveling up, but it would have been nice w/o looking at a guide to guess what materials did what or looking at a shop.  Just show me the requirement like most games do, would have been nice.  Leveling up is similar but more simpfiled which is nice, although it would be nice to look far ahead like in the last 13 game to see what I'm about to learn so I can level accordingly.\n\nThe combat system is back like last time, a bit more polished up but it's still a button masher here and there.  Which overall doesn't bother me.  Still as fast pace as ever with paragrham shifts.\n\nOverall....\n\nPros:\n*Fantastic story!  It kept me captivated til the very end and kept me asking questions.\n*Fun QTE's and interactive novel like storyline presentation (novel part was a bit repeative but nothing bad).\n*Fantastic music, better than the last game.\n*More mini games and challenges and extra content upon finishing.\n*Unlike the last time, there are graphical settings.  Though people still complained about stablitiy, the only issue I had if there was no 360 controller plugged in, the game would stutter.  Why this happens is beyond me but should be something to be looked into especailly for those who don't have a controller.\n*Loved the "previously on 13-2" while the game loaded, very TV show like!\n*NO DOOM (thank GOD)\n\nCons:\n*Stuttering w/o a gamepad plugged in (again may only happen on certain systems but still a con)\n*Felt wierd having only two key storyline characters.\n*Like last time, character movement would just 'stop' which became annoying for areas you needed to jump in.\n*Certain araes had a high encounter rate\n*Sometimes collecting fragments/wild artifacts to progress the game was a pain.\n*Finishing the game because I enjoyed it so much was sad to let it go.  Yeah story was that good\n\nWhile I've heard 13-3 is crap, I still plan to play it because how the story was in 13-2.\n\nOverall I recommend this game, though you may want to play 13 just to see how crappy it was, but 13-2 certainly makes up for it.\n\nNo DOOM was casted while writing this review.","April 20, 2015","true","57.0"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","26","40","2","2"

One involving the PC port, the other two involving the gameplay and its story.\n\nFirstly about the PC port: It is HORRIBLY BAD optimized. And I'm saying this after they had plenty of time patching the game but it seems this is as good as they're gonna make it. The game runs on a very, very weird dynamic fps capping system that generally limits your framerate very low so it doesn't spike, sometimes far lower than what you consider okay to look at. The community has found a way to remove this framerate limiter, greatly increasing the potential fps you will have. However, this will cause audio and animation during cutscenes to go out of sync if the framerate drops below 60, making most of them ridiculously stupid if they happen in a performance intense area.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay. I've never been fond of XIII's Active Time Battle system, which frankly hasn't changed very much in this game, making this already a minus. What's more is that most of the time it feels like you're fighting unnecessary encounters partly unrelated to the situation. The whole time-travelling system is also very confusing and annoying to do, gating you from progressing by having to go back and finding wild artifacts or other keys in order to progress through the main story. I suppose this was an attempt to go away from XIII's linear world but it's not better at all, making it more annoying if anything.\n\nAnd lastly, the story. If you enjoyed the story of FFXIII then you probably won't feel at home here. Apart from starting off somewhere near the ending of XIII and sharing its characters, it's like a fan-made alternative universe. While I understand that time travelling is playing a major role in this, it feels very disconnected from XIII. The character relations aren't reflective of XIII either, seperating it even more from being a sequel to XIII.\nOn top of all that, Lightning Returns almost nullifies everything that happened in XIII-2 and just starts off from an almost completely unrelated universe. The only thing the 3 XIII games have in common are characters and modifications of its ATB system.","March 29","false","14.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I was slightly disappointed to see that Serah was really the only character from the previous game that you got to interact with on a regular basis. I got over that pretty quickly, however. The story for this game is fantastic, on par with the previous game.. if not maybe just a bit better. The combat system is the same as the previous game, so if you liked it in FFXIII this game is just a rehash of that system. There is a difference in party makeup though. Instead of a 3-character party makeup you have the same two characters the entire game (Serah and Noel) but have the ability to capture, train, level, and use field monsters as your third party member. At first this seemed lame, but shortly after there became a collector aspect of it that i really enjoyed. Having a party of nothing but multicolored chocobos was really fun. You may also see complaints about the game not running well; as long as you arent expecting 60 FPS on max settings while trying to play this on a laptop you borrowed from work.. you'll be fine. The game ran at 59.97 FPS @1080p and all settings to their maximum (and also extended settings via the Nvidia cpl) consistently on my gaming machine, which is a couple of years old at this point. If you enjoyed FFXIII, go ahead and grab this one too. You will love the evolution of the story. There is also DLC that i won't spoil, but you really want to play it after beating the game.

The game still suffers a bit of optimization problems but the game itself is a better improvement over XIII by a bit. Pros and cons skip to bottom.\n\n\nStory(Spoiler free)Just a heads up as this game opens up with lightning but the protaganist this time is Serah who is trying to rescue her sister Lightning with the help of Noel. You'll meet many guest characters  and familiar faces from XIII. You do not need to play 13 to play this since it comes with a guide that tells you the events that has transpired.\n\nGameplay  Most of the gameplay stays the same from XIII such as killing your enemies, rating, the combat system is fairly the same with paradigm,except for a few new introductions of systems to initiate attack on  enemies such as the mog time, multiple choice qte interactions  and the crystarium facelift. The game does however offers revisit of different areas, there are towns this time and mini games to play and also some end game content bosses that will brutally rip you apart.

The game is a bit more open-world but still pretty straight forward in terms of traveling, etc. It is definitely, however, not a straight lined map with no town/NPC interactions. They also did a really good job (in my opinion) with the storyline that is still a bit confusing but not as bad as the first one. Keep in mind that the store page is somewhat misleading as they only show you screenshots of Lightning but the main character in this game is Serah and the new character Noel.\n\nGraphics and performance-wise it is a bit disappointing but I don't believe it is detrimental to the gameplay. I have an i7-2600k GTX 770 OC and 8 GB of RAM and I frequently have frame drops to below 30. I believe people with a much higher-end PC experience the same problem if not worse. The game still requires patching and optimization so if you are looking for a drastic change in performance compared to the first one I don't recommend you buy it just yet. They allow you to change the game resolution and shadow resolution. I don't really have much knowledge whether the in-game resolution is set to native 1080p but to me it just looks like a stretched out 720p when I set it to 1080p (I could be wrong). Overall I still think it's a good change compared to the console version but can definitely be improved some more.\n\ntl;dr If you don't care too much about performance issue (it's not great but not detrimental to the gameplay) and are looking forward to improved gameplay (open-world, more NPC interactions,etc) and a good storyline I definitely recommend buying it.

(especially hope turning from annoying little brat into a somewhat responsible young man, even vanille had a very deep character behind her annoying airheaded appearance)\n\nthis game seems to try to do it right but fails on multiple points:\n\n- the story feels like bad fan fiction.. they exaggerated with the melodrama to a point where it is unbearable to listen to the dialogue. also they kinda dump noel on you without any character development and didn't bother to make him likable in the least, he just seems like a mix of tidus and sora from kingdom hearts, and i didn't like either of them..\n\n- the music... i want uematsu back! some tracks are kinda ok tough, but most of it feels like generic j-pop\n\n- the time travelling scenario and different dimensions were done much better in other games (radiant historia, chrono trigger/cross)\n\n- it's way too easy; in the previous installation you had to strategize a little bit, think about the paradigms you'd use and change them sometimes when a boss just wrecks you.. in this game i mostly mash auto battle and sometimes change to healing when i get low\n\n- the monster collecting is plain dumb.\n\nBUT, if you like, melodrama, j-pop, obnoxiously cute moogles and easy gameplay then this is the right game for you! :-)","April 16","false","13.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Everyone has their own opinions and Mine are just shown throughout this review.\n\nIf you did not play the first game do not worry you are not missing out too much.\nHOWEVER\nThis game is much more open compared to the significantly linear FF13. I believe that is one reason why people hated the first game.\nThis game will use various tactics to keep you from progressing at a later point in the game which really will annoy anyone who plays this game. The puzzle challenges for example are by far the most annoying additions to this game.\nCOULD BE LIKE ANY OTHER FF GAME WITH A BOSS BUT NO. PUZZLE CHALLENGES ARE ALL THE RAGE.\nSeriously, that crap made me stop playing. And sure I could go and watch someone do them, but I'd rather do it myself, especially seeing as my network connection isnt that great especially with video content.\n\nANYWAY other than the annoyances\n\nFor the good things so far\n\n-RESOLUTIONS:\nCAN CHANGE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN 720p\n\n-A lot of elements from the first game reappear, giving you some idea just how the first game went.\n\n-A LOT of crap people hated in the first game is fixed\n(Like, if the leader dies, it used to be game over, yeah no, thats gone now)\n\n-If you have played Tales of Symphonia 2 THIS GAME FEELS SLIGHTLY LIKE IT\nWell in battle that is. You will only have two playable characters, and other characters like Snow joining in, but not in the party as they are not of the same timeline.\n\n-You will also be able to collect monsters to help in battle which is cool.\nOh they also troll you a bit by making the game look like an older FF tittle, (like with an actual level system) But its not.\n\n-You get all DLC from the ps3 version included too!\n\nTL:DR the game is vastly more simplified than the original, My guess is the creators saw how annoying the first game was and aimed to change it up somewhat.\n\nThe bad\n\n-THERE IS NO LINUX PORT. STEAM TROLLS YOU.\n\n-Character selection and world/timeline selection can be a pain to deal with at first and for some reason to me if feels like I'm playing kingdom hearts in a way due to Noels looks, however like all games you play for hours, you will get used to it.\n\n-The AI has a mind of its own, screwing up story lines, in more than one way.\n--Becareful how you talk to people, the camera may be in an odd position\n\n-Grinding does help lots here, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GAME TROLLS YOU TO TAKE ON BOSSES WAY HIGHER LEVEL INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE MISSON TO MAKE IT EASIER.\n\n-Graphics options are available although limited. SE seemed to have borrowed the settings changer that was created for the first game, however I will say one thing..\n\n>>There is no option to change the texture quality, so you WILL NEED A HIGH END PC FOR THIS GAME<<\n\n-Even though its a PS3 Port, the game has a significant performance hit even on low settings. So if you played the first game, thinking you can play the second one easily, think again.\n\n-The AUTOSAVE FEATURE WILL KILL YOU: By being stressed out, as for some reason steam needs to be not only online and active, but if steam gets disconnected, the game will LOCK UP DURING AUTOSAVE MOMENTS. Just keep that in mind if you have a faulty internet connection or you are playing during times where steam goes down for repairs.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nOver all I have nothing really bad to say about this port. This game  does however raise the question on if i shall buy the third installment of FF13 as even though the first game was mainly linear, I preferred it over this one currently. There is alot Square could do to make this game better and a lot of things that i hope do not transition to FF15 when it does arrive, assuming it comes out for PC. anywho gameplay wise It is much better to play over the original, and even though there could be a few more fixes here and there. I'm sure with the right system you would be able to play this game maxed out, however currently this game is as demanding as something like witcher 2 So keep that in mind when trying to play this game.\n\nAlso for you tech heads out there, this game is multi(meaning 2) threaded.\nHigh clocked strong CPU cores are recommended. (so FX minumum, Intel core i7 or something above 4ghz)\nGPU Wise: RADEON HD 7870/7790 and above / NVidia GTX 750 TI and above (for 1080p gameplay)\nRam isn't really an issue, so minimum being 3gb, lol.\n","January 9, 2015","true","42.7"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","20","32","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chic0ny/recommended/292140/","chic0ny","Chicony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chic0ny/","199 products in account","After many complaints about linearity of the previous title, FF XIII-2 offers more variability of where do you want to go and how you want to proceed. Which is both good and bad, depends on how you look at it. However, to give a quick conclusion, the game is very well worth the money spent.\n\nThe biggest issue I've had this time isn't the linearity of the game, but the PC port. I consider my computer as very good, yet I've had few problems. The most annoying one would be the lack of 7.1 surround sound support, and I didn't find a way to at least make it work with my Razer headset. Video stutter in cutscenes is still there and there are few locations where I've had lower FPS than I'm ok with.\n\nThe story yet again feels as an interactive anime world, truly well written and astoundingly presented. It felt a bit shattered at first, but that's the part of "don't lead the way for the players too much". Plus, if you are fan of time travelling and consequences of changing things in the past/future, you may love this one.\n\nCharacter progress is more "free" aswell. And I don't think you can actually develop your characters so badly you won't be able to finish the game. If you don't grind a lot, it will be hard, though. I've spent a lot of time in final battles that were also close to death, it wasn't just about not enough damage.\n\nThe battle system was slightly improved. Ok, it's nearly the same, BUT. There is one big BUT for me - the pre-emptive strike finally does not start an hour-long animation of hitting every little enemy, instead, it's like one quick Blitz attack and that's it!\n\nI was missing characters, though. From the start to the end, you'll be forced to play with Noel and Serah (yeah, and the Mog) + some monster Serah is able to capture. And also cinematics. There really is only the opening and ending, everything else are just regular cutscenes, I think.\n\nBut well, I don't think this game was as good as the first one (story-wise), because it didn't have that much touching moments, but it's still Final Fantasy. And a very good game.\n\nI definitely recommend this, Kupo!","December 27, 2014","true","23.8"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","23","38","0","0"

But it does attempt to rectify some of the problems that XIII had.\n\nFirst, the story, which is a weakness. I do not believe XIII-2 or Lightning Returns should have been attached to XIII. Each of them convolute the story so much, adding and changing the mythos in unnecessary ways. Personal beef aside, XIII-2 takes place... uh, anytime and everytime after XIII. That's right, you'll be traveling through time. It continues after XIII and retcons the happy ending. Series heroine Lightning has disappeared, and as her younger sister Serah, the only one who seems to remember her, you need to team up with Noel, the last survivor of humanity in the far-off future, to find the source of a timeline disturbance and fix it.\n\nThe combat is similar to XIII, which is a more dynamic version of the ATB system from many other FF games. The difference here is that you always play as the same two characters, plus your choice of captured monster. In this game, you can recruit enemy monsters, each with a specific combat role (medic, physical attacker, magic attacker, etc.), as opposed to Serah and Noel who can change roles. You can change combat roles for your party on the fly during battle to react to the situation.\n\nExploration is limited, each area is self-contained and you travel between each area/time via a menu. Some locations are used more than once, and you can explore them in different times to reach new areas and quests. Also unlike FFXIII, you can get sidequests from the beginning of the game. Completings quests will get you fragments, the chief indicator of progress. There are 160 fragments to collect. On the surface, I like the concept of fragments, reminiscent of Sonic Adventure's emblems. Most are single challenges. You'll have about half of them or maybe less if you're just gunning for the end (if memory serves). There is a meaty postgame, but it does get slow and annoying at times (but not as slow as FFXIII) and the fragment that has you logging battles with every single monster will be annoying, but perfectly passable with a guide. The Paradox Ending concept is also annoying too. Oh, and the quizzes in Academia. You would probably not know how to get all of them without a guide. Also unlike FFXIII, levels are not just single tunnels, but Academia (all time periods, really) is an unneccessary overcompensation. It's huge and confusing.\n\nAh, almost forgot! The port. Both XIII and Lightning Returns are better that XIII-2. Nearly everyone has encountered slowdown with this game. It is simply not optimized well. That said, it never became unplayable for me, and I mean ACTUALLY unplayable instead of 'OMG it's 59 FPS instead of 60 FPS' like some people who use that term. This does dip below 30 FPS at points where I could run XIII at a pretty smooth 60 throughout. I can deal with that, but some people can't. It does not excuse Square Enix from doing that to us. The game's $20, though, so yeah.\n\nIn summary, the game is worth the price. You'll have to deal with lag and a story that simply didn't need to happen, but you have a fun battle system and more exploration than FFXIII in return.","December 29, 2015","true","79.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Now it's up to Serah, mysterious traveler Noel, and moogling Mog to make things right. Despite putting 50+ hours into FFXIII-2, I'm about as equipped to discuss the plot as somebody who has never even heard of the game....or Final Fantasy.\n\nI guess this title could be compared to previous Square games like Chrono Trigger & Chrono Cross. The player must pass through various times and dimensions, alleviating paradoxes, fighting monsters, and getting pushed around by some jerk named Caius. There are dark moments (like Chrono), but it sticks to 3-4 characters, instead of attempting to juggle 300 (like Cross). I guess that's part of what got me through this game. When the story doesn't make a lot of sense, at least you can watch the friendship between Noel & Serah grow, and realize that they're getting by despite the heaps of BS being tossed their way.\n\nThe battle-system is straight outta FFXIII, but with numerous changes. The most obvious is that the third party member is always a monster. Pocket Monster fans are going to find dozens of creatures to recruit throughout their journey. Monsters are strengthened via materials, and can be infused with others to gain additional skills. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed that monsters adhere to the FFXIII system. For example, I recruited a Giant Cactaur, but he's not going around using 100,000 needles on everything. He's a synergist so he sticks entirely to buffs.  I know I know, the paradigms are essential to winning in FFXIII, but I just...oh well. On the bright side, monsters tend to have unique skills that make them more effective in a given situation than Serah & Noel.\n\nOn the whole, FFXIII-2 is a fair bit easier than its predecessor. This is mostly due to the fact that you're actually not limited in how much you can grind. Since this game is non-linear, you could go to various optional areas and amass a ton of levels, making the story-battles trivial. Aside from a handful of post-game & DLC fights, you'll have to limit yourself if you want a challenge.\n\nSpeaking of levels, the Crystarium got a convoluted revamp. You cash in points for stat bonuses: +3 to magic, +20 to HP, etc. Over time you unlock and level all six roles, but your level 99 stats can vary. There's a "perfect" guide floating around to help you figure this mess out. While I ended up using guides to have a chance at 100%ing this game, I merely stuck to leveling what I thought would make sense. For Serah, I leveled Ravager on the large nodes to boost her magic, and with Noel, commando. I probably goofed somewhere and cost myself a good 30+ points in an essential stat, but I've done most everything in the game, so it isn't that much of an issue.\n\nIn order to get all 160 fragments, you're going to be doing a lot of exploring, grinding, puzzles, and stupid pet tricks. Mog is capable of finding hidden items, and can also be thrown to reach faraway objects (which you might need a guide to find). The puzzles are almost entirely mini-games. As anyone who has played FFXIII-2 will tell you, the clock puzzles SUCK. Most of them aren't that difficult and can be brute-forced. But there are a few that all but require a website for calculating solutions. Either take advantage of the tools the internet has made available to you, or watch in horror as the pacing dies a painful death, your choice. The grind isn't quite as bad as FFXIII, but expect to spend a lot of time in the Archylte Steppe fighting the same monsters for potent orbs, essences, & crystals.\n\nAfter completing the game, all of the major DLC is unlocked. In the Coliseum, players will engage in battle with numerous fan-favorites, and a few characters from FFXIII. I find it amusing that one of the opponents should have been in a boss-fight in FFXIII, but it never happened because reasons. I won't spoil it, but if you played FFXIII, then you already know who I'm talking about. You'll want to fight these battles not just because they're quite good, but also because you can recruit everyone you defeat. The next DLC adventure is a solo battle between Lightning and Caius. Lightning has a specific set of roles, and is expected to switch between them constantly. For example, she can use the knight role to become impervious to damage, and it's necessary to avoid getting one-shotted by a handful of Caius's attacks. Since this DLC doesn't require Serah & Noel, you can do it immediately after completing the game to gain a powerful ally.\n\nSazh's DLC adventure takes place in a Casino. He's trapped in limbo, and his son is nowhere to be found, only by gambling can they hope to be re-united. While the concept sounds sufficiently dark, this isn't exactly Gambling Apocalypse Sazh. The goal is to acquire 30 fortune medals, which can be done in less than 30 minutes by playing Texas Hold'em. The casino is also available in the main-game, though all N&S can do is play slots and race their chocobos. Once I got the items I required, I never went back.\n\nI'll admit, I enjoyed my time with this game more than FFXIII. Noel, Serah, and Caius are some of the better JRPG heroes and villains I've seen. Trying to make sense of everything is headache-inducing, but the revamped crystarium and monster-raising provided excellent distractions. The combat itself also recieved some slight improvements, like paradigm  shifting being noticeably faster. The various areas/times/dimensions being more than a narrow corridor definitely helped, though the quests tend to be of the fetching variety.\n\nThe port still could have been a lot better though. I'm not nearly as frustrated about it now as was when I started the PC version, but Square-enix isn't getting a passing grade for this one. FFXIII and its sequel deserve better ports, but I expect Lightning Returns to be at about the same quality as the previous two PC entries; superior to the console versions, and not much else.","December 20, 2014","true","51.0"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

Overall, I do recommend buying this game "IF" you bought and loved playing FF13, for the story and graphics if nothing else.  HOWEVER --- and this is where I go off on a complete rant about this game.  This sequel takes a complete turn to how you will play the game, and in my opinion, takes you far far away from the original.  ***BUYER BEWARE, you may spend as much time online researching this game than you do actually playing it.  Because, it is not very intuitive and does lack significantly the continuity of this game overall.  It's hard to follow; ALL of the various paths you are suppose to follow, when and where to find the fragments/ items you need to continue moving forward, once you figure out where you are suppose to go, so very much more.  You are left saying much of the time "exactly WHAT is my objective now?!"  You cannot and will not finish this game without having external help [period].  Don't let anyone tell you differently, because they are lying and/ or braggarts, and you will get plenty of these examples in the brag-thoughs on Youtube and other various places like I have.  I mean, I do not mind doing "some" research online about the games I am playing.  But, I do not like having to keep pausing my game just to finding out that once again I cannot do what I must do, for that road too is yet another dead end.  there are the endless puzzles/ rifts to solve that will rack your brain, and/ or the minimal amount of keys to unlock gates (wild fragments) to continue further, and/ or they are completely hidden like an easter egg hunt, constantly.  This game is complete chaos as far as trying to figure out what/ where to do/ go next!!!... But, YEAH!, people that hated FF13 seem to just love FF13-2, and visa versa, people that love FF13 seem to hate this game.  At least this is my concensus?!... Oh, and the pro's to this game; excellent character development, storyline, graphics, diverse gameplay, multi-purpose gaming (separate gaming abilities; stragegy, action, adventure, etc.), and I've been told it has great replaying qualities to continue your character developement and alternative realities.  So after the end, you can reshape different endings.  While I'll be happy just to get to one type of ending.

It gives you a lot more freedom in terms of what you want to do during the course of the game and although you will eventually have to follow the main story to progress to later stages of the game, you could easily go ahead and just burn another 3 or 4 hours here and there just exploring and gaining more CP for your characters, materials for your monsters and finding those pesky Artefacts.\n\nOn the topic of levelling, yes it is a little annoying because the game doesn't fully go over the system and if you are not careful you can indeed make your character weaker because of it. Although it does pretty much imply the way they should be setup with Noel being Strength and Serah being Magic, it doesn't explicitly state it nor does it tell you that you can easily waste CP and Role levels on nodes that give little to no actual benefit which is a slight issue but not one that should make anybody overlook the game, it's trial and error.\n\nThe third party member in the team will consist of a Monster character, which you find various items to level up unlike the usual CP used for the main PCs. The ability to gain, level and infuse said monsters to make a third player who could be a huge asset to any party you make is a huge plus to it. With that, you can take up to 3 Monsters into a battle as part of a Paradigm Pack, which lets you add them to your current Paradigm setups then change the roles freely to (hopefully) change the tide of battle upon change. Also Paradigm Shifting is a bit quicker, which I personally found a little bonus.\n\nThe story itself could be confusing, especially if you haven't played the original and it can also get a bit crazy to follow too if you do things in an odd order or seek out Artefacts all the time. It's solid, but it isn't the best and possibly one of the very few things I can pick on within the game.\n\nOverall it is a solid game, not amazing by Final fantasy standards but it is worth a go if you played Final Fantasy 13 or really any version of the Final Fantasy series in the past, or if you are like me and just love playing RPGs.","January 18, 2015","true","27.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","15","24","2","0"

Because it's the continuation of its story and an "evolution" of the game mechanics. You will only understand and possibly enjoy it by first experiencing the first game.\n\nI've played both of the games on PS3, after I asked for a friend to borrow me Final Fantasy XIII and felt in love by it for some reason, and decided to buy it and got addicted. I finished the main-storyline on both games on PS3, but then PC gaming happened.\nI read some reviews and comments about Final Fantasy XIII-2 performance on PC version, and let me tell you, I was a little afraid that I would buy it and not been able to play it.\n\nNow look at my profile and you will see, not only I played it for more than 70hours but I also finished all the achievements.\n\nSo despite of what people are writing on the media, and gaming portals, such as steam, here is a proof that the game doesn't suffer from any crashes or slow gameplay.\n\nIt does suffer from some frame drops, but only on some battles, and only for some seconds, let's say, if you know the game well, pray that when you are in the Bosses battles that they don't use the skill "Ruinga" very much.\n\nI only had frame drops, on 3 boss battles though.\n\nI've read people with high-end computers (like GTX 900 series with i7s) having crashes and frame drops on even exploring the maps, and my only explanation to that is the lack of acknowledge of those people in configuring their systems for proper gaming.\n\nIn 70+ hours my game never crashed, and I played with my PS3 controller all the time. I Alt+tabbed numberous times, I streamed the game on twitch, and I even used the steam web browser while ingame.\n\nBut enough of technical review, if you really liked the first game and its story, you will certainly like this one too.\nThe game battle is pretty much the same, the exploration and battle encounter has changed and the free roam is completely different.\nThe system to upgrade your acessories is no longer by EXP.\n\nThe DLCs that you could bought in PS3 (for example, to have Lighting in your party - otherwise its not playable) is totally free on steam, because it comes when you buy it.\n\nNeedless to say I annihilated the last boss and some achievements by just using Lighting power of the DLC.\n\nI don't want to spoil the story or anything, but if you did a research, the story will not end in this game, and if you want keep knowing what happens next, you will have to play Lighting Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, which is the third and last game of the trilogy.\n\nSo to end my review I'll give a score that I think is fair for my experience.\n\n8,2 / 10\n\nThe price is still a bit high for its quality and I disliked some new ideas that they brought into this game, like the "Hands of Time Clock Puzzle", or the Casino Coin mini-game.\n\nThe opportunity to tame monsters and train them to make a build of ur own was delicious!","May 3","true","77.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","5"

No problems with my Windows 7 laptop with a GeForce GTX860M. Steam cloud sync works perfectly and I am able to play the game on both rigs perfectly, except for that one time when my internet was down and the cloud sync did not work (duh). You can play it offline and it will sync once you have internet again.\n\nHaving a playstation controller is highly recommended to enjoy the game!! Don't listen to keyboard players who complain about a game made for a PS controller.\n\nBattle System:\nThis is the best part of the game! As someone who has played FF6 - 9, the battle system of FFXIII-2 was extremely refreshing and challenging. Throughout the battles, you will need to switch between modes in order to damage, mitigate damage, debuff and buff your party, failing which you will just die. And die again. And again. Fortunately, when you die you will be given the option to respawn at the same point prior to the battle or retry the battle, which saves alot of time. Also, if you think you're gonna lose the battle, simply press start and retry to have another shot at it.\n\nYou get a chance to tame monsters after you have defeated them. Catch em, level them and infuse their abilities to other monsters to create your own unique monster!\n\nIf you're looking for a game that you could simply press O and you could cruise through battles with ease, this is not for you. Go play dota 2 or something.\n\nLevelling System:\nYou earn crystarium points after battles or side quests and can use it to level up your party's crystarium, gaining new abilities etc. Level up wisely in order to maximise your stat gains!\n\nStory:\nThe storyline feels kind of lame and slow at the start, but believe me when I say the character story developers did a fantastic job of making me have dem feels for both the protagonist and the villain. BTW, there are multiple hidden endings for the game if you can defeat / unlock them, or you could just youtube it if you're lazy.\n\nSidequests:\nCHOCOBO RACING AND A CASINO! You also get all the additional digital downloadable content Square Enix launched after you complete the game!\n\nMusic / Soundtrack:\nAfter playing the game, I purchased the OST from ebay. The music made for this game is phenomenal. Lolz were had when I rode the red chocobo for the first time.\n\nOverall:\nJust play it, you will like it.

Having options such as 1080p and FXAA etc certainly helps deliver a way more graphically pleasing product than on the weak PS3.

Some love it. Some hate it. If you dig your RPGs to be a little more action-oriented and faster paced, XIII-2 will be right up your alley (after you play through XIII first as this is a direct continuation of that story line.)\n\nFor a game from 2012 built for hardware from 2006 it's a pretty game. Sadly, concerning the graphics/performance of this title is my big, and only, gripe: the PC version is not well optimized and has some pretty wacky stuff going on.\n\nYou'll notice that the features of the game specify that the title sports a 60fps framerate and that's technically true, but misleading in how one would expect. First of all, you're going to need a decently beefy rig to play this game smoothly at 30fps due to the pitiful optimation for PC. Second of all, yes, you might hit 60 fps here or there, but the internal engine applies restrictive frame limiters at multiple points so don't expect that frame rate to stick.\n\nAny cutscene shot that focuses on Noel runs nice and smooth at 60. Shift to Serah or any other character? Hard drop to 30. Running around the map at a nice 60 before it loads a new area and you've got another drop. Battle start? Drop to 30 until the victory animation, then snap back to 60. My system is not being taxed, mind you, it's just how the game operates, which is disappointing. XIII did not have this problem on my end (save for some cutscenes that were hard-limited to 30 fps here and there).\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing - wide variety of styles and genres. There's plenty of tracks that hit the right emotional beats to go with the story and lots of great blood-pumping battle tunes to get you into the fight, ready to take on the world.\n\nThe story is great, not entirely needed as a follow up to XIII as it feels pretty shoe-horned in to make some more money, but it's serviceable and enjoyable. It's nice to play as the damsel in distress from the first game and Noel is a good companion and a welcome addition to the cast.\n\nFun RPG, great experience, and while far from being the PC port it could have been, it is the superior version to the console editions.","December 31, 2014","true","39.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Now to play some more!\nWith tons of included DLC and post-game content there's an insane amount of extra hours worth of gameplay after you kill the big baddy.\n\nThe storyline while awesome does feel built around the time gate mechanic instead of the other way around.\nWhat I mean by that is that the story comes in chunks rather than in previous FF's that tell their story from A to Z as you play. It's a bit tough to explain but on the plus side, it's always exciting to see another storypart revealed.\n\nVisually it's great, as expected. The audio is bloody fantastic, with great music and even the US voiceovers (of the 2 protagonists especially) are very, VERY well done.\nCombat is expanded upon compared to FFXIII, with an extensive catch-'m-all monster (and infusion) system, and a blast to behold.\nThe Crystarium, one tip, don't just level it!

I mean really, really horrible. A game with graphics like these should run at a silky smooth 60 fps at all times on my rig. As is, most overworlds run at 35 fps, and battles can really chug at 20 (some bosses are even sub 20.)\n\nThat having been said, the game is phenomenal. It's a unique final fantasy, and also quite different from XIII. It retains most of the positive elements of XIII (such as an excellent battle system) while avoiding the linearity that XIII was panned for. In addition to being much more linear, the story is far easier to follow. This speaks volumes about the over complication of XIII, that its sequel about time travel is easier to follow. However, with the added freedom of exploration, it's lost some of the focus that XIII had. Also, I don't like the soundtrack as much. Too much J-pop for me.\n\nBuy this game on steam if you don't have a PS3 or X360. Either way, buy this game. It's a lot of fun.

This was my first ever Final Fantasy game, and I was thinking that it may have been a bad idea to buy this. Before I say anything else, I must say that this game is a love it or hate it kinda thing.\n\nSo when I first started the game, I was rather confused by what the controls were, and how the game worked. Of course, it was my fault as I did not bother reading the instructions or tutorial that the game offered or provided. Nevertheless, after about an hour of playing (during which I was pretty much still in the first area that you start in), I got the hang of it. The battle mechanics and the various paradigms that you could switch to were more clear to me now.\n\nFrom that point on, it was smooth sailing, up until I first enccountered the main antagonist. I was hopelessly stuck at that portion, then I realised that this, being a RPG game, meant that grinding would be necessary. And grind I did. and FYI, it worked (eventually).\n\nA good point about this game is that even after you have defeated the final boss and completed the main storyline, which iin my case took about 40 hours, there are still things and people out there that will giive you a good thrashing. Even certain monsters that you may have defeated before countless times may take you down if you get a bit too complacent.\n\nOverall, I would rate the experience a 8.5/10, and greatly recommend it to others. Now, I'm just waiting for the next sequel to come out on Steam, at which point I'd likely pay the full price without waiting for a sale on Steam.","March 6, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The FPS is all over the place, can't reach it's target FPS at anypoint (aside from in and outside of battle using 2 different FPS targets). The "fps hack" helped but the game is still slowing down, the music is cracking for a second just to jump back. Same with animations.

I have only played FFX on console, FFXIII on PC\n\nGameplay: Very similar to FFXIII, improved in a few ways, but feels identical. Overall very fun game play for turn-based.\n\nControls: I would really like to have more configurations and customization opitions for my controls, but other than that it's fine. They also fixed the esc key which is awesome.\n\nResolution/Graphics: Very nice, I have been having no lag related issues, very clean. One problem I do have is the ability not to re-size windowed mode because it is fixed.\n\nSound: Very nice soundtrack and Japanese or english language for me is perfect.\n\nCharacters: I am actually very upset that you are not able to play Lightning. The picture of the game is Lightning, the trailer is all Lightning, and the first 5minutes is Lightning. HOWEVER YOU DO NOT GET TO PLAY LIGHTNING OTHER THAN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES. It really sucks that you only have 2 character opitions in this game. I really wished that they would advertise the game as more to what the game entails. Advertise Noel and Serah, Lightning isn't even playable, why advertise her for everything and make people think she is one of the main characters again. I seriously can't stress how much that is bugging me from enjoying the game more.\n\n\nStory: Great so far! Really like how they are giving you more say in how the story goes, however I would really perfer a completely linear storyline (that's just me) for this type of series.\n\n\nOVERALL: Buy it if you liked FFXIII or any of the previous FF. This is a great game and buy, however I see no reason that you would buy it on PC if you own a PS/Xbox because you can have superior controls and identical everything else (unless there is a huge price difference). And again... really wish I could play Lightning... I guess I have to wait till Lightning Returns :(.","December 12, 2014","true","20.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

The game itself is much better than XIII,  the game is no longer stupidly linear and is actually fun to run around the different areas/time zones, as opposed to running down a corridor. The monster system is pretty cool, having the ability to choose monsters to be part of your party, and leveling them along with the main characters. The shop is actually not bad now, and is something you might use often. They also smartened up with the battle system, so now when the leader dies, you don't lose the battle, which was the dumbest thing ever. There is a lot more things to the game than just this, but these are some of the things I really liked in the 13 hours I've played at this point.\n\nThe Port: The PC version of this game is... in need of work. Granted XIII-2 Launched with graphics options, which is awesome, the game fells like it stutters a lot more, and has more frame drops than XIII did. My computer is very high end, and should not have any troubles with any game like this, but for whatever reason, it does. If they can fix it somehow, and make it so computers good enough get a constant 60FPS, it would make this game just that much better.\n\nOverall, I would rate the game a 8.5 I'd say at this point, and the port a 5. It is a fun game, so I can put up with the sometimes bad performance.\n","December 18, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

However, there's consistent frame rate drops in game, either when in open world, or when in battle mode. Me having a high-end pc, the frame drop rate sometimes can turn the table of your whole battle results, but nonetheless, with proper handling, its not a problem. There is also cutscenes in the game and it does not havefps drop. If fps dropping consistently is not much of a problem to you(Such as like good at handling minor-slightly major fps drops) and you're here just for the storyplot, then get this game, its recommended. But however, you might wish to get FFXIII first to understand the story a little more(Although FFXIII-2 itself also provides summaries of what happened in FFXIII in the premier.) I personally myself enjoyed this game, its fun, and really, a real time-battle strategy with little to no emphasize on turn-based strategy game. Basically, to sum up everything,\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10\n(This is piled alongside with the fps drop however, it does not really deter the gameplay much. But if i were to place the fps drop aside, it would be 9/10)\n\nStoryline: 8/10  (Not really bad, but sometimes, even i get kinda confused due to the time-travelling paradoxes lol)\n\nGameplay: 8/10  (This is piled alongside with the fps drop, however, it does creates minor delay which can lead to you not being able to strike first or to just lose a fight because of that slight 0.5s delay or so, and like i said, with proper handling, this is not mmuch of a problem. But if i were to place the fps drop aside, it would be 9.5/10) (This gameplay includes the battle systems, navigating in open world environment, talking to different NPCs, being able to choose your replies to certain question or in circumstances to mould your own story and so on)\n\nI'm already close to finishing the game, so i thought to give a review for those that planned to buy which yes, if you dont have a ps3 for this game(like me), you wouldn't mind much of the minor(to me) fps drops and what you want (for which what i believed) is the storyline and gameplay xD\n","December 18, 2014","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, throughout the entire time whilst playing the game, I haven't experience any lagging in performance (so far). I assume my computer specs are decent enough to run the game in "high" settings (or probably because of Razer Cortex, as I used it to boost into gaming mode so that it'll run smoothly). So yes, I never cared about looking at the FPS. The details are there - nothing like a definitive edition of sorts - I can say playing it on PC turns out like how it is back when I played on Xbox 360.\n\nI've beaten the game on the console stated previously so of course, I didn't expect any changes in the game and storyline. Everything is exactly what I anticipated. However, I wish that the Asia region would also have the chance to switch between the English and Japanese voiceovers considering that I'm so used to hearing the game in English.\n\nAll in all - I loved the game when I first started playing the demo. Loved it more when I bought the physical copy and dedicated my entire school holidays on it. Loved it most after finishing the game and replayed it to re-experience the entire story again.\n\nStill love it today after waiting for three days to download. Went on a "feels" trip subsequently. My love for this game will never fade :)\n\nGuys, Square Enix is slowly improving. They actually listened and did what we wished for. Give them a chance; they rarely port FF games from consoles to PC. Be thankful that they do.\n\nNow, I can't wait for Lightning Returns!","December 13, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also the leveling system allows a more individual set up.\nThe gameplay got less linear, there's a ton of optional stuff to do, you can play minigames etc. You even get the DLCs for free (you shouldn't miss Requiem of the Goddess: Lightning's story when you've played through the game)\nSoundtrack and music (including new tracks and some of the first part) are as always fantastic.\nThe story mainly introduces new characters, so the events and characters of the first game are mainly issued as backgroundinformation.

Yes. The graphical capabilities of this game on the PC are untrue. It runs slower than 60fps, sometimes dropping quite low in more intense battles / larger view battles. This is nota fault of anyone's PC, but how the game was programmed with the PS3 in mind, a poor architecture. It does not make use of the full capabilities of GPUs or Multi-core CPUs, therefore it will run similarly on older computers as it might on a state of the art. The software is the limit, not the hardware.\n\nThat said, I do have an older PC. I played in a 720P window at that resolution using the smallest shadow-map, and 2x MPAA. It ran alright for the most part. As I said, it had it's slow moments, but was hardly unplayable as some might have suggested. I do play modern games at post 60fps, but do not find low FPS to be a kill all. I could probably have upped the shadow and AA and still been fine. No crashes, no critical flaws to the game in that regard. I could have been lucky, but that was my experience.\n\nNow then, on to the game review itself. Would I recommend this game? Yes.\n\nThe story I find rather touching, if a little too sappy at times. I don't find it really killed the story of the first, but rather fleshes it out. The combat remains quite close to Final Fantasy 13, which is a plus, albiet there are times when I felt it was overly easy comparatively(explained later). The 'time-traveling' and 'gate-closing' mechanics give you chances to go back and redo areas to complete them differently where available. Unlike Final Fantasy 10-2, you do not need to replay the game through from the start multiple times to see everything. You will need to replay sections, but so far nothing I have seen too much repeating. The world is definitely more 'open' than it was in the first game. There is more to explore than narrow hallways. Still very closed in spaces comapred to /world maps/ in the older games, but better.\n\nNow for the things I did not care for.\n\n"Ease" of Battles:\nBattling in 13 seemed a bit more tactical than it is in 13-2. I attribute this to the libra spell which you could cast at will in the first game. In this game, there are librascopes you can find or buy for exorbitant prices about mid-game, but no actual simple libra-spell to get data on monsters initially. This means the game can't be too harsh for not paying complete attention to the monsters while you fight them. Without foreknowledge of the enemies, you just have to constantly hit them until information is revealed, often through multiple encounters. If you don't avoid fighting a long way through the game, most your 'random' battles until the very end will revolve around three commandos just nuking everything with blitz and ruinga. Auto-battle will be used overall, as very rarely do you need to worry about selecting proper skills.\n\nNot to say that there are no times it's better to manually control, especially if less than ideally leveled, but mostly that revolved around me applying proper debuffs to certain enemies. In that regard though, I felt a lot of the battles could just be brute-forced compared to 13, with only a few that it really mattered to focus on it all. Many times, if you didn't care about time too much, having a strong sentinal member(not too hard to get early on, and upgrade later) could really ease it.\n\nSpeaking of character classes...\n\nThe '3rd wheel' as it were of your 3rd party member. Rather than a single character with multiple classes, you capture and raise various monsters for the roles. Each monster only has a single role, and you can only have 'equipped' 3 monsters at a time to fill various roles. For the most part, this isn't a big deal... Raising them isn't too specifric unless you need uber monsters to help the uber enemies situation. Even then, I don't see the value in perfectly upgraded partners.\n\nAnd speaking up upgrades...\n\nThe crysterium is very lack luster to me compared to the first game. I liked how you could choose which class to level in what order in the first game, but each character would ultimately max out at a certain stat level when all was finished. In the first game, you had a max level for a given area, which forced more strategy on the player as they could no brute force it as much.\n\nThis game? Regular battles are basically infinite CP batteries. You will be maxed well before the end of the game, unless you really rush. How you level though, is is a single crysterium for all classes on each character. Depending which class you level though at different points in the crysterium(including even/odd levels on some classes) gives different bonus stats. In short, there is an ideal way of leveling each character, while others could leave you with somewhat less than great stats, depending which all you leveled. Nothing game-breaking, but if you are a perfectionist, prepare to study and research ideal leveling order.\n\nLastly, a few of the 'fragments' in the game are a real time-sink and pain to get. Grinding certain enemies to get a lot of gil to just dump. At one point, taping a button on the controller down on the slot machines just to make sure I win a certain amount over a few hourts while I browsed the web. Battling every enemy at least once, including rare enemies and some that have a 50% chance of not spawning at all on a run through an area before you have to reset the area and try again. Making sure to explore every last detail of every map for 100% completion. Just... tedium work, really.\n\n\nThat aside, I do not regret this purchase. It fixes some of the problems I had with FF13, but introduces different naggings. Despite my naggins though, I felt compelled to play it through and enjoyed the ride. A few points that were dull busy work, but overall a fun game. Just be prepared to look to the next game if you want any sort of conclusion, because this one literally pulls a Halo 2 with a "To Be Continued..."","March 31, 2015","true","62.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't forget that earlier games in the series had wise-crackin' octopi, evil warlord death trees, boats that fly you to the Moon, and yes, even time travel.\n\nMy one caveat is that I did have to tweak some settings to get the game running smoothly, but honestly that's kind of the norm for PC gaming, isn't it? Once I got it just right, my game ran without any problems.\n\nFor both players who enjoyed and disliked the first XIII title, I'd recommend giving this one a try.

Linearity is fine if the context is there. This game is linear too but hides it through optional fetch quests, a few open areas, and time traveling.\n\nAlmost every single side quest involves an NPC looking for an item in the same location but a different time period, then being amazed that you found the item that shouldn't exist. The only thing that stopped you was monsters spawning on top of you while you wasted time running around finding the floating treasure chest with the item in it.\n\nTurn the awful english dub off and make some changes to your nvidia control panel so it doesn't run at 5fps.

Interestingly it's the only time travel game I've seen to make use of string theory.\n\nAs a port, there's a severe dearth of options. Resolution, shadows, AA, and that's about it. Textures in particular look very dated and can't be adjusted, so I'd suggest finding a third party tool to force antisotropic filtering. I didn't experience any stability or framerate issues, though there was some weird behavior with alt-tabbing that required the game to be restarted.\n\nDecent enough game for the price if you have a JRPG itch.","December 30, 2014","true","71.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The only thing I was interested in was Lightning.  I read that this game fixed a lot of the problems of the first so I gave it a bash not expecting much.\n\nThis is leagues ahead of the first game.  It's back to more traditional Final Fantasy elements - proper exploration, side quests, interactive story, secrets and MOG!  I was thoroughly entertained by this game and I loved the little surprises it has!  The after-game coliseum, I can tell you, is a REAL treat for old timers of the series (very old timers, think pre-playstation).  There's Chocobo racing in a Gold Saucer tribute location along with other mini games.  Especially loved the poker!  I really appreciated the addition of Mog.  He brought humour to the rather heavy storyline.  And when the Government gives him tissue instead of Gil?  Priceless. He was just yet another nod to the fans.\n\nI was really impressed by the voice acting - especially of Noel.  Music is great too.\n\nI enjoyed Hope's character development in this one.  He annoyed me quite a bit in the first game although I warmed to him as he matured toward the end of the game.  In this installment he has fully matured, both physically and mentally and it's lovely to see how he has turned out.  He was definitely my favourite in this.\n\nThe downside is perhaps the story.  Although time travel gives this game the tools to be free for the player, it has made the XIII universe more complicated than necessary.  It often leaves more questions than answers and many things simply don't make sense.  It is better than the first game, but then it surpasses that in almost everyway.  The ending is also an epic troll - be prepared to play Lightning Returns for even a chance of satisfaction.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game, especially if you got through the first - this is your pay off.","March 21","true","78.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nowatercolours/recommended/292140/","nowatercolours","sik maems","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nowatercolours/","120 products in account","This is the game FF13 should have been. It's almost amazing how well Square Enix managed to improve upon FF13 while maintaining it's core principles and mechanics.\n\nGameplay is an improved version of FF13's paradigm/ATB combat. You still have the same roles (COM, RAV, SAB, SYN, MED, SEN) and the same maximum of 3 members in your party. Except now you have the ability to get rare drops from almost everything you fight (excluding bosses) that allow you to use said monster for your 3rd party member. This really opens up that much needed flexibility, compared to FF13 where all 6 party members were essentially the same apart from their full ATB skill. Also important to note is that there's no longer a long animation for paradigm shifting, which really feels more natural and doesn't make your characters idle for a few seconds, wasting that precious time you could be using to input commands. Characters feel less clunky and slow in their animations and you get the full combat system available very early on into the story. One of the main gripes I had with FF13 was that you were forced into the slow progression into unlocking the full capabilities of the paradigm shifting system. Other than the reasonable improvements, it's still essentially FF13's combat mechanics. You still craft higher tier-weapons with monster materials, although it's less farmy compared to FF13. Accessories take a major backseat due to a limitation being placed on the amount of accessories you can hold on one character, which different accessories having different amounts of capacity they take up. Eidolons/Summons are gone, but it's not really missed since you'd barely use them in FF13 anyway. You also get Fragment Skills, which are unlocked as you go along completing the game. These have a wide range of effects from changing monster encounter rates to opening up different endings by allowing an alternative path.\n\nThe world itself has been really revamped though. You can now jump (although you're often blocked with invisible walls in most places) and as a result, there's a lot more verticality in the map design. You aren't forced into a corridor driving you forward towards the story. Progression is done by visiting areas of varying sizes, some small, some very large, in different time periods. You'll often have the option of visiting a place multiple times in different time periods, but it's not repetitive due to the slightly altered designs and different npcs. FF13-2 still has that gorgeous visual quality from FF13. The level design really has an emphasis on creating the perfect atmosphere for the situation, It's amazing how well they managed to convey each time period of the same location so uniquely.\n\nThe story's done much better, with excellent pacing that feels natural and not forced. You unlock new locations (and time periods of that said location) within a level and progress slowly along with the story, although the locations have barely any correlation with each other. The story itself is actually done well. Characters feel natural and likable, and the main antagonist is one of the best Final Fantasy villians in recent memory. Pacing is done well since you control where and when to go and it's fairly open. It feels more like you're just going around places solving time paradoxes and moving onto the next world, which is a really nice change from FF13's forced pacing. There's plenty of optional areas to visit during the story, and the hub (Historia Crux) allows you to visit past areas instantly without having to retrace your steps.\n\nSonically, this is personally one of my favourites from the recent FF games. There's FF13 tracks, remixed FF13 tracks and new music that really helps set the tone of the game. There's beautiful orchestral tracks, well written vocals and context appropriate background music that help drive the atmosphere of each and every situation. Although I felt there were a bit too many vocals and it was definite far more than what's usually present in a FF game. Not that I'm complaining though, some of the vocal tracks are done perfectly. Naoshi Mizuta outdoes herself in Noel's Theme, which features hauntingly sombre vocals, with a simple piano and violin background. The song really encompasses the character Noel and his struggles, and it's used to really emphasise emotional scenes. The main battle theme, Paradigm Shift, is a fast paced track featuring a vibrant violin, a simple but strong drum beat and a bassy synth. It really suits the frantic but orderly nature of battles and it's colourful but subdued enough to help focus on the battle. Eclipse is another standout, with vocals acting as a backing to the sharp violins, frantic pianos and punchy bassline. Honestly, even if my terrible adjectives haven't convinced you, at least listen to the soundtrack. It's really good.\n\nAs a PC port, it's bad. Not FF13 bad, but still pretty bad. It has graphical options for resolution, anti-aliasing and shadow resolutions but nothing else. And it's not even ingame, but within a window that acts as a launcher of sorts. The EscKey=AltF4 is still here with it's warning box that's STILL a popup box outside of the game. It's 60fps, but poorly optimised so you can expect sudden drops in certain areas. Graphically, it's stunning but with few options to tinker around with. There hasn't been any bugs I've noticed though, compared to FF13 which suffered from random crashes that forced you to save at every available opportunity. As PC ports go, Square Enix still has a long way to go.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game with great visuals, an interesting time-travel based story with an optimised combat system from FF13 and a very memorable OST. Better than FF13 in every way. Easily get it if you're a fan of jRPGs, it's an excellent choice.","December 16, 2014","true","76.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

It continues to tow the line of deviation from what made the core series so great, interesting backstories and adventuring prospects and an overall cohesive main story.  Despite this it is still a better game than FFXIII, and its two main characters actually have significant character development (relative to FFXIII at least). This game although graphically stunning is lacking substance, and albeit improving on some of the linearity of FFXIII it is still not of the same caliber of  other Final Fantasy games and is a forgettable experience. That being said with the exception of some of the developments in FFXIII- Lightning returns aka. 3, much of this game can retroactively be ignored (FFXIII-Lightning returns is arguably the strongest installment in the trilogy, both gameplay and story wise). The story in this game is disjointed so much that playing Metal Gear Solid 4 before any of the others will logically make more sense than some of the components of this game.\n\nGameplay wise, its minimalist approach isn't all bad. You have two main playable characters, Serah and Noel and an captured monster that assists as a third member. The combat as a result offers more complexity than FFXIII-2 albeit still is rudimentary. The exploration involves a variety of areas, not bound by the linear connections that FFXIII's were, and as such you get more opportunities to adventure. You will have an enjoyable experience facing off against the classic assortment of FF foes and a few unique new ones. It should be noted, as stated prior that much of the cast of the previous game is not playable, and Lightning, whom I'd consider as the saving grace in FFXIII has behind the scenes role in this game, despite much of the plot relating to her. Overall the gameplay is worth picking this game up for alone, if you can tolerate the subpar storytelling and disjointed story.\n\nI can't recommend this as a Final Fantasy game, but I can recommend it as a JRPG, at its core its still an enjoyable experience that you will find investing many hours in as you continue your adventure in the FFXIII universe.","December 11, 2014","true","4.5"," 27 of 54 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","27","54","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerealman/recommended/292140/","cerealman","Harveysaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerealman/","173 products in account","Please note that I am very familiar with FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 on the PS3, hence why my playtime may not seem that great.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIII was a fairly ill-recieved game that dissapointed critics and fans alike, the Steam port of which was barrated for having next to no graphics options (thankfully, both ports now do) but it was no where near as bad as people thought. Long drawn out story, annoying characters, pesky bosses aside... it was a pretty eventful 50 hours, after which it's frankly boring narrative was summed up and we could all go home.\n\nUntil now.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIII-2 literally re-writes the ending of XIII, placing us in an entire new universe as Lightning's younger sister, Serah, and her charming companion, Noel. They join forces on a quest through time to save Lighting (who has now been erased from time. For some reason.) in the sequel that no one asked for - but it actually works.\n\nFirst thing first XIII-2 improves on alot of what XIII was lacking. Freedom is now a big part of the game, players can now choose what time zone to visit and what order they want the story to play out in - which is a very nice addition to the plot as it fuses well with the time-travel theme. The battle system remains similar, except a new feature has been added allowing you to add a monster you have collected into your party - sort of like Pokemon. You are free to customize the monster, and level it up with your party. This is a really neat feature, which opens up the battleground for new opportunities.\n\nHowever, this game comes across like it is trying to hard to be different from XIII. The narrative is convoluted and complicated - worse than the usual FINAL FANTASY formula. The different time zones and multiple (pointless) "Paradox" endings do not weave well with eachother, chances are you won't know what's going on half the time. However, unlike XIII you are thrown straight into the drama at the start of the game, no waiting about 20 hours for something to happen. And I do admit, some events in the plot did grab my attention - some of my fondest FF memories reside within XIII-2. The entire story does feel like a kick to the groin, as those 50 hours I spent in XIII are rendered pointless as almost none of it's key ideas are mentioned. You could easily pick this game up and go (it even has a plot summary of XIII.)\n\nAnother feature I enjoyed of XIII-2 is The Coliseum, a battle area in which you fight off special monsters/bosses in order to win them for your moster collection. It's a pretty neat way to level up your party, or just to have a muck around in. Most of the battles are DLC - but luckily this port comes with most of the available DLCs including the 3 story expansion packs.\n\nAll in all, FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 (like XIII) is not a bad game. It rights many of XIIIs wrongs, and certainly is a more enjoyable experience while a more confusing one.\n\n+ All DLC included. Mostly.\n+ Improves on many of FINAL FANTASY XIIIs flaws.\n+ Major improvement on XIII cast.\n+ New, enjoyable, characters.\n+ Moster collecting.\n+ Added freedom. Feels more like an RPG than any modern FINAL FANTASY.\n\n- Convoluted narrative.\n- Makes XIII feel pointless.\n- Cop-out ending. Sequel bait.\n- DLC stories unsatisfying.\n- Easy to exploit the level up system.\n- QTEs. *shivers*\n\n7/10","December 12, 2014","true","1.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

While FF13-2's battle and encounter system have been greatly improved, the flaws from FF13 are still present and hamper enjoyment of the game. The time travel element is welcome if you're, like me, a fan of the SNES classic Chrono Trigger, but wears out its welcome when it comes to collecting specific key items required to advance gameplay. You'll quickly grow tired of time-hopping in order to run across a regional map to pick up one item only to do the same thing in several other timelines. The plot is also a mixed bag and only mildly improves on its predecessor's writing, leaving me dreading the last quarter of the game or so which I only completed as I felt obligated to at that point.

I have an Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 and an Intel I7 4770k with 16 GB system RAM. The game works just fine for me, however, when I try to play the game at 1080p, I find that the FPS is highly unstable. It goes anywhere from 20-60 FPS, depending on what is going on. Prerendered cutscene: 30 FPS (although the video itself was only rendered at 30 FPS anyway). In-engine cutscene: 60 FPS. Menu: 40-60 FPS.

(Strongly recommend to play through the previous game, CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM XIII)\n\n(TL,DR: Read Pros&Cons and Overall at the bottom, I played on the console version)\n\n„Why does mankind defy its fate?”\n\nThe game takes place three years after the events of Final Fantasy XIII, and depicts the story of Serah Farron's journey across time and space to prevent the end of the world while searching for her missing sister, Lightning.\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic atmosphere\n- The battle system expanded (you can catch monsters and they fight with you as third party member)\n- Epic music (more vocals and remixed versions for pre-battle)\n- ’More openworld’ than the XIII had, side missions, puzzles, casino etc.\n- Returning characters and places (You can visit the areas in other timelines, these areas change in appearance)\n- You can replay the chapters/missions anytime you want, and you can continue your journey (this is the NewGame+)\n- Paradox (or alternate) endings\n- Epic final boss battle with one of the best FF antagonist\n- You will get all the DLCs (3 story, all Coliseum battles, outfits)\n- Still an amazing story, but...\n\nCons:\n- ...again linear and complicated (time travelling)\n- Only two playable characters (the DLCs grant you to play with Sazh, and Lightning in their own story)\n- Too easy\n- Shorter than XIII\n\nStory (AF timeline means After the Fall of Cocoon):\n\nAfter the events of XIII, Lightning gets caught by a paradoxon and taken to Valhalla, the realm of death. While everybody thinks Lightning is dead, Serah is confident that her sister is alive. Lightning will be a knight of goddess Etro, and her task to save the future from Caius Ballad, who wants to destroy the time, he is Yeul's immortal Guardian and seeks to end the suffering she sustains by being endlessly reincarnated by killing the goddess Etro. Noel Kreiss comes from the Dying World at 700 AF, where he is the last surviving human in a world that faced destruction 200 years after the Crystal Pillar’s fall and Lightning ask him to find Serah and help her reach Valhalla. In New Bodhum (on Gran Pulse) at 3 AF Noel coming to find Serah. The two encounters in an epic journey through time and space to solve the paradoxons and save the world and Lightning.\n\nWhat about with the original team? Fang and Vanille are still in the Crystal Pillar, Hope is now 24 years old and the leader of the Academy (the new capital city), Sazh and Dajh have mysteriously gone missing, Snow left to search for Lightning two years after her disappearance, and Serah stayed with the NORA at New Bodhum.\n\nBattle:\n\nThe battle system returns from XIII, you are able to switch the party leader during battle, the third party member will be a monster that will fight along with you with their own role (One monster = One role) and you can upgrade them (new abilites, better stats). It’s okay because three monsters can be held at a time, and automatically switch to the role a player shifts to in the paradigm. The Crystarium system returns too, with levels not with tiers. A new form of damage, called Wound Damage, lowers a target's member's max HP during battle and can only be healed by items, giving further incentive to defeat enemies as quickly as possible. If the current party leader is KO'd, the party leader is automatically switched to the other human character. The defeat of the human characters in the party results in a game over.\n\nPlaytime (My first walkhthrough):\nStory: 32 hours (ofc with cutscenes)\n100%, All achievements, all (160) fragments, best chocobo for racing: 63 hours\n\nOverall:\n\nFor me this game 10/10, if I need to compare to the other FF games then 8/10, the story not better than the XIII’s story, but the atmosphere is better and the battles are exciting, there will be people who like this game more than the previous.\n\nIf you loved the first installment, you will love this one too, if you hated you will be disappointed again, don’t buy it then. That's a pity, because I think it promises adventure not to be missed, despite its flaws.\n\nIf you liked the game, I can recommend the finale of the trilogy: Lightning Returns.\n\nThanks for reading!\n","December 11, 2014","true","19.3"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","2"

I'm running at 1440p. I'd say for a game essentially made for CELL architecture and quickly ported to pc it runs "fine." As long as you don't leave fraps up and count frames you'll see there is nothing immersion breaking abou the framerate drops. It's about what you're used to from the 360 generation. I can imagine it's frustrating for guys that want this game to be as well optimized as a AAA game like BF4 with pc as it's lead platform, but it's not going to happen. We're getting a game for $20 that's a AAA console game that essentially has many games on pc that cost much more than this beat. I'd support this on the chance FF XV could come to pc one day. I would appreciate it if Square made the effort to have released this on pc at launch as it seemed like was intended, but whatever. It stands up to current games.\n\nIf I update this review, I'll tell you about how I've been enjoying this game so far. Luckily people can go on about this being linear because it's Final Fantasy alright, it just has much better graphics than you're used to so they're went through a period of adjustment and they're almost there as far as emotional impact and complexity of the game. Music is great too.\n\nDon't expect this to feel anything like an American game. It feels like a Japanese game, like Sonic or Mario, but of course the rpg version. It won't feel like The Witcher or Dragon Age.","December 12, 2014","true","160.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tatsuhoshi/recommended/292140/","Tatsuhoshi","Tatsuhoshi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tatsuhoshi/","3071 products in account","There seems to be a lot of hate for this game stemming from largely unimportant technical issues versus actual game quality, so let me give my two cents as an avid gamer with a very diverse array of games and technical knowledge.\n\nLet me start off by saying that this is a console to pc port.  While this game, as all games are, have been developed on a pc, it was developed, originally, for an entirely different type of hardware, so you can't just take your pc dev source and throw that on a computer and call it a day.  While there are some technical issues, they are largely minor and unnoticeable with a few exceptions.  I'll cover all of that in detail below.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game uses a similar combat system to its predecessor, FFXIII, in that rather than micromanaging every move of your team, they learn from their combat experience and adjust their fighting on their own, you simply tell them what role to fill in the party by changing your party paradigms.  While this means a whole lot less button pushing and decision-making as far as battles go, it makes for a more casual gameplay experience and allows battles to be conducted in real-time.  For those of you that still want the final say in what is done how and where to what, you can select the abilities individually through the combat menus.  I don't suggest doing this on boss fights, as a note.\n\nThe game is split between exploring maps, battling monsters, and dialogue.  As far as the story goes, they have a lot of interesting bits.  There IS a solid story to be told and you are fed it through a myriad of time-jumps and side quests.  You could, of course, straightline the story and be done with the game in a few hours, but you'd be missing out on a lot of the depth of the story and information.  Take the time to explore the world, do the side quests, and you will be rewarded for the experience with a rich plot that is severely downplayed in reviews.  Once Serah grows a spine and takes up sword and bow for her sister's sake, she's a certifiable badass, and, something new from the previous game, you actually have a say in the stories, deciding what she says or asks at critical points to affect the information and reactions of the npcs.\n\nThe party mechanics are pretty different now.  Serah and Noel are your only real party members and you can swap between which of them leads freely.  The third party slot is filled by tamed monsters, each which has a specific role and can be evolved along the crystarium at the cost of item drops.  This mechanic is a bit odd, but not unwelcomed.  There's a lot to be said for a Behemoth mowing down your enemies along side the mains.  There are some battles where the characters from the first game assist, such as a battle alongside Snow fairly early on, but I wish there would have been some of that for some of the newer npcs, like Alyssa, who you run into repeatedly and even voices an interest in the party's actions and time travel.\n\nControls:\nDon't use mouse and keyboard.  Sure, they work, and they will get you through some stuff, but they are a bit awkward and clunky.  The convenience of a controller is that all the controls for the game are easily accessible and don't require reaching across your keyboard and hitting the wrong button during a crucial moment, or simply losing track of where your fingers are on the keyboard.  I am very accustomed to keyboard/mouse controls....get a controller.  It will make your life easier and many games benefit from the ease of access of the buttons you need in your hand.\n\nAudio:\nI applaud Squeenix for this whole-heartedly.  For those of you who like the english voice cast (which they did do an amazing job of casting, I might add), the game offers the usual English release as seen on the consoles.  For those of you who prefer to hear the original voices, you can choose the original voice track from the Japanese version of the game.  If you know Japanese, you'll here some inconsistencies between the dialogue and the subtitles that are curious, but for the most part, both are solid and you won't miss anything one way or the other.\n\nThe music for this game is very easy to listen to.  Though the battle theme is repetitive and a bit obnoxious at times, especially as frequently as you end up in battles, the rest of the soundtrack during exploration is beautiful and well done.  Rather than simply extending the soundtrack a little from the previous game, there are only a few familiar songs from XIII, and most of the music for XIII-2 is new.  Nice vocals sung in English (for the most part) help add to the story as the songs are actually relevant to the plot in their weirdly Engrish way.  I wish the soundtrack was available for this on Steam as well.\n\nGraphics:\nHere's the bit where things get dicey.  The game is fantastically beautiful and well-worth exploring.  That said, the game's requirements are fairly punishing on most middleweight/moderate systems.  The game runs beautifully on my desktop (3.4ghz AMD Quad-Core, 16gb RAM, Crossfired 6870s), with no measurable issues.  All those people complaining about frame rates dropping to unplayable levels are either experiencing hardware incompatibility issues or other OS-related issues (such as background processes, viruses and malware, or everyone's friend, System Idle Process) ...or are simply first-worlders with no real concept of what unplayable is and are just whining for attention and because things aren't perfect for them.  Nothing is going to be perfect and this title is no exception to that rule.  It IS playable.\n\nMy laptop struggles a bit more with the game, on the other hand, but the issues are so minor that I still have no real unplayable moments.  The game engine is built with an internal frame-skipping mechanic that mitigates lower end systems, something I don't think many people have noticed.  While the game may not be running 30frames per second, it does it's best to keep it as close to 23 as it can.  I have no complaints with this.  Even when the count drops below this, the game is still playing smoothly thanks to the frame skipping with only a little bit of lag during the visually stunning spells, like Thundaga and Ruinga.  It's running a 3.2ghz AMD Quad-Core, 8gb RAM, and HD6650 video card.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nThis game is worth the money.  At $20, its not like Squeenix is trying to milk a new market, plus we get most of the DLC at no additional cost.  The only thing that they could have thrown in to make it a better deal would have been the soundtrack.  Sure, the game may occasionally drop in performance a little bit at times, but it's never bad enough that the game can't be played and the gameplay experience is not bad.  I'm playing Final Fantasy on my computer and I'm very happy for the experience.\n\nAs a side note, I do own both games on consoles, so I am aware of how they play there.  I can't pack up my console and take it on a roadtrip like I can do with my laptop, however, and as often as I'm on the road or in a position that I CAN'T play my consoles, this is a nice and welcome option.","December 18, 2014","true","65.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

I'll highlight the worst parts of it, but first I want to make clear that any of it's many infractions would be sufferable were it not for the horrendousness of the "story."  Most of it simply makes no sense, but from what I can gather, there are time travelling asteroid anomolies from other dimensions.  This might seem strange, but in the game world, everyone is an expert on time anomolies, because you know... this stuff happens every day.  Honestly, my five year old niece could have written a more cogent and engaging story.\n\nCombat.  They took everything that was good about FFXIII's system out, and left us with everything we wish they'd improved upon.  Nothing you do matters.  I got through most of the fights in this game by simply setting my controller down, going into the kitchen and making myself a beverage while the NPCs finished the fight for me.  I got all the way to the end area this way, but then the enemies became so much more powerful that I've had to go back and grind these meaningless battles for hours upon hours to build up enough hit points to survive the end boss' attacks.\n\nSaving.  You can save anywhere, but evidently the time anomolies have infected the game's save system, because it routinely takes 2-5 minutes to save my game.\n\nPacing.  Everything takes twice as long as it should.  There are load screens to load the load screens for the animations.  This game has more in common with a kaleidoscope than anything else.\n\nCharacters.  Utterly forgettable.  Whatever their motives are, I don't even care.  I stopped listening hours ago.\n\nSo in closing, if you enjoyed FFXIII as I did, be content to stop there.  This game does nothing to add to the game's world, story, or legacy.  Instead spend your $20 on some glass shards and salt to roll your eyes around in.  The experience will be similar, but will take up less of your life.","January 20","false","33.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","6","13","5","0"

As a response, Square-Enix released a sequel that promised to fix everything that was wrong with the previous game. Did it work?\n\nYeah....sorta.\n\nThe first thing that is immediately apparent with the game is that there is no longer any linearity.In fact, the game is the opposite of XIII, with both the story and game systems taking a free-form approach, allowing you to level your characters the way you want, and tackle the story chapters with quite a bit of degree of freedom, though this freedom also means there's some tedious back&forth in some sections.\n\nSpeaking of story...it's still nonsensical, with a LOT of reading done through datalogs to get the gist of it,like XIII was.Liked it more than XIII, but that's mostly due to being a sucker for sci-fy plots (like time-travel), and for  That ending.\n\nGraphically, the game's a bit worse than XIII, but nothing serious that could distract you.Some places look just as great as XIII did (Academia looks pretty gorgeous). Graphical Settings are a exact carbon copy from XIII, with nothing to set both of 'em apart in that regard (patch for XIII released at the same time as this released). The performance did change though...for the worse. This game runs even worse than XIII did, on the exact same hardware.\n\nI usually don't mention audio, but Final Fantasy games in general are known to have good soundtracks, and XIII & XIII-2 are no exceptions. Special mention goes to that ridiculous chocobo metal song, it's just too silly to not like it!\n\nSo, the tl,dnr: improved sequel marred yet again by performance issues. Buy it if you're a fan &/or is on sale.\n\nPS: Same regional restrictions that applied to XIII applies here.

That was a great game, story was entertaining and interesting, it has good character development and a range or characters to establish connections with through the game, here is a different story.\n\nIm gonna start with Serah (stupid spelling), i never liked her character in ff13, she seemed like the demsel in distress and that is a pathetic character role. Here she starts off just like thats to quote "Lightning help me" while she cowers.... she changes almost instantanious into a more confident ♥♥♥♥ing Blues Clues lets see what we can find here ♥♥♥♥. She is essentially Vanille from FF13.\n\nNoel is basically a male lightning with a bit better people skills, doesn't have the keep up or die attitude that lightning had at the start of FFXIII. I don't know why but they are doing the typical bs of drip feeding background information to the player has if Noel knows all the answers from the start and wants to keep them to himself to quote chapter 3, He sees this device and straight away goes how did you get that? knowing full well what it is and what it does then plays it off that he only mildly read about it and isnt that well known on the subject..... what an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow the story, this feels so tacked on to make money its not funny. Its like they had no idea where to go from 13 so they just chose the lazy option and was like TIME TRAVEL!!! yep that solves every ♥♥♥♥ing issue. Because you time travel there is literally no flow to the game. You start off in your normal timeline then jump a head a little then a little more then just 200 years etc. I just doesnt seem rewarding when you finish an area and it just takes you back to a menu to pick the next time zone or a previous time zone to replay. I think sure if you missed something or want to go back to collect everything possible,  that is useful but as far as creating a flowing story it feels like a stop everytime you finish a level and its like do i want to pick this up again? I know the next mission is just gonna be go here, talk to them, kill that, collect an artifact and rinse and repeat. It just doesnt feel fun, doesnt feel like there is an actual story, or cut scenes, havn't seen many pre rendered cut scenes like FF is famous for. Now i havn't finished the game yet because im strougling to stay interested in this game.\n\nPuzzles, I believe that since they didn't have to worry about writing a proper story they could put more content into the game, being these "Temperal Paradoxs". Well I suppose they are more like distractions from the main story and have very little depth involved in completed them.\n\nthe crystaium I find now is just a mess comapred to 13 where you had those floating crystals and then the circles around them, now you just press A (playing with a controller) and you level up your class.\n\nthe lack of characters in this game and replacing your 3rd character with a monster is both creative but takes away from any possible character development you might make being that once again THERE IS NO ACTUAL STORY LINE HERE and by adding more characters to this would almost make it worse because your Moogle is basically your 3rd character and it is just Serah's weapon (makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense, typical jrpg kawaii stuff).\n\nFF13 started of straight away with action and good character development, its just ♥♥♥♥ing kawaii ♥♥♥♥ with Serah being a pathetic character Noel being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ drip feeding the player information to prolong the NON EXSISTANT STORY and there Moogle which has almost NO pressance in 13 but is now appropriate for 13-2.\n\nthe port is just god awful, im running a superclocked 970 gtx and when i ran this on 1080p 8k shading, this raining mission towards the start of the game gave me 10fps.....................................\ni rate this 2/10 cause FF has decent hair modelling.","December 4, 2015","false","8.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","2"

Even though it's a port and it's short compared to the previous title, I had no issues with it on my PC; it ran smoorthly and it only crashed once, and I enjoyed playing it. The game is pretty good; I honestly liked FF-13 more, but 13-2 wasn't bad. The story was alright, it was confusing at first but it all makes sense by the end. Although, I didn't really feel anything by the end, whereas at the end of FF-13, I felt a tiny bit emotional. It felt like they made a huge game and spilt it into two parts; the second being Lighting Returns. So, I was like "meh, that's it?" at the end.\n\nGraphics are great, nothing really to say about it. The music was perfect as it usually is with a Square Enix game. Gameplay was good, but I still don't get why I have to grind, even for a tiny bit, in a single player game. I couldn't be bothered leveling my party past stage 14 and I didn't need to because I beat the final boss with ease. I still had a few side missions to do to get more fragments, but I couldn't be bothered since it has no effect on the story what so ever.\n\nOverall, it's a great final fantasy game, not the best, but pretty decent. I defintely recommend buying it, especially if it's on sale. It's worth your time if you're a FF fan. Ignore all those negative reviews; those people either play on ancient PC's or are obsessed with the past and are unwilling to accept change to the franchise.","October 10, 2015","true","40.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oneironaut/recommended/292140/","Oneironaut","Oneironaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oneironaut/","1659 products in account","You played FFXIII and want to know if this one is worth playing?  That depends on what you did and didn't like about XIII\nI'll compare the two games some to give you an idea of how the sequel changed up the formula.\n\nLinearity:\nXIII-2 is much more open than the first game.  Each area can be explored and has hidden objects to discover, there are also occasionally different enemy types for different parts the zones.  There are less unique locations than the first game, but I think the openness of the areas makes up for it.\n\nParty members:  There are 2.  The first game had 6 characters to choose from and while many parts forced you into specific configurations of party members, there were times that you had a choice of how to compose your party.  XIII-2 only has two human party members and the third slot is for monster party members that you capture and level up sort of like pokemon.  There is quite a bit of depth to this mechanic, but I still would have liked some extra speaking party members.\n\nCombat:  Largely unchanged.  Big improvements are the ability to continue fighting a battle when your party leader dies, and the ability to change leader mid-battle.  Some of the SAB and SYN abilities appear to be missing, making those roles a bit more simplified(Those skills may be present in monster party members that I haven't used yet)\n\nMonsters are not sitting out of the world in this game, at least for the most part.  They act more like the random encounters of older JRPGs, with the exception that you can still occasionally avoid them after they have spawned by running away.  I feel like this is a better system because it mostly prevents you from farming a single enemy over and over like the optimal CP grind in the first game which ultimately led to me giving up on its endgame.\n\nCrafting:  I disliked the crafting system in the previous game, largely because it wouldn't tell you which items were required to improve weapons, and it had no indicator to show when a piece of equipment was at it's max level or could be upgrading another rank.  XIII-2 has solved these problems but also has a much simpler system which lost some of the depth that could have been.  A vendor sells you new weapons in exchange for crafting materials and occasionally an old weapon too.\n\n\nStory:\nI found FFXIII's story to be enjoyable but also easily forgettable.  I didn't think any of the characters were well written or very likable(except for maybe Saszh) and only a few months later I barely remember any of the major plotpoints.  XIII-2 is much the same case, There are parts of the story that I liked, but the character dialogue was mostly bland and often grating.  In particular I found one of the main characters very unlikable, and with no option to remove him from my party I had to play the entire game with him.\n\nEndgame:  I find that I am enjoying XIII-2's end game much more than that of the previous game.  The path to max level is almost over and I have just been going around doing quests for fragments with barely any true grinding. There is a lot to do with the monster party members that I have not done yet; that appears like it could get grindy later on.  I haven't fought any of the hardest bosses in either game yet, but for XIII-2 I do think I will end up doing that, while I don't know if I can stand the grind in XIII long enough to get there.\n\nNew Things:\nPuzzles:  There are some puzzles that are required to be completed in certain areas, and for the most part I found these ranged for boring and unenjoyable to frustrating and unenjoyable.  I think at this point that I've finished all of the puzzles in the game, and I didn't find one of them to be enjoyable at all, and I enjoy playing puzzle games occasionally.\n\nHidden objects:  There are a lot of hidden objects to find in the game for 100% completion.  Fragments are mostly tied to quests but occasionally hidden throughout the game world.  There is an indicator to show you how many you are missing in a particular area, and I've been enjoying hunting these down.  I find them much more interesting than the less varied Ci'eth stone missions from the first game.\n\nThen there are the wild artefacts which I ended up hating.  These are hidden objects that must be found to access certain areas.  Most of them I found during regular play, but after beating the game I still had a few that I hadn't found, and with no indicator hinting at which zone they might be in, I had to mindlessly comb every area I had been to looking for the last few.  I finally did manage to find them all, but I found the task very frustrating.  It feels like the developers might have been assuming that players would just go online for a guide for these, but I prefer to avoid outside assistance when possible.\n\nOverall I enjoy it and if you enjoyed the first game you may very well enjoy this one as well.  It still has many of the flaws that drove away hardcore Final Fantasy fans, but some of those were fixed.\n\n","December 20, 2014","true","54.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

There is a nice amount of different locations and some areas are the same location but in a different time period.\n\n+Good music overall and some tracks are superb. Like these:\nParadigm Shift\nNoel's Theme\n\n+The narrative is very focused compared to the muddled mess in the original. This is mostly thanks to there only being a handful of main characters.\n\n+The villian is great, you completely understand why he is doing the things he does.\n\n+The combat is a lot better this time around while still feeling like the same system:\n+When you changed your partys roles in the orignal game there was a animation that took you out of the battle for about 2         seconds, this might not seem like a big deal but removing this animation and just letting the battle flow like it was before does a lot to improve the pacing of fights in this game.\n+If the character you are controlling dies you just take control of the other person in your party. This was lacking in the  original game and it is very nice to see them address this problem.\n+You can also change what character you are controlling mid battle, a very welcome addition.\n\n+The leveling system is actually very open to customization compared to the linear mess in the original. If you want to you could go through the entire game without ever getting the ability to heal. Not that I would reccomend it but it's awesome that you can do that.\n\n+You have 2 characters that are stuck in your party and a third slot open for a monster that you have tamed. You can tame most of the monsters in the game and every monster has its own abilites and base stats. I say base stats because you could have 2 "Behemoth" monsters but level them up completely differently. You can also find a lot of cosmetic items for the monsters, including hats. Each monster also has a unique limit break ability.\n\n+There is loads of optional content. Through the story you will be collecting "Fragments" to unlock new locations and time periods. You get these items by doing side quests and just finding them in chests. When I finished the game I only had 36 out of 160. So if you want to, you could spend a lot of time with this game.\n\n+This time around they included some actual graphics options. Including resolution, MSAA up to 16x and shadow resolution.\n\n+The game CAN run at 60 fps but...\n\n+There is dual audio, I played it in english and everyone was fine except for Lightning. She has less peronality than Microsoft Sam. Good thing Lightning only has about 10 minutes of screentime in the entire game.\n\n+Weapon system is better than in the original. In the original you could upgrade your weapons meaning that if you just kept upgrading your original weapon you had no reason to ever buy a new one. And because of the effort and gil needed to upgrade a single weapon you literally had no reason to ever get a new weapon. In this one you get access to new weapons in the shop the further you progress in the game, some are just a straight up upgrade, stat wise anyway. But other weapons have special abilites stuck to them but these require some additional items aswell as gil to be bought. All in all it's a straightforward system but at least it works, unlike the original.\n\n+Game leads nicely into XIII-3.\n\nCons: -Time travel elements are very "It's magic I ain't got to explain ♥♥♥♥", but then the characters waste a lot of time in cutscenes talking about how it works and it just ends up wasting time.\n\n-The combat is still very much a case of just switching your classes to match the situation and pressing the "Auto" button. There was only one time in the game where I actually selected commands and that was because I was against an enemy that had health regen but my character refused to cast poison with auto.\n\n-You can't control your characters in battles. This can be really annoying in a lot of different sittuations, like when you have somebody as a tank with the ability to divert enemy attention to themselves and the party just stands around really close to each other, as a result everyone gets hit regardless. This defeats the entire purpose of a system that works in a 3D space.\n\n-Story was okay at best but a lot of time was wasted on nonsensical time travel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and in the end it just came down to "X thing is a paradox, we must kill/fix it!". X often being just a random boss enemy in the area. The story was more interesting when it focused on the stories of Ciaus, Yuel, Serah and Noel.\n\n-The game has very unstable framerate. I never dropped under 30 though, nonetheless it can be very annoying to watch as the framerate jumps all over the place.\n\n- The game crashed at least once every 2 hours. The biggest time lost as a result was 1 hour. Regardless, this was very annoying and by doing a short google search I can see that I am not the only one with this issue.\n\n-This time around there are minigames, something lacking from the original but all of them are luck based and some are even locked behind DLC.\n\nConclusion:I must admit I wasn't excpecting much out of this game but all the non-linearity and freedom came as a big surprise.\nWith loads of optional content, much improved combat system and non-linearity in almost every aspect, this game is actually worth playing unlike the original. As long as you are fine with a combat system that is very simplistic and a story that makes little to no sense.\n\nI will likely edit this review soon if I forgot to talk about something.","December 21, 2014","true","30.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Shockingly terrible.  Endless, un-skippable cut-scenes and dialogue.  Why would I want to skip them in a story RPG?  Because they are astonishingly bad.  The direction of the film/cut-scenes are dreadful such that you have no idea what is going on.  The dialogue is so dreadful that the game-start intro sequence (that is identical to the unskippable) intro animation was better without the words.  Every sentence is, every single one is doom, foreboding and portent to a level indistinguishable from parody (but no-one is laughing)  You remember how the characters in old final fantasy games looked like whiny, poetry writing children but then usually turned out to be funny and violent? The characters in this game look *and* act like the most irritating of teenager stereotypes.  CINEMATIC ACTION! or real-time-events blah, blah  its fun looking at the instruction during a cut scene so that i do not see any of the action.\n\nThe action combat system combines the  necessary elements of real-time and turn based action such that all possible fun is removed.  The combat action is also almost hidden by camera angles, camera movement and interface elements.\n\nThe characters speak every (awful) line in a way that is so slow and ponderous no further slowdown seems possible before encountering humorous audio-processing effects.  All final fantasy villains  have looked goth and androgynous - this cain guy here manages to look as physically harmless as the most anodyne of pre-teen pop 'stars' .  I literally could not tell in the 'voiceless' opening that he was supposed to be the villain as there is nothing threatening about him whatsoever (even when dropping mountains onto people).\n\nDuring one of the 'interactive' periods it is also apparent that the game environment is as tedious as the characters and the plot.\n\nI am mystified as to how this game can be so bad\n\n...and that *THIS* is the superior sequel !!!!!\n\ni love jrpgs.

Possibly the only redeeming qualities of XIII-2.  Okay and maybe the music.  XIII was a full, flagship title game; XIII-2 and LR feel like they were created by a third-party using assets that were not included in the original XIII.  The developers even stated in interviews that they had enough material leftover from XIII to create another game.  Well, guess what, this is what you get; sloppy story written to fit the usable assets rather than build assets for a decent story.  Time travel can be an excellent tool in storytelling but it can also be an excuse for developers to reuse the same environment but give it a different name.  They did try to make this game seem appealing, and it would be, for, say, people who have never played a above average RPG.  While I did not run into many issues other players have reported a number of issues with the port on the community hub page.  Sadly as a whole the experience was not very memorable for me but for someone new to FF - maybe.  And cripes would it have killed them to change or even modify the model of the treasure spheres??\n\nPros:\na) Mog & Chocolina\nb) You can throw mog\nc) You get to see all the assets that could have been in XIII\nd) Cinematic cutscenes\ne) Couple of nice music tracks\n\nCons:\na) Messy story (if you were expecting romance, sorry to disappoint)\nb) Barely any Lightning\nc) Few new monsters (reused the same models/animations from XIII)\nd) Gimmicks/time sinks in place of good storytelling (coliseum, casino, quizzes, weather changes, 100% map collection)\ne) Changes as a result of time travel not tied to the main story are superficial, no significance, minimal impact (you don't get to see the results of the change and quite frankly aren't given many opportunities to make change)\nf)  Spawn rates are far too frequent to let you just enjoy the game; you never become truly immersed\ng) lazy end game; at one point it literally turns into a platformer with respawn by falling into void space (FML)\nh) Poor character development","January 29","false","49.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I've seen a lot of people saying they're getting hard framerate issues with aparently high end rigs. Better than my rig, that's for sure. However, a lot of issues that others are having on better rigs aren't that bad on mine. I think that's a matter of tinkering with the game to get what you want out of it. While I don't hit 60 fps that other people can (occasionally), my fps is pretty stable, with it rarely ever dropping into an 'unplayable' state, and even when it does, it resolves itself rather quickly. This is running at fullscreen at 1600x900 resolution. I could probably get even better fps by putting it to a lowe resolution, but I find the framerate to be playable almost all the time. I feel that a large number of problems when it comes to the game's fps can be solved, or at least minimized, by just messing with the settings and seeing what works for your system. Remember that sometimes you can't just go by your specs (i.e. there's some games that I tend to run better with higher settings rather than with lower ones). Also, as dumb as it might sound, remember to close your other open programs when you're running a game that demands more out of your system. Freeing up RAM is extremely important, as the game will have more resources to work with when carrying out tasks\n(Just a note, I can't even run Skyrim at 60 fps [though it still runs with a stable framerate], yet I run FFXIII-2 better than a number of people who can. I don't know what it says about me or my machine, but it definitely says that the people complaining about technical problems could definitely do a bit of work on their own before blaming everything on the game)\n\nOn Graphics\nFor reference, my game graphic settings are as follows:\nFull-Screen Display Mode\n1600x900 Resolution\n512x512 Shadow Resolution\nx2 Anti-aliasing (the minimum. I'd turn it off if I could)\nA number of people have complained about low resolution stuff. One in particular stated that the graphics all looked blurry above 1280x720p resolution. As I stated before, I run the game in full screen at 1600x900p and I don't get this at all. If anything, I would recommend turning down anti-aliasing (AA). It may sound counter-intuitive, but the point of AA is to smooth out images. If the texture resolutions are low, higher AA means it'll be trying to smooth textures even beyond what they 'need' (as dictated by the player), and can actually be the cause of blurry textures. Try turning AA down to fix the blurry texture problem if you seem to have that (As a plus, this can also improve your frame rate!)\n\nOn Story/Characters\nThere's a number of reviews on this matter, but a few in particular stuck out to me. One was about Serah's 'feminization', complaining how she's weaker than Noel, and more delicate/feminine, unlike her sister. First off, Serah's not really a fighter, she wasn't in the military like Lightning, and Noel survived in a wilderness. How can you expect her to match up to those? That's from a story perspective. In game, her stats aren't as high in strength, sure, but she has a higher magic stat and can perform just as well as noel in battle if you focus on building up her starting strength in magic. Don't forget class passives either, Commando gets a damage boost, if you have Noel Commando and Serah Ravager (like I did), of course Serah's not going to have as much damage output... initially. Don't forget that classes like the ravager can still target weak points that one like the commando can't, allowing them to gain even more damage output than even the commando's damage bonus gives.\nSorry, got on a tangent there.\nA more common complaint is that the characters are flat, and the story is lacking as well.\nAs far as characters go, I think the main reason for this complaint is that there simply aren't that many steady characters that you can compare Serah and Noel to. As characters, I think they're fine. The problem lies in that they're the only characters that remain constant. In a larger group / party of characters, such as in Final Fantasy XIII, there's a lot more variety in personality, allowing for a lot more dynamic in the group as a whole. With just two people, they can't cover as much ground as the larger group can, and so, they seem flat by comparison. That's my spin on the whole thing.\nAs for story, one thing I've seen a few times is that it doesn't make sense for them to be jumping around at random to reach Lightning. My response is: They have no idea how to get to her beyond through the portals they're using. There's no set way to get into Valhalla (as far as I've seen in the game yet). Noel got there by a prayer, quite literally. There was some outside intervention that brought him there, and he has no idea how to do it on his own, aside from knowing that the portals are somehow the way there. What else CAN they do beyond working through this network of portals and hope they find the right one? Besides, them magically winding up on the proper portal early on makes for a short and boring game. If they had an easier way to it, then you can bet even more people would be complaining about the game being short.\nThe rest of the story, how things play out and such. Early on, you don't get too much about the world. For one, the game IS a sequel, you're expected to have at least some basic prior knowledge of the world and its events before playing it. Even if you aren't, there's a system in the game DEDICATED to providing lore about the world around you. Even without prior knowledge, you can get a decent look at the world just by reading through the data logs. And besides, if you got all the information at the start, there's no mystery or intrigue. That makes for a far more boring game than a somewhat convulated story. At least a convulated story gives you something to think about as you play through it, rather than handing everything to you on a silver platter.\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, but I'll leave it there for fear of this becoming a pure rant.\n\nMy Personal Thoughts\nOverall, I liked the game. I liked the characters, the world, the combat, everything. Though I may be somewhat biased, as I like the Final Fantasy games and Square Enix a lot. I'll admit, sometimes I do wish I could get higher frames, but that's mostly an issue of me finding the optimal setup, and my system IS somewhat bogged down by a variety of things. I'll admit, the game gets tedious at times, but that's to be expected of a JRPG.","February 15, 2015","true","21.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Gameplay feels a lot more like you get to choose what you want to do next (at least at some points). Downside is that you're limited to fighting with your main characters + pet but that's only a minor bummer. You'll probably like this if you're into RPGs.

They know these games run like crap but refuse to properly patch them. On PC, FF13 was "playable"for the most part, and I finished it. FF13-2 on the other hand is a choppy mess. It's frame rates are so bad that I honestly don't think I can finish the game. I've supported Square for over 20 years and I've decided not to buy from SE again unless they can get their sh*% together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack.

I'm also not keen on the monsters  management / collection thing, if they operated like a pet bear or wolf that happens to level up and you get clear choices / abilities on how they can aid you then great but it all feels a little too microey to me.\n\nOverall, great music and visuals, interesting concept and some improvements in places but it just feels a little overlay complicated and not easy to play (in terms of flow not difficulty).

The performance, at least on my machine (8gb ram, i5 2500, geforce 970, SSD HDD) is the same and sometimes even worse then FF 13-1, the grafic settings seem like ripped from Durantes mod, the Loading screens remind me of the ps1, really? I have to load 30 seconds on a SSD just to be in another cutscene 10 seconds later? Skip this! SKIP THIS ONE!

Oh, and the +50% ATB rate weapons are OP, totally OP. Since you get them, there isn't anything else worth looking when it comes to weapons (MAYBE +1 ATB weapons for that 6 ATB segments action lol)\nStory: Interesting, yet somewhat disappointing and too short for my taste (when this game was coming out, I was hoping for the title that would be like FFX-2 was to FFX). Tbh I liked FFXIII's story better despite its linear feel, but it does not mean FFXIII-2 sucks in that regard. It has some awesome and funny moments, plus you decide what to do next (you can techically get ~140 fragments before beating the main plot, but that would make the final boss battle laughable considering the amount of CP you will acumulate throughout the game). Overall, it's damn dark compared to the first title and, let's be honest, how many FFs are there where the "bad guys" actually win?\nAs for the DLCs, PLAY'EM! the boss battles are a lot better than the main story (read "more difficult").\nReplayability: The amount of combinations that there is when it comes to Serah/Noel stats is just astonishing. Every player is able to create his/her own, unique character setup with the new CP system, that does not make your characters unstoppable. Each development strategy has its strenghts and weaknesses, and leads to different late game scenario, which is shaped by person's individual needs when progerssing though the game, A BIG PLUS for that.\n\nIs this game better than FFXIII? In some ways, yes\nDo I like it? YES\nIs it my favorite FF? Nope, that title goes to FFX\nWould I recomment it? If you've played FFXIII and liked it, ABSOLUTELY\nScore:\nchocobo/10","May 13, 2015","true","77.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite very mixed reviews, I find the combat system (essentially carried over from FF XIII) is still challenging and fun, and the new twist with "capturable/trainable" monsters was interesting and fresh. Like the previous title, however, the storyline is still bland and the characters too formulaic to be likable. The Steam version also comes with all the DLC from the console version, however it's only unlocked after the main story ends, so while it looked pretty interesting I just couldn't bring myself to complete it. After 60+ hours spent on the storyline, I couldn't muster the courage to keep playing.","June 13, 2015","true","70.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's just, so bad. This game is bad. Nobody matters. Nothing matters. There is never anything compelling about any of these people. Their hair looks like a fever dream involving Dokken and Poison. No more bad FFs, squaresoft. I'm not getting the third one, this is turd number two in a three turd trilogy I reckon.\n\nThis is CGI quality gaudy floral wallpaper. It is boring and overdone to such a degree that the thing becomes an offense, so much of a waste of time of clearly-talented people, but to what end? They get talent and THIS is what happens? Artists unable to resist adding yet another strand of impossibly boyant purple hair...\n\nSo glad somebody else is in charge of FFXV, maybe it'll have a chance.\n\nOn top of the actual game itself being just miserable and stupid, this is also a very bad port and despite having a PC that makes Geralt look like he's about to kill a monster standing behind me in my room, the performance of this PS3-quality game is pretty bad. Lots of framerate drops, and even some crashes to sprinkle in there. There are no "Advanced" options for PC, either, it's just the most bare-bones effort - they didn't care about this port's quality any more than they cared about making a good game, I guess?","December 11, 2015","false","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now you can control wild monsters to fight along side you. I didn't like the backtracking, there's a part in the game that you must collect graviton cores and for that you must do sidequestss to collect fragments to open the right gates to then collect the graviton cores needed, that means some sidequests must be done to progress the main story. The story is great and the soundtrack is even better. The port for the PC however is very bad, no graphical options, just 2 resolutions, no sound options, capped at 30 fps, etc. So, I played the game with 15fps till the end.\n\nScore: 8/10.","November 20, 2015","true","68.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite very mixed reviews, I find the combat system (essentially carried over from FF XIII) is still challenging and fun, and the new twist with "capturable/trainable" monsters was interesting and fresh. Like the previous title, however, the storyline is still bland and the characters too formulaic to be likable. The Steam version also comes with all the DLC from the console version, however it's only unlocked after the main story ends, so while it looked pretty interesting I just couldn't bring myself to complete it. After 60+ hours spent on the storyline, I couldn't muster the courage to keep playing.","June 13, 2015","true","70.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sexualyes/recommended/292140/","sexualyes","Ragnar Grundlegrinder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sexualyes/","17 products in account","Quality of port: very bad, low fps, needs to be heavily adjusted by the user to get any sort of quality out of, assuming thats even possible for casual users. The quick-time events are all coded in keyboard keys, but if you switch to an xbox controller, it doesn't give you an option to change it to xbox symbols, so you are left to figure out wtf backspace is on your controller.\n\nQuality of game: had me at first. thought it had a really interesting concept, but after i progressed through the game, it turned into one of the most tedious and frustrating things ive ever played. Key items you NEED to have in order to progress are hidden away in some of the most unintelligible and impossible locations. If you are going to have super difficult to find items hidden away in your game, DO NOT MAKE THEM ITEMS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO PROGRESS. I can almost 100% guarentee you that no one will complete this game without a walkthrough or a love for grinding. That or maybe getting lucky. If may not have been as straight-forward as the first installment, giving you a bit of freedom, but its at the cost of the game being extremely tedious and downright impossible at times\n\nAdditional thoughts on game: level-up and role system was dummed down and poorly explained. Crystalarium expansion or what ever its called had intesting upgrades though. Combat through out this game was either so freaking easy i never needed to heal, i would just stay in relentless assault and kill everything in 1-2 turns without grinding, or it would be downright impossible. FF13-1 was way harder, but there were strategies to beating difficult enemies and it didn't ALWAYS come down to just grinding more, there were usually a few work-arounds. This game is all about just being stronger because some enemies will just be too hard to take down, period.\n\nI find it hard to believe this game came out not that long ago. It feels and plays like a game from 2008. Hard to believe games like skyrim came out around 2 years before this, when by comparison, i'd guess they were ten years apart, skyrim being the newest.","January 16","false","25.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/292140/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","WARNING, this is a recommendation with a huge list of "BUT"s and things you need to know and is very much not a glowing one. And first thing to know - do NOT play this game with steam cloud on, turn it off before you even start in the game library properties, otherwise the game will crash very often during "now loading" screens and attemtps to switch to offline saves mid-game will result in infinite loading screens for that game, unless switched back to cloud saves. Also, the game port is pretty buggy, you should search for a rain effect fix if you value your eyesight and the game will load like 1/5 times when you launch it, just keep trying.\n\nSo after this lenghy "the port is horrible" opening let's get to the actual game. What's good about it is that it actually tries to use all those ideas found (and wasted) in Final Fantasy XIII properly and succeedes in many cases. All RPG systems and mechanics are still flawed, but are much more fun to play with, battles are less boring and actually require some thought and the progressions is rather open. The levels are no longer "go from point A to point B in a corridor" and while they're reused constantly with variations via the whole time traveling plot, they're mostly fun and look good. Game has a system similar to oldschool random encounters, which is both good and annoying. There are horrible puzzle sections, although they are ussually tied to optional areas and quests. And there are few super annoying and boring platforming sections, but the game is not too insane with those.\n\nWhat is also good is that the plot is happening. It's weird to put "this storydriven RPG has plot" as a plus, but after FF XIII that has nothing happening for dozens of hours, having things happen, story expand, characters develop all the time is great. The story itself is, like with FF XIII, more interesting in theory than in execution and few twists and turns feel not just silly but completely undermining some of the other stuff, but it has moments. And is surprisingly darker than you might expect. But overall, storytelling and themes are good, waaaay better than hours of nothing from FF XIII, even if a lot of stuff feels stupid or absurd and tone can be off by a lot.\n\nIt looks good, it sounds very good, if sometimes unexpected (soundtrack switches from usual FF, to Resident Evil/Parasite Eve 2 feel (same composer), to Devil May Cry 3-4 in seconds and always catches you off guard). It has very welcome tweaks to UI and controls. It's a bit too experimental for it's own good. But it's also pretty fun. Not something to go into for a full price, especially with the port quality like this, but a pretty interesting jRPG nonetheless.","March 24","true","32.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Curiosity got the best of me, and here I find myself, playing a game I never expected to like, and never got into when I tried.\n\nThe Crystarium is improved from XIII by allowing the grind-happy players to grind to their heart's content and fully develop their characters as soon as the option becomes available; no story-locked stat progression. However... It must be said that my least favorite mechanic of any RPG is the concept of random battles. I find them tedious, annoying, repetitive, and grounds to legally assault whoever decided they were worth including in the gameplay mechanic. When you can just be walking along and some random winged and clawed thing sprouts out of the ground like hopped up kudzu right in front of you with no explanation, and this is a common occurance at the rate of less than 30 seconds per incident, something is UNSPEAKABLY WRONG with your game. The only worse gameplay offense I can specifically name is QTEs, and this game has those, too. A less observant onlooker would assume I have Tourette's.\n\nThe story is marginally less embarrassing than Final Fantasy X-2's, though no less thoughtless. You can talk all you like about VIII being the entry in the series that discovered recreational uses for household cleaners, but this story is the one that should have warranted an intervention. The only reason I'm happy that it didn't is because I did find enjoyment in Lightning Returns, which I will undoubtedly purchase as soon as it appears on the market, with a very small amount of self-loathing. This series is my guilty pleasure, though this game in particular is the one I will look you in the eye and say, "I swear, this isn't mine; I don't know how it got here".\n\nIf you use the (all but necessary) community fixes, this is far and away a superior version than the console releases, but I can't recommend it to anyone who didn't already like the console releases. And if you did like the console releases... I am so sorry. Please, pick up Lost Odyssey.\n\nTL;DR - This is the best release of a hateful game, but only if you use the community fixes. I'd just rather be playing Lightning Returns.","December 14, 2014","false","131.4"," 22 of 46 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","22","46","0","0"

I used to enjoy FF games and looked forward to each new installment, nowadays... not so much. FFXV will probably be my last FF game, it looks promising... but sadly thats Square-Enix's MO nowadays... flash over susbstance, game looks stunning but lacks any depth and just feels hollow.\n\nFFXIII was a massive let down for many people for many different reasons, all of which have been well documented and beaten to death across all forms of media and review sites. I too found myself asking, What happened? The FF series began to slip with FFX and FFX-2, for me thats where it started to go down hill, save for FFXII which I enjoyed. Actually if you really want to pin point the beginnng of the end, its probably when Squaresoft partnered up with Disney for that horrible Spirits Within movie and the following Kingdom Hearts collaboration.\n\nI'll give Square-Enix some credit FFXIII-2 is a lot better than FFXIII, but honestly how could anything have been worse than FFXIII. The battle system is essentially the same as FFXIII except your third party member is made up of one of many different monster you can get throughout the game. The maps are a little less linear but your still hand held as you make your way through. NPCs actually exist now, aswell as some hubs/towns so some effort can actually be seen on Square-Enix's part. Getting a ton of negative backlash tends to make you not rest on your laurels and name recognition and makes you actually have to try, go figure. Adding Mog was a definite plus, how moogles were completely and utterly ignored in FFXIII was a joke. It would be like having a Mario game without Mario.\n\nStill FFXIII-2 has a ton of short commings. I logged about 7hrs on this before I finally tapped out, I couldnt force myself to even bother with it anymore. I'm also more than a little annoyed at how liberal Square-Enix is at borrowing and the re-interpretation/perversion of nordic mythos when it comes to things like Odin and Valhalla. I'm sorry but that is just pure ignorance and disrespect for the nordic mythos and if I was Square-Enix I would be wholeheartidly ashamed.\n\nI forced myself to complete FFXIII, literally forced/tortured myself because I kept telling myself that the game couldnt be this bad and that it had to get better at some point. I wasnt making this same mistake with FFXIII-2. I'm sorry but I'm not watching movies/cutscenes for 20+ minutes having story characters repeat everything dialouge-wise because I'm apparently to dumb to figure out things on my own and need to be hand held through everything. Not like it matters, the zones are still fairly linear so its not like I'm going to get lost at any point in time here.\n\nMaybe its because I'm older now and dont appreciate the newer installments of FF, or maybe its because I'm old enough to realize that the game really does suck this bad.\n\nSkyrim.\n\nThat name right there sent a message to the once mighty Square-Enix. The revival of the western RPG is here and wont be going away anytime soon with studios like Bethesda and BioWare leading the charge. Even european studios like CD Projekt and their Witcher series of RPGs completely crush anything Square-Enix has released in the last 10 years outside of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ming. Whats really sad, is that South Park: The Stick of Truth is a more compelling and complete RPG than FFXIII/FFXIII-2 is. Honestly.\n\nNo one insitution can be great forever, Square and FF kind of remind me of Metallica, back in the day Metallica was the hottest metal band on the planet. Now its time for them to retire and be put out to pasture, that same amount of passion isnt there anymore like it once was. All anything nowadays is based off of name recognition and past achievements to mask how brutally bad the current product is today. Sad but true.\n\nAgain maybe its just me and I've out grown FF, its just too Disney-esq for me to take seriously anymore.\n\nThanks for reading.","January 24, 2015","false","6.8"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","0"

Out of the box on release day, this thing ran like a sloth on my ROG G750JM laptop (GTX 860M, i7-4700HQ, 16GB RAM). I had to open Nvidia control panel and manually adjust the performance settings (say INTEGRATED) before the game ran anywhere between 30-60FPS at 1080 (though it seems to be locked at 720 anyway), usually closer to 30. The graphics and even audio options are extremely limited (screen resolution, shadow resolution, aliasing, English/Japanese voice) so make sure you're at least close to the recommended specs. Once I had the settings down, the game was smooth sailing with no crashes so far but the overall experience could be more consistent. And for crying out loud, I would love to be able to adjust the background music level! That song at the beach was totally out of place when it kicked in!\n\nThe game just feels natural with a controller so I plugged in my PS4's dual shock FTW. One thing that irks me is that there's a silly bug that resets QTE displays from controller buttons to keyboard keys. You'll have to change it each time you boot up the game if you plan to stick to controllers or it could get very confusing during the QTEs. Either way, you can use both control methods at the same time.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's FFXIII made better in every way with a good dose of fanservicing. Oh and it's just Serah, Noel, your trusty Moogle, and a bunch of pets. If you heard bad things about this game's predecessor, well, XIII-2 more than makes up for them, at least in its systems. However, if you never played the first game, I strongly advise playing that before this because you'll sorely be lost in the story if you haven't.\n\nThere are reports of the story DLCs missing but that does not take away from the main story. It should eventually get patched up since they advertised the inclusion but who knows when that'll happen? Thankfully, the bonus costume DLCs work.\n\nIn spite of all that, I still recommend getting the game but with caution. In my own experience, the game is entirely playable and does not bog down. But there are some bugs and plenty of room for optimization. This release comes loaded with more things than the console versions came with and at a lower price to boot. Putting this game on your wishlist to wait for a patch isn't a bad idea though to get a fully fleshed out experience.","December 12, 2014","true","5.8"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

I noticed (not through Steam in any way) that opinions on XIII-2 are polaryzing. I happen to be on the side of the fence that would say it was OK and had good things going for it, but wasn't better than XIII. Since Steam has only "yes" or "no", I'll give it a "no". The battle system was vastly improved in XIII-2, which is probably the most important thing for me, but mostly everything else feels unnecessary. Caius is a great protagonist and I love the soundtrack, but I just didn't have it with the story and Serah and Noel. Therefore, my "no" goes for the story and protagonists and how badly optimized it is, but it can be lots of fun if you focus on the gameplay.

This was just a downright frustrating experience for me. A little while ago, they promised a patch that added options to change the graphical settings, but they're still practically non-existant. I bought this game, hoping that when they said they were adding that patch in, i would be able to run the game. My laptop can run more or less any game, as long as they allow the option to lower the graphics. But, Square Enix did not add anything like that... All that's there, is the ability to change the shadow resolution, change anti-aliasing, and the resolution. But you can't turn down the resolution below 1280x720. Where's 640x480? 800x600 at least? Where's the option to turn down the texture quality, the model quality, the depth of field? There's absolutely nothing like that in this game, showing that Square Enix did not give a single ♥♥♥♥ about people with low end pcs.\n\nOh, i'm sure people with better computers are having a grand time with this game. And i'm not saying the game itself is bad. But i felt genuinely upset when i found out i can't run the game because Square can't bother to give a few tiny options to make the game accessible for more people. Bioshock Infinite was an absolutely gorgeous looking game, but even that game shown enough care to give loads of options to change the graphics, which allowed me to play the game with no problems. Why can't this game do that? Not everyone has a super high-powered computer out there.

In FF13 all mobs you were going to fight were visible on the path in front of you with the exception of some triggered events. In FF13-2 most mobs spawn on you randomly, Pokemon style. It is possible to outrun these and avoid the fights in most cases (unless you are in tight corridors, that is), though this feature still severely detracts from the game in my opinion.\n\nPokemon is a fun game, but if you are like me, and get to a point where you just cringe every time a new random encounter interrupts your progress, when you for instance are searching an area for an item, then FF13-2 will probably irk you the exact same way.\n\nIt has of course been a key feature in many of the older Final Fantasy games, though is harder to stomach in this modern installment, especially after playing through FF13 first. I suspect this is due to the way enemies were themed to their location in older games. In FF13-2 they can literally spawn in from different timelines, meaning the fights are completely disjointed from the area you are currently in (for the most part, anyway).\n\nI played through FF13 twice, and it's a game i love despite it's flaws, though i do not think i will ever finish FF13-2. Besides, compared to the cast of the previous game, Serah and Noel are far less interesting to me (granted, i have only played it for 15 hours, their stories might get fleshed out later on, sadly i will never get there).","January 26, 2015","false","18.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","16"

It's better than XIII in every way really. I personally didn't like the first game that much, it was too restrictive and it took forever before you had some freedom but XIII-2 gets to the point very quickly compared to the first game and doesn't bombard you with as many tutorials. I would still recommend playing the first game or watch all the cutscenes on YouTube or something because this is definitely a direct sequel and you'll be very lost in the story if you don't check out the first game. The game does come with a XIII primer to help people who didn't play XIII to catch up so there's that too.\n\nI was pretty happy to see this game coming to the PC. Unfortunately, the game has some issues. There are two main issues that IF fixed will help this port immensely. There is a TON of screen tearing and the frame rate is all over the place (the lowest I hit was 20fps). My rig has an i7-3770K, 16GB RAM and a GTX 670 FTW so it's definitely not my PC which can't run the game at a constant 60fps on its highest settings.\n\nAs for graphics options, don't expect a myriad of options. This is definitely a console port so don't expect advanced options like Tesselation, PCSS, and so on. You have resolution, shadow resolution and MSAA. The game is not ugly by any means though.\n\nI will still recommend it. It's definitely the best in the XIII series, but buy with caution. I hope that Squeenix release a patch soon and/or someone releases a mod which fixes these problems.","December 12, 2014","true","49.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The first thing that pops-up is a settings menu and in the actual ingame menu there's a "Beginner's Primer" that summarizes what happened in the previous game. If these are any indication of what's to come, at the least, I doubt I'll regret having bought this.\n\nJapanese games aren't exactly something I play, ever really. So the story in that sense probably intrigues me more on the sheer fact I'm not familiar with its style, beyond anime maybe. The gameplay so far is very console port-esq but I didn't expect much more than that, though the esc button being unchangably the exit button as if i need the ability to almost instantaniously quit is annoying.","December 11, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Contrary to what everyone says there is absolutely nothing wrong with this game. The people that claim the game has issues are those who cant build a proper computer. I have an asus gaming laptop with an i7 processor and geforce gtx 860 m graphics card. Game runs FLAWLESSLY. I see 60fps. Learn to build a computer before calling something a bad port. Square enix did a great job with these ports. Having played the trilogy on the 360, ps3 and now pc I can say the pc is by far the best. Ignore the "performance issues" and "bad port" comments. These come from people who know nothing about computers and how internal components can affect the way a game runs. My buddy whos an engineer built his own computer and had nothing but problems with the game. Hopped on my laptop and was stunned at how an engineers computer built exclusively for gaming cant allow this game to perform but mine can. He went out and bought all the most exensive parts on the market 6 months ago but never actaully learned how each part works and what they do. Ill be honest I dont know much about computers which is why I bought my laptop from asus after my buddy whom knows his computer internals went with me and said for an on the floor unit this was the way to go. Again i cant stress how well the game runs on my computer.\n\nAs for the game itself its a continuation of a great story. The trilogy actually introduced me to final fantasy and now its my favorite game series. I decided that my favorites in order from 1-5 are 13 trilogy, 8, 10, 3 and 6. So many people complain about the story but i find lightning and her story to be refreshing. The second one allows you to play as her sister whom is a major plot character to the entire trilogy and how lightning develops as a character. I know many people may not like the story or characters and thats actually fine. Every person has a different emotion towards stories and characters. Me personally i never cared for 7 but thats me. Enjoyed playing it though.\n\nTake the time to ignore the bad port comments and read into the specs of your computer before buying. The games do require alot to run them.","May 25, 2015","true","41.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ykmsanada/recommended/292140/","ykmsanada","Amarant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ykmsanada/","100 products in account","TL;DR - The port is bad, the game is good.\n\nSPOILER FREE REVIEW**\n\n**If you're wondering about my hours played, like FINAL FANTASY XIII, I have spent nearly 200 hours on the console version, so I can talk gameplay with a sense of where I'm coming from.\n\nIf you read my last review on FINAL FANTASY XIII, I gave the game a pretty good review about it. Despite some performance issues that at least had the chance to be fixed, this PC port of FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 doesn't give you the same freedom.\n\nLet's talk about the port first - why is it bad? A lot of the game's visuals are a little subpar comapred to its console counterpart, but what really gets to me right now in my first 50 minutes in the game is the quality of the audio. The audio for everything except the soundtrack is all muffled and in poor quality, a complete downright shame which can really, really ruin the game for some. The soundtrack in FFXIII-2 is just fine though, no issues there. But I would suggest avoid playing with a headset, as hearing how muffled and poor some of the voices were done might just put you off.\n\nNow on to the game itself. When FFXIII was released, a major complaint was that it was mainly all hallways and corridors all the way up to Chapter 11, when you reached an open world area and where you would spend most of your time playing the game ultimately. In FFXIII-2, this issue is fixed, much to the delight of those giving the XIII series another chance. Straight away, in the starting area of the game, you'll get the chance to explore all the nooks and crannies of the town, really giving away the sense of exploration and detail in each individual map. The game, is always in the XIII series, looks gorgeous. From the sights of the Archlyte Steppe to Cocoon, each environment is captured with a sense of beauty and detail.\n\nGameplay wise, the core aspect of Paradigms and Auto Battle is the same. But, if you read my review on FFXIII, you'll know what I'm going to say here. FFXIII-2's biggest flaw with gameplay can be fixed with a simple tick of a button in the options menu - the Default to Abilities. Many players went through FFXIII and FFXIII-2 using Auto Battle, complaining at how easy and boring the game was when what they were actually doing was playing the game at half it's potential. Set the option to Default to Abilties, and give yourself a challenge in this game. The Paradigm system is one of my favourite battle systems in the FINAL FANTASY franchise for a reason - give yourself the chance to play the game.\n\nOverall, the port of this game does the actual game no justice at all - FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 fixes many of the problems encountered in FINAL FANTASY XIII, and is always a worthy addition to the legendary roster of JRPGS. Unfortunately, much to my dislike, I'll have to vote aganst buying this game purely because of the poor port. Maybe in time, when Square releases a performance patch, this game will become recommended, but at the moment, it's another game ruined by poor ports.","November 18, 2015","false","44.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sloshy42/recommended/292140/","sloshy42","LiquidOcelot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sloshy42/","778 products in account","A pretty good port of a pretty alright game. XIII-2 doesn't have the same level of polish that the first game has even though the port is much better thsi time around, meaning it has a very inconsistent difficulty level and some rather arbitrary mechanics, but the wide variety of new features, an overall improved battle system, and a still-stellar soundtrack make this a game worth playing for the price. The visuals are also spectacular in moments, particularly near the beginning and end, but a painfully padded middle-game really shows that they did not give nearly as much effort to the aethetics in the core of the experience. If you are able to get through a lot of the padding, you'll find a fun game with some moments on par with the high points in its predecessor, particularly the boss battles. Overall, though, the added visual options are a great touch and if you set your rig to maximize performance, you'll get some really smooth gameplay. While I have not played the entirety of the game on PC, I have completed it on PS3 and this review is based on my initial impressions. I will change them if anything significant lowers my opinion later on in the game.","December 11, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I've finished the game on the PS3 already, and I wanted to replay it on PC with the much nicer graphics options and Valk Lightning in my party for my entire experience. However, Squeenix took it upon themselves to "unspoil" people going through the game the first time. While I can understand their decision process, I do not agree with it.\n\nI also do not recommend anyone who has already completed the game on PS3/360 to buy this for nicer graphics, because although it does certainly look nicer, there are extremely frequent, noticeable instances of frame stutters that quite honestly makes it an inferior experience compared to the PS3 original. Plus, there's the issue of locked DLC. I was extremely disappointed as a result, and I will not recommend the purchase of this version of the game.","January 18, 2015","false","16.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

No, it's not the most serious nor the best written story but it just feels so, so much better than FFXIII. Honestly I think if this had been released instead of FFXIII (with obvious little story changes that would entail) I would have been much more pleased with the brand instead of being constantly scared that whatever they put out will be "just like FFXIII."\n\nThe world, although still slightly linear, feels much more freeing. There are no more literal corridors with a bunch of static monsters waiting for you to approach and battle them. Being able to replay some chapters was quite interesting as well. The combat feels smooth; nothing new, just like FFXIII. Not my favorite FF combat system but still good. I like small challenges in games such as the map completion quest or the monster hunting one; so I was happy to see that there was some of that.\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is fine playing a happy-go-lucky RPG. If you're looking for some epic story, this is not it. If you're looking for a fun 40+ hours, this is a good choice.","July 12, 2015","true","79.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The moment she started talking to cats I was done.\n\nThe cutscenes where "bearable" but the music was different and gave me a headache to the point where I felt nauseated.\n\nI can't recommend this game to anybody, unless your a thirteen/sixteen year old girl, who has a major ego and crushing on some random dude who just fell out of the sky.","December 11, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unfortunately we now have a sequel that basically throws it out of the window, because FFXIII-2s main focus is time travel. Poorly done time travel that creates plot holes the size of Jupiter.\n\nThroughout the game, you hop through several time periods to help unravel the overall story line. Unfortunately, this chopped narration left me confused on what the underlying tale was trying to tell. What is left is a jumbled, forced gibberish that some game designers called a story line. It also doesn't help that most of the plot is explained through long and uninteresting monologues, rather than actual cutscenes with dialogues. And when FFXIII-2 finally concludes with now infamous sequel-bait my only thought was "Really?".\n\nAlso, be prepared to hear the word "paradox" at least five times in each cut-scene. It's a convenient maguffin that drives the plot forward but is never really explained.\n\nCombat system taken almost verbatim from FFXIII with all its ups and downs. Since your two protagonists are the only "real" party members, you now have a random chance to recruit monsters, which you can then add to your team. They all have innate paradigm, but you can level them up individually and even fuse them together to create stronger versions. Unfortunately challenge is mostly gone as 95% of battles are easily doable using auto-battle autopilot.\n\nFFXIII-2 tries so hard to fix some problems of FFXIII. Long corridors are gone and replaced by (mostly) open areas. There are actual side quests, various challenges, different paradox "endings", post-game content and a new game plus. There are also a handful of minigames located in poor-man's version of Gold Saucer from FFVII. All this makes for an overall better gaming experience. Base game took me 24 hours to complete, but I imagine that if were to 100% it, it would take at least twice as much if not more. Be wary that few pieces of content is locked on PC - nothing that modding can't fix.\n\nPort-wise it is a tad better than FFXIII. We now have an option to change screen resolution, shadow resolution and anti-aliasing (MSAA), but why do I have to use third-party programs to unlock framerate, fix minor UI problems and graphical glitches?\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 is another, after FFX-2, sequel that no one asked for. It left me indifferent but since Steam only allows Yes or No then... can't recommend.","April 5","false","29.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Let's get a few questions answered first.\n\nYou loved that there were finally no random encounters in FF 13?\nYou didn't want to grind all the time?\nYou liked that you had not to go to an npc and get them to tell you to get a medkit for them because they rather sit at the beach and watch the waves?\nYou liked your characters in FF 13 and want them to be playable in the next part?\n\n\nWell if say you "no" to all those points then this game is definitly for you.\nHowever if "yes" is you answer - don't get that piece of history.\n\nI don't get how all those positive reviews come to.\nBesides the obvious frame drops etc. (yes it has framedrops)\n\nSo you wanted to play your nice FF 13 characters - Because you know it is a sequel? right? right...? WRONG, you get to play the first 2(3?it's always the same enemy who cares) battles with Lightning and that's about it you see of her. Because you know - you always wanted to play Serah and a random dude from the future, right? I know you want it.\n\nI'm just 1 hour into the game and already want to quit it because it just gets everything what was good in the prequel and throws it completly over and says "we heard you - you wanted a less linear story progress, there you go".\n\nHowever, that they thought mechanics like completly random leveling (you won't have no idea what you do if you haven't played the other game), the story (yey, time traveling - nice idea actually) and that ****freaking random encounters are a good idea, needs to get his mind washed!\n\nOf course the story itself isn't as bad, it seems like it will have it's moments of fun and so on BUT I already noticed myself using a guide for all those Live trigger Events!!!! (YES you have to decide what your characters say! Damnit if I wanted a telltales game I would get one!). But wait if you want to get special items you need to talk to all the "LTE" for that sector of the game and if you want even better bonus items you have to get the "funny" ones.\nSo I was busy reading what I should take instead of just taking what feels like what I would say.\n\nAnother point. You like QTE? Ye, Quick time events - Because someone at SQE obviously does. They included in their cutscenes freaking QTEs. Who in their right mind wants to play a FF with those dirty missused things.\n\nIf that all points are however something you would like you should defenitly get the game, you won't be dissappointed.\n\nI will see if, I can get myself to play through that black sheep of FF and see if it gets any better...","December 31, 2014","false","2.6"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

However, this really deserves a down to earth look at what's wrong here.\n\nThe game itself isn't bad. In fact it's above average by what I consider a fair standard for JRPG's coming westside recently. This game is simply a port of its console predesessor. And that is what I'm calling it through this review.\n\nMy PC's specs aren't high end, it's completely running on factory hardware. And I can play games such as Path of Exile and Call of Duty AW without much trouble, if any. And I'm running on 6 GB of RAM with an AMD A8 Quad-Core processor. Final Fantasy XIII ran almost PERFECTLY with very little chugging when the particles started flying. So as a PORT this game fails to meet what I would consider even sub-par standards that we've come to expect from an A-class company.\n\nThis game needs some serious patching. So if you're intending to buy this game, think hard about your rig's specs.

Well, the PC version anyways.  The console versions are still fantastic obviously.\n\nI can't believe this.  Original FFXIII actually runs surprisingly well on my PC considering all the port issues, but FFXIII-2 runs like CRAP, even with the lowest possible settings (I freaking played FFXIII the day it launched on Steam and even then it ran WAY better than this).  There's got to be some bigger issues at play here as even people with very high-end graphics cards are reporting problems getting the game to run at a consistent framerate.  This is ridiculous, it's pretty much the same engine as FFXIII, and I remember it running a hair more smoothly than FFXIII on consoles, but it runs a whole heck of a lot worse here.\n\nWell, hey, that's nearly 30GB of space I can get back on my PC at least, and I won't have to feel even the slightest temptation to get Lightning Returns when it inevitably comes out.  Glad I kept my PS3 copy.\n\nKind of a shame too, as Square-Enix frequently has PC sales, and the PC version includes most of the console DLC right out the gate (I think the only things not included are a few costumes and weapons and such, nothing major), plus the Japanese language track.\n\nI hate to do this, as the game itself is wonderful, but I really can't recommend the PC version at all.

I played through FFXIII on PC just fine; I don't expect a 60fps experience in 4k resolution, I expect for my somewhat dated but still capable hardware that I'm going to get framerate stutters, trouble animating several effects at once, and so forth.\n\nIn Final Fantasy XIII-2, at best I get 10fps during some battle scenes.  Cutscenes are a bleeding nightmare, as characters speak their lines and the game animates several frames very, very slowly as the dialogue pauses for it to catch up.  Running around on the map is around 3-6fps.  This is with all effects set to minimum and NVidia settings tweaked to maximize performance.\n\nI'm fine with being told I can't play a game because my computer doesn't meet the specifications; I'm familiar with the minimum/recommended specs dance.

How is it possible that I can run NEW games on High to Ultra, yet get 9-30 FPS on this game, one from years ago? Not to mention the graphics are so fuzzy, it looks like somebody enabled FXAA antialiasing for a program that doesn't require it. Even using NVIDIA control panel to give a performance boost does ZERO to help increase FPS. Regardless of whether you play the game with x16 MSAA, or x2, you receive the same FPS. Same with the shadow quality slider option. If anything, it ran slightly smoother with maxed graphics quality than lesser. Not to mention the audio is all over the place. Voices are too loud in cutscenes, too soft everywhere else, and there is no in-game slider to balance it out. Once (or IF) patched and stabilized, it will be as much fun as it was for the PS3. If it doesn't receive the needed patches/updated optimizations, steer clear of this game for the PC.\n\n[Updated - 12-16-2014]\n\nAfter clearing the very first area, the fps improved by 10, which is apparently a huge deal for this particular game. Game is now playable at a constant 20-30 fps, with the only increase over that being 50-60 for menu/blank loading screens.\n\nIdk what all was going on graphically in the first area, but it must have had some serious graphic drainers. Hopefully they patch this game eventually like how they did with FF13's fps stability update. Adding an ingame option to change the various sound levels would be nice too. However, now that I'm back to reliving the fun I had years ago on the PS3 version, I can thankfully change this to something I recommend.","December 12, 2014","true","105.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","10"

It all fixed in this sequel where some of the npc can be talked with and asking you a request to accept mission.\n+Cinematic action: while you're watching some of the cinematic sequence, there's cinematic sequence that requires you to push some of the button that'll be displayed.\n+Graphics: The graphics was pretty well done.

It was somewhat of a relief then, that it actually started.  Not disappointed with the game at all, because it is definitely living up to the FF saga I know and love.\n\nThe graphics are incredible, compared to playing FF7 on a PS1 and FFX on a PS2.  Battles have similarities to the previous games, with some nice improvements such as paradigm shift - a setting that allows you to change your party's battle strategy mid battle.  The controls are clumsy, as you'd expect for a PC port; it seems weird not to get the map by pressing 'M' for example, but accepting that this is how it will be played, doesn't detract from the enjoyment.\n\nThis is a must have for Final Fantasy fans, and a playable game for those new to the franchise.

The battle system breaks away from the traditional turn based system which is a nice improvement in my opinon. While the story isn't as stellar compared to previous Final Fantasy games, it is still interesting to play through. The story repeats similar areas in Final Fantasy 13 which may seem bad at first, but they add a certain freshness to each area making them unique and fun to go through again. The Soundtrack for this game is incredible and is definately one of the better FF soundtracks. There is also a lot of replay value in this game because of the alternate endings, side quests, and monster taming. Also purchasing the game includes most of the DLCs so its a nice bonus to the game.\nOverall the game is worth picking up for its low price and is fun for advocates and newcomers alike!","March 5, 2015","true","78.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How is it possible that I can run NEW games on High to Ultra, yet get 9-30 FPS on this game, one from years ago? Not to mention the graphics are so fuzzy, it looks like somebody enabled FXAA antialiasing for a program that doesn't require it. Even using NVIDIA control panel to give a performance boost does ZERO to help increase FPS. Regardless of whether you play the game with x16 MSAA, or x2, you receive the same FPS. Same with the shadow quality slider option. If anything, it ran slightly smoother with maxed graphics quality than lesser. Not to mention the audio is all over the place. Voices are too loud in cutscenes, too soft everywhere else, and there is no in-game slider to balance it out. Once (or IF) patched and stabilized, it will be as much fun as it was for the PS3. If it doesn't receive the needed patches/updated optimizations, steer clear of this game for the PC.\n\n[Updated - 12-16-2014]\n\nAfter clearing the very first area, the fps improved by 10, which is apparently a huge deal for this particular game. Game is now playable at a constant 20-30 fps, with the only increase over that being 50-60 for menu/blank loading screens.\n\nIdk what all was going on graphically in the first area, but it must have had some serious graphic drainers. Hopefully they patch this game eventually like how they did with FF13's fps stability update. Adding an ingame option to change the various sound levels would be nice too. However, now that I'm back to reliving the fun I had years ago on the PS3 version, I can thankfully change this to something I recommend.","December 12, 2014","true","105.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","10"

You don't need to wait for around 20 hours like the previous game.\n- You can customize character, mog, and pet monster appeareance\n- The crystarium offers more cuztomization for your character right at the beginning\n- You can make the monster you defeat into your pet as a 3rd character to fight alongside you\n- Story is more easy to understand now\n\nBad:\n- Some of the background music is just baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddd. They throw some metal music like the one you found in Devil May Cry for battle or exploration music. It just doesn't match FF XIII-2 atmosphere.\n- The crystarium is more confusing than the original version and IMHO the crystarium graphic is bad\n- The Archelyte Steppe is a massive downgrade from the original. I really love original XIII Archely Steppe, but in XIII-2 its kind of barren,\n- Upgrading your pet monster is kind of hard especially for high level monster.\n\nNetural:\n- The Historia Crux concept is interesting but can be quite confusing\n- You can only control 2 characters here, Noel and Serah.","January 3, 2015","true","53.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crymzen/recommended/292140/","crymzen","Fawkzi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crymzen/","290 products in account","TL;DR: It feels like DLC turned in to a full game but there are major improvements/changes that make it interesting enough to warrent a purchase. The graphics seem worse than XIII yet the assets look like they were pulled directly from the previous game. The story is the weaker element, not as good as XIII yet the gameplay improved on everything that was annoying about XIII. It's a good title, it holds up as it's own game but it's not something that will keep you hooked.\n\n(I jumped right in to XIII-2 just moments after finishing XIII so comparisons will be made between the two, this review will concentrate on the changes made from XIII to XIII-2 as the games are so similar that if you did like XIII then you will most likely enjoy this.)\n\nIt feels like DLC turned in to a full game, What i mean by this is that it feels like they had a cool idea to play as Serah in an expansion to XIII but opted to turn it in to it's own game, This is common in the industry (Just take a look at Saints Row 4, it was originally a DLC for Saints Row The Third)\n\nWith that being said  it IS a fun game to play though at first glance it is misleading, With Lightning's character model and face plastered all over the place it is easy for one to think that she is the focus of the game, she is in a sense but not in the playable kind, she is the starting focus of the story.\n\nSerah is your playable character in this game, a long with a boy called Noel. Graphics wise it actually looks worse than the original XIII to me but that could be down to the port itself. Gameplay wise itis more of the same only they scrolled things back a bit in terms of enemy encounters.\n\nYou can no longer see the enemies in full view as you could in XIII, encounters work on a detection system where enemies will randomly appear as you are running around, you can either try to run or attack them. It's a sort of ballance between the way encounters worked in XIII and how encounters worked in the old school games.\n\nThe combat system as been revamped somewhat though it does feel a hell of a lot slower (even when using the haste ability) One of the major improvements is ability to switch party leader mid battle, this also means that the battle is not over if your current party leader goes down in battle, it simply switches to the next person so you can continue the fight.\n\nThe major update though is the addition of monsters, you can now "Tame" monsters you encounter (Through no special mechanic, you simply beat a monster and sometimes it will drop a crystal wich adds that monster to your collection) These monsters act as your third party member in combat, each one having a specific role from the same pool of character roles that you saw in XIII.\n\nThese monsters can not become party leader and have the same behavior as any AI set in whatever role it happens to be in but with a unique twist. every monster has it's own special attack which can be used by incrasing the "Feral Link" gauge, this gauge works very similar to the "Gestalt" and "TP" gauge from XIII. Once full you can activate a special attack which then starts a QTE to determine a damage boost to said attack via a "Sync Level"\n\nHow fast you complete the QTE prompts determines your Sync percentage which determines the damage boost for the attack, each monster has it's very own unique attack each with different attributes.\n\nThe leveling system has also changed a fair bit, the Crystarium is back but in a different way, rather than all roles having their own seperate progression track all roles are now on the same track which i honestly do prefer because "Builds" are now a viable option. The Crystarium also expands automatically rather than in key points of the story, once you reach the end of what is currently available the track will then expand, you can then pick a bonus.\n\nThe bonuses are pretty cool, you can pick a boost the roles you have unlocked, unlock a new role or increase your accessory capacity. The Crystarium is also available for your monsters, though you can not use "CP" to upgrade them, instead you use componants to progress them but it still works in the same way..the main difference beign you can not change the role of a monster, each monster has it's own set role an dunique progression track.\n\nThey made a big change to the way you equip accessories, in XIII you started with one slot and unlocked more as you progressed, here you start with three and can still unlock more except now you have a capacity, each accessory has a number next to it, for example a ring has a value of 55, your capacity is 70, if you want to equip a second accessory you will needd to find one that doesn't go above the remaining capacity, example case being 15. Your capacity can of course be upgrade via the Crystarium expansion bonuses.\n\nAll in all it is a decen entry, far from being the best and story wise it isn't as good as XIII but Gameplay wise it adds enough new mechanics to edge ahead of XIII. It's worth it for the price, give a try.","February 17, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I am going to "rant" more about this game in-detail.\n\n\n\nSTORY/ART STYLE\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the thirteenth instalment in the series. That said, in retrospective, I think I actually like it story-wise more than XIII-2. Why? Because of the time travel element! The wisdom I once heard: "Usually, when a time travel plot element is involved, it tells that the story writers were desperate." That seems to be the case in some parts of the story.\nWhile the story seems much clearer so far in the game, initially, when you first start, the concept of time traveling seems to do nothing but confuse with all the feeling-based concusions about the future and the past. You are given a simple goal: get from point A to point B, and the "road" to there is all tangled up. Sort of.\n\nRemember FFX-2? It was supposed (?) to be a direct sequel, sure. However, it was a whole different game! There's sort of a stigma associated with direct sequels to Final Fantasy games and it sure made my expectations lower for this "direct sequel", too.\n\nThe plot? with all the "kupo! look-at-me-i'm-so-cute" and some painfully slow and outright boring parts aside, I have so far enjoyed the idea of finding Lightning and untangling the tangles. I think I will finish the game (once).\n\nI'm not very fond of the violin-piano-la-la-la-remember-my heart-la-la-female vocalist faintly singing type of a thing, as it seems very "girly" or overly romanticized and overused in the universe of FFXIII. I do, however, like few of the battle themes and how the track intensifies when monsters appear on the field.\n\n\nThe characters? We see three kind of character behaviour in this game:\n1) Characters state the obvious. and do it again.\n2) Characters don't know a thing\n3) Characters (Serah infamously so) become quantum scientists; they pull wild, speculated theories out of the thin air that turn out to be truth.\n\nUsually in the following pattern:  1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 -1 - 1 -1 -1\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nWithout a doubt, combat and leveling up are my salt and butter in this game. Just like in FFXIII, I find it satisfactory to level up the crystarium and watching the stats go higher. I like the paradigm system as it makes it possible to "stagger" the otherwise ridiculously strong opponents and beat them up with the right set of paradigms.\n\nI am not entirely satisfied with few things:\n\nMog throwing? ugh. A nice idea, but the implementation is not quite there.\n\nMog clock? In few places of the game, the enemies "chase" you and the mog clock turns red. The problem here is, the enemies are no where to be seen! This means, you are forced into combat with no retry option. How convenient.\n\nThe gameplay really drags the story in some parts. Some dungeon hallways are so narrow that you are practically forced to fight battles every few meters. The same things with fast and aggressive enemies in some dungeons. Luckily, the dungeons seem short, which seems to balance this out a little.\n\nPerformance issues: the game seems to lag here and there and the gameplay seems capped at 30fps for the most of it. I am running the game on a decent "gaming" rig:\n\ni5 3570k @ 4ghz\ngtx 970 4gb\n12 gb ddr3 ram\n\nThe performance definitely could be better. At 1080P 8x AA, The graphics card barely gets a challenge. Seems like this game is more CPU intensive.And by no means my cpu is a slouch.\n\nLong story short: I'm glad I bought it on sale!\n\nI SAY DO IT!\n+ If you're a final fantasy fan (not hardcore level) like me and out of curiosity want to play through the game at least once\n+ you liked FFXIII\n+ If you are a hardcore ff fan\n\n\nI SAY NO WAY IN H***\n- If you are new to the series\n- if you haven't completed FFXIII prior to playing this\n\n\n7/10 story so far\n8.5/10 battle system\n","February 21, 2015","false","60.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is nicely carried over from the first XIII title and is generally presented pretty well. We return to familiar faces, along with some new ones.\n\nThe story starts off quite confusing and you are given tons of info pretty quickly. It may seem messy at first due to alot of unexplained events and the time travel aspect can mix things up a little further. However time travel in XIII-2 is mostly used as a way to get the game world to be opened up a bit and to move away from the linear direction that was FFXIII, from this point of view its done well and doesnt really pose any issues. As the story goes on it gets really intense, i found myself at the edge of my seat a few times.\n\nThe graphics for the most part seem to be slightly improved over the first game and are really enjoyable. The battle system is fantastic. Its simular to XIII with a bit of a twist with things like the mog clock, allowing you to start off a battle with haste if timed well. There is also the addition of pets and they act as the third member in your party. The Crystarium System is more streamlined and works really well.\n\nThe performance for some reason isnt as good as XIII and i find myself getting very varied frame rates, this should not happen on a 4000 dollar PC that was purchased in 2015. Overall its not too much of a problem, however it certainly doesnt go unnoticed and its worth mentioning. Hopefully they improve on this for Lightning Returns.\n\nBoss fights feel very rewarding and fun. Encounter mechanics are fresh and interesting, this game has one of the most memorable final boss fights ive experienced in ages. There is a fair amount of grinding needed to be done to down the final boss but nothing too crazy, the progression feels right, they really nailed it here. There is a great addition of skins in XIII-2 that are taken to the next level in Lightning Returns, something that i rate very highly as i love customization in any game.\n\nThere is a lack of CG cutscenes in XIII-2 i would have liked a little more than the 2 or 3 they did for the game.\n\nOverall i found FFXIII-2 to be a fantastic sequel that is a must play for anyone that enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII, you get the chance to delve further into Lightning and Serah's story, I cant wait to jump into Lightning Returns, this might be one of the best game trilogies ive played, infact this game was the reason i will continue to invest my time and money into the franchise and purchase a PS4 to contine the legacy that is Final Fantasy.\n\nWould thank Square Enix again and again and again for porting this to PC.\n\n9/10\n\n","March 4, 2015","true","100.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bertema tentang time traveler, Serah bersama Noel berpetualang mengatasi paradox untuk menyelamatkan dunia & menemukan Lightning yang menghilang.\n\nCerita (7/10)\nLightning menghilang tepat setelah bertemu Serah, terjebak dalam dunia yang disebut Valhalla. Ingatan tentang Lightning terhapus & semua orang menganggap Lightning tersegel dalam Cocoon bersama Fang & Vanille. 3 tahun kemudian, Serah bertemu Noel dan menceritakan bahwa Lighting ada di Valhalla akibat paradox.\nMeskipun lanjutan FFXIII, cerita FFXIII-2 benar2 baru, villain baru dan masalah baru.

What I got exceeded my expectations by a long margin. This game is - believe it or not - not that bad.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nThe Story.It is terrible. Just plain awful. Even if you thought the story of the first Final Fantasy XIII was fine and never left any questions unanswered, XIII-2's story will most likely go over your head. I have to admit, it lost me very early on. It kind of makes sense in the end, but then again...not really. Don't try to wrap your head around it.\nIt's not even the fact that it is about time travel, which in itself has always been one of the most confusing topics in movies and video games, no, it's just that the story writer went and took a rather simple concept and filled it with lots and lots of 'technobabbles' and weird pseudo-scientific assumptions to make it sound more complex than it actually is.\n\nSome of the dialogues in this game reminded me of what it feels like to watch an episode of Star Trek.\nHalf the time they don't make any sense. Other times the characters just blurt out seemingly random thoughts and assertions, which we are - apparently - supposed to take for granted. More often than not they just make up the rules as they go along.\n\nIt starts with lines like :\n"We changed the future, which altered the past (sic). How is that even possible?"To which to the obvious answer is:\n"With Paradoxes, anything is possible!"(You'll hear the "a wizard paradoxes did it" bit a lot.)\n\nOr how about this one from the casino:\n"Like people, slot machines have moods. Talk to the attendend to find out how the slot machine is feeling today."\nJust.....go with it. There is only one real way to play this game in my opinion. Turn your brain off, don't think too much about what's happening, take in the atmosphere and relax whilst listening to the phenomenally good soundtrack.\n\nWhich leads me to the next bullet point.\n\nGame World and Atmosphere.If you compare it directly to Final Fantasy XIII, then this game is undoubtedly much more open. Every map has lots of secret (and sometimes invisible) stuff to discover in every corner. And I personally just love the attention to detail everywhere, like when your character's foot step noise dynamically changes depending on the surface he's walking on, including small puddles on the pavement, or when you use your weird 'Moogle Magic' and every NPC in the vicinity gathers around in curiousity. The world generally feels alive and is really atmospheric.\nMy only gripe is the way they handled invisible level bounderies. It is kind of immersion breaking when your characters can jump up towering trees that are dozens of meters high, but at the same time the knee high rubble in another area proves to be an insurmountable obstacle and you need to "find a way around it".\n\nSome of the aforementioned items you can find allow you to unlock more and more areas and side quests. Speaking of side quests though, the area selection hub does - in my opinion - a poor job in distinguishing the main story line from side quests. With how often I traveled back and forth between different time lines and areas I wasn't always quite sure if I was doing a mandatory or an optional quest. And in some cases a quest is even optional in the beginning, up until the game tells you that it is now mandatory for the story progression, and you realize you already did all that 6 hours ago. Oh well.\nThe missions itself feature a good variety of objectives. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but they usually require specific actions in specific locations and times to change something along the time line. It never felt like i was doing boring chores.\n\nNow let's get to my favorite part of the game.\n\nGameplayAside from walking around and talking to NPCs, the field gameplay features small 'puzzles' every now and then. Most of them are insultingly easy, though. Some of them are plain annoying.\n\nNow, the battle system is largely the same as XIII's. However, it has one neat little addition. You can now recruite Pokémon to fight at your site.\nI have to admit, I'm a sucker for the Shin Megami Tensei series and its demon recruiting and fusion mechanic. And Final Fantasy XIII-2's system is kind of similar to this.\nWhenever you kill a monster there is a chance to 'capture' it. You now have your very own lvl. 1 version of this monster with basic abilities, which you can either keep leveling up with specific monster materials (random drops, loot; can be bought later) or you decide to infuse it, in order to pass some of its abilities on to a stronger monster. This way you can spend dozens of hours trying to create unique and powerful allies.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as you can customize your monsters, the same thing does not apply to your main characters. Their level progression is much more set in stone. Both of them have obvious roles they excell at. Like, Serah is a much better Ravager than Noel, while Noel is the better Synergist and so on, so you obviously want to focus on these first.\nAdditionally, the very high encounter rate lets you accumulate way too many CP (exp) too quickly, leading to overleveled characters, who steamroll every story boss in a matter of seconds (both main characters even stopped learning new abilities about 30% and were completely maxed out a little over halfway through the game).\nSpeaking of encounters in this game, they technically aren't random encounters, as they appear on the map in front of you and you could theoretically avoid them. This is easier said than done, however, as many of the enemies move significantly faster than you and hit you before you can escape.\nOne thing I did like about the encounters, though, was how in some locations there is a rare chance to spawn significantly stronger monsters than usual. Sort of like optional bosses who randomly appear in certain regions.\nAnd don't worry, even if you manage to die at any point, you will never lose anything. You have the option to retry any battle at any time and the game generally autosaves left and right.\n\nThe autosave feature also reminds me of my final bullet point.\n\nTechnical IssuesLets get this straight. The PC version of Final Fantasy XIII-2 is one of the worse console ports out there. Thus, it can and will randomly crash during loading screens. FORTUNATELY it autosaves everytime you enter or exit an area. So, I never lost any progress, personally.\n\nAnother problem is the awful frame rate. Currently there is no surefire way to fix the frame rate stuttering, everyone has. Forcing V-Sync and triple buffering and disabling the weird 'maximized windowed mode' (yes, the game runs in windowed mode, even if you choose the full screen option in the launcher) made it somewhat bearable for me. Some of the more populated areas will most likely always cause problems, though.\nIf they ever manage to fix these issues, this whole point becomes moot.  But until this happens, the game may or may not give you a headache due to its unstable framerate.","March 4, 2015","true","117.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The battle system breaks away from the traditional turn based system which is a nice improvement in my opinon. While the story isn't as stellar compared to previous Final Fantasy games, it is still interesting to play through. The story repeats similar areas in Final Fantasy 13 which may seem bad at first, but they add a certain freshness to each area making them unique and fun to go through again. The Soundtrack for this game is incredible and is definately one of the better FF soundtracks. There is also a lot of replay value in this game because of the alternate endings, side quests, and monster taming. Also purchasing the game includes most of the DLCs so its a nice bonus to the game.\nOverall the game is worth picking up for its low price and is fun for advocates and newcomers alike!","March 5, 2015","true","78.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Final Fantasy XII's story is a Godsend in comparison to this.  Imagine Final Fantasy XIII's story but with time travel that goes against all of the modern time travel conventions.  It is really only there to get the characters together for a new adventure.  You should not be playing this game for the story.\n\nExploration-  While still somewhat linear, there are hidden chests placed throughout the world that you can find.  You are also able to accept quests in the field.  Completion of these quests will cut down on grind time because they give you EXP (Crystarium Points).  You can travel between the different areas of the game in the Historia Crux, a menu showing all of the points of time you can travel to.  This menu allows you to reset areas, battling bosses again and gathering treasures you might have missed.  Enemies show up at random on the field, but you are given a short period of time to run away from them or get an early attack on them.\n\nCombat-  In combat, you have a bar that is split into several segments that fills over time.  Battle commands can be attached to the segments of the gauge.  You can choose to use the entirety of your gauge at once, or use moves as the bar fills up.  Serah and Noel can be assigned classes and switch between these classes in combat.  This is where the meat of the battle strategy comes from.  You are able to have a Pokemon-esque monster accompany you in battle.  This monster also has a class which will help balance out your team.  The way the class system works still goes over my head, but I think that combat is enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nOptimization- This game will run like garbage on YOUR PC.  I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE A TITAN X, THE GAME IS JUST BROKEN.  EXPECT 30 FPS AT ALL TIMES.\n\nTL;DR, like most modern Final Fantasy games you will love it or you will hate it.  The story is meaningless, but the gameplay is enjoyable.\n\n6.5/10 mediocre, would bluescreen while playing again.","April 8, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is nicely carried over from the first XIII title and is generally presented pretty well. We return to familiar faces, along with some new ones.\n\nThe story starts off quite confusing and you are given tons of info pretty quickly. It may seem messy at first due to alot of unexplained events and the time travel aspect can mix things up a little further. However time travel in XIII-2 is mostly used as a way to get the game world to be opened up a bit and to move away from the linear direction that was FFXIII, from this point of view its done well and doesnt really pose any issues. As the story goes on it gets really intense, i found myself at the edge of my seat a few times.\n\nThe graphics for the most part seem to be slightly improved over the first game and are really enjoyable. The battle system is fantastic. Its simular to XIII with a bit of a twist with things like the mog clock, allowing you to start off a battle with haste if timed well. There is also the addition of pets and they act as the third member in your party. The Crystarium System is more streamlined and works really well.\n\nThe performance for some reason isnt as good as XIII and i find myself getting very varied frame rates, this should not happen on a 4000 dollar PC that was purchased in 2015. Overall its not too much of a problem, however it certainly doesnt go unnoticed and its worth mentioning. Hopefully they improve on this for Lightning Returns.\n\nBoss fights feel very rewarding and fun. Encounter mechanics are fresh and interesting, this game has one of the most memorable final boss fights ive experienced in ages. There is a fair amount of grinding needed to be done to down the final boss but nothing too crazy, the progression feels right, they really nailed it here. There is a great addition of skins in XIII-2 that are taken to the next level in Lightning Returns, something that i rate very highly as i love customization in any game.\n\nThere is a lack of CG cutscenes in XIII-2 i would have liked a little more than the 2 or 3 they did for the game.\n\nOverall i found FFXIII-2 to be a fantastic sequel that is a must play for anyone that enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII, you get the chance to delve further into Lightning and Serah's story, I cant wait to jump into Lightning Returns, this might be one of the best game trilogies ive played, infact this game was the reason i will continue to invest my time and money into the franchise and purchase a PS4 to contine the legacy that is Final Fantasy.\n\nWould thank Square Enix again and again and again for porting this to PC.\n\n9/10\n\n","March 4, 2015","true","100.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I am going to "rant" more about this game in-detail.\n\n\n\nSTORY/ART STYLE\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the thirteenth instalment in the series. That said, in retrospective, I think I actually like it story-wise more than XIII-2. Why? Because of the time travel element! The wisdom I once heard: "Usually, when a time travel plot element is involved, it tells that the story writers were desperate." That seems to be the case in some parts of the story.\nWhile the story seems much clearer so far in the game, initially, when you first start, the concept of time traveling seems to do nothing but confuse with all the feeling-based concusions about the future and the past. You are given a simple goal: get from point A to point B, and the "road" to there is all tangled up. Sort of.\n\nRemember FFX-2? It was supposed (?) to be a direct sequel, sure. However, it was a whole different game! There's sort of a stigma associated with direct sequels to Final Fantasy games and it sure made my expectations lower for this "direct sequel", too.\n\nThe plot? with all the "kupo! look-at-me-i'm-so-cute" and some painfully slow and outright boring parts aside, I have so far enjoyed the idea of finding Lightning and untangling the tangles. I think I will finish the game (once).\n\nI'm not very fond of the violin-piano-la-la-la-remember-my heart-la-la-female vocalist faintly singing type of a thing, as it seems very "girly" or overly romanticized and overused in the universe of FFXIII. I do, however, like few of the battle themes and how the track intensifies when monsters appear on the field.\n\n\nThe characters? We see three kind of character behaviour in this game:\n1) Characters state the obvious. and do it again.\n2) Characters don't know a thing\n3) Characters (Serah infamously so) become quantum scientists; they pull wild, speculated theories out of the thin air that turn out to be truth.\n\nUsually in the following pattern:  1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 -1 - 1 -1 -1\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nWithout a doubt, combat and leveling up are my salt and butter in this game. Just like in FFXIII, I find it satisfactory to level up the crystarium and watching the stats go higher. I like the paradigm system as it makes it possible to "stagger" the otherwise ridiculously strong opponents and beat them up with the right set of paradigms.\n\nI am not entirely satisfied with few things:\n\nMog throwing? ugh. A nice idea, but the implementation is not quite there.\n\nMog clock? In few places of the game, the enemies "chase" you and the mog clock turns red. The problem here is, the enemies are no where to be seen! This means, you are forced into combat with no retry option. How convenient.\n\nThe gameplay really drags the story in some parts. Some dungeon hallways are so narrow that you are practically forced to fight battles every few meters. The same things with fast and aggressive enemies in some dungeons. Luckily, the dungeons seem short, which seems to balance this out a little.\n\nPerformance issues: the game seems to lag here and there and the gameplay seems capped at 30fps for the most of it. I am running the game on a decent "gaming" rig:\n\ni5 3570k @ 4ghz\ngtx 970 4gb\n12 gb ddr3 ram\n\nThe performance definitely could be better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raziadastra/recommended/292140/","raziadastra","Razi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raziadastra/","320 products in account","FFXIII-2 is such a good game that it almost makes me like FFXIII in retrospect. Almost.\n\nFirst, let's just get the elephant in the room out of the way: yes, this port is terribly optimized. It may work fine for some, but I played at 30fps with drops, with is really pretty abysmal. The only thing this has over playing on console is resolution and the ability to use the Japanese audio. The Japanese audio, by the way, is fantastic.\n\nSo now on to the good. I played through FFXIII and really hated the experience by the end and still consider it the worst entry in the franchise. Then this game comes along and basically fixes every problem I had with the original.\n\nCombat:\n- Paradigm switching is now instant! A no brainer change, really, but it changes the pace of battle so much when you don't have to watch the camera stupidly focus in on every party member one at a time for each paradigm shift.\n\n- You can now tame wild monsters and have them fight along side you. This not only goes a long way towards offering the player choice in how to compose their party early on, but it's also just a lot of fun finding badass or adorable monsters and taming them.\n\n-The game just generally utilizes the game mechanics much more. I was forced to rapidly switch between paradigms and change up my party compositions SO much more than the original.\n\n-Boss fights typically include QTE's to finish off the fight. Some might take issue with this but I liked them and it made beating bosses feel really satisfying. Reminded me of Bayonetta.\n\n-Enemies no longer appear in the field all the time, but rather randomly show up in circle around you as you walk around. This isn't reeeaaally a positive or negative change, but what IS better is that you now have a dedicated attack button to get the drop on enemies instead of runnung around in circles like an idiot tryng to run into enemies from behind like in the original.\n\n-Actually, there is a negative to be mentioned here: difficulty spikes. I have no problem with challenging games but when a section or boss comes out of nowhere and just wipes the floor with you repeatedly it tends to raise an eyebrow. This thankfully only happened to me twice (once in the middle, and then final batshit crazy boss), but it was more than a little annoying.\n\nGeneral Gameplay:\nThe original game had you do 2 things and 2 things only: walk forward and fight enemies. FFXIII-2 not only gets you up and running with all the game mechanics MUCH quicker, but generally has a greater amount of variety in it's gameplay, including:\n\n- Actual sidequests! And lots of 'em!\n\n- NPC's to talk to and interact with! Lots of those too!\n\n- Branching pathways and areas that aren't a simple straight line!\n\n- Monsters to tame and level up! Fight with a chocobo at your side!\n\n- You have an adorable Moogle companion who you can throw (yes, throw) to reach far away treasure. A small but hilarious addition.\n\n- The crystarium has been changed. It's still a pretty linear affair, but every time you fill up a full grid or screen or whatever, you can choose a big reward like adding a new section to the ATB guage or even unlocking a new role.\n\nStory/characters/world:\n- I was completely sick of most of the characters in FFXIII by the time I was through with it. Serah and Noel are, thankfully, handled in a much better fashion. I found Serah to be likeable from the get go,  and while her motivations aren't really that deep ("I just want to see my sister again!") she's characterized really well and her sincerity is really charming. Then Noel is like FF's version of Riku, minus the being a d*ck to the main character part. Both have really solid voice acting whether playing in Japanese or English.\n\n- This game is also pretty dark, which might not be what you expect from looking at it. The farther and farther into the future you travel the more hopeless things become. This sense of desperation, to me, is the heart of Final Fantasy.\n\n- On a similar note, the time travelling is a lot of fun. Seeing how the world and characters change depending on what time period or even timeline they're in is really interesting. There's a good chance you'll get sick of hearing the word "paradox", though. You've been warned.\n\nGraphics/sound:\n- The soundtrack is phenominal. The original certainly wasn't dragging it's feet in this department but I feel like it fell a bit short of pulling off a "different" sounding FF score. XIII-2 absolutely pulls it off. The three composers have put together an awesome collection of beautiful tracks ranging from the classic FF sounds, to some more electronically infused numbers and,  best of all, a handfull of tracks that include vocals. The New Bodhum theme alone sets this score apart.\n\n- The game's a looker, no doubt about that. Special mention goes to the animation however, as I think Square is really great at animating their characters and especially faces.\n\nThere is one more negative however, and that's how the game handles it's ending. To see the "real" ending you have to play a (thankfully included) DLC chapter that is incredibly tedious and feels entirely divorced from the whole experience. It's weird that Square would get such a huge amount of things right in this game and then bork up the delivery of the ending. Yeah. Just weird.\n\nThat aside, I can't recommend this game enough. If you already liked the first, then you robably didn't need any convincing anyway, but if you are like me and hated the original, then I have to urge you to give this one a shot. It's not often that a studio puts in this much effort into fixing a game, so when they do I think they deserve to be rewarded.","February 16, 2015","true","52.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How is it possible that I can run NEW games on High to Ultra, yet get 9-30 FPS on this game, one from years ago? Not to mention the graphics are so fuzzy, it looks like somebody enabled FXAA antialiasing for a program that doesn't require it. Even using NVIDIA control panel to give a performance boost does ZERO to help increase FPS. Regardless of whether you play the game with x16 MSAA, or x2, you receive the same FPS. Same with the shadow quality slider option. If anything, it ran slightly smoother with maxed graphics quality than lesser. Not to mention the audio is all over the place. Voices are too loud in cutscenes, too soft everywhere else, and there is no in-game slider to balance it out. Once (or IF) patched and stabilized, it will be as much fun as it was for the PS3. If it doesn't receive the needed patches/updated optimizations, steer clear of this game for the PC.\n\n[Updated - 12-16-2014]\n\nAfter clearing the very first area, the fps improved by 10, which is apparently a huge deal for this particular game. Game is now playable at a constant 20-30 fps, with the only increase over that being 50-60 for menu/blank loading screens.\n\nIdk what all was going on graphically in the first area, but it must have had some serious graphic drainers. Hopefully they patch this game eventually like how they did with FF13's fps stability update. Adding an ingame option to change the various sound levels would be nice too. However, now that I'm back to reliving the fun I had years ago on the PS3 version, I can thankfully change this to something I recommend.","December 12, 2014","true","105.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crymzen/recommended/292140/","crymzen","Fawkzi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crymzen/","290 products in account","TL;DR: It feels like DLC turned in to a full game but there are major improvements/changes that make it interesting enough to warrent a purchase. The graphics seem worse than XIII yet the assets look like they were pulled directly from the previous game. The story is the weaker element, not as good as XIII yet the gameplay improved on everything that was annoying about XIII. It's a good title, it holds up as it's own game but it's not something that will keep you hooked.\n\n(I jumped right in to XIII-2 just moments after finishing XIII so comparisons will be made between the two, this review will concentrate on the changes made from XIII to XIII-2 as the games are so similar that if you did like XIII then you will most likely enjoy this.)\n\nIt feels like DLC turned in to a full game, What i mean by this is that it feels like they had a cool idea to play as Serah in an expansion to XIII but opted to turn it in to it's own game, This is common in the industry (Just take a look at Saints Row 4, it was originally a DLC for Saints Row The Third)\n\nWith that being said  it IS a fun game to play though at first glance it is misleading, With Lightning's character model and face plastered all over the place it is easy for one to think that she is the focus of the game, she is in a sense but not in the playable kind, she is the starting focus of the story.\n\nSerah is your playable character in this game, a long with a boy called Noel. Graphics wise it actually looks worse than the original XIII to me but that could be down to the port itself. Gameplay wise itis more of the same only they scrolled things back a bit in terms of enemy encounters.\n\nYou can no longer see the enemies in full view as you could in XIII, encounters work on a detection system where enemies will randomly appear as you are running around, you can either try to run or attack them. It's a sort of ballance between the way encounters worked in XIII and how encounters worked in the old school games.\n\nThe combat system as been revamped somewhat though it does feel a hell of a lot slower (even when using the haste ability) One of the major improvements is ability to switch party leader mid battle, this also means that the battle is not over if your current party leader goes down in battle, it simply switches to the next person so you can continue the fight.\n\nThe major update though is the addition of monsters, you can now "Tame" monsters you encounter (Through no special mechanic, you simply beat a monster and sometimes it will drop a crystal wich adds that monster to your collection) These monsters act as your third party member in combat, each one having a specific role from the same pool of character roles that you saw in XIII.\n\nThese monsters can not become party leader and have the same behavior as any AI set in whatever role it happens to be in but with a unique twist. every monster has it's own special attack which can be used by incrasing the "Feral Link" gauge, this gauge works very similar to the "Gestalt" and "TP" gauge from XIII. Once full you can activate a special attack which then starts a QTE to determine a damage boost to said attack via a "Sync Level"\n\nHow fast you complete the QTE prompts determines your Sync percentage which determines the damage boost for the attack, each monster has it's very own unique attack each with different attributes.\n\nThe leveling system has also changed a fair bit, the Crystarium is back but in a different way, rather than all roles having their own seperate progression track all roles are now on the same track which i honestly do prefer because "Builds" are now a viable option. The Crystarium also expands automatically rather than in key points of the story, once you reach the end of what is currently available the track will then expand, you can then pick a bonus.\n\nThe bonuses are pretty cool, you can pick a boost the roles you have unlocked, unlock a new role or increase your accessory capacity. The Crystarium is also available for your monsters, though you can not use "CP" to upgrade them, instead you use componants to progress them but it still works in the same way..the main difference beign you can not change the role of a monster, each monster has it's own set role an dunique progression track.\n\nThey made a big change to the way you equip accessories, in XIII you started with one slot and unlocked more as you progressed, here you start with three and can still unlock more except now you have a capacity, each accessory has a number next to it, for example a ring has a value of 55, your capacity is 70, if you want to equip a second accessory you will needd to find one that doesn't go above the remaining capacity, example case being 15. Your capacity can of course be upgrade via the Crystarium expansion bonuses.\n\nAll in all it is a decen entry, far from being the best and story wise it isn't as good as XIII but Gameplay wise it adds enough new mechanics to edge ahead of XIII. It's worth it for the price, give a try.","February 17, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some underlying flaws but it left me with a positive experience playing through to the end. The plot is very hard to follow, in that sometimes it just doesn't make sense. It's a time travel plot but where usually with this type of plot, you change the past and the future changes, here everything changes including the past, as well as having a location and character in the opening sequence that falls out of 'time' and you arent really sure whats going on. The good? It look's pretty, even if things don't make sense .\n\nThe battle system is probably the best disguise for a bad system I've seen in a long while. 'Auto Battle' command is back, which lets the CPU choose the best actions round by round. Personally I like to issue commands manually, only the thing is, to do so will put you at a huge disadvantage - manually issuing commands takes a couple seconds more while enemies still attack and prepare moves, and the commands are very generic (Attack, Magic attack, and four elements) for the most part. There are some battles with 6 enemies where I couldn't even tell what was going on, I found most battles I was glued to the HUD without looking at the graphics etc.\n\nYou control one character while the AI controls the other, as well as a tamed monster you can have. I disliked this system too - it had potential but did a bad job of explaining what monster stats were, what benefit using monster A over monster B was, or even the fact it doesnt flag 'rare' monsters you encounter in the field up so you can easily pass them by.\n\nCharacter progression felt flat. You can level according to what you prefer, class wise, but by the end of the game you realise that in the end you will end up the same as every other player. As well, the points you put into the system to level up, dont seem to actually 'do' much. Partially realted to being glued to the HUD, you don't notice your characters scoring that massive crit thanks to their new stats/gear, because well, the numbers arent that impressive. Additionally the game seems to reward grinding and raw stats over strategy leaving many battles feeling unrewarding.\n\nThe game is not linear, one of the main complaints many had with XIII. Did they take it a bit too far here? Maybe. I would say no, overall, however the tools you use to unlock extra stages or unlock special skills, or heck to even advance, were very difficult to locate in levels without the assistance of a guide. I didn't have too much issue finding my way to the end of the game, but then going back and trying to unlock extra stages or locate and capture decent monsters is impossible to acheive in any sort of decent time without a guide.\n\nPerformance wise, it is a bad port, but with a few tweaks it is bearable, even fine if you have a good specced PC (I run it on an i7, GTX 770, and aside from a few frame rate drops it has been fine after tweaking using nvidia's own graphics settings.) There are no meaningful graphics settings in the games menu, so first thing you will want/need to do is google up some reccomended settings and then change these directly in your GFX cards manufacturers tool.\n\nExpect to get around 30 hours from the main story, and exploring side branches of the story reasonably well. Post game, FF fans may expect an uber boss, there are a few in this however as mentioned before, to even set about finding them, or preparing for them, you need a guide. If I'm using a guide to do everything I don't see the point in doing it, so I will likely complete some of the DLC and retire from the game. Overall the 30 hours have been enjoyable and I felt I have definately got my moneys worth,","August 9, 2015","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, it's a time paradox based story so you'll find as many plot holes as you want to, but I'd say the writers watched a lot of Doctor Who and it looks decent enough to be enjoyed.\n- The main paradox in the story is just great, with a Doctor Who style resolution. Awesome.\n- Real choices with corresponding alternate endings which make sense. And it's a way to escape your doom if you understand the problems with what the main characters are doing ...\n- The two main characters are annoying and mean good but don't really know what they are doing. Clever. Lightning on the other hand is the best character from the XIII series by far, and they found a nice way to keep her busy while making her look good.\n- Good combat system, slightly improved from XIII.\n- The way the side content is blended with the main story (you have to do side missions at some points in the story, explore timelines a bit randomly, etc).\n- Lots of side timelines and additional missions.\n- Lots of content.\n\nBad:\n- Could use a few more locations and one or two major paradox plots in the main story.\n- Some important side content is gratuitously hard to find without guides (wild artefacts locations ...).\n- Too grindy to complete the endgame content.\n- Confusing character advancement (read guides).\n- The third character in the party are monsters which can be swapped. Nice, but again too grindy and impossible to use correctly without reading wikis and guides. Although they tried to find something original and it's a decent attempt, a regular character would have been better.\n- Graphics and textures are a big downgrade from XIII. Less budget (but far better game).\n- Some technical details.","March 28, 2015","true","51.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the requisite production values, large scope, interesting battle system, monster variety, and pretty much everything else you'd expect. Square Enix did well in taking a very different direction than the game's predecessor. The ultra-restricted linearity is gone, replaced with far more explorable environments - and, at a macro level, the ability to time hop. It doesn't get much more nonlinear than that.\n\nBut the overall result is disappointing.\n\nWhen it all comes down to it, one of the central game mechanics becomes "find and do as much as you can." This kind of approach can be entirely functional and fun. It works wonderfully for the "Mass Effects," "Elder Scrolls," and "Fallouts" of the world. The problem is that "XIII-2" chooses to go the route of the 3D pixel hunt. That is, hints and direction are quite sparse, when they're around at all, and certain things (especially the Archylte Steppe) come down to a process of walking around every inch of an area you've already seen, hoping to run across something new. Which character offers quests? Who knows! What actually has an effect on this part of the gameworld? Who knows!\n\nThe mixture is both boring AND frustrating, which is not a recipe for a happy player.\n\nNow, this kind of thing has been found in the "Final Fantasy" series before. It's just that it's very, very optional. Completing the game is usually about the core mechanics of character development and party management, with some very powerful goodies thrown in for the person who pokes their nose into everything. In "XIII-2," poking your nose into everything is much more central to finishing the storyline - and that can make it rather maddening. The game suffers from a case of "Guide Dang It" (where you would never logically figure out an element from gameplay alone) more than any other "Final Fantasy" I've played.\n\n"XIII-2," like its predecessor, also has a case of a suddenly steep difficulty curve. You'll find a combat groove, and it will work all the way to the end of the game...and then the final battle occurs, and...looks like we need to go hunting around for more things in places we never thought to look! Let's try talking to everybody again. Again! While getting attacked by monsters the whole way! Again! Some more!\n\nSigh.\n\nAnd then, you finally get to the ending, and it lacks any real payoff at all. (I can't say too much without spoiling things, but my reaction pretty much sums up as, "They can't actually be serious about this, can they?")\n\nAs a final note, I have to say that I just dislike the whole "time travel and alternate universes" thing. It really worked for "Dr. Who," but I find it thoroughly stale and disinteresting when used anywhere else. It seems to always turn into a case of "we just want to throw a bunch of random stuff together, and so we'll explain it with TIME GATES!" The game doesn't quite go that far - it is decently written - but my not being a fan of the central premise as a storytelling strategy doesn't make me want to award points to the title.\n\nIn summary, "XIII-2 " really does improve on "XIII" in certain areas, but it's still more obtuse than it ought to be. Also, it REALLY hits some sour notes with how it wraps itself up. It was good enough to play through, but if "Final Fantasy" were a band, this would be one of the weakest albums in the catalog.","August 16, 2015","true","50.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did my best to stick with this series, but Square has really fukt up and dropped the ball. The characters are mediocre, at best(mostly cliche). The story was a HUGE mess. The combat system falls apart with their sad attempt at "pokemon" fighters, which doesn't allow you to have a 3rd fighter. Also, there are certain areas of the game that are off limits due to implemented (and unfinished) DLC. This game was a huge disappointment and a waste of everyone'e time and money.

Here are my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nFun high paced style very different from previous FF games.\nGreat animations and environments.\nLots of freedom to explore and extra challenges to face.\nGood voice acting and excelent music.\n\nCons:\nQTE finishers on boss monsters. I hate QTE sequences I'm sure some people love them just not for me.\nNo limit breaks. Your monsters get limit breaks which can be mildly powerful but your characters don't get them they get these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ super spells that can only be used once a fight and do only slightly more damage than normal moves.\nAuto attacking is more effective than trying to cue up abilities manually. The fighting is too fast to navigate the menus and select the ideal combos (especially if you are hasted in a boss fight) and auto select does a decent job so why even bother?\nOnly having two people is novel but I didn't like it. Requires grinding areas for rare monster crystals which could take tens of hours if you're unlucky.\nStory is hard to follow even for a time travel game.\nLimited customization in character leveling. (again only two characters and they can be maxed out pretty quick)\nNo crafting or ultimate weapons.\nCapacity limit or status ailments makes good gear worse (better to stack delicate low level items for synergy bonus).\nRepetitive zones. It's cool you can go to the same place at different ages but it's the exact same map you play though 3 sometimes 4 times.\nNo new monsters or bosses. Same exact monsters and abilities and differet time periods have the same mobs just a different color pallet.\nNo fun mini games. The casino is dull the poker can only be played after the game is beaten and even then the opponents are predictable and no fun to play against. Slot machines are worthless.\nEnding sucks. No spoilers just know that the ending along with pretty much all the Pardox Endings are sh*tty.\n\nFinal verdict.\n\nIt was fun and I did throw a bunch of hours into the game collecting almost all the fragments and getting the various endings but the poor story, poor character development, and lame ending are all major turn offs. Get it if you are a major FF fan (though you would probably already have played it by now) or it's on a significant sale.","July 3, 2015","false","42.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not stingy about framerate, so playing this game at a steady, unmoving 30fps feels really nice, in comparison to the wonky 10fps-60fps I was having with the framerate unlocker.\n\nHere's what I did: I first tried the framerate unlocker, which, as I said, was giving me some rather inconsistent framerate, among several other issues such as lip-sync going off. After that, I used a program called Nvidia Inspector (there's another program called RadeonPro for AMD cards) to limit my framerate to 30fps and v-sync to 1/2 refresh rate. My game was working perfectly after that, though the rain glitch still existed. After picking up the fix for that, I can enjoy the game fully, completely, how it was intended to be played.\n\nIf you follow those steps, this PC port is definitely the best version of the game. Coming with most of the console version's DLC, and now with Japanese audio (which in my opinion, is vastly superior to the English audio), this game is a great experience that improves upon the original XIII in every way I can think of. While I haven't beaten it yet, the story is great so far, with interesting characters, good graphics, fun gameplay, ear-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic soundtrack, and fantastic atmosphere. I can see why Famitsu gave this game a 40/40, it's rather incredible.\n\nThe XIII series is criminally underrated by "fans" of Final Fantasy, but if you like JRPGs with high production values and go in with an open mind (the story isn't told to you completely, you have to figure some of it out yourself), you'll like this game a lot.","February 17","true","181.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The framerate issues due to HUD messing up the framerate still not fixed? Meh, Square Enix doesn't bother polishing their PC ports. Even Lightning Returns has framerate issues apparently, just not nearly as bad as this or FFXIII but bad enough that most reviews seem to mention it.\n\nThis game? I'm on the fence... it's a decent RPG... but yet again? Square Enix ♥♥♥♥ED UP THE PORT! Yeah I can select screen resolutions, MSAA and Shadow Resolutions... but the framerate... oh man, it just SUCKS how much it flops between 60fps animations and 30fps animations... and how the Heads Up Display (menus and the Action Time Bar) is the main issue of the framerate never reaching 60fps in combat! Outside of combat? Disabling the minimap improves framerate!! WHY DOES THE 2D HUD CAUSE MY FRAMERATE TO TANK SO HARD!?\n\nThe best solution I've found is to unlock the fps via a .exe mod discovered by FF community members and then forcing a 30fps cap. It at least keeps the frame time variance quite leveled so at least the game doesn't have such terrible framerate stuttering.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388731782&insideModal=1","February 14, 2015","false","43.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Final Fantasy 13-2 is the story of Serah, Noel, and the Time Rangers. Time is broken and it's up to them to solve history. As Time Travel stories go, I've seen worse and more confusing ones.\n\n13-2 gets going right out of the gate in stark contrast of FF 13 which took about 10 hours before it opened up.  In this game, you can explore right from the the start.\n\nThe combat system is the same paradigm system from the first game with the added touch of monster taming. Tamed monsters fight with you in battle as part of your paradigms and, most monsters in the game can be tamed;each coming with their own active and passive benefits. Taming  monsters became my thing as I sought out and farmed specific monsters to add to my party.\n\nThe combat system never got boring, the story kept me interested until the end, and the monster farming added a fun side thing to do. Sure this is a Jrpg ♥♥♥ jrpg and got anime AF at times. But that's pretty much what I was expecting from a Final Fantasy game.  Some people on here were griping about the frame rate, but, I never experienced any FPS issues.  Worth the purchase.\n\nThis game also has a primer that tells the story of Final Fantasy 13 very well so you can skip the first game and not feel that you missed out on anything.\n\nPlayed on a Toshiba Satellite\n\ni5-3337u\n740m 2GB\n12GB Ram\n\nPlayed on medium/high settings with no noticable frame rate issues.","April 3","true","38.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For some people; this story might not be interesting, but it still have some fun parts to play with. I'll give it some examples:\n\n- First of all, one thing is not going change is this game has an excellent graphic, no doubt it. I can adjust the screen size resolution same as FF13 Lightning Returns up to 1920x1080p and shadow resolution up to 8120x8120 before the game starts, which is really high definition. I found when I put my shadow resolution into 8120x8120, everthing seems like too lagging, almost gone to frozen. I was not able to turn off game, then started panicking. After like 10 minutes, I shut down my PC and restarted again. Listen carefully, I can hardly to move the mouse to the shut down button. I found myself quite silly sometime, I should have made sure my PC can run that level before I go to adjust the resolutions. As a result, I just wanted to find that setting how high resolution my PC can handle itself.\n\nOne thing I would like to suggest is making a game on a PC should have an Exit button, then player can go exit the game easily rather than clicking the window tab to go out to the window bar and close the game app or going into Steam app to play a game and closing the game on Steam app. Just my opinion sharing.\n\n- Second of all, I want to be clear I am not a spoiler, I just want to talk about the battle combat in this episode. In this episode, the battle combat still keep the old version of the function the most which I feel a bit not functional like Lightning Returns, it would be good to have some movements controling by the players, let players feel they're actually controling what Lightning is going to move next. At the same time, I found a new battle combat, which was Cinematic Actions". I found Cinematic Actions quite fun to play with, it's also about testing how fast you can react. I think Cinemtic Actions makes you more exciting and what makes players to expect something that is cool and fun would happen.\n\nI have a thought of this Cinematic Actions, if this could put it into Final Fantasy 7, to me I think, it would be really epic! Myself quite like this kind of cinematic actions, it is also really making a game come to life. People like playing something different, such as something interact something move by using hand or joypad button or mouse, & VR Gear.\n\n- At last, this game is not bad, it has a lot of things and fun stuff to play. As usual, I would recommend this game to my friends! Thanks the director and the group of game developers for making this three long episodes for every player here included me! I really appreciate it! Glad I have bought this game! Keep making great games!","December 29, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything has been made so that it is impossible for you to accidently screw up your game hence why it does not take much brain.\n- Story is okay-ish, however there is a lots of little points which just felt like they were fixed together without any proper thoughts.\n- Dialogs / Interactions often include choices which are absolutely meaningless\n- Cinematics have quick time events.\n- They tried to randomized the encounter by spawning the monsters right into your face but this is just as bad and can create issues are times.\n- The game crashed due to Steam cloud, fixed it by disabling it for the game but these kind of thing should simply not happen on a finished product.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and play Chrono Cross, Star Oceans or probably any other RPGS instead of wasting your time on this game.

I tried an application that would lock my fps didn't work. I tried one that would remove the files that cap your fps in the final fantasy files. Didn't work.\nWhat worked for me is plugging in a controller. I don't know why but the fps lag and in game lag is gone. So if you have a controller (any controller seems to work) then plug it in and play with that. (I have a logitech gamepad F310)\n\nPlease try this series out its by far my favorite, you won't regret it <3","January 6","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall I really enjoyed playing this game, and am still building up the monster's for fun! If you like RPG's you will probably like this game. It might help to know the previous story in 13 but honestly I had to re read most of it again since it's so complicated at times so really you can jump in at this game I think.\n\nYou'll find the graphics are nice and the animations are good, its overall a very nice game to listen to and play but its not a very good FF game. Meaning that because its has FF in the front of its title its supposed to blow the doors off of the ride. Its just not that good.\n\nSo if you like rpg's you'll find the game to be a mix of chrono trigger with time travel and tomb raider with exploration and finding VERY hard to find fragements that are shaded dark and transparent so have fun with that without a guide!\n\nThe rest of the difficulty is just navigating the huge world where i feel it can slow the pacing. Old final fantasy games would frustrate me with the amount of battles and lack of story progress where as here the sheer size of the worlds to travel can take up time. there are chocobo's to speed things up but still... some maps are needlessly big. A common square enix complaint of mine. To much world not much interaction.\n\nThe music is good but for its ups it has downs, i wouldn't play the ost front to back but playlist about half of it. Nice though overall.\n\nThe battle system is where its at. This time you have only two character's,  aa bold rpg move, but you have a rotating monster to fill the third spot, this is fun but they are usually kinda weak untill late game so its helpful but sort of lacking as a real team member.\n\nThe story is cool but why is time travel just now making an appearance in FF13 series? I don't think this is really all bad but it makes the world seem contrived and its just an odd feeling of the series being not a very well defined and formed rpg.\n\nThey just make these ff games ont the fly these days without much real originality. Its a very manufactured rpg for your enjoyment but that's like a person who tries hard to be your friend and makes thier life choices around you. I would rather know they had a personality that was original and that I liked them... anyways i respect that they made improvements based on what we didn't like in 13... but why did they need to? Shouldn't they just make a good FF game that we are used to? Since 10 (the last true FF in many's opinion) its been all over the place and honestly just play this game as an RPG and put up with the Final Fantasy in the title as just a title not the gameplay hint.\n\nSad but true, its still a good RPG and i reccoment it. Its very fun but very hard and the story is different but interesting albeit with very few actual characters. Most places have people in the towns but its not like they really are that interesting in my opinion. I feel like this is a very KOTOR Final Fantasy actually but that could just be me.\n\nIf you like RPG's and action turn based combat get this one, its fun overall! If you like FF6 religiously try to take it in stride!","August 11, 2015","true","281.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the requisite production values, large scope, interesting battle system, monster variety, and pretty much everything else you'd expect. Square Enix did well in taking a very different direction than the game's predecessor. The ultra-restricted linearity is gone, replaced with far more explorable environments - and, at a macro level, the ability to time hop. It doesn't get much more nonlinear than that.\n\nBut the overall result is disappointing.\n\nWhen it all comes down to it, one of the central game mechanics becomes "find and do as much as you can." This kind of approach can be entirely functional and fun. It works wonderfully for the "Mass Effects," "Elder Scrolls," and "Fallouts" of the world. The problem is that "XIII-2" chooses to go the route of the 3D pixel hunt. That is, hints and direction are quite sparse, when they're around at all, and certain things (especially the Archylte Steppe) come down to a process of walking around every inch of an area you've already seen, hoping to run across something new. Which character offers quests? Who knows! What actually has an effect on this part of the gameworld? Who knows!\n\nThe mixture is both boring AND frustrating, which is not a recipe for a happy player.\n\nNow, this kind of thing has been found in the "Final Fantasy" series before. It's just that it's very, very optional. Completing the game is usually about the core mechanics of character development and party management, with some very powerful goodies thrown in for the person who pokes their nose into everything. In "XIII-2," poking your nose into everything is much more central to finishing the storyline - and that can make it rather maddening. The game suffers from a case of "Guide Dang It" (where you would never logically figure out an element from gameplay alone) more than any other "Final Fantasy" I've played.\n\n"XIII-2," like its predecessor, also has a case of a suddenly steep difficulty curve. You'll find a combat groove, and it will work all the way to the end of the game...and then the final battle occurs, and...looks like we need to go hunting around for more things in places we never thought to look! Let's try talking to everybody again. Again! While getting attacked by monsters the whole way! Again! Some more!\n\nSigh.\n\nAnd then, you finally get to the ending, and it lacks any real payoff at all. (I can't say too much without spoiling things, but my reaction pretty much sums up as, "They can't actually be serious about this, can they?")\n\nAs a final note, I have to say that I just dislike the whole "time travel and alternate universes" thing. It really worked for "Dr. Who," but I find it thoroughly stale and disinteresting when used anywhere else. It seems to always turn into a case of "we just want to throw a bunch of random stuff together, and so we'll explain it with TIME GATES!" The game doesn't quite go that far - it is decently written - but my not being a fan of the central premise as a storytelling strategy doesn't make me want to award points to the title.\n\nIn summary, "XIII-2 " really does improve on "XIII" in certain areas, but it's still more obtuse than it ought to be. Also, it REALLY hits some sour notes with how it wraps itself up. It was good enough to play through, but if "Final Fantasy" were a band, this would be one of the weakest albums in the catalog.","August 16, 2015","true","50.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The framerate issues due to HUD messing up the framerate still not fixed? Meh, Square Enix doesn't bother polishing their PC ports. Even Lightning Returns has framerate issues apparently, just not nearly as bad as this or FFXIII but bad enough that most reviews seem to mention it.\n\nThis game? I'm on the fence... it's a decent RPG... but yet again? Square Enix ♥♥♥♥ED UP THE PORT! Yeah I can select screen resolutions, MSAA and Shadow Resolutions... but the framerate... oh man, it just SUCKS how much it flops between 60fps animations and 30fps animations... and how the Heads Up Display (menus and the Action Time Bar) is the main issue of the framerate never reaching 60fps in combat! Outside of combat? Disabling the minimap improves framerate!! WHY DOES THE 2D HUD CAUSE MY FRAMERATE TO TANK SO HARD!?\n\nThe best solution I've found is to unlock the fps via a .exe mod discovered by FF community members and then forcing a 30fps cap. It at least keeps the frame time variance quite leveled so at least the game doesn't have such terrible framerate stuttering.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388731782&insideModal=1","February 14, 2015","false","43.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For some people; this story might not be interesting, but it still have some fun parts to play with. I'll give it some examples:\n\n- First of all, one thing is not going change is this game has an excellent graphic, no doubt it. I can adjust the screen size resolution same as FF13 Lightning Returns up to 1920x1080p and shadow resolution up to 8120x8120 before the game starts, which is really high definition. I found when I put my shadow resolution into 8120x8120, everthing seems like too lagging, almost gone to frozen. I was not able to turn off game, then started panicking. After like 10 minutes, I shut down my PC and restarted again. Listen carefully, I can hardly to move the mouse to the shut down button. I found myself quite silly sometime, I should have made sure my PC can run that level before I go to adjust the resolutions. As a result, I just wanted to find that setting how high resolution my PC can handle itself.\n\nOne thing I would like to suggest is making a game on a PC should have an Exit button, then player can go exit the game easily rather than clicking the window tab to go out to the window bar and close the game app or going into Steam app to play a game and closing the game on Steam app. Just my opinion sharing.\n\n- Second of all, I want to be clear I am not a spoiler, I just want to talk about the battle combat in this episode. In this episode, the battle combat still keep the old version of the function the most which I feel a bit not functional like Lightning Returns, it would be good to have some movements controling by the players, let players feel they're actually controling what Lightning is going to move next. At the same time, I found a new battle combat, which was Cinematic Actions". I found Cinematic Actions quite fun to play with, it's also about testing how fast you can react. I think Cinemtic Actions makes you more exciting and what makes players to expect something that is cool and fun would happen.\n\nI have a thought of this Cinematic Actions, if this could put it into Final Fantasy 7, to me I think, it would be really epic! Myself quite like this kind of cinematic actions, it is also really making a game come to life. People like playing something different, such as something interact something move by using hand or joypad button or mouse, & VR Gear.\n\n- At last, this game is not bad, it has a lot of things and fun stuff to play. As usual, I would recommend this game to my friends! Thanks the director and the group of game developers for making this three long episodes for every player here included me! I really appreciate it! Glad I have bought this game! Keep making great games!","December 29, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've scoured the internet for fixed, but it seems like I have wasted money on a game I can probably never play because I can't clock my CPU high enough to get it to a playable state.\n\nIs my CPU the best? No. But it fits the minimum reqs and it can run other recent games at buttery smooth framerates so I don't understand why I can't get at least a solid 30 in the beginning of the game, inside a small house, with no other characters on screen.\n\n1/10 at least the pre-rendered cutscenes are pretty\n\nEDIT: so I cranked all the settings down to the bare minimum and changed the power settings for this game in Nvidia Control Panel to maximum performance.

YOU ARE MUCH BETTER OFF GETTING A USED COPY OF THIS GAME ON A XBOX 360 OR PS3 CONSOLE FOR CHEAP INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nNote; I am not writing a negative review towards the game itself. From what I played so far with my few hours in this version, it's actually quite GREAT!! Obviously, the game takes place after the events of the Final Fantasy XIII and takes the original concept of XIII's game play and well... Pretty much sets it on fire.\n\nIt throws away the linearity seen in the original and makes it entirely open and free to explore (although personally I didn't mind linearity at all.. And imho it actually fits the stories theme but that's just my personal preference.) as well as adding some new features to what's an already great combat system... One of the new features being is that you can now have POKEMON ON YOUR TEAM!!! ...erm, I mean monsters of course...\n\nBUT....\nThere is just one thing wrong with this...\nIT'S THE PORT OF THIS GAME.. IT’S GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI was able to run the original game just fine with some minor issues here and there, but nothing too serious and was an overall enjoyable experience for me. However with this game, it runs terrible even though graphically the game is NOT any different as the orginal!! I keep on getting CONSTANT frame rate drops left and right, yet when I explore in some areas the frame rate runs buttery smooth. IT MAKES NO SENSE???\n\nNot only that, but the port also LACKS graphic options. The only options are just resolutions and anti-aliasing. SERIOUSLY!?!?\n\nThis port is so bad that I had to download patches for the game that was made by the community, but even then the game still ran terrible. I understand that porting console games onto the PC is no easy task, but seeing this coming out from SE, this is unacceptable.\n\nI had to watch a "movie" version of this game onto YouTube instead, and it really made me sad seeing as how I'll never get the chance of actually playing this game.. Which is a huge let down.\n\nWhat's even worse is that this port has been out for an ENTIRE YEAR... AND SE HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!!\n\nLike I said, just get the console version of this game, or watch a "movie" version of this game like I did on YouTube.

The battle system is almost the same as 13. but has added monster training as a third party member instead of another character. They also introduced dialogue options. Overall the level design is much better as they are way less linear and more interesting. Not to mention there is time travel and a ton of sidequests and alternate paradox endings to explore and find. The game has way more replayability than 13 and is a pretty big improvement on an already great game. English voice acting is still bad so I reccomend setting Japanese audio in the launcher.\n\nThe ONLY DOWNFALL of this game is severe framedrops. Overall during battle my game plays @60fps but some specific cutscenes where 10fps. Most cutscenes and exploration played at 40-60 fps with a lot of fluxuations. And there is a mod/patch someone made but it actually makes the framerate worse in some areas and some areas it does nothing. Also I have to get a patch for an Xbox One controller to work, but 13 had the same problem as well. (that's not too big of a deal though)\n\nI honestly don't mind the optimization issues becasue its a great game either way, and honestly it probably still runs at a hgher framerate than the console versions so it's better in that aspect anyways.","January 22","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
