Pad controls generally feel good, the action is exciting, the game is suitably twitch-based and the whole thing is just a joy to play.\n\nRecommedend to all shoot-'em-up fans. In fact, I'm sure even a few with little experience in the genre will have a good time, considering how slick a of a production this is.\n\nBut mainly, it's just good fun. You do like fun, right? No?

Satazius features an arsenal of 13 types of upgradeable weapons, power-ups, obstacles and boss encounters that arcade veterans will enjoy getting to grips with. Customize your ship by selecting two side weapons which can be selected at any time during and a charge attack to unleash massive destruction.\n\nThis game is not for the casual gamer as even i struggle to get to grips with its seemingly bipolar difficulty curve, good luck guys i highly recommend this game to the bullet hell "vet" out there. The sound track is great, its a metal retro mix of high speed loops and fast guitar riffs that really set the mood and get your blood pumping.\n\nAt first navigating the menus can be a hassle as the game does not tell you what button is mapped to Enter is Z if your wondering, apart from that the menus are simple and easy enough to navigate and the game even supports gamepad support, however i have not tried to use it myself so that's a mystery i shall leave to you guys.\n\nI was actually fairly impressed with the graphics in this game, granted there nothing spectacular however if this game was released alongside with r-type HD it would defiantly have given it a run for its money, as this games has a much higher pixel density and the animations are so fluid they look almost as good as another game called intrusion 2 witch features one of the best animated boss's i have ever seen\n\nSo the bottom line this game has great features and a great soundtracks but does not do anything new and fresh to this genre and missed out on a mark here, however with that said if your feeling a little bit sadistic then go on put your patience to the test, this game for me gets.....\n-------------------------------------\n8 out of 10 - High recommendations.","December 18, 2013","true","0.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/203990/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Satazius is a horizontal shoot em up in which the environments are far more dangerous than the enemies you will be fighting. You have multiple weapons to choose from and unlock more the further you progress. It is not a bullet hell as enemies fire reasonable amounts of projectiles, at least in the first two unlocked difficulties. You have a basic fire and two alt fires which you can switch between, all which can be switched for different unique weapons to make your ship like one of a kind. One shot will kill you if you don't pick up a shield power up but scraping into the environment will kill you regardless. One thing to be noted is that the game worked perfectly fine from the get go with my 360 pad even though it doesn't say that it has controller compatibility on the Steam page\n\nThe one thing that was weird with the controller was that you can not bind the pause button to it which  can be problematic. No dpad support either which is not too great considering the environments require pixel perfect navigation. On top of your already massive fire power you have a special rechargeable move which is really helpful against bosses. There is also powerups scattered around the level to further increase your damage and speed. All this makes you sound overpowered as heck, and you are actually pretty overpowered and the devs know it.  They will constantly sucker punch you with things you had no way to see coming instead of offering a fair challenge.\n\nYou are offered 9 continues each which grants you three lives a pop. Most of my deaths felt pretty cheap and made it into a trail and error type of game until you memorize the level. If you don't enjoy flying through very narrow insta-kill environments with little time to react this is not the game for you. Being only 7 levels long means having a high difficulty is kind of necessary but knowing that doesn't make it any less annoying when you have to traverse a ton of hazards, get sucker punched and have to repeat that section again. Each time you die you are thrown back into a previous checkpoint instead of simply respawning. It does lengthen the game and it does feel like an arcade game for better or worse.\n\nGraphics are nice and have a decent amount of detail to them. The explosions and debris flying around after you shoot down enemies look great as well.  It runs at 60fps which is another point in it's favor. Even the music is pretty catchy. Outside of the main mode you have a “practice” mode where you can choose any level to play but you don't have any continues which makes it harder than playing through the actual game. Do not press the escape key or you will shut down the game. The key to pause the game is “Q” for some reason. This game does feature cool looking giant bosses but most get absolutely devastated when you use your special move making them kind of a pushover.\n\nSatazius is by no means a bad game. It's just that if you are expecting some fun shooting there is very little of that here. You will just be holding down the fire button and trying to navigate the environments which pose a far greater threat to you. And having to control your ship with the analog stick or keyboard makes it far more difficult than it should be. It is difficult and unfair but it is still fun to mix and match your weapons to blast through levels. Overall this is a solid title if you are in to arcade like shoot em ups and is recommended to those that can deal without a dpad.","June 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Kinda sounds like Gradius, I'll give it a whirl".... And my god, if sounding like Gradius is one thing, looking and playing like Gradius is another.\n\nSatazius is an exceptional game that has CAPCOM's seal of approval, and it's one of the better inde shooters I've played. Basically take Gradius, and take away all of it's medication, force feed it a diet of protein shakes and suffering, then you'll have something that doesn't even come close to Satazius, this game is hard as hell!!! The beautiful thing about Satazius is that the similarities are all there, but it's not a shameless rip-off. For a starts it's way harder, and it's a lot prettier.\n\nI find it difficult to write about shooters like this, well because they're pretty much the same. But the moral of the story here is "Why fix what is not ultimately broken." If CAPCOM put its stamp on it, then it's got to be good right? That's Satazius, an old school side scrolling space shooter, that get's everything right, no complaints from me. Take it from someone who plays these games non-stop.\n\n... And seriously...

While the graphics and music might be a little cheesy or off-putting, the weapons, stages, and bosses will literally blow you away, and you'll love every second of it. I've started a new run maybe thirty times and only recently beat it, so expect plenty of deaths and game overs, but pushing yourself a little harder to reach the next insane boss or stage is totally worth it.\n\nThe weapons are pretty standard, but the power-up system is just different enough to catch you off guard when you finally bite it and lose a few points and your weapons power down. Thankfully, while the game is pretty hardcore and the bosses are totally nuts, there are several checkpoints and mid-points during stages and boss fights that give you a few upgrades so you're not totally ruined when you twitched into a ceiling or missile just seconds from a victory.","December 16, 2015","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The stages themselves are nice, but will challenge you as you progress, and it doesn't get easy on the higher difficulties. Graphica are good, and the music is good, especially the boss theme.\n\nThis game has some of the Gradius features in them.

Easy mode would be perfect for younger kids, normal mode is a good introduction to the game for the average player, and the higher unlockable difficulties are where the real challenge starts. If you are a pro of this genre, it might be a little annoying to play through normal mode before you get to the hard stuff, but don't worry, it's a fairly quick playthrough, and it's certainly entertaining in the mean time.\n\nThere is a nice variety of weapons, allowing you to choose whether you want hyper-focused high-damage attacks, spread-attacks, or even homing shots. Weapon powerups are nicely spread throughout the level, and they can be hidden slightly off-screen, requiring you to explore a bit once the levels open up.\n\nThe graphics are old-school and fantastically-done, and the music fits the game like a glove.\n\nIf you like the sidescrolling shooter genre (Raptor, Stargunner, Gradius, Radirgy, ThunderForce, etc), then you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.","February 20, 2013","true","2.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It features  a very simalar aesthetic and shares some of the retro design philosophies (I.E being in the right place at the right time) that made the earlier games irritating, but it's nowhere near as unforgiving. You choose your weapons as you would in Gradius, a primary, two switchable sub-weapons and powerful charge weapon.\n\nYour weapons are pretty much ripped straight from other STGs. Gradius, mainly, but you even have the Hunter from Thunder Force.\n\nThe powerups work differently. Intead of collecting cores from enemies to highlight a bar you collect them from stationary boxes and each core has a letter on it. S for sheild, and a P for power which powers up either you main, your equipped Sub, or your charge.\n\nBosses are also exteremely easy. You won't need to aim for the core and a few of them will even go down with a single hit from your charge weapon.\n","December 27, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Graphic is way behind, but the gameplay makes up for it. Featuring the same element, both, bullet hell, and makes shumps real fun. Also the OST is kind of lackluster in my opinion - Ether Vapor's much much better with its ambivalent sound and gives the real feeling of Japanese game (which I prefer for this genre).\n\nYou select main and sub weapons before the stage starts, during the progress you'll find up powerups and upgrades for the weapons. The more you collect, the better. The ship you control is one hit dead if you touch any obstacle or enemies' bullets, although you can find rather common shield kit to give you one chance to survive.\n\nBoss battles are real hell especially in latter stages. You might find yourself dying alot - and using continues alot - during the process. We have plenty of continues (9) but don't get satisfied as the deeper you go, the harder the game is.\n\nController support is quite good and that's what I expect to have here. Both Dinput and Xinput are supported so there's no need to worry. And yes, game is better with gamepad than keyboard.\n\nOverall I'm quite satisfied with the game.

It's loads of fun and definitely anger inducing, like GEEZ...  I wouldn't suggest being around mixed company when playing this as it will cause you to fill the room with that foul language.  It's a mix of the old gradius vibe with some of that mindbreaking "bullet hell" that everyone loves.\n\nThat aside, the graphics are really good. Think a step above SNES, with sprites that stand out and sound effects that keep your attention.  I don't really enjoy the soundtrack too much, but the option to turn it down is available.  My only major major gripe is the inability to actually pause the game with the start button on my Xbox 360 USB controller. It requires me to press Q instead and while it might not be a huge deal for some, a shooter like this is kind of hard enough to survive without having to reach over to press Q when I could easily press the START button.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game that comes cheap (and even cheaper with a steam sale) and for 4 insanely hard levels, it's not bad at all.

You get 10 continues for the whole game session. If you don't beat the game without using them all, then you go back to square one.\n\nLike I said, it's an okay shoot 'em up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueskies/recommended/203990/","blueskies","Kolba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blueskies/","160 products in account","I would recommend Satazius to both fans of the genre and curious newcomers.\n\nSatazius borrows some of the best elements of older games like Gradius and other horizontal shoot-em-ups, and is more forgiving than the arcade of games of yore.\n\nLet's take the weapon system. In Gradius the player could choose their ship build at the start of a credit, while in Satazius the player also gets that opportunity at the start of each level, allowing them to select the best tool for the job at the right moment. Weapons are powered up in a similar way to Gradius, though here each weapon remains powered up as you switch between them. This gives the player the option of focusing on just a select few favourites, or else improving a wider range of weapons at a slower rate. Spreading the love, as it were. Upon death, the player is not stripped of all power; instead their weapons are just downgraded a few notches. This means death is not a double punishment, and failing once does not mean you're twice as likely to fail on the next try.\n\nThe levels are full of exciting set pieces, high speed chases and environmental hazards. Indeed, the environment is as much your enemy here as the enemies themselves, reminding me fondly of another classic horizontal shmup, Thunderforce III.\n\nWhich is a good point to turn to Satazius' few bad points. In those high speed sections the player simply cannot survive if their ship is not a fast one, whereas in tight quarters a nimble ship is easy to crash. The player should be able to switch at will, a la Thunderforce III, rather than having indirect control through power-ups.\n\nAnd secondly, the music doesn't match the catchy melodies of the above mentioned games, or so many other old-school shmups. That would have just been the cherry on top of the cake.","August 23, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donnychong07/recommended/203990/","donnychong07","Anyplayer01","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donnychong07/","61 products in account","One of the shoot 'em up games in Steam I would consider a classic challenge because you die from one hit and its pacing, and not as hard as bullet hell even if you play the hardest difficulty among the four available difficulty setting. Naturally, any shooter can become a bullet hell depending on your situation such as having too many enemies on the screen at once.\n\nThose who have played Gradius, Thunder Force and Axelay would definitely find the little resemblance here though the elements of Gradius and Axelay would stand out the most here. There is no wordy text to explain the story, no worry about catching up the story by reading while you are busy blasting stuff, creating beautiful fireworks. The story is pretty much explained through visual presentation, a normal thing I see in some of the old hits.\n\nGameplay-wise, it is pretty easy to pick up this game. Your choice of weapons(including a superweapon) may be limited but you decide what you want before the stage to fit your style of play though there are times that I feel that certain weapons are just not suitable to certain stages which you will learn the hard way. Most of the enemies definitely resemble Gradius here but you will still feel like you are playing a different type of game due to the overall game design. There are definitely end stage bosses, each of different capability and design in its mission to destroy you. Unlike Gradius, the final boss is no sitting duck. Certain bosses are available for fighting only at higher difficulty, a full experience I enjoy as a skilled gamer and for immersion. Tried expert on Gunstar Heroes yet? Anyway, checkpoints, 1-ups based on scoring, continues, replay and two different endings are other features in this game.\n\nFor its price, it is worth my time and money for the fun that I could hardly get of this genre for PC.\n\nP. S. Complete the game without using continue for a better reward. Not so much but not bitter at least.","January 28, 2015","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So it has a level design unlike most shmups these days. The weapon system where you have a your primary weapon and two secondary weapons. The secondary weapons you can switch during the game. You shoot both the primary and the secondary weapon at the same time. So you got quite some fire power. But the game is designed around it. You also got a special weapon that you need to charge. And you can collect upgrades for your weapons. The controls are good and there is controller support. The artstyle looks good although it's a bit generic. One thing I didn't like is that the game has a very low resolution. But you can play it full screen or windowed. The music also doesn't do it for me. But if you are looking for a shmup Satazius is a great pick.","January 10, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is basically a well-done port and shamelessly recycles many ideas, but it also boasts a lot of cool new ideas of its own, while improving on a few things.\n\nIt's not perfect - The ending can be accidentally skipped by hitting the shoot button, so it was on the whole a bit anti-climactic.\n\nAt times it also has issues with conveyance, such as at times it not being clear what you can fly through and what will hurt you, not really making it obvious when weapons downgrade, and very often hitting you with unfair gigantic lasers and capsule toys crashing down on you, only for you to realize you had to be watching for a subtle warning glow, or memorize a boss's attack patterns.  There are tons of "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!" moments, but in a way, that's part of the fun.\n\nIf I can say just one thing to convince you that you need to play this game, it's the music!  OH GOD the music!  It's like a cross between Goa Trance and Cyberpunk and while fairly simple and loop based, it's very well done and a welcome modern spin (as opposed to the dreck that was the soundtrack of Gradius IV - Jazz Fusion?  what were they thinking???)\n\nVery fun and full of heart pumping action and surprises.

I like how the game lets you choose your weapons that you power up as you are playing. Be careful with your favorite though, if that's all you us it will get maxxed out quick and your other weapons will be stuck at the basic power levels and you are not getting through this game with just one gun. The graphics are great even though they are stuck in the 16 bit era and the music and sound won't distract from the game. Satazius game wise is put together perfectly so there are not bugs or flaws to take away from playing. I rarely play this game but I can't stand the idea of taking it off my system.
