"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zapsie/recommended/201510/","zapsie","Jay Gilstrap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zapsie/","49 products in account","Awful in every sense of the word, ESPECIALLY when you compare it to its predecessors.\n\nBut, before I begin, there's something you must know - The first two FlatOut games were made by Bugbear Entertainment, and they were phenominal racing games, especially FlatOut 2. This game? Totally different company that completely misunderstood everything Bugbear had done right.\n\nFirst things first, the AI is pitiful. I know the name of the game is destruction, literally, but it's a RACING game, and I'd rather have people using force to win the race than veering off the track in the first lap to wrestle in the grass like kittens.\n\nOn this note, *everyone* targets you. I went into one demolition derby round, and it was hilariously stupid the way it worked. As soon as the countdown hit zero, the twenty-or-so other non-player racers veered to the opposite side like the Persian army and all ganged up on me at once, with the exception of, what, like, two motorists smashing each other's bumpers in. I mean, I played FlatOut 2's derby mode religiously, and it sometimes feels like the AI prioritizes you over their brethren, but even in it worst state it was nothing compared to this insanity.\n\nNow, it's time to compare it to its predecessors - Yes, Flatout 3 was made by a different company than the first two, but being a sequel by its title, I have to rate it in comparison to its past successes in the franchise.\n\nThe other NPC's -- The way this development team tried to recreate Bugbear's non-player character gimmick is awful. If you haven't played FlatOut 2, lemme give you the jist of things - There were seven NPC's that were the only opponents in the game. They all had distinct driving styles, color schemes, and skills in different racing areas. They were so memorable thanks to this that you had those names ingrained into your brain after your first couple of races and figured out very quickly whose names to curse every time you launched out of your windshield.\n\nWell, 3 messes this all up. There are something near 15 characters, and some of them are so similar that you have no hope of remembering them. The character models are all very idealized, if you catch my drift, and there's one fully anonymous man wearing a motorcross helmet with practically full-balanced stats that you'll choose every time if you're sane. That's another thing, too - Unlike the original, where you were your own identity, you have to choose one of these punks.\n\nAnyway, 2.5/10, because it technically functions, I guess. Go buy Next Car Game instead, it's made by the same company that made the other FlatOut games. Speaking of which, go buy the other FlatOut games, too, they're super cheap and also on Steam. It's a shame those two don't have online multiplayer anymore, because if they did, I'd force you to buy them at gunpoint.","June 11, 2014","false","0.7"," 87 of 91 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","87","91","2","0"

If you want nice destruction derby game, get FlatOut2: Ultimate Carnage, soo much better than this crap. Or get Bugbear's new game called Next Car Game, thats a great destruction derby game (but still in making).\n\nThe real problem with this game is, that it isn't made by Bugbear but by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company.\nGraphics seems (at least to me) like downgrade from FlatOut2.\nIt have horrible original "music" and not licensed music from rock bands like the other flatouts.\nFrom what else i saw in that half hour i wasted on it was horrible maps like simple square with some houses around and thats it, thats your city race track. No destructible props at all.\nThe "throw your driver out of car" minigames are worthless, so much better in FlatOut2.\n\nMy verdict? It's 1/10. One point for cool name that can charm fans like me who played and loved previous FlatOut games.\nSeriously, don't buy this crap, hell, don't even pirate it, it's just waste of time.\n\nP.S.

So, since I bought the FO1/FO2/FOUC/FO3 package, why not play Flatout 3 although I've heard some pretty nasty stuff about it. Note: one of my Steam friends told me to keep my memory of Flatout as it was: when I did install, he uttered "don't play FO3, uninstall and never look back"\n\nNaturally, I rejected his advice, because I wanted to form an opinion that I made myself. How I wished I had listened. The game has graphics worse than Flatout 1, driveability worse than Flatout 1, a damage model worse than Sony's F1 2005-2009 (and that was horrible) and looks like a game made in....1998 at best. No, even the Half Life 1 graphics were better. 1996, 1997? For the Dutch in my list, it looks like A2 Racer. The first one.\n\nJust one race, but enough to scrape the pieces of my Flatout memory to what it was after Ultimate Carnage.

Honestly, I think I might have been better off paying more to buy the rest of the pack separately without this one.\n\nAvoid this game and here is why:\nThe graphics are at best mediocre.  However, despite this expect to find the game stuttering and struggling to keep up (especially when turning corners).  This quickly becomes more than a minor annoyance when you find yourself losing control because the game has stuttered on a corner.  Textures applied to the walls around the track (such as graffiti on the concrete) will flicker.  (Keep in mind this is on a PC with an i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a GeForce GTX 670).\n\nThe car handling is distinctly fishy.  Half the cars will stick to the road like glue.  The other half will be sliding all over the place.  There is nothing in between.\n\nThe AI is even fishier.  When they go around corners expect to see carnage as they drive straight in to walls.  To make up for this the AI will quickly catch you on the straights – passing your car with no problems even when you’re burning nitro.\n\nThe damage modelling on the cars is all or nothing.  Where Flatout Ultimate Carnage slowly added damage to the cars depending on the impacts in this game your car is either brand new or has been completely crumpled.  There is no damage in between these two options.  As soon as your car scrapes against anything expect to see the whole car appear as if it has been squashed by an 18 Wheeler.","February 17, 2014","false","0.2"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","34","40","2","0"

I didn't expect much, but there was a sale, and I picked the game up for $1.90. The instant I got into a race I knew that the game would be good. There was mayhem, car bits smashing everywhere, tires all over the road, explosions after colliding with barrels. The game was fun, and to this day the original Flatout is one of my favorite racing games.\n\nSo when I heard that there was going to be a Flatout 3 (Sequel to Flatout 2, which was also a great game,) I was excited. I waited the week until it came out, (I should've known something was up, they only announced the game a week before it was released!) and promptly bought the game off of Steam. Once it had finished downloading, I started the game up to see if it was a worthy successor to the game that I had loved.\n\nThe first thing I did was check out the graphics options. I have a fairly fast computer, so I maxed everything out. I headed into a race. There were several classes of cars to choose from, and one of the classes was Classic. The car looked decent, so I chose it. After a loading screen with an unmoving bar, I was in. From the start, I was shocked. I won't tell you the specifics of this race, I'll just break it down by category:\n\nPhysics\nOne of the best things about the previous Flatout games was the tight sense of physics. It wasn't quite a simulation, but it was realistic enough that you had to be careful not accidentally hit something solid and crash. It also had excellent car damage, and the cars dented and crunched realistically. With Flatout 3, all of this was thrown out of the window.\n\nCars in Flatout 3 handle like they do in those racing games at the arcade. When you're driving them, you don't really have a sense of control like you do in a real car. They feel way too fast, and also very light. They are also very difficult to control. The cars in Flatout 3 have all of these traits. They just don't have the tight sense of control that previous games had. Instead, they feel like someone modded the game files to make things more hectic. Honestly, it just feels bad.\n\nGamemodes\nIf there was one thing that I thought Flatout 3 had going for it, it was it’s gamemodes. It has a varied lineup that looks like it could be fun to play, but still manages to fail. The modes are: Race, Stunt Man, Big Battle, Battle Arena, Monster Trucks, Speed, Nightshift, Offroad, and Challenge.\n\nRace is the obvious one. Race around a track, and the first to complete the predetermined number of laps wins. Nightshift is actually identical to race, the only difference being that all of the courses are at night. Race mode lacks depth, but this can be forgiven seeing as there’s only so much you can do with a lap race. Even so, the mode really isn’t very good. I wouldn’t say it’s bad as it is, it’s just kinda boring.\n\nStunt Man is the classic minigame mode from the previous games. In it, you launch your driver through the windshield to accomplish various tasks. An example would be the high jump. You would drive down a long track until you reached a high net. You would hold down the nitro button to adjust the angle, then release to see how high your driver would be launched. It sounds horribly sadistic, but it really was quite fun in the previous Flatout games.\n\nNot so in Flatout 3.\n\nThe reason for this is simple, and this is essentially the reason the game is so bad: The physics engine quite simply fails. You just can't launch your driver like you could in the previous games. It feels cheap, kinda like a bad iPhone game. The physics just don’t perform like they should in the situation. It ruins it.\n\nThe next two modes are Big Battle and Battle Arena. In these modes, 8-24 cars are thrown into an arena. A car wins by destroying all other cars in the arena. This is essentially the Derby mode from the older games. This mode sounds fun when I describe it (and it was in the last two games), but it’s terrible in Flatout 3. The reason for this is (once again) the incredibly poor physics engine. Cars fly around as if they were made of paper. A car trading paint with you does 50% damage to you, whereas a T-bone collision only does 20%. And don’t even get me started on the explosions. Unfortunately, this gamemode feels like a cheap knockoff of the established mode from the other games.\n\nMonster Trucks is unique, and it is the highlight of the game. In this mode, your only cars are (guess what) monster trucks. You can then choose from five gamemodes. The first is Search and Destroy, which is a timed dash to destroy 40 barrels on the map. The second is Bring the Light, in which the goal is to bring 5 objects into a container. The next mode is Catch the Bus. In this mode, you have to knock over 5 double decker busses as fast as possible. The fourth is Royal Flush, where players roll a mine into the sewer. The final mode is Dude, Where’s My Car, which is similar to Search and destroy, only with car wrecks instead of barrels. These modes aren’t terrible to play like the other modes, and can actually be enjoyed. Unfortunately, this enjoyment is short lived, and it soon falls to the mundaneness of the rest of the game.\n\nSpeed attempts to play like a F1 racer. All of the cars are Formula 1 cars, and the tracks are similarly themed. However, this simply doesn’t work. The combination between Flatout 3 and F1 2012 is a match made in hell, and the mode fails horribly.\n\nOffroad is kinda interesting: The goal is to get from Point A to Point B in as fast as possible. Playing the game reminds me of an old game called Fuel that I once had. The premise is interesting, but there’s so much junk everywhere on the track that its a nightmare to drive, especially with the physics engine that stubbornly refuses to go away.\n\nThe final mode is challenge. This basically sets up specific scenarios in the previous gamemodes with goals you have to complete. This could be something like a time trial, or a race where your goal is to deal a certain amount of damage or wreck x number of cars. It fails to impress, just like everything else in this game.\n\nGraphics\nSometimes graphics can warrant the purchase of a game. You may buy a game just to show off your computer, and that’s alright every once in awhile. This isn’t one of those games. The graphics are flatout terrible! (See what I did there!) The game just doesn’t look good. The cars always seem kind of squashed when you look at them, and they're low enough poly to be in a GameCube game. In fact, the entire game looks like a GameCube game. Here’s some examples to prove my point:\n\n\nIf the GameCube one were higher resolution, it would beat out Flatout 3 easily.\n\nSound\nEr, no. Just no. This game has terrible sound. The main theme gets old and repetitive. Cars sound like RC cars. Collisions have no force in them. And just about everything else sound really bad. It doesn’t help that this game has no soundtrack, which means you’re stuck listening to crappy music that someone wrote in a day. Words can’t describe just how bad it sounds. It really is pathetic.\n\nConclusion\nIf you haven’t figured out by now, this game is terrible. Unfortunately for the studio that made this, the reason I feel it was so terrible was because of the Flatout label. Everyone who had played the original expected it to be the same. It just wasn’t. This game might have been decent it it wasn’t called Flatout 3, but because it was, it is terrible. There really wasn’t anything going for this game, and I’m truly sad to see how a previously excellent franchise fell flat.\n\nGraphics: 0/10\nHorribly dated graphics manage to look worse that Flatout 2.\n\nSound 0/10\nJust no. Almost like they realized they needed sound a day before it was released.\n\nControls: 3/10\nRacing games should not be played on the keyboard. When a controller was used, cars randomly careened out of control.\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nVery little enjoyment in the game.\n","November 26, 2013","false","2.6"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/recommended/201510/","actherian","Therian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/actherian/","483 products in account","Racing with a Broken Axle\nThis is one of the games on steam where a neutral option would prove useful.\nIn its current state, I simply can't recommend this game, certainly not at $30. Maybe if you pick it up in a bundle for $3 or less, or a price tag of $5~10, but no more than this.\n\nI actually enjoyed the game, having played to completion the two Battle Arenas, but it fell short on Racing and Monster Trucks due to one fundamental problem - the handling of the various vehicles was just horrible at speed. It's recommended in the first race tips to master the handbreak, though this seemingly does very little on its own. Used in conjuction with the boost (or being slammed from behind), I was able to take corners, and finished the first race on fifth or sixth position, but the problem with that was the even further loss of control, often resulting in slamming into someones living room, least for the first race.\n\nThen there's the damage control system to contend with. I completely fail to understand how slamming into another vehicle at 160 kph head-on can deal only 1~3% of damage, while a slight "scratch" at half that speed can deal 5~15%+. I won, and lost, many a times for this during the Battle Arenas, even if did still technically win on points alone; which "feel" like for NPC's points are stopped been counted as soon as the player loses, instead of artifically continuing until the last one standing was revealed.\n\nGraphics wise, can't complain too much. There's a wide selection of vehicles, colours, and even characters behind the wheels, seldom "repeated" by the NPCs, if at all. So there's plenty of variance on the track. Though at no point did I actually see for example a wheel flying off, or a character being thrown out of the car when the car itself dies off, which can apparently be done in one of the other game modes where you land them in a target following a crash. A game from 1995, Destruction Derby 2, was based much the same as Flatout 3, and even for its time, if you took too much damage various parts of the vehicle would go flying; the wheels included, which then (was supposed too, but aided sometimes.) negatively affected your vehicle control, or you had the hood bouncing around obstructing your view until more damage knocked it flying off. These are relatively small things, but they matter to the overall experience.\n\nLong Story Short\nPro's\nWide Selection of Graphical Characters, Vehicles and Scenes\nMultiple game modes ranging from Racing to complete Destruction\n'The Stig' reference with the unknown character\nUnlockable Characters & Vehicles\nAchievements\nCon's\nVery poor vehicle handling, in certain instances a 1 star vehicle was easier to control than a 5 star.\nPoor damage control system. 'Scratching' doing considerbly more damage than head-on collisions.\nDamage control system based as a whole, rather than individual parts of the vehicle.\nVehicle clipping. Occasionally at speed you'd drive straight through another vehicle, rather than hitting them\n(Maybe just me?) No, or little, ability to recharge your boost gauge. Tips say it recharges during jumps or causing damage, but it seems much more random than this.\nDamage having little to no affect on vehicle control. No losing of wheels until completely destroyed.\nLack of varied sound effects; e.g horns, announcer discussions, crash sounds.\nRandom unexplained "flatout3.exe has stopped working..." errors, or in some cases, inability to load the game at all according to some users.\nNo Trading Cards ;)\nSo once again, I cannot recommend this game in its current state, at the current price.\nIf you can buy it in a bundle, then by all means. Otherwise, wait for a 80~95% sale, by which point it may be worth a couple of hours of entertainment, but overall, if the developers ever come back to this game, it does have its potential if cared for properly.","April 8","false","2.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

Except it's not wonderful. In fact, throw it in the trash and think about what you just did.\n\nThis game is the downfall of the FlatOut franchise. Not only because it was made by a game dev studio that usually does Wii games. No, this game also lacks of pretty much everything that made FlatOut fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cenapturan/recommended/201510/","cenapturan","Hethradiah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cenapturan/","345 products in account","Let me give you the TL;DR right now. Worst game ever.\n\nI played a single race (yes I made it that far, so I earned the right to judge the game). I immediately remembered a really funny parody of the FPS games of that era. Duty Calls. Now for those who aren't familiar with this name, let me describe it briefly. Duty Calls is a parody of many FPS games, based on Call of Duty franchise. It was made as an advertisement for Bulletstorm, whose trailer played at the end of this mocking game, with the message being "nowadays FPS are like the one you just played, here is what it is supposed to be like (Bulletstorm trailer begins)". Flatout 3 felt exactly like that. "Here is a crappy racing game to depict everything wrong with racing games today, and now, real Flatout 3 begins where you get to have super fun just like you had in the previous games, even ultimate carnage, which was basically flatout 2 re-sold to you suckers, but turned out to be pretty good anyway". Disappointment begins... It was no joke, no "real" Flatout 3 started. Flatout 3 really is the horrible.... ummm..... I can't really say that it's a game.... It's...... a software...... where you control...... no not control........ more like........ watch a car that was based on the drawings of a drunk newborn...... cruise in a city designed by a band of autistic apes...... and think that you contribute to its behaviour by pressing certain buttons on the controller.\n\nOk jokes aside. Graphics are extremely unfinished. Simple and undetailed, but not intentionally, just due to lack of skill and/or effort. Just look at the screenshots. At the first glance they look pretty decent. Now look closer. Inspect details. Don't tell me it's a 2011 game. Compare it to DiRT or just Flatout UC. You will see it has horrible graphics.\n\nControls just don't matter. You don't feel in control of the vehicle, not even a little bit. The car just goes vroom vroom. No realism, no control, no fun. For those who will bash me for looking for realism, just go play the previous games. You will see what I mean. Junker cars used to slide, drift, bump, etc. Now they just perfectly hover over the asphalt. When you try to turn, it either doesn't turn enough (if you're too fast), or turns successfully (if you're slow enough). It doesn't drift, slide unless you pull the handbrake. But if you use nitro when your car is aligned with the road, it just immediately and magically stops sliding and continues it's hovering over the road. Here is a short list of games that offer a better and more realistic driving experience: Asphalt 8 (iOS and Android), The Need for Speed (1994), FIFA '96. Also, I'm using a Logitech F710. When I set the controls to the gamepad, it stops working. If I set them to keyboard I can use my gamepad with xinput mode. ♥♥♥♥ logic!\n\nSounds. There are 4 sounds in total. One of them is the menu sound "click". Three in game sounds are "vroom", "bfffttt", and "dufff". Now "vroom" is the engine sound made by the cars engines. The sound was produced by a pair of bored game devs, that just made the sound with their mouth. I can almost hear one of them saying "screw the consumers, they will buy our games anyway", in the middle of the sound recording session, faintly hidden behind the sound of the engine. "bfffttt" is the sound nitrous makes, and the artistic creation of this amazing sound was most likely based on an air refresher spray. "dufff" is the collision sound used in every single collision to every single combination of objects. Again, it was probably made by devs dropping a heavy pillow from a distance.\n\nMusic. Literally non-existent.\n\nCar tuning. Do you remember the simple, yet fun car modification system Flatout used to offer? It's gone. Here is the new system. "Would you like to tune the car?" [Yes/No]. If you choose yes, then the car is "tuned" by standards seen fit by the devs. I swear to god, I am laughing at the stupidity of this, as I'm writing, while crying on the inside because it isn't even slightly exaggerated. Ladies and gentlemen, a new era of modification begins where cars are either "tuned" or "aren't".\n\nPlease just watch a single gameplay footage from any source. Even the official game trailers give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is. Don't take any of my word for it. Just look it up on youtube yourself. Watch some videos and see for yourself that every single sentence you read here, is describing that video.\n\nI bought the Complete pack for 10$. I am not sorry because I love Flatout games. I played them on PS2 for long hours. I am glad to have 1, 2 and UC in my steam library for just 10$. But if you want a Flatout game, just buy UC. 2 was better than 1, even though 1 was a pretty solid game itself. And UC is just a graphically and realistically superior game, that is essentially Flatout 2 with additional content.","July 22, 2014","false","0.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

It shares none of the good qualities the previous games had. The first sign I knew that this wouldn't be a quality title was the developer: Team6. If you know anything about the FlatOut series of games, you'd know that all of them were developed by BugBear Interactive. Still, I was stupid and went ahead with the purchase (only $7.49, but still, I could have bought a better game). Expecting something at least halfway decent, I got a buggy, crashing, and barely playable pile of mess dumped upon me. The physics are arguably the absolute worst thing about this game. Cars don't handle like cars, they handle like ice cubes lubed up in a messy bowl of KY His and Her jelly and butter. The graphics are just awful and look worse than the first FlatOut game, which, for reference, was released in 2004, a wopping 7 years before this pile of fail. I guess the only nice things I can say about it are the car designs themselves, the amount of them, and the amount of  game modes included in the game. Other than that, avoid this like the plague. If I could get my money back, I would.\nRating: 1/10.\nBuy the other FlatOut games and BugBear's Next Car Game instead.","February 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Flatout 1 is worlds better than this. Do yourself a favor and get the previous titles to this series. For starters, the gameplay is absolutely broken with garbage physics,\nnonexistant handiling, and incredibly bad AI there is no reason to try to play this game. The visuals are\nlate PS1 early PS2 quality, with way too much motion blur and bloom that can cause siezures there\nshould be a warning to those that have epilepsy; the courses themselves are unimaginative and\npoorly put together. The cars look and feel like rejects from a Hot Wheels game along with some that\nwere foisted from the previous FlatOut titles to give some impression that this is a sequel.\n\nThere is no structure to the gameplay mechanics, for starters the damage calculations are randomly\ngenerated so hitting an opponent can result in either doing little to no damage to you or taking most of\nyour health away. There are no boundries on the tracks so you pretty much can drive where you want\nwith no penalties. There is no way to regain boost except crossing checkpoints; hitting cars or objects does nothing here. If they want you to use boost to "heal" your car then they should have more ways to obtain it.\n\nThe tracks seem to be made to fully expliot the nonexistant handling and for most of time you are riding the handbrake to get around the corners. There are tuning options for your car but they make no difference here.\n\nThe AI is the worst seen in any racing game; from the start they just smash into each other and into objects for no reason. In derby mode they all pile up on you and in no time your car is running on a sliver of health while your oppenents have most of theirs.\n\nThe game modes themselves are poor attempts at variety, speed mode is depressingly easy to win on account of the absymal AI. Offroad is the only mode that elevates this game to very bland. Nightshift is almost impossible to win because of the deplorable handling. Stunt is probably the worst\nhere in that the requirements to win are so arbitrarily steep and each stunt course can only be figured out through trial and error( there is no tutorials here like in the previous titles) as well as being poorly put together that when you do win it you have no incentive to do it again. Challenge mode is just an excuse from the developers to extend gameplay. Even monster truck mode had any fun removed by the lousy handling, bad physics, and damage calculations.\n\nThere is nothing to say about mulitplayer because that is simply broken.\n\nThis game is nothing more than a cynical cash grab from Strategy First to profit from the FlatOut name along with the technical incompentence of Team6 games in developing this sorry excuse for a game it can be safe to say that the FlatOut we know and love is now too badly damaged that there is little hope that it can be brought back.","December 14, 2011","false","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I heard from alot of sources that Flatout 3 is like the unwanted child of the series. But I couldn't believe it..I looked at so many reviews and tbh I thought that the gameplay doesn't even look that bad. So I tried it just now..I never ever regretted playing a game that much.\n\nThis series was once known for it's incredible driving physics and its fun races including a partly destructable circuit..well forget about that in Flatout 3: Normally you would slow down when you aren't driving on the track but offroad..well here the speed is always the same and therefore nobody drives on the track. The car flips after every single ♥♥♥♥ and the environment is non destructable. If you ram a stone then you have to respawn. Also respawning makes you stand still for a few seconds which is a huge disadvantage. There is no career mode and you have all the cars from the very beginning which sucks. There are a lot of modes, but they are either other car models or the challenge mode, where you have to complete 50 random challenges. Also the 'Stuntman' Mode is back, but because of the poor physics it is no fun.\nThe handling is so bad that it doesn't matter if you take a car with good handling and bad speed or bad handling and good speed, because the handling is exactly the same..utter bull****.\nThe Graphics are slightly better than Flatout 2 but because of the overused motion blur it looks stupid. And the best feature: If you finish below 1st in any race you automatically lose and have to start over the same ♥♥♥♥ again..\n\nDON'T BUY THIS JOKE OF A GAME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!","April 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What I wanted from this game was something like Flatout 2, with that fun, cartoony art style and derby/racing game. First off, this game has aggonizingly slow load times and I run this game on a fairly modern computer! The soundtrack is so dark and mysterious which doesn't help with that fun part either. I also dislike how if you looked at Flatout 2 and Flatout 3, you would not see anything that represents each other. Set aside the bad stuff, I do like how this game looks, it looks absolutely goregous and I have to say I wasn't expecting Flatout 3 to be looking this good. I also like how you can finally choose your character which was something that was highly requested throughout the Flatout franchise. I also like how there is a whole new selection of cars to choose from. I don't like how there is no car from any of the previous Flatout games in Flatout 3. The number one thing that really bugs me the most, is the physics of this game, they are NOTHING like any other Flatout games, same with the camera angles. I won't get too much into detail with that because I have so much to rant on about with the camera angles and physics. I will probably play this game again being me who doesn't want to accept the fact that one of his most beloved franchises is now ruined by one simple game.

The stunt modes were fun, but not a part I find necessary in this game. It was the arcade style of driving, not too difficult for anyone. It was the focus on damage, so you could earn money for new cars even by driving the wrong way! The upgrading system is a bit RPG-ish and keeps you going for more. I have bought all Flatout games since then. Flatout 2? Better. Flatout, Ultimate Carnage? Better again. I still play it every now and then, it's still parked on my HD. Just because it's fun without restrictions.\n\nSo, everyone considering buying Flatout 3: DON'T DO IT!!\nGo for the old one's instead, preferably Ultimate Carnage. Flatout 3 is everything the earlier games aren't. It's from a different developer and they managed to mess up everything that gave Flatout it's distinct quality. Racing arcade style is no fun anymore, there is hardly a damage model. It's a\nWASTE OF MONEY!\n\nKeep an eye on Bugbear, they still exist. I do not pray, but for a good follow-up of the old Flatout games? I am on my knees..","January 13, 2012","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Using a keyboard for controls is an absolute nightmare, but then again (IMO) using a keyboard for any racer is a bad idea. Use an Xbox360 controller or you'll have zero chance. I only played a little bit of it, but the little bit I did was fun. At least to me. I don't play many racers and really only truly enjoyed Forza 3 on 360, but this was good to me.

Scroll to the bottom for my FIX for this.\ncar deformation is worse than in other FlatOuts\ncontrols can only be changed/checked via settings, off the main menu\n-just like the other FlatOuts, but is still a bad design choice.\nOffroad mode only has 4 levels\n-the most-fun mode IMO. technically 2, since 2 of them are the same map, just reversed.\ndisconnects: I have experienced disconnect from the server about 20% of the time & it usually happens as the server is loading up the next map & trying to transfer me over. (fyi, I live on east coast USA & usually my friend in Germany is the host, so THAT may have a big part in why I disconnect sometimes; I'm not sure)[/olist]\n\n\nTL;DR=\nBigger derby levels versus MORE opponents,\nmore cars, less customization, less optimized,\nbut still a fun game if you just want to have fun and can look past the flaws.\n\n\nNOTE: I would recommend this ONLY if you spent about $2 or less for this game (as I paid $7.99 for the bundle); but the $30 base retail price is a rip-off.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nTechnical issues\nThis game was inconsistent for me.\nSometimes the load times were long, running off a HDD.\nPerformance was terrible on SOME levels -if running off a Hard Disk Drive; I was getting as low as 6 fps on the 1st SplatOut map.\n\nBut...when I ran it off a SSD, somehow it magically worked much much better for me & I suddenly got an average frame-rate well over 100 on Ultra. (I had my resolution down at 1180x800, fyi.)\n\n-----------\nupdate: changed 'bad handling' to 'handling feels off, is worse than it should be on most vehicles'\nupdate2: added 1 more pro (AI in mp matches) & 1 more con (disconnecting)","January 15, 2015","true","12.8"," 13 of 51 people (25%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","25","13","51","5","9"

But it`s not bad! There came a few patches and its a really good arcade racer now. It has many cars and maps to drive and unlock and there are many modes like stuntman, races, party modes like monstertruck and a zombie mode.\n\nTechnically it works fine for me on very high settings (GTX 660). It has not as good graphics as Flatout Ultimate Carnage but its ok. It did crash sometimes for me but that stopped in the last time.\n\nThe AI seems to be stupid but that really hurts mostly in Destruction Derbys. In Destruction Derbys all AI drivers `hunt` the player. That`s annoying.\n\nSo the massive 24 player destruction derbys are good for multiplayer but there`s no one online.\n\nIn total Flatout 3 is a good arcade racer that doesn`t need good skills so it`s perfect for playing once or twice a week. 30 $ is too much for this game so get it on a sale.","February 9, 2015","true","24.4"," 9 of 42 people (21%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","21","9","42","4","0"

I have never been so wrong in my entire life and yet they got the name right: "chaos&destructrion" which fits perfectly to my hopes and dreams about this game. But here it goes, allow me to start with the good parts of this "masterpiece":\n\n+it has steamworks\n+it has achievements\n+it has multiplayer and works well with the steam incorporation\n+it gives you a good reason to appreciate the classics and your life in general\n+it has wacky looking characters and vehicles, always good for a good laugh (since this entire game is a laughing matter)\n\nAnd now...for the long and tedious negative list...I could probably just sum it up to: "It sucks!", but I will mention just a few of the downgrades (in comparison to it's predecessor it seems lesser of a game) and downfalls of the game:\n\n-it crashes, sudden unavoidable and uncontrollable exit of the game (I have everything up to date, but not only for me, but also for others...it just gives an error and crashes)\n-bad handling (not sure if this game was supposed to have handling that you would only see in those old car games, really rudimentary and quite disappointing)\n-bad graphics (I know I played it on low, but I wasn't expecting to look worse than the first title)\n-no community (hmm, I wonder why? *sarcasm* )\n-the crashing effects suck (apparently every time you crash, you lose all of your wheels and other unaesthetic looks for the crashing events)\n-from what I noticed, it lacks the story part or something related\n-the physics are broken most of the time\n-limited maps, barely new features compared with the previous titles etc.\n-it was not worth the price I paid at the time\n\nAnd the list can easily continue for a lot...this is my experience from only an hour or so of gameplay...but, I will still recommend this game, because it really helps you to learn to appreciate what you have and, heck, how knows, you just might enjoy this game while you are drunk or feel like doing something really dumb, so why not keep it close for just those special occasions when you "dare to be stupid".

It has  9 modes that  include  all of the  old  modes such as stuntman and demolition derby,  There’s also Monster Trucks, Speed Racing, Off Road,  one called Night Shift where you race at night  and another that has 50 different challenges. Many more than previous titles in the series.\n\nThat said, I was really disappointed with the graphics and   vehicle handling.  Graphics seem to have taken a retrograde step and handling is much more difficult in Flatout 3.   Overall I don’t regret purchasing this title, but it’s not what I expected.  If you are familiar with the previous Flatout titles   you’ll see what I mean.  Bugbear Entertainment  disappeared back in 2007 so  a new developer has  created this new title and probably explains the differences.  At this time, after trying all the modes I   much prefer the previous game Flatout: Ultimate Carnage.","December 16, 2011","true","21.0"," 5 of 33 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","5","33","2","0"

The game feels just  like a cheap arcade game.  The vehicle physics is crap and wanky.  The destruction is okay at times but it pretty craply done compared to the other games.  Some items like cones and wood float and never move.  I can no longer recommend this game to anyone, not even your worst enemy.  Its like the just stuck the name FLATOUT 3 on a piece of crap and tried to sell it.  You have a better chance at winning the lottery TWICE than enjoying this game for more than 30 mins!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ALL FLATOUT FANS BEWARE!!!  This game is a horrible addition to the Flatout series.  That is why I gave it a negative reveiw. It feels nothing like the originals.\n\nNow on another note as a racing game it isnt the worst (still isnt that great).  It is okay for people who have never touched Flatout if they can get it cheap.  I highly recomend getting the complete pack mainly for the other games.\n\nOverall I do not recomend this game.\nOnce again FLATOUT FANS BEWARE!!!!","September 26, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

F:UC felt good to play, but this game is a frustrating chore. Ramming other cars has no weight and pisses you of for the next 30 seconds when the other car is glued to your hood. The "Power" is merely slow motion where you can tap other racers to blow them up, but good luck finding any racers to ram, and good luck getting your power up more than twice per race. Not to mention it only lasts 5 seconds, so the most you can manage to do is kill only one racer out of a conglomerate total of 16 racers. 16 racers, yet most of the track is always empty, staying in between the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ racers that can barely finish the race whithin a week, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ first placer who finishes sooner than you can even expect.

Instead, I got something very different. In Flatout 3, the racing mechanics are close to none, theres no feel to how fast you go, to how you should turn, its all very different. You just have to be the fastest, not the most skilled. Yes, I do agree the graphics have been upped, but thats not everything a racing game needs to have. Flatout 3 seems to have a lot of good things about it, like the many many many different variety and types of races, but again, its missing the core element, which is the driving. Another thing I noticed was that I were to be given this game without rading the title, I would not realize that this is of the Flatout series. This felt more of an arcade game than a sit-down-and-get-serious-to-race game, its like a 1999 arcade game just with the graphics of 2011. I seriously feel that this game could be improved.","September 5, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead, I got something very different. In Flatout 3, the racing mechanics are close to none, theres no feel to how fast you go, to how you should turn, its all very different. You just have to be the fastest, not the most skilled. Yes, I do agree the graphics have been upped, but thats not everything a racing game needs to have. Flatout 3 seems to have a lot of good things about it, like the many many many different variety and types of races, but again, its missing the core element, which is the driving. Another thing I noticed was that I were to be given this game without rading the title, I would not realize that this is of the Flatout series. This felt more of an arcade game than a sit-down-and-get-serious-to-race game, its like a 1999 arcade game just with the graphics of 2011.

Instead, I got something very different. In Flatout 3, the racing mechanics are close to none, theres no feel to how fast you go, to how you should turn, its all very different. You just have to be the fastest, not the most skilled. Yes, I do agree the graphics have been upped, but thats not everything a racing game needs to have. Flatout 3 seems to have a lot of good things about it, like the many many many different variety and types of races, but again, its missing the core element, which is the driving. Another thing I noticed was that I were to be given this game without rading the title, I would not realize that this is of the Flatout series. This felt more of an arcade game than a sit-down-and-get-serious-to-race game, its like a 1999 arcade game just with the graphics of 2011. I seriously feel that this game could be improved.","September 5, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
