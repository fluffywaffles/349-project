The surrealistic backdrops and bright colors are truly wonderful. The constant storms, the overlay of winds that manipulate the lighting does add to the chaos of our assigned absinthe addicts mind. It adds to the madness. It's a 2D game in a 3D plane, which gives way to a plethora of amazing art-decisions. There are houses, cliffs, rubble, just floating around, sometimes in front of our screen - this can be incredibly annoying while doing some of the more precise platforming since it obfuscates our path, but it could be intentional to make an otherwise easy game a bit harder(bad way of doing that though). But the 3D and the more modern graphics - if you compare it to other indiegames - is a nice change in the way of storyfocused 2D platformers. Spate always give you something to look at, you will never be bored, visually.\n\nThe gameplay is bog standard, but for the most part it's well done, relatively fun and doesn't bring too much frustration to the overall beauteous atmosphere. Parts of the gameplay are not really enjoyable, and doesn't really partake in the physics that the game otherwise upholds. It didn't make sense and it felt contrived. I am mostly referring to the parts where you used a cannon. Especially when you use a cannon to shoot balls into a basket that at the same time moves up and down, it felt out of place and I also fps-dropped in these parts of the game, which made it even worse.These were however short enough to not ruin the experience, but annoying nonetheless. These stops in movement made the game stagnate a bit, it ruined the flow and atmosphere in a way, for me. It felt really gamey, it snapped you out of the game and into a world where you are playing a game, trying to time a frustrating, fps-dropping ball into a bowl which seemingly made nothing happen. It didn't really give you the feedback you needed either to understand that you progressed. Or maybe I was just not paying attention in my boredom. Otherwise the gameplay is okay, but perhaps not the main draw of the game.\n\nThe story was interesting. But in a way that reminded me of Contrast, it didn't get it across in the best way possible. The end seemed rushed, lackluster in a way, the death of his daughter didn't really seem to have been absolved. That could just be the ending I chose, the mindless optimist that I am. Which some people may enjoy being there, but it seemed out of character and trivialized the daughters death.\nThere was also some weird writing, where the robot calls attention to the protagonists alcohol problem and he answer in anger, just after he himself have admitted to it being a problem. It felt like it was forced to give way for a dialogue later on. A dialogue infected by cliché.\nThe narrator is this deep voiced guy: Jack Bair, sort of sounds like Morgan Freeman and he really makes the narration a joy to listen to. It's a third person telling of what you're doing in the way of Bastion, only it's the protagonist talking from his point of view. And apart from some trite observations, or "ruining" - perhaps confirming - the symbolism you yourself get from the background, the narrator does really add to the game. It's simply great.\n\nSo Spate has its moments. It can be hilarious at times, it can be depressing at others. It does illustrate the delirium of an absinthe drinker. It's worthwhile for everything that it is. And for everything that it tries to be. It's intelligent, quirky, surreal, humorous, pretty, colorful. It has spirit.Hehe","March 27, 2014","true","1.7"," 47 of 59 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","47","59","0","0"

It's a 2D platformer that seems to try and emulate better games but only does so at a superficial level, leaving it completely devoid of any substance at all. The level design is bland, the platforming is unsatisfying, and the game offers little to no challenge at all. The gameplay itself is almost non-existent at times; one level in particular is pretty much a Flappy Bird clone, while another has you sliding down slippery slopes and jumping over gaps for about 2 minutes straight. There are instances where you're doing nothing but moving to the right while admiring the scenery and listening to the narrator go on about regret and how alcohol has consumed his life. It's just all too repetitive and boring.\n\nOn the positive side, the game is quite the treat visually and musically. I really enjoyed the art style, in particular the impressive backdrops of each level. The orchestral composition was probably the high-point of the experience. It did a great job of creating atmosphere and was one of the main reasons I continued playing for as long as I did.\n\nAll in all, Spate is a game that looks better than it plays. It builds up a strong ambiance, but unfortunately everything beneath that feels empty and shallow.","June 17, 2014","false","0.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

It definitely got the artsy walking simulator part down, but the story is really... boring. It's essentially "gosh, absinthe/alcoholism sure did ruin my life, but now it's the only thing keeping me going. Also I'm sad that I lost my wife and child." repeated about 30 times with different wordings. The ending bashes you in the face with symbolism that would make an English teacher proud. "Climbing this tower represents his struggle with alcoholism. The boss at the end sustains his life by feeding off the souls of those around him, just like the main character destroys those around him with his alcoholism."\n\nThe platforming bits are alright, but nothing particularly special. And though it might seem petty, I really didn't like the narrator's 1920's New Yorker accent - just didn't seem to fit the character at all.

A brilliant set up for a story and nothing more needs to be said about that.\n\nSpate is a nice little platformer that you should have no trouble finishing in around 2 hours. There aren't really any enemies to speak of in the traditional platforming sense; Spate is more about platforming and then interacting with characters and objects. Does that make it a puzzle platformer? Not really, no.  I wouldn't call anything I came across in this game a puzzle, and to be honest the controls didn't feel particularly tight so it wasn't particularly good as a platformer either, but since nothing too much is expected of you it doesn't really matter that much. In terms of gameplay Spate isn't sounding that good on paper, but it still somehow manages to be a good game.\n\nThere are a few things that make Spate a bit special. Being able to drink a seemingly unlimited supply of absinthe as you navigate through the world adds an extra element I haven't seen in many games. The effects of the absinthe warp the screen and environment around you. It makes jumping a little floatier and can affect how some environmental objects function too. While drinking isn't really necessary, you'll find yourself doing it often just for the hell of it. Just like in real life ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nWhat really goes a long way towards making Spate a good game is the fact that it has well thought out audio. The moody string instrument soundtrack adds to the atmosphere of the dark and deranged art style. Spate is narrated by a Christopher Walken sounding man - it's actually Jack Bair, but I've not heard of him before now. Just imagine someone that sounds a bit like Christopher Walken. The only thing I wish was done differently in Spate is that they could have voice acted the dialogue as well as the narration. Having a well done narration (although Jack Bair lacks emotion in some parts where he's meant to be quite upset) makes it seem quite jarring when dialogue appears and it is text only.\n\nI played the game through using only my Xbox 360 controller and it worked very well. There aren't many buttons required, but controller support was good.\n\nI'd recommend Spate based on the art style, the drinking effects, and the narration/music - although it only just scrapes in on the recommendation line for me. Spate is a fairly simple little platformer, but it shows a lot of promise and I look forward to seeing more games from Eric Provan - Ayyo Games.\n\n6.5 out of 10 - Would press X to drink again.","August 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","3"

There are places where I died few times, but death only sets you back a little. There are two sections where you fly your airship, which is only controlled by one button similar to "copter.swf" which I played a lot in the early '00s. You also have a button that makes you drink absinth, which makes your screen swirl a little and makes you jump a lot higher. I'm not sure it's required to do so in any point of the game, but it can make your life easier... maybe that was the point of the story?\n\nNarration is done by a guy who does sound like Christopher Walken, the few dialogues the game has are text-only.\n\nNot all is good, though, I noticed few problems. Ingame options (subtitles specifically) are not saved when you exit the game. Sometimes you get stuck walking slowly like you're crouched even if you are not.

If I was asked to give a list of examples of how to make a so-so atmospheric platformer, I wouldn't hand over Spate, because that would imply that this game was good enough to even be considered "only" mediocre. No, Spate is the epitome of what people who hate the genre believe it is: creepy/trippy backdrops to make up for a dearth of actual gameplay elements.\n\nSpate is the story of a detective who ventures to an supposedly uninhabited island that was once the scene of a mass disappearance of its citizens, and is now covered in a layer of fog and precipitation. His goal is to find some missing entrepreneur, but that quickly resolves itself to make way for heavy handed existential talk of him losing his daughter. You really begin to feel for the good detective when transparent photos of his deceased daughter are superimposed in the background. It looks as terrible as it sounds, but sounds nowhere near as terrible as the voice actor who portrays our detective. More often than not, Detective Hevyhans sounds like one of the more hilarious Christopher Walken impersonations littering youtube. It's as if the actor who portrays him truly means to do his best to destroy any remaining potential for solid exposition, at least any that the highschool level monologue that runs ad nauseam fails to deal with.\n\nLevels typically consist of overly long straight and narrow pathways, and occasionally these turn into overly long platforming segments where the platforms barely differentiate in height, size, or distance from each other. And don't worry, equally mediocre jumping controls complement these mediocre jumpways. Some areas introduce more puzzling elements, and I don't mean that they in any way promote thought on the part of the player. An early example of puzzling elements include machinery (usually controlling buzzsaws) that may try to throw a wrench in your plan to move rightward. There is no rhyme or reason to their inclusion in the game, and they don't even match with the surrounding scenery. So why are they here? Likely because someone played too much LIMBO whilst developing Spate.\n\nAnother puzzling addition to the game is the inclusion of a "drink" button. This lets you take a swig of absinthe whenever you please, because your daughter's dead, which twists the world a bit, adding oddities like eyes to trees and giant floating fish in the sky. It also allows you to jump really high, because absinthe is apparently a very powerful hallucinogen, now. From what I've played, there's no point to the function, other than to break up the monotony of moving right for minutes while nothing happens. I've never needed the high jump, and the "hallucinogenic" effects wear off in a matter of seconds unless you smack the "drink" button between every couple of breaths.\n\nSpate does do one thing right. It gives me an even higher appreciation of games that absolutely nail the whole atmospheric bit, like LIMBO. I remember first playing LIMBO years ago, thinking how easy it would be to make a similar game. After all, how difficult could such a minimalist experience be to create? If Spate is any indication, I clearly gave the creators of LIMBO far too little credit.","June 8, 2014","false","0.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/recommended/269810/","bonnup","bonnup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/","264 products in account","As the video game medium evolves into a more comprehensive experience, mechanically defined genres have blurred, thematic material and atmosphere emerging as the most accurate descriptions of games. Spate is neither a platformer nor a two-degrees-of-freedom walking simulator; it is a psychological thriller, ripe with counterplay between its prominent mechanic and its aesthetic intentions.\n\nThe Negs --\nSpate is a game that relies heavily on illusion and atmosphere. You are held in harrowing hallucinations as much as the protagonist, but this captivation spirals down the drain faster than a slick steamer in a Taco Bell toilet whenever you speak with the main NPC, a comedic relief robot that passes for funny only in abrupt contrast with the otherwise somber environment. The game's exposition switches between text box (for conversations with NPCs) and voiced narration for the protagonist's thoughts. The text boxes aren't the best writing and they have several grammatical errors (as does the store page description if you care to look for them), but the real issue is in the execution of these internal monologues. The writing for these is slightly less obtuse than store-brand cereal names. In a genre that demands vague motivations and misleading actions to unsettle the player's own thoughts, this title was rather direct in all things. Any misdirection by the narrator is almost immediately recanted and explained. Interpretation is unheard of. Also, these narrative monologues come up in one of the 6 distinct gameplay portions. These are open straightaways (wherein the long narration occurs), NPC interactions, platforming segments, sliding sections, "Angry Birds" mini-games, and "Helicopter Game" mini-games (you know, the one we all used to play on public school computers with the bright green cavern walls and terrible collision boxes where you click to fly up and release to fall down while constantly moving right). I suspect that the straightaways are designed as such that you can just listen to the narration and take in the environment without much thought as to where to jump or what pitfall to avoid. The problem is that these are too long. If you were to continue to walk right for the duration of the monologues, it would often conclude long before the next segment of gameplay. This is suboptimal design. Besides, the platforming sections are so infrequently strewn into the game with such embarrassingly shallow challenge that there would be no concern for distraction should the player encounter one during important exposition. The sliding sections are slopes that your character slips down without any control. The two mini-game types seem to be attempts at bolstering the gameplay, but they neglect that Spate's most enticing characteristic is not its gameplay. I will say, though, that the most fun parts of the game were the "helicopter" segments. My very minor complaints for this title are some collision glitches and an uneventful soundtrack that was just a smattering of sounds you might hear in any token thriller.\n\nThe Pos --\nEric Provan developed this game as a personal project and I am glad he did. Provan has worked for Disney's and Henson's animation studios, and he designed models and textures for such works as Frozen, The Amazing Spiderman, Alice in Wonderland, and Big Hero 6. His experience in 3D modelling provides Spate with its most powerful aspect: a haunting visual trek through a fantastically detailed world. The game is set in a steampunk era, and it plays well with the dark and mechanical environmental elements. The visual experience is unrivaled by most 2.5D side-scrollers; it develops a cerebral existence with themes symbolically integrated into the geography of the protagonist's world. While the story is not especially well-written, it does offer an emotional journey if the player wishes to be so engrossed. This is actually the most satisfying part of the game to me. The game very early informs you that you can take a swig of absinthe at any point during the game. The effect is shocking at first, the world twisting and distorting, backgrounds shifting into monstrosities. Having consumed the spirit, the player can move slightly faster and jump significantly higher. As is the case with absinthe, the player will encounter hallucinations on account of the drink which really embellishes the story in every good way. I will not ruin any plot elements in this review, but I will say that the entire game can be beaten without drinking absinthe, only some of the platforming sections are made stupidly simple if you are under the influence (due to the jump height advantage). I loved this intertwining of mechanic and story, since an alcohol addiction may make coping with pains significantly easier but it is never one's only option. A slighter pleasantry I should mention is the pacing of the game. It took 2 hours to play through, and I did not feel that any distinct section was drudgery, since the narration and visuals did mesmerize me quite well.\n\nThe Verd --\nIt may very well seem that I loathed this game, but its mistakes had much to do with the gameplay, which was not Spate's draw in the first place. Rather, thrilling atmosphere and striking animation are what this title offers most. I would have to dissuade those looking for a fun platformer from purchasing this game, but anyone who might be interested in a spectacle of mind games in service of a gloomy theme must experience Spate. For missing out on an opportunity to further immerse the player by melding more of the mechanics with the plot and for leaving the gameplay unattended, Spate garners a [7 / 10]. A dark theme terrifically employed into an uncertain world, Spate makes a great game for anyone willing to overlook its design flaws.","January 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/269810/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","Very much a flawed gem, this isn't as strictly gameplay focused as some might hope for and because of the story focus with simple, even bland gameplay it's no wonder a lot of people expected more, but for me Spate was a short, visually strange and interesting journey that only suffered from a few minor annoyances and delivered a lightly moving story. Because of that I'd recommend it as a flawed but good, or at least interesting game worth an hour or two of your time.\n\nHighlights\nThe balance of gameplay with the narrative/story was what stood out most for me in Spate. Thrown into a dark damp and rough visual art style, you feel slightly out of place and isolated when you first begin your journey, and that matches the point at which the story begins, which is a good example of the multiple instances of putting the narrative ahead of the gameplay, for better or worse. Throughout the stages you'll pass through relic and forgotten structures and visuals from the past, just as the character does. In many stages I felt as though the game was far too simple and I was simply being carried along, later realizing this was intentional and even emphasized during a long slow water stage. Everything tries to feed the story in much the same way Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did, and while this game is in no way as well polished and designed as Brothers, it does have its own charm and some interesting design points.\n\nThe narrative and art style are also beautiful and solemn, the strange mix of rough low-res textures and gloomy but vivid lighting are different enough to stand out but not enough to take away from the story or feeling of the game.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nThere's plenty wrong with Spate and that mostly come down to lack of production value and polish. As a short simple platformer you'd expect the controls to be a priority, but they feel floaty, slow and frustratingly inaccurate. You could argue that this is intentional to help feel out the story, but it still feels cumbersome and when mixed with poor stage design where you might need to repeat a section a few times or repeat the same action 10+ times to proceed and faulty graphical artifacts and clipping, it really sucks away some of the immersion and takes away from the game as a whole.\n\nThe other concern is the length. At just an hour or two of gameplay Spate really needs to offer something well crafted and refined. I'm glad there're no false gimmicks like jaunty collectibles or multiple characters and I understand that every section of the game attempts to represent a part of the characters journey, but with the fairly simplistic design of the game and the one line story it needs something else in terms of gameplay to keep it going long enough or make it challenging enough to have an impact and they've missed a beat.\n\nRecommendations\nAt just $4.99/£3.99/4.99€ Spate isn't overpriced, but due to the very short length and lack of technical care in design it's a game I'd actually recommend waiting for a sale on to keep you from feeling robbed out of a more traditional gameplay focused game. If all you want is a short interesting journey, this is very much worth a play, just don't expect a puzzle/platform title like LIMBO and be prepared to forgive some poor design and you'll enjoy what this has to offer.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/269810\n\n* There are a number of hidden bunny's (Easter Bunny's = Easter Eggs) throughout the world which usually offer a line of dialogue, spoilers available here\n\nUnedited review notes 27/12/2015 for Spate:\n\n-Poor menu system, have to switch between mouse and keyboard multiple times and backtrack etc\n-Really lacking in polish, multiple small jagged bugs from artifacts to timing, big problem for such a simple game\n+Good narration and fairly good writing that match the art style\n+Rough indie art style makes it feel more personal, like a student art movie\n+Moves slowly and gameplay always seems to match narration in terms of pace, point in journey etc","December 27, 2015","true","1.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

In sincerity, I don't really buy very often on Steam.  From the glowing reviews, I wanted to give this game a shot, especially considering the breathtaking design that the screenshots promised.\n\nThe noir/steampunk design lended itself nicely to the plot, which is ripe with cliche dialogue that would make Max Payne's grimace transform into a prideful smile.  Although, I have to admit that the main voice actor in the game sounded very similar to Morgan Freeman.  Not that it's a bad thing.  Truly, the sin of the story is that it doesn't seem to go anywhere.  You can plop down the most surrealistic architecture, but if you have a plot that stands still, why am I even listening to the protagonist?\n\nIf you're used to platformers, the gameplay is par for the course.  Jump on things that spin, dodge pits, dodge spikes, throw in a cannon or two.  Don't get me wrong, it's obvious that the developers put a ton of work into the game, but I still can't recommend the title, even at 50% off.\n\nTo be honest with you, I haven't finished the game.  There was a respawn glitch that sends me to through the floor, straight into the kill barrier.  After shutting off to my desktop, returning to my save file, the glitch was still happening.  There's no excuse for this kind of game stopping glitch, which is a shame.\n\nThere was a lot of potential for a truly special experience.","August 3, 2014","false","0.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","2"

In Spate you play as a detective sent to an abandoned island to investigate the disappearance of a business man. Detective Bluth has a troubled past, as most detectives seem to have, involving his daughter disappearing, his wife leaving him, and having a drinking problem, which makes its way into the game as a surprising game mechanic.\nThe first thing I noticed right away just by the game's screenshots is the game's style is gorgeous. They even say in the discription that they took influence from several artists such as Jim Henson and Dr. Seus. They way I could describe the overall style of the game is, Tim Burton remaking "The Wicker Man" with elements of Dr. Seus.\nThe other cool mechanic of the game is the use of the main character's addiction. The game itself is a puzzle-platformer, like Limbo. And the reason the game looks so surreal is you don't know how much of the strangeness is real and how much of it is hallucinations from his addiction. And by drinking the alchohol during a puzzle it will make completing the puzzle easier. My only complaint about this that only a few puzzles actually needed to use the mechanic on. I like that it didn't force the mechanic on you, but the puzzles just seemed a little too easy, at least to me. I feel it could been a little bit harder to really make you sort of fight yourself not to use the alcohol. For the most part I just said "Okay I'll try not to use it!" and I didn't really have to try.\nThe story also keeps you interested. The main character slowly feeds you what happened to him in his life and why he's become like this, and what's really going on, on this myserious island.\nThe only other thing I have to complain about is the ending, or should I say endings. The game has two different endings. And while I liked them both, I feel like the way you get them could have been handled a lot better. I feel like what they should have done was one ending you get if you solved more puzzles without the need for the addictive substance, and the other ending you get if you rely on it too much.\nIt's also surprisingly short, it only took me 99 minutes to complete on my first try. But to the game's credit I'm not sure how they really could have made it any longer without it feeling like they were dragging it out.\nOverall I liked Spate, it's a little flawed, but it's got a beautiful and interesting style, and a good story about overcoming loss and addiction.

There's cannons, jumping, and drinking your absinthe. It lacks interesting elements to keep a steady flow of attentiveness and enjoyment. There were some very interesting parts, such as entering through the first odd creature. As it went along I thought 'wow, i'm a little intimidated to go through this part/go inside this area. What'll happen if I do?' well, what happened was that I literally just walked through it, without any action or consequence. This game isn't terrible, don't get me wrong...But another problem with it, is that the controls are clunky. It feels like your character's slightly off in certain situations. There were a few times when I had a checkpoint and died. Not so hard, right? You get sent back to the checkpoint when you die-well, when you've went through a series of 6-8 obstacles and a narrow passageway just to slam right into the same upper wall the billionth time JUST because you didn't hold the space bar in just the right timing makes respawning very agonizing. There were very few other parts where I just sat there and said to myself 'I wonder if i'm going to get through this anytime soon.' because it was just so clunky and absurd. I go on a jump panel, and somehow I die....I jump towards a paltform, miss my jump, glitch in the segment holding up the platform and instantaneously die. The difficulty in this game is just aggravating. For the most part, it's easy sailing, you just work your way through, and to an extent it gets boring. Then, when you come to a more difficult part, that's not even that difficult in concept....You keep dying, or falling back to start, over and over and over again. It's not the fact that you die that makes it difficult; in fact, dying wasn't a concern...It's falling back right to where you started. It happens very solemn in this game, but when it does.....It's pretty aggravating. The narration is excellent, the story is very well done. If it's on sale and you just...Want to find a way to kill time, or if it looks interesting to you, go ahead and get it...But if I was recommending this to people who're looking for a triple A game, i'd tell them to pass on this.","May 31, 2014","false","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, have we got just the game for you!\n\nSpate is a gorgeously epic and dream-like platformer which teaches kids all about the ups and downs of alcohol abuse, and suggests that while absinthe will usually just lead to child neglect and marital disintegration, it also has its benefits, such as giving one the boundless energy required to perform super-human feats of death-defying derring-do which even the most suicidal of "extreme sportsmen" would balk at attempting; all whilst our anti-hero muses casually to himself about the wrong he has done in his life, thanks to his dual addictions to detective work and the dreaded demon drink.

Apparently this game is all about the story. I heard people were comparing this to games like (I think) Limbo and Bastion but I'm sorry to say that it doesn't even come close.\nThe story it tries to tell is interesting but the world feels weird and I couldn't really connect with it. That, and the conversations and monologues working toward the ending sometimes seem random and/or uninteresting. The ending, however, is pretty good and maybe it needs a second playthrough in order to fully understand things. Then again, maybe not.\n\nSpate is a nice attempt at trying to be something deep but let's just face it: you're better off playing games that are actually deep. Or, at least, deeper than this.\n\n[Rating: 63/100]","June 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

I thought this was a really great/deep/one of a kind experience that I wasn't really expecting. I was following this game for quite awhile and then had forgotton about it till it showed up on a steam sale recently. The game is short, but I'm okay with that, the story is as unique as it is weird and the narration I thought was very good actually. Perhaps was expecting more for the ending, but it was still very rewarding none the less as the game does a really good job and making you keep guessing exactly what the hell is going on.\n\nGraphically was beautiful and the orchstral soundtrack really did the game justice, fantastic music. Loved how you can just drink endlessly and the weird funny effects that it does on the game can really trip you for a loop! Beautiful game with quite a deep story even though it is short, and read the credits, some meaningfull stuff in there I wasn't expecting either, so take the time to read some of em....\n\nGame ran flawlessly for me with great mechanics. Ending was unique and just enough to walk away with a satisfied feel you finished the game. I hope there will be another game someday with perhaps more to it, doesn't matter if its a sequal or a whole new story/adventure. There isn't many games that are so simple, but yet, move me a little and this did that.... If you're thinking about buying this game, just don't think about it what this game is when you play it, just let the game take you on its journey is really the best way to describe how to play this game....\n\nI highly reccomend this game, especially when it was only $3.99 from sale.\n\n1 side note though:\nGame isn't optimized very well, It ran good for me, but then I am sitting with a GTX 980 so it would but I would go from 220FPS down to 40 something without much going on with my GPU/CPU or much going on the screen.","October 16, 2014","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The description of the story is enough to pull you in:\n\nSpate is a dark, brooding, and beautifully crafted emotional journey that is seen through the eyes of a struggling addict.\n\nIndie game gold right? Sadly no.\nI found Spate to be a story-based puzzle platformer with no puzzles and a narrator whom I felt no empathy for. The way he casually flings his alcoholism and self-deprecation about is more akin to a troubled teenager than a father in mourning.\n\nThe 'game' mostly consists of holding down right and jumping. I thought that the 'X to drink' was an excuse to put a funky filter over the whole thing and promote it as an art piece but it wasn't until the last scene that I found I could jump higher once I'd activated it. I'm not sure if that was contextual or a mechanic I had somehow missed throughout the whole game, it just goes to show how little I actually needed it.\n\nThe imagery is often spectacular but is interspersed with glimpses of the main character's daughter who looks like something out of Frozen. On the whole, I got the feeling that three indie titles had been merged into one to help fill 90 minutes of gameplay. Even then I found myself skating down a waterfall for about 5 minutes. I almost jumped off it at one point to see if it was a test.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wahtzy/recommended/269810/","Wahtzy","Wahtzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wahtzy/","764 products in account","So like with my last review, I came upon this game when I was browsing my way too big steam library. Incidentally I had seen this before, and put it on my list of one of those interesting looking indie games, with a nice artsyle. The fact that I had gotten it from somewhere had completely gone over my head, until I saw it on my list. I guess I must have gotten it in one of the many bundles I have bought over the time.\nAnyway..\n\nSpate is a side-scrolling platformer, and my first impression was that it reminded me a lot of Limbo, wich is a very good thing. This might just be because they are both sidescrolling platformers, with a cool artsyle, but I think the whole feel of the game was very much like Limbo, and not like, for instance Megaman wich is, incidentally also a sidescrolling platformer.\nThe characters movement was pretty solid, if a little sloppy. I wouldn't say this game has top-notch twitch-action controlls, but they are merely good, and works very well with this game.\n\nThe level design wasn't that good, the puzzles wasn't that challenging, and more often than not, the game would have wide distances with nothing going on, other than the narrator filling in a piece of story, or some wierd visuals going on. Personally I don't have a big problem with this, because I'm not the best at platforming, and I'm especially not that patient, so I tend to give up if the puzzles are too hard. The fact that it was pretty easy, and there was these 'empty' sections, gave more space for the story to grow. There was however some points that were pretty fricking frustrating, at one point the game kept on killing me for incorrectly landing on some platforms, meanwhile the jumpy things bugged and died, meaning I had to restart the section to make it work. Another place would be right at the end *SPOILER ALERT* where you have to climb a tower to get to the end of the game, and it uses a mechanic that levitates you upwards, while you have to dodge saws and stuff, if you die at any point while flying you will start back at the bottom, and will have to fly up again, and it takes a long time to fly up.\n\nThe story was pretty great. The setting of the game had this whole Zeno Clash style wich I absolutely adore, and the story was a gloomy one about a man with a lot of problems. The whole thing matched nicely into the setting, and even managed to justify the wierd things, in a way that makes the player think for them selves. I think this part of the game, the whole story and setting thing, was by far the best executed thing in this game, and is defenitly the main selling point in my opinion.\n\nThe artstyle was pretty cool, as I already mentioned, it uses the wierd Zeno Clash esque style, and combines it with a grimy but colourful pallette (yea both of those things, at the same time, go figure), and often uses wierd camera angles, and effects, in a non-intrusive or gamebraking way, to effectuate the whole drinking thing.\n\nOverall Spate is pretty good, but is also very short. I beat the game in one setting in less than two hours. So with a pricetag of 9.99 eur, I would say you'd probably want to pick it up at a sale, or buy it in a bundle. If you are a stickler for great stories, you might be able to justify the price.\n\nTl;dr: Great story, great visuals, great setting, very short, a little pricy. Buy on sale!","July 7, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You simply put faith in the fact that it will do well.\n\nMr. Provan has made a game much more than a success and what I had in mind. And I have chosen the two greatest admirations of this experience.\n\nGraphics:\nThe Unity engine still shows itself, once again, to somehow bring my computer almost to its knees with its somewhat out-of-the-box lack in optimization. However, I was present when Eric was doing well to optimize it himself so that performance and quality was equally present. That said, the graphics in this game are done well and beautifully. In most games, I try to admire the level design but most of the time, I'm just breezing right through it. In Spate, the game was at an appropriate slow pace that I was able to stop and enjoy the level designs. I would say that my favorite was the level with the small village and houses.\n\nSound/Music\nThe entire time I was playing this game, Mike Raznick's surreal and haunting scoring pulled me more into the experience. The violins led the way and drove the music toward feelings of melancholy and ethereal. This is a great example of how the music not only fits the story but drives it forward. The voice acting of Jack Bair as the main protagonist was perfect; I personally received the feeling of a 1920s detective with how his words were spoken.\n\nSo there are two cents on a wonderful experience that I need to play again so I can see what happens in the other ending.","May 31, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rather, the game mainly focus around heading to the right and avoiding the obstacles whilst you admire the interesting visuals and listen to the story unfold.\n\nThe visuals are the main reason why anybody would enjoy this game. They are definitely interesting, as you can see in the screenshot gallery on the store page. At any point, you can also take a swig of absinthe and have the visuals go all wobbly to spice it up a bit. But it saddens me to say that I found this to be its genuinely single redeeming factor.\n\nNever before has a psychological thriller — I guess you could call this one of those — left me so bored. The main character and narrator has not an unpleasant voice, which is a good thing as he spends a lot of the game talking to himself about his life. Nevertheless the narration begins to get really seriously drab as he goes back over the same points over and over and over, and I became completely sick of his talk of “the drink” by the end of my first playthrough.\n\nThe gameplay involves dodging various obstacles which aren't ever a real challenge to avoid, and you're given slight changes in pace in the form of piloting a small plane or sliding down several slopes in succession (which is my new favourite sentence) in order to break up the sheer monotony that still manages to seep through. The main causes for my deaths was either impatience due to boredom or not paying attention due to boredom, and neither of which are ever a good thing.\n\nAt the end of the game, your only form of actual interaction with the story comes in the form of making a ‘choice’, which sort of falls dry when there's a clear right and wrong answer:\nFix everything that's wrong and get your life back on track vs. Be an alcoholic and continue destroying any emotional ties you have because why the ♥♥♥♥ not.\n\nYeah. Spate is a monotonous game with interesting visuals. The several points in which it fell flat weren't so bad as to make me not wish to finish or revisit it. I got it in a bundle, and it's been in four unique ones thus far, so maybe keep an eye out on those sites if this has piqued your interest; I didn't hate it, but I honestly couldn't recommend it for full price.","August 25, 2015","false","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't want to say much about the story but there is a personal tragedy evolving around the character you play throughout your journey through the world. You can drink Absinthe whenever you want and it changes the play world in terms of colors, surroundings and so on but most importantly it changes gameplay as you can jump much higher even though it gets really hard to control those jumps but overall it makes the jumping challenges easier. First I thought it would be useful to have a limitation on the Absinthe consumption but well, it's a crucial part of both game and experience. At anytime you can get hallizunations - if you want but you don't have to.\nThe narrator of the story - the character you play - does a great job in telling your story and it's pretty immersive if you are open to it. Even though gameplay is not perfect and there are some minor glitches, the 2D side scrolling is perfectly built into the 3D surroundings. It has become quite common and usual but the game developers did a great job on that!\n\nSo, if you are thinking about getting this game - look at some screenshots (I loved to do some myself).\nI recommend this game if you liked e.g. Limbo even though it's not that concentrated on survival. It's more about the experience and you can take your time and are not in a hurry. The jumping challenges are a bit repetitive though and the sometimes you jump from platform to platform which somehow is in conflict with the atmosphere of the game world as the platforms look mechanic and quite unfitting but it's aside from that there is nothing to add.\nSo have a look at Spate and maybe you pick it up while it's on sale (Y)\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that the voice-acting itself is outstanding and all sounds add beautifully to the experience.","June 25, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

This game would be better described as a narrative visual book than a platformer. I was unimpressed with the gameplay all together, but for some reason I couldn't stop playing.

Even the ability to take a drink and disorient yourself for an ability of jumping higher, which is mostly useless, brings you further in. The ending is strong and for the sake of not ruining anything, I won't comment further on it.\n\nI once said to a friend of mine that, gameplay be damned, a solid story can make a game become amazing.

Runs awfully, even at the lowest graphics settings. This may be partially my computer at fault, but I've played games that looked nearly as good without any issues in the slightest.\n2. Dialogue is repetitive; I hope you like hearing about the main character's daughter, "the drink", and/or how life sucks every time something is spoken.\n3. Too much tedium especially given the short amount of playtime. Many scenarios where you run right with no dialogue or perfom some repetitive jumping task for far longer than needed. There's about enough here to fill 40ish minutes of gameplay, and the game is twice that length.\n\nI will say this. The game looks beautiful and the sound design is great. The plot is... okay. It's sort of nonsensical at the end, I found; things that outright don't make sense unintentionally, but I won't say what to avoid any spoilers of the sort. The mechanics were alright enough. There's nothing special in the gameplay at all though. If you want a short game that's nice to look at, maybe check it out on sale; I don't think it validates its full price in the slightest, unfortunately.\n\nOh yeah there's also a drinking mechanic that you literally never have any reason to use and will only serve to make the game harder to play? And the altenate ending thing is literally confined to the very very end of the game and there's no way to view the ending you didn't pick without replaying the game or, more sanely, looking it up on youtube.","July 3, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/269810/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Spate is a weird game.\nFar more on the side of an artistic experience, more atmospheric and narrative driven, rather than a game with solid mechanics that you need to learn in order to overcome various obstacles.\n\nThis by itself might put a lot of people off, as the game bundles itself with Dear Esther, Gone Home, Limbo, Braid, etc.\nI would definitely not pair it with Limbo and Braid. Those games had more focus on the mechanics, regardless of having just as big of an artistic approach to it.\n\nBut, I certainly enjoyed Spate. I wouldn't consider it as good as most other attempts at art-sy games, but it certainly had a few great moments!\n\n\nIn Spate, you're an alcoholic father, who has "lost" his little girl. You're in a twisted, dream-like land (it reminded me quite a lot of Alice Madness Returns, in a good way) in search for answers.\nYou, and your absynthe.\nAnd because of that, you don't know what is real, and what is not. You don't know what's actually true, or what you've hallucinated in this weird world. And that's part of its charm.\n\n\nVisually, the game is beautiful, without a lot of strange creatures, and a world that makes you feel tiny and insignificant right from the beginning.\nThe game is also very heavy on effects, and camera movements, so beware if you get motion sickness easily.\nAll in all, I really like the look of the game, and trying to figure out exactly where the hell I was.\nA big issue, is that it performs terribly. The developer is actively trying to make it better, but it still runs pretty badly, even in very good rigs.\nI played at probably 30-45 fps and it didn't really impact the gameplay too much, but a smoother experience would be much better.\n\nThe music was actually phenomenal! It was one of the high points for me. It has a sad feel to it, and very heavy, actually (Not in a heavy metal way, but created a very heavy atmosphere), and it was beautiful. It was fairly minimalistic, but it worked perfectly.\nI'm not sure if it was influenced by the players actions, but it always hit the spot for me, with its intensity.\nI'm very impressed with both graphic and sound design in this game, both beautifully crafted!\n\n\nNow, how was gameplay?\n\nWell, pretty weak, for the most part.\nIt seemed more of a vehicle for the narrative, but just ended up feeling a bit too empty in that regard.\nYou jump and run to the right, for the most part, with some soft platforming. A few saws here and there, some somewhat precise platforming, but there was hardly any challenge. As there shouldn't be, taken how the game was designed. It's more of a walk, enjoying the world and its looks, trying to answer the questions it brings.\nThere were also 2 sequences where you were in a flying boat, that played a bit like flappy bird (with good maneuvering space, not unfair or anything) to keep the game fresh, but it felt out of place, and a very artificial way to keep things interesting.\n\nThen, there was the main mechanic, directly tied to the narrative. You can take a sip at your absynthe. That'll make the world even more surreal, making you dazy, but will also make you run faster and jump higher (perhaps a bit how you would feel, like it's a weight off your back, ready to face the world).\nYou could easily beat the game without drinking anything. But you could also drink a lot, like the drunk you are!\nAnd, while they may not matter in what the game does later on, it serves as your own story. In this case, the path, and not the final goal.\nThere were a couple of great moments where I myself felt inclined to drink (or not to), as my own interpretation of what was happening, and that's also something I didn't expect, but was very cool.\n\nThe whole game is narrated by you (the character), about how things got where they are. About all that went wrong. About losing your daughter, your wife, and now your life, to the alcohol.\nIt's up to your whether or not you try not to drink, or just drink to forget. While great in concept, it didn't quite feel as significant as it could have been, as it changes nothing, in the end (And I don't think that was the point, although it could certainly be a valid interpretation).\nThe game has 2 endings, I believe, but they're not based on your actions , it's more of a binary choice in the last sequence of the game. And that was very disappointing. I feel that much more could have been done with the theme.\n\n\nI liked the narrative of the game, I've found it fairly enjoyable, and has you questioning reality, life, misery, all within a very surreal looking world. The gameplay, on the other hand, isn't as tied to it as it should. But hey, it's not too bad.\nThe game is pretty short (most people finish it in 90minutes to 2 hours) for one playthrough, and the binary nature of the choice lacks replayability.\nDespite thinking the game has still a huge room for improvement, I still liked it, for what it is. It's a beautiful walk in the park, structured more as a short film than as a game, but still worth trying out if you're into these kinds of games.\n\nWait for a sale if you think it's too short for 10$, but it's certainly an interesting one.","June 9, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium ("grand wormwood"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as "la fée verte" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.\n\nAbsinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. Owing in part to its association with bohemian culture, the consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists. Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie and Alfred Jarry were all known absinthe drinkers.\n\nAbsinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, although present in the spirit in only trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria-Hungary. Although absinthe was vilified, it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties (apart from that of the alcohol) have been exaggerated. A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed longstanding barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Australia, United States, Spain, and the Czech Republic.\n\nAnd your character is guzzling it down as he searches for answers to his daughters dissappearence.\n\nWith your wife having left you years ago, your mind is warped by the toxic green substance that is often refered to as "The Green Fairy". The trip you take is to an island where everything starts to take a turn for the worse the moment you step foot on it. This was the last known where abouts of your daughter, the last bastion of madness and regret. As you witness strange things you will often run into a strange but friendly robot. He speaks weird, he might be hiding something, but your goal is too important to trouble yourself with the history and purpose of this robot. You have to find out what happened to your daughter. The further you go the more absinthe you drink. You should of brought food, water, real supplies. But who needs that when you can find all the comfort, all the numbness, all the peace you will need in this dark green liquid? Surely not you.\n\nSo embark, my friend, on this strange journey. Know what it is like to have lost everything, go into the middle of a river of blood and force yourself to tread on. What's the point? The end. What is the end? No one will know until it is upon us. What of all your goals and questions? Will you reach them? Will you have answers? My friend these are the wrong things to ask... Drink another long healthy swig and let us go. For what really is behind us? Nothing but despair. It is time. Lets go...\n","February 21, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can't say I was sorry it ended, or that I particularly enjoyed that 1.6 hours. It was just.. okay. The artwork is definitely beautiful and if you're the type who can enjoy a game for the artwork then I'd definitely recommend it, its wacky, colourful, weird but pretty. The story was ...okay. It could have been so much better, could have had so much more depth, but as it was it was just ... flat, didn't make me feel for the guy at all.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I think I spent at least half of the game simply pressing the right arrow. Sure there were platforming elements but though they looked challenging and fun, they were simple jumps and swings, easy. The flying through the caves I felt went on far too long on both occassions, it just got old - which, in a game this short, is definitely saying something. For anyone expecting a decent platformer or a hell of a story, I definitely can't recommend it.","November 2, 2014","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serpico/recommended/269810/","serpico","Serp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serpico/","206 products in account","Alright, to be fair, this game does have some gorgeous level design. If you're looking for a stroll through some pretty levels, I guess this game is a fine choice. That said, there are a number of problems:\n\n1.) Lack of Polish\nThere is a serious lack of polish on this game. In the first 36 minutes of play, I had already died from glitches twice and had to restart the game once because I mysteriously lost the ability to focus on a submenu, and could only control the main menu so the submenu was seemingly impossible to get rid of.\n\nThe deaths were due to falling through the floor of a see-saw-like platform twice. This same see-saw sometimes seemed to pivot really fast if I stepped on it a certain way. If I stood on it while it descended, the character would hang in the air for a moment then fall repeatedly instead of riding down smoothly, causing him to do a weird sort of dance.\n\nAt some point I was also shooting cannonballs into a basket to lift up a rock. I didn't realize at first how high I was supposed to lift it so I kept shooting cannonballs into this basket, which lifted the rock comically high above the pully that was supposed to be raising it.\n\nThere's also barely any sound effects in the game. Buzzsaws swoop silently around you and kill you just as silently. The music volume on the other hand varies wildly, and I kept having to adjust my volume.\n\nAnd while the level design was fanstic, the character you play as seems to stick out awkwardly against hte world. He doesn't seem to quite fit the art style. This game simply doesn't seem to be finished.\n\n2.) Gameplay and Physics\nThe physics in this game are pretty awkward, and that really takes any kind of fun out of the dodging/jumping challenges you have to complete. The challenges themselves are pretty uninspired, and just don't really even seem to belong to the rest of the game. There is also a game mechanic where you can drink absinthe for apparently no reason other than making the screen wobbly. There is There's very little to gain from playing this game that you wouldn't gain by watching a playthrough of it.\n\n3.) Writing\n\n(Spoilers Below)\n\nWhile there are a few good lines, a significant portion of the monologue is reminding us over and over that the character drowns his sorrows with absinthe and that it makes him hallucinate. At the end of the game we also see the professor in the place of the bad guy for a few flahes in an apparent analogy between dependence on a machine and dependence on absinthe. I feel like the "bad guy is you" / "journey of self improvement" theme was pretty apparent long before we arrived at the end though. If there is anything subtle in this game, it was too sublte for me to catch it.\n\nThe world and underlying plot are also not very well fleshed out. I understand that that may not be important in every game, but for a game where you play as a detective, the truths you uncover are pretty unsatisfying and feel very ad-hoc. The jokes are also not terribly funny.\n\nAnd I'm still clueless as to why our protagonist has a giant hand.\n\n(End Spoilers)\n\nIt's not an "awful" game or anything, but pretty disappointing. I'd like to see the same artistic and musical talent in this game put into a more polished product in the future.","August 11, 2014","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It wasn't bad, but it was far from being good. There are a lot of STRETCHING in this game. Calling it a platformer was a stretch, as a good 50 minutes of the 85 it took to beat I spent holding the 'D' key and taking a nap. There were no puzzles, and very few obstacles to keep the gameplay interesting. So Idecided to focus on the other aspects...and was STILL dissapointed. Calling the game surreal is also a stretch. There was one moment about 45 minutes in where it got weird, and I was hoping that it would keep getting stranger. It didn't. Instead, that segment was over in about 5 minutes and it was back to boredom. The story was also really dissapointing. The narrator had a nice voice, but he sounded bored out of his mind. Th story was almost non existent. Guy loses daughter, drinks, goes to find missing man on deserted island, there is another guy there. done. The end has no significance, the drink mechanic has no significance, the art has no significance. The main issue here was a MASSIVE waste of potential. The game was boring and the story was even more boring. That's really all I have to say.","October 28, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Bluth is an alchoholic who cant stop drinking after his daugter dies when an island becomes poluted which is now prohibited to every human and now named the X zone. Bluth loses his wife and becomes addicted to drinking alchochol. One day he gets an assigment to track down a weatlhy man who has disspeared in the x zone. So how is Spate ? Its one of the best game i have played in a while. Now the game is quite simple. Its a 2d platformer with a heavy story element. Now for the pros. The game has an outstanding soundtrack and Amazing Graphics. Gameplay is smooth and alot of fun. Story is great and kinda creepy too. But there is some cons to it as well. The game is incredibly short but there is two endings so you can play through it twice. Some minor bugs. Kinda wonky controls but thats about it. Overall Spate is an amazing game you need to own if you like story driven games. Spate is incredibly fun and Atmospheric game.

Mechanically you can drink it anytime - it applies some Unity filters and makes you jump higher for a couple of seconds.\nThis drinking mechanic is virtually useless - during long walks with bits of narrative it's used 2 times to jump higher - that's it. And in pointless single button flight sections (2 of these) or no less pointless cannon sequences (3 of those) it provides no benefit whatsoever. So I conclude that it was added to make the game more 'artsy' and to tie it to whatever moralizing story this game is thought to tell.\nOverall, I couldn't find anything impressive or interesting in this game.

A lot of colorful backgrounds, eerie symbolisms and a certain amount of intrigue.\n\nHowever, when I got to the end, I frankly expected more than just to complete the game. No boss battle, or some somewhat challenging puzzle to solve? Or more to add to the story?\n\nThe voice acting wasn't enchanting at all. In fact, I kinda wished there was no voice-acting in the game. It felt way too jarring, the way there would be just the background music then suddenly somebody narrating. And there was no cohesion whatsoever to the story.\n\nImagine if the voice acting was done in the same vein as Thomas Was Alone (or even Bastion). The narrator there has a brilliant voice, and it never felt jarring even once. Story was slowly built, and character bond created, via the narration.\n\nThe voice acting/narration in Thomas Was Alone single-handedly made the game so memorable. Or else, it would have remained a freeware game on some free flash website.\n\nIn addition to that, too much time was spent just pointlessly going to the right, dropping down rivers and jumping up stairs. While I agree a game like this should not have too much (and too difficult) precision platforming, there was so much room for better puzzles though.\n\nAnd what was with the cave sections where you fly the ship? Felt completely pointless and out of place.\n\nIn the end, while I say this game is decent, it is not particularly something that has enchanted me as so many indie atmospheric platformers before this (Thomas Was Alone, The Swapper, and even Brothers, which is admittedly not a platformer). I personally did not connect to the character, and the story was lost on me. Gameplay was too sparse.\n\nReally, this is probably the first 2d walking sim I have played.\n\nAs a singular developer, the dev may have been so consumed by his work that the flaws or rather weak-points may have gone unnoticed to him. Or perhaps, I just missed the point of the game.\n\nRegardless, it is a brave try. Artistically, the game looks good, though the dev really needs to work on optimizing the game. Framerate dropped by more than 50% in around 10 scenes in the game, and a further 10 times I got freezes that lasted 5 seconds.\n\nIt is hard to recommend this game, but then again, it would be harsher still to rate it as not recommended". As for the price, maybe yeah I kinda regret getting it on release, but when it goes 50 or 75% off, it should be more palatable for what is offered.","March 29, 2014","true","2.2"," 14 of 66 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","14","66","0","0"

I really do. It would've been amazing. But it fails more than it succeds and good visuals, interesting narrative and occasional excitement fades due to the fact, that the majority of the game is boring, tiring and, sometimes, frustrating.\nIt tries to be an atmospheric cinematic platformer (think Another World, Oddworld or, more recently, LIMBO), but with much less action and much more narrative. And it starts quite well. The beginning feels like an interesting build-up for something great - surreal imagery, unique setting, interesting narration and seemingly solid platforming. But this build-up than starts taking much longer, than you'd want it to. You start expecting things picking up soon, adding some more interesting elements to the gameplay, maybe. And they do, a bit later than they should, but they do. And then you start wishing they'd not.\nA lot of "challenging" parts of the game feel just thrown in without much thought. Here's a section, which would inevitably remind you of Flappy bird nowadays, thrown in for no reason and working at the painfuly slow pace, with checkpoints spaced out unevenly. There's a long jumping on the slides section, which has absolutely no tension, is also very slow, also has weird checkpoints placement and doesn't have any interesting visual or narration things going on either. Here's platforming with buzzsaws, for no particular reason, which don't really fit the aesthetics or the speed of the game. All those sections are just *there*, being not fun to play, nor interesting to look at. And the checkpoints seem to sometimes completely disregard just how long some parts of absolutely *nothing* can take, where you can somehow manage to die right at the end and redo all that nothing again.\nThe snail pace during the simpler narration+platforming segments tends to be less frustrating, just because at least there's narration and some interesting visuals happening. But even there, I feel, a lot of things could've been changed and a lot of things could've been much better and more creative.\nIt is a shame, really, since the game has lots of potential. But I don't see many people not giving up on it after about half an hour, just a third of the game in. And the sad thing is that, they will probably be not missing out much, since apart from a few interesting visual things and flawed but good narration, nothing really changes in the game after that.

I say that about any game where there's really something to be taken away from. I don't want to say that there's a certain quality to these games (there is an inexplicable lasting distinction between just a collaboration of controls and pixels) because then people will think all games that have that lasting appeal will always taste the same, even if that taste is delicious. What I'm trying to say is, there more to just platforming to SPATE.\n\nThe control's a little floaty, and there isn't much flushing out of what's there, but it uses what it can do. Especially the drink. I went through multiple stages of alchohlism playing this.\n\nA variety of what you see doesn't make any sense, that there just ambiguosly talking about falling apart, darkness, madness, assuming we'll just eat it up; that isnt the case. Sure there's some random stuff and I can't retell every event in the game but I remember quite a bit. Moreover, I enjoyed it, even if I don't remember exactly what it was.The graphics and art-style are a bit wierd, you don't think you're playing with real people with Bluth's get-up but you adjust.\n\nThe game can be a bit creepy, and I did put it down for a little bit; not saying much since I'm too spineless to be called an absolute horror game lightweight. It can be beaten in two hours or so, with not much replayablility, or other qualities good "games" (i. e. polished, marketed, well developed titles) nor does it have all the soul in all of fiction combined, but all amounts of soul are equal and worthwhile when not obscenely hindered by the core gameplay. Spate isn't, and it's and enjoyable ride.","June 8, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Through a narrated story we find out the man lost his daughter, his wife left him and he has an absinthe addiction problem. This is where the interesting mechanic comes in - at any point during the game Spate can have a drink of absinthe, affecting his controls, the environment around him and the camera of the game.\nHowever interesting of an idea this is, like the rest of the game it just falls short of being great. With every drink the camera turns "trippy" and slow-motionesque, Spate can jump higher, and the environments often become creepier. But that's it. At any point of the game, that's all you can expect. There are no consequences to how much you drink or no further feedback other than the small visible changes.\nWhile the main story is narrated, the two other characters in the game, plus Spate himself (as in the entirety of the game's dialogue) is left to text without any sort of audial feedback feeling strangly out of place.\n\nThe platforming itself is nothing special - the controls feel rather floaty and slow/sluggish but never really become frustrating or aggrevating - a checkpoint at literally almost every jump helps this. Despite the generous lives, the gameplay mechanics itself lack depth and mechanics. The total of activities you'll do include: jumping, firing a cannon, flying in a ship. That and the absinthe. It just doesn't feel like enough.\n\nSo why is this recommended? Well, at the end of the day I had a good time with Spate. It's story is interesting, it's atmosphere is wonderful - tense, creepy, and "trippy" all at the same time, and the game deals with a topic rarely touched upon by modern games.\nWhile this is a recommendation, and I believe you should most definitely try Spate if you like atmosphere/story heavy games, I simply can't recommend it at full price - there are so many more rewarding, fleshed out, and expansive games available on Steam for $10 with which you can spend hundreds of hours, unlike 60-120 minutes (and that really is max) with Spate.\nSo if it's ever on sale or in a bundle - go ahead and grab it. Despite its shortcoming its easy to tell that the single developer put a lot of heart and effort into the game.","June 20, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But is the game any good? It depends on what you like, If you're just here for the platforming aspect, this may not be for you. Don't get me wrong, he game has fun platforming sections, but it i's more focused on the story and surrealism of your surroundings. The story is intense, and although it might seem a bit confusing, that's part of what the game is trying to do. Overall, depends on the type of gamer you are, but for people like me: It's a not bad game, even if the way the character handles, and menu are clunky.\n\n*Edit*\nSo i've finised playing the game, took me 2 hours, which is on the short side. But I do realize why. By the two hours, the characters are fleshed out, the story has progressed with a beginning, middle and end, and since spate is about the story, couple more hours of platforming which isn't up to polish would get boring real fast. I"m not gonna spoil anything, but the characters end was thought provoking and had emotional wieght to it, which something not all games do well. The story's end though, was extremely confusing. I think it was meant to be something that made us question what was going on alongside the character, was this real life, was this a dream, what was this? Overall, a good game, a bit short, some glitches (nothing game stopping), but great environments (if your computer can handle it), and a intriguing storyline. I would praise this game more, but I feel it could've been polished much more, to make it an even better game.

Little inklings of a story fed to you here and there are never really expanded on just mentioned before the main character reminds you of his melancholy.\n\nPlatforming aspect is as boring as I have ever seen. More often than not you are just mindlessly going forward and jumping with no challenge at all. Logic puzzles are virtually non existant. If you are looking at this game for its platforming qualities, I assure you there are none.\n\nThe only quality here is the artistic background which will briefly break you out of the boredom that this game brings, but not for long.

You play as a depressed detective investigating the dissappearance of a rich business man in the "X Zone", a dreary, mysterious place that is plagued by endless rain and storms. Spate mixes the literal with the surreal to create a distinctive setting that is at once vivid and dream-like.\nThe first and also lasting impression comes from the visuals of Spate, which look very much like something from a stop-motion animation. It is as if the player were looking in at a smaller world through a maginfying glass, only to find it filled with all manner of buildings and landscapes, crafted from wood, cloth, rocks and paint. Not only does the game have a striking style of art, but the actual design is also noteworthy, from a mountain made from a head made of hardened clay, to swerving, curving, striped pillars reminiscent of a Dr.Seus illustration. And all the time, the rain falls, the wind blows, rocks glistening and grass swaying beneath a relentless storm. The end result is the sense  of a dark dream, not a nightmare, but a somber, melancholic world colored by the perceptions of the detective the player plays as. The visuals are beautifully complimented by an atmospheric soundtrack that blurs in and out, a soundscape both musical and representational of the sounds of the world.\nThe story is also an important part of the game, with the detective consistently narrating as the player journeys through the game's environments. The narration also reinforces the mood created by the visuals, of dark brooding and depression. We learn much of the detective, his past, his present and his attitude towards life, and especially of his addiction to drinking absyinthe and the effect this has on his mind. While the narration is effective, it doesn't quite match the stunning beauty of the visuals and audio of the game. I found the detective to sound a bit cliche and repititive. The story and the narration work, but they aren't the highlight of the game, which is unfortunate given that they are strongly focused upon.\nIn terms of gameplay, Spate is a well-executed if not particularly original or challenging platformer. I would definitely recommend using a USB controller as the game plays much better with a D-pad, just like most other platformers. Spate utilizes many classic tropes of the platformer genre, from springs that let you jump higher to ropes that let you swing across holes. It is a physics-based game, which does set is somewhat apart, but by and large the game plays fairly similarly to something like Donkey Kong Country. For someone experienced with the platformer genre, the game is not particularly difficult, yet is nonetheless well-designed and enjoyable. It is perhaps a particularly good game for those approaching the platformer genre for the first time, as it introduces many typical ideas of the genre without assuming the player has already mastered the basic elements of the genre.\nSpate is a wonderous game if only for it`s exemplary visual and audio aesthetics. The story is decent, and the gameplay is fun, but it`s the setting and the presentation of that setting that really take your breath away. Never before have I played a game so willing to embrace surrealistic aesthetics, and with such a captivating art style. The game is rather short (I beat it in a few hours) but this is a case of quality over quantity. If you like an experimental aesthetic approach in videogames, this is definitely a game to try out. If you're looking to get acquainted with the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is also a pretty great pick. If you don't like experiemental aesthetics, or are looking for a long game with lots of challenge, this game isn't for you.","September 8, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it had one, this game would fall firmly under it.\n\nThe game itself is simple.  It is a platformer that has very simple obstacles, and no enemies.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward, with one of the main abilities (drinking) being almost unnecessary for actual gameplay, considering the benefit of it is to make the game look funny and to jump higher - which never really is called for.\n\nThe story is intriguing, if slightly confusing.  The dialogue is stilted and forced at times, but overall isn't too terrible.\nTime-wise, I finished it in an hour and a half roughly.  Not a terrible amount of time, but perhaps a little shorter then I would have cared for.\nAs for visuals - this game is stunning, with dark and surreal backdrops and colourful environments.  It shifts and changes at times, and is probably the best part of the entire game.\n\nThis is one of those games that doesn't have too bad of a price at full retail, but I would wait until the steam sale to acquire unless you really like games that are more like interactive movies rather then actual, full games.","July 30, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is VERY predictable and VERY depressing. Besides the drink element, there was nothing special about this game.

Through a narrated story we find out the man lost his daughter, his wife left him and he has an absinthe addiction problem. This is where the interesting mechanic comes in - at any point during the game Spate can have a drink of absinthe, affecting his controls, the environment around him and the camera of the game.\nHowever interesting of an idea this is, like the rest of the game it just falls short of being great. With every drink the camera turns "trippy" and slow-motionesque, Spate can jump higher, and the environments often become creepier. But that's it. At any point of the game, that's all you can expect. There are no consequences to how much you drink or no further feedback other than the small visible changes.\nWhile the main story is narrated, the two other characters in the game, plus Spate himself (as in the entirety of the game's dialogue) is left to text without any sort of audial feedback feeling strangly out of place.\n\nThe platforming itself is nothing special - the controls feel rather floaty and slow/sluggish but never really become frustrating or aggrevating - a checkpoint at literally almost every jump helps this. Despite the generous lives, the gameplay mechanics itself lack depth and mechanics. The total of activities you'll do include: jumping, firing a cannon, flying in a ship. That and the absinthe. It just doesn't feel like enough.\n\nSo why is this recommended? Well, at the end of the day I had a good time with Spate. It's story is interesting, it's atmosphere is wonderful - tense, creepy, and "trippy" all at the same time, and the game deals with a topic rarely touched upon by modern games.\nWhile this is a recommendation, and I believe you should most definitely try Spate if you like atmosphere/story heavy games, I simply can't recommend it at full price - there are so many more rewarding, fleshed out, and expansive games available on Steam for $10 with which you can spend hundreds of hours, unlike 60-120 minutes (and that really is max) with Spate.\nSo if it's ever on sale or in a bundle - go ahead and grab it. Despite its shortcoming its easy to tell that the single developer put a lot of heart and effort into the game.","June 20, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I say that about any game where there's really something to be taken away from. I don't want to say that there's a certain quality to these games (there is an inexplicable lasting distinction between just a collaboration of controls and pixels) because then people will think all games that have that lasting appeal will always taste the same, even if that taste is delicious. What I'm trying to say is, there more to just platforming to SPATE.\n\nThe control's a little floaty, and there isn't much flushing out of what's there, but it uses what it can do. Especially the drink. I went through multiple stages of alchohlism playing this.\n\nA variety of what you see doesn't make any sense, that there just ambiguosly talking about falling apart, darkness, madness, assuming we'll just eat it up; that isnt the case. Sure there's some random stuff and I can't retell every event in the game but I remember quite a bit. Moreover, I enjoyed it, even if I don't remember exactly what it was.The graphics and art-style are a bit wierd, you don't think you're playing with real people with Bluth's get-up but you adjust.\n\nThe game can be a bit creepy, and I did put it down for a little bit; not saying much since I'm too spineless to be called an absolute horror game lightweight. It can be beaten in two hours or so, with not much replayablility, or other qualities good "games" (i. e. polished, marketed, well developed titles) nor does it have all the soul in all of fiction combined, but all amounts of soul are equal and worthwhile when not obscenely hindered by the core gameplay.

I really do. It would've been amazing. But it fails more than it succeds and good visuals, interesting narrative and occasional excitement fades due to the fact, that the majority of the game is boring, tiring and, sometimes, frustrating.\nIt tries to be an atmospheric cinematic platformer (think Another World, Oddworld or, more recently, LIMBO), but with much less action and much more narrative. And it starts quite well. The beginning feels like an interesting build-up for something great - surreal imagery, unique setting, interesting narration and seemingly solid platforming. But this build-up than starts taking much longer, than you'd want it to. You start expecting things picking up soon, adding some more interesting elements to the gameplay, maybe. And they do, a bit later than they should, but they do. And then you start wishing they'd not.\nA lot of "challenging" parts of the game feel just thrown in without much thought. Here's a section, which would inevitably remind you of Flappy bird nowadays, thrown in for no reason and working at the painfuly slow pace, with checkpoints spaced out unevenly. There's a long jumping on the slides section, which has absolutely no tension, is also very slow, also has weird checkpoints placement and doesn't have any interesting visual or narration things going on either. Here's platforming with buzzsaws, for no particular reason, which don't really fit the aesthetics or the speed of the game. All those sections are just *there*, being not fun to play, nor interesting to look at. And the checkpoints seem to sometimes completely disregard just how long some parts of absolutely *nothing* can take, where you can somehow manage to die right at the end and redo all that nothing again.\nThe snail pace during the simpler narration+platforming segments tends to be less frustrating, just because at least there's narration and some interesting visuals happening. But even there, I feel, a lot of things could've been changed and a lot of things could've been much better and more creative.\nIt is a shame, really, since the game has lots of potential. But I don't see many people not giving up on it after about half an hour, just a third of the game in. And the sad thing is that, they will probably be not missing out much, since apart from a few interesting visual things and flawed but good narration, nothing really changes in the game after that. I do hope, though, that people who worked on this game will continue and maybe next time they will create something much better.","June 3, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It had such a great atmosphere and story to it that I ended up completing the game in one sitting.  The controls were tight, art style is amazing, and if you enjoy platformer games, I totally recommend this one.\n\nI did record my playthrough for a Youtube Let's Play Series if you wanted a closer look... if you like what you see either here on Steam, or in my video(s), please support this developer and purchase this wonderful game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZfUXz6Sxm8&list=PLMJ5plmKMJtYLRBICuvxAPDqg0qT9QoS0","December 3, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keksos/recommended/269810/","keksos","Keksos der Grosse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keksos/","200 products in account","Spate a wonderful game with heavy emphasis on music, narrative and an overall style I can hardly describe. It is surreal, strangely enveloping and brings all the colors and illusions you always wanted to experience for yourself unless you can't get rid of them. Combine with slow-to-come platforming were, apparently, alcohol makes you faster and jump higher, you get truly awe-inducing game. Not to mention the art style and visuals - I often felt as if Machinarium had married The City of Lost Children along with bits from Fantastic Mr. Fox' 2.5D perspective.\n\nThus, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's perfect for those times when you feel like there's nothing in life but numbing away from your pain. And then it surprises you with something so otherwordly that you simply have to change your perspective.","February 23","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kind of a odd contradiction in itself, theres a bit of good and a bit of bad. The narative is kind of fun to watch as it plays out alabiet it feels a bit flat. It's short but each level seems like it's drawn out longer. There are some interesting platforming sections, but some of the jumps outside of those sections feel like they're there to engage the player. In some sections it feels like there are some moments that are really able to draw you in, but others just kind of remind me that I'm playing a game. The main character feels resonably fleshed out, but it's as if there missing sections that I can't understand. There are creative monsters that give you a conversation, but never apear again. At the end of the day this is a fun game that is worth a look see because of the price. There seems like there could be multiple endings outside of a mere choice but I'll update if thats the case.","February 25","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game tries and fails to do this, with the narrator either re-stating things that had just happened, or saying "my wife and kid died and it made me sad because I drank a bunch of absinthe" for the hundredth time. Also, making a surrealist work that literally has somebody say "boy that sure was weird" every-time something out of the ordinary happens is a ♥♥♥♥ing sin. Some really nice visual effects and setpices don't make up for the horrible platforming, floaty controls, and a story that sounds like it was written in a day.\n\nAlso absinthe doesn't cause hallucinations you chuckle♥♥♥♥s.","June 23, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The nature of the game, and the overall story is really surreal, and distorted. Spate is a side scrolling story telling game where you pretty much do nothing except scroll to the side and listen to the history of the character you play.\nI was really impressed by Spate. The story is outstanding, the voice acting deserves an award, and the visuals altogether are brilliant.\n\nEven though this game only lasted 2 hours I can honestly say this was an experience like no other. I was fascinated by this game. It's not usually a game I would buy, but this has made me consider buying more side scrolling story telling games.\n\nSpate tells the story of an alcoholic detective who cannot get over the loss of his daughter, and collapse of his marriage. When he gets a contract to look for a missing business man on the same Island his daughter went missing the story begins to unravel...\n\nThis game leaves you with two endings. It leaves you with a choice. Which one will you decide?\n","April 9","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
