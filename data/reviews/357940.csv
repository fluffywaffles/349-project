If you have played Fire Emblem, you can consider this a PC tribute to the series that is well executed and has extra features too. If you haven't played Fire Emblem, here are the basic selling points:\n\n- It is a turn based strategy RPG\n- Combat is tricky. You will need to think out your moves. If you are too reckless, you'll lose characters and suffer later on.\n- Your warband evolves with you throughout the game, from battle to battle. Each unit has their own abilities and they will level up through combat to grow stronger, earn new abilities and spells, and eventually evolve into elite units. However, if they die... they're gone for good, which can lead to tricky decision making. (You can play on casual mode to disable permadeath)\n- Each battle will have several things drawing you off to explore - distant treasure chests, neutral units to talk to and recruit, potential allies to save, items to loot etc.\n- You can interact with the environment. Characters can smash down doors, or learn abilities to lay traps, push, pull enemies etc.\n- There is an ongoing storyline between battles and your actions in battle can influence future events (like whether or not you saved a character will affect whether they join you after the battle, and they may be able to have special interactions later).\n\nONE BIG POINT: The graphics interface looks quite quaint and basic, but don't let this turn you off. There is fun to be had and more functionality than it suggests. Have fun!","April 16, 2015","true","4.6"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","55","62","0","1"

You move your squad through the map, defeating enemies along the way and reaching the objective. It plays a bit like chess in that you need to protect certain units that can die extremely easily. Even the tanky units die in a few hits so you need to make walls or use terrain to avoid ways in which the enemy can hit you. Most of the difficulty comes from the fact that units die forever if they are killing in battle but you can play on easy mode without permadeath.\n\nTelepath Tactics takes advantages of a lot of the small but interesting mechanics in Fire Emblem and expands on some of them, for example: being able to talk to enemies and neutral characters to convert them to your side during battle and destroying/pushing/pulling environmental objects strategically.\n\nIt also adds a lot of different skills and abilities - magic users have a variety of spells and healing while regular units can have skills such as sprint or motivate. There are also some interesting items (so far I bought the grappling hook, which lets you pull enemies towards you). Overall it feels like a game made with a lot of love and a lot of different things to explore.\n\nObviously the main issue is the graphics, as especially the UI looks pretty ugly. To be honest the in-game maps aren't that bad and the portraits grow on you after a while.","April 17, 2015","true","39.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

What I loved about those games is that you had to play smart. Telepath Tactics captures that in oodles. This isn't a game you can run into willy-nilly and win. You must carefully command your troops across the battlefield. Using their unique abilites, strengths, weaknesses. All the while countering the enemies movements. With plenty of classes, abilities, and environmental hazards. Telepath Tactics brings plenty to the table. The combat itself is based on positioning and stat based damage. Keenly placing units to flank enemies and do devastating damage is required to win this game. Sadly Telepath Tactics is a very unappealing looking game. The terrain is flat and lifeless, the pixel characters lack personality. The combat animations are underwhelming. The only good thing about the art style are the Fire Emblem-esque avatars. While this isn't necessarily anything to break the game. The battles can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. It would've been nice to have had something pleasant to look at. Also a save and quit feature would've been great too. The game for the most part is designed well. With minor bugs that don't really affect gameplay all too much. With the map editor you've got plenty of replay value. If you find yourself really enjoying the game and want to get more out of it. In all the game is a great homage to TRPG's and Fire Emblem.\nIf you don't mind the graphics and are looking for a deep strategy game. Telepath Tactics is a good choice.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/oocjjnxMdRQ\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 7, 2015","true","2.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

I remember playing Telepath RPG via the Armor Games site years ago, and even then I really liked the originality of the setting and the tactical feel of the combat. Fast forward to this game, and I am really impressed with what the author has done. This game feels very polished and fluid. The world is well-concieved and enjoyable to be a part of. The portraits/graphics are great (for a lower budget indie game), the music is also stellar as well, but what really stands out is the strategy and tactics! It also reminds me a lot of Battle for Wesnoth more so than SSB, but to each their own.","April 16, 2015","true","38.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

This game handles both elements very well and it's a testament to its strategic depth that, for once, I can honestly say that the combat is more engrossing than the plot (even though said plot is humorous and well written). I was very sceptical at first due to the recent FLOOD of indie rubbish and that the screenshots don't exactly make you want to rush to buy. Don't be put off by the graphics, the gameplay is SO good that it renders them irrelevant.\n\nIf you only buy one indie game this year then I would strongly suggest it be this one.\n\n*edit* It can be unforgiving too.

I bought Telepath Tactics through early access, and I have to admit, I’d never played a strategy RPG before so I got killed at first. A lot. But a friend of mine had persuaded me to check it out on his computer, and, after my initial rough start, I got totally hooked. I love trying to figure out the best strategy in a battle, given the huge number of variables: number of characters, number of enemies, types of enemies, terrain, environmental obstacles, the huge range of abilities my characters have. It can be overwhelming at first, but it’s so much more fun! Now, even if I get killed (and I usually do the first time I try a battle), I’m that much more psyched to try again. The environmental interactions are great, too. They open up a whole new range of strategies you can employ, not to mention, throwing enemies off cliffs if deeply satisfying. I think the characters are really cute, too, and the story keeps me wanting to know what happens next. It’s also nice to see a game with a large contingent of female characters for once – especially main characters! I'm almost finished with the single player campaign on my early access copy, so I'm starting over on Steeam so I can play on all my computers. Now, to figure out how make mods … :)","April 16, 2015","true","12.7"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","29","46","2","0"

Be warned that the battles in this game are tough! Carfeul thought and planning are required to defeat your enemies, not blindly charging in. I also like the fact that they include a casual mode where characters defeated on the battle map are not permanently dead. This removes the frustration of repeating levels to ensure that all your characters survive.\n\nI really like the artstyle of this game. Don't let the simple graphics fool you, there is quite a lot of charm and detail to the characters, especially when attacking. If you are a fan of Fire Emblem, as I am, then this is defintely worth the purchase.\n\nIf there is one thing that annoyed me somewhat - though this is an entirely personal preference issue - it's that you get rushed from one battle to the next. I like the pacing of Fire Emblem games more, where you have a chance to catch your breath, equip and talk to your party members between battles. So far, I've only come across two instances where that happens. Then again, this is most probably a design choice by the developers.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent battle system that rewards thought and planning.\n+ Levels that are tough but fair. A good plan will see you through.\n+ Very nice graphics and art style.\n+ Good story so far.\n+ All this in merely 200 MB, which is fantastic!\n\nCons:\n- Some slowdowns on larger battlefields with lots of effects.\n- No saving. The game automatically saves between battles. If the battle ends with a victory, but you're not satisfied, you can't go back and replay it (I think).\n\n","April 18, 2015","true","8.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I am sure there will be more to come.\n\nThere's a map editor in which you can make your own battles/MP maps/Campaign (I believe). You can download more campaigns at the main forum (http://sinisterdesign.net/forum/index.php). I only saw one small one (5 battles), but I haven't really explored it yet, as I came to write this after finishing.\n\nI haven't tried MP yet, and I do not see how to access it from the main menu. I didn't buy it for that, so we'll see about it later.\n\nSo, the game is fantastic; I truly enjoyed it. I didn't think the final battle was the final battle though, as the story alludes to a more sinister design, but I'll leave that be, as to not spoil it (also, in that battle, you get some items that can't be equipped on any unit you own, so I figured that there might be class promotions or something). *Edit* - Apparently units automatically promote @ lvl 20, I never used cavaliers much, as they are weak-as-hell, so the items I had gotten couldn't be equipped on them, due to them not being 'Mantis Knights' or what-not (figured this is good info for anyone looking to play, the auto-classing).\n\nThere are quite a few bugs, nothing game breaking, some can be a bit frustrating. I'd advise restarting the game every few battles, or after a really large one (takes like 20 seconds). That seemed to help a lot for me. I don't mind the bugs so much considering this was pretty-much-wholly made by one guy (Mr. Stern - cool cat). I've played his previous games and they are all very solid.\n*Edit* - Most of the bugs have been patched, the Dev is still working on the memory leak issue, and some exploits have also been patched, but you can look on the forums to learn how to change them back.\n\nIf you like Turn-based tactical combat, SRPGs, and/or indie devs I would highly recommend it. The Dev is active and loves this style of game which is very apparent when you first start.\n\nAlso, skip the 'tutorial' - you have to go through it on the main campaign anyway, so it is a waste of time. =D","April 22, 2015","true","24.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","7"

Telepath Tactics is a game that walks this line perfectly, by offering a casual mode that will revive your fallen after combat with a reduced health total. As someone who put over 600 hours into the GBA version of Final Fantasy Tactics, as well as smashing my fair share of Fire Emblem games I was certain this game would be a cakewalk. This is simply not the case. Your strategy most be on point. It’s important to take advantage of flanking and backstabs for your melee fighters, as well as using higher terrain to power up your archer’s attacks. Find that a characters is a bit out of range? Use a skill or spell to push/pull them to a more convenient position. It takes a conventional formula and seems determined to improve upon it. Will it push its way to the top? Or will flaws pull it into obscurity? Let’s find out as we take a deeper look at Telepath Tactics.\n\nThere are skirmish battles which can be set up, but the true glory of Telepath Tactics lies in the campaign mode. The story starts out in a fairly generic fashion, with two girls escaping from a slaver camp to find their father. Along the way, many interesting characters will join your force and before long you will be mixing and matching your favorite classes to decimate your foes in the manner of your choice. Combat is extremely gratifying, and victory or decimation is almost always based on your tactical wits. You will often recruit new members from cutscenes, or by talking to allied troops during a battle. These extra reinforcements are great for filling in the gaps that might be left by people lost via permadeath, which is how I chose to play. Far more characters were recruited than died in my play of the campaign, but I can imagine the situation becoming quickly sticky for a novice player left with nothing but revived, weakened heroes. There is a level up system as well which can make your main fighting force an absolute wrecking ball, but newer recruits and heroes that manage to die enough on casual mode will eventually be left in the dust.\n\nThe music is another pointedly enjoyable factor of this game. The pulsing beat of a battle march captures the pounding of my heart as I sit for 10 minutes deciding how my next move will lead into the one after, and what my enemy might do to thwart me. Some campaigns have a different objective than simply slaying your opponent. From rescue missions to capture the flag, Telepath Tactics offers an array of ideas into a genre that is generally pretty straightforward. Telepath Tactics also has the ability to create and share custom campaigns, so the possibilities are as endless as you care to make them. User-created content is one of the most exciting advances in this new generation of content, and although the game only features local hotseat multiplayer currently, you can still smash your overseas friends’ egos by creating the most sadistic map possible and challenging them to complete it. I feel I should mention you can do much more than just shove people into water. You can freeze the water to create a path, blow up terrain, and even build your own bridges! The possibilities are amazing, and even if I don’t find the graphics particularly enjoyable, I think the game itself has more than passed my expectations.\n\nTelepath Tactics isn’t without its flaws. The controls don’t seem extremely intuitive, the graphics displease me, and as everyone knows: local hotseat multiplayer is only for people with friends outside the internet. I also found the sound FX a bit repetitive after a long battle, there is no voiceover work and LOTS of text, and while the spellcasting sounds aren’t great, the score is slightly redeemed by things like the golem punches, which are actually quite impressive. Overall Telepath Tactics is an extremely fun and deep game with a campaign that is sure to pull you in with its lore, and gameplay that will keep you coming back for more. Kickstarter seems to have a better track record that Greenlight for allowing new developers to flourish. I am pleased to say $15 is a bargain for this game. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay here for slightly more than the cost of a movie ticket. With online multiplayer and a big of graphical polishing, I think these developers are headed for something huge. Thanks so much to Sinister Design for letting IGB put this beauty through its paces. We hope to see more soon!\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 6/10\nFun Factor- 8/10\nDifficulty- 7/10\nReplayability- 8/10\nInnovation- 6/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 3/10\nMusic- 7/10\nSound FX- 5/10\nStory/Lore- 8/10\nLevel Design- 9/10\n\nFinal Score: 67/100 for fun factor, replayability, and level design.\nVerdict: This game is a must buy for fantasy turn-based strategy fans.\nSummary: A great turn-based RPG where the environment is key to strategy. Absolute gobs of replayability as well as a ton of interesting lore.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-telepath-tactics/\nFull video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YQeSk4gKhE","April 26, 2015","true","6.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I can't tell if it's a bug or not but there seem to be features missing (there's talk of classes being promoted to prestige classes and a number of weapons that can only be used by these expert classes but I never came across a way to actually promote my soldiers. Maybe I just missed it, but the general bugginess of the game makes me suspicious some script just didn't trigger). And my final gripe is that there is no workshop support so downloading custom campaigns is a pain (not that there are many available as of 4/25/2015 on the developer's website).\n\nSo...why do I recommend you buy it if I have so many complaints? First, it's an indy game made *nearly* entirely by one guy. Some slack is cut for that. But more importantly because the game is FUN. The creator really understands strategy and it is legitimately difficult and entertaining in a way I haven't felt since I played Fire Emblem. I love that the different classes actually have powers which dramatically affect strategy options like Engineers which can build barricades (Fire Emblem should take note!)--leveling up your little soldiers is very fun and the fact that they usually have personalities and a role in the plot is great too. You don't notice the hours going past because making the many little strategy decisions in evolving battels is so engaging. Basically, if you want to scratch that tactical RPG itch this is for sure your game. I was sad when the main campaign ended and given the riduculous backlog of games I still need to play it should tell you something when I say I played this and only this for several days straight. The story was charming. Not amazing, but I enjoyed it. Oh, and the music was pretty good.\n\nIn sum, you should pick it up! I don't regret my purchase. Once some of the...bugs get squashed and some costum campaigns appear (awkwardly on a random forum page? Which I don't have time to visit regularly? Workshop support please...) then I look forward to returning to Telepath Tactics again.","April 25, 2015","true","50.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

That said there are a lot of missed opportunities like the lack of online multiplayer, even an email multiplayer system, that works well in turn based games like chess, would have made this a much more enjoyable experience. Online multiplayer is the most obvious useful feature in turn based tactics/strategy games & its absence is keenly felt. Additionally I'd have liked to have a free roam system across a world map with random encounters but we can't have everything.\n\nWhat is here is a decently written & lengthy campaign that very much reminds me of fire emblem even if the characters all felt a bit samey particularly in their speech paterns. The game is very challenging but more in the vein of a complex puzzle that semi randomly rearranges itself. Trying to keep all your characters alive in normal mode greatly increases the length of the game & adds to the fun. The developer has chosen to eschew the element of chance found in most similar games in favor of fixed damage dealt & attack chances rarely straying from all but certain hits.; this makes the game more deterministic which is something some will like & some will hate. The potential to change this exists with a robust system of modding which is the key feature of the game with the potential to relatively easily mod in your own classes, maps & campaigns which is very exciting. Steam workshop isn't currently added & we all hope it will be soon.\n\nThere are plenty of bugs the most painful of which being massive slow downs as a long battle progresses & another which involved a slain prison guard not dropping his keys on his death if you choose to attack rather than make a grab for the keys.\n\nOverall I very much enjoyed Telepath Tactics & while it has some obvious flaws it is very much the best game I've played in quite some time. If you love Fire Emblem, Xcom or just about any other game with tactics in its name then you'll love Telepath Tactics. If you haven't played those games, go buy them & become addicted to sRPG's & turn based tactics/strategy for the rest of your days.

I haven't played any multiplayer games, nor modded it at all, so I won't be reviewing those aspects of the game.\n\nSummary:\n\nTelepath Tactics is a strategic turn-based RPG, with many ways to complete each mission. The game has no random chances* (e.g. critical hits, varying damage/damage reduction), and so the only unknown variable in the game is pure strategy. With a variety of different classes, weapons, armour, and items, you have to out-think, and out-fight the enemy AI. Once you learn more about the AI through fighting them, you can start building new strategies to combat the AI more effectively. But the enemies get more tricks up their sleeve as they go, so it's up to you to do your best and keep your troops alive and fighting effectively through superior and adaptive strategy.\n\n*Technically there is one random element; psy attacks have a 50% chance of inflicting their respective status effect (see below)\n\nPros:\n\n+ Through the varying classes, equipment, and items, almost any strategy you can think of is possible to defeat the enemy:\n· Destroying bridges, or making your own bridges, or barricades to direct the enemy to where you want them to go\n· Weapons of varying lengths/ranges allowing multiple characters to attack the same enemy from a line formation\n· Psy abilities causing varying statuses (50% chance of effect) based on their element (as well as their base damage) (Light = Blindness, Dark = Softness/Slowness, Ice = Freeze, Fire = Burning) which can be taken advantage of to great effect if planned well.\n· Creating a completely defensive position with healers and ranged units protected by strong melee units in front or surrounding them.\n· Using flying characters and/or high mobility characters, you can rush the enemy and try to defeat small groups before they have a chance to gather against you.\n· Using Emma Strider's Motivate or Inspire abilities grants other units a second turn, which can be, and usually is one of the best abilities in the game, allowing for many more strategic capabilities.\n· And so much more can be accomplished with what's available to you.\n\n+ The campaign's story is straightforward and quick to the point, and is much more down-to-Earth than most game's stories (where the starting characters discover some inner hidden talent and end up being key to the world's survival against hordes of enemies in an endless war). This story is simply about two sisters escaping from the slaving Shadowlings, and trying to return one day to save their father from captivity.\n\n+ The music is very nice, with Classical and Medieval tunes to fit the game very well.\n\n+ Lots of replayability; if the mission didn't turn out the way you would have liked, you can restart, and try out other strategies and see what works. And once you've learned more about the AI, you might decide to start another new campaign and see how much better you'll do now.\n\n+ The Sinister Design forums for the game ( http://sinisterdesign.net/forum/index.php?board=35.0 ) allow you to interact closely with the game's development, to report bugs, and suggestions which all get looked over closely and/or implemented if they look good.\n\nNeutral points:\n= The art of the character portraits is hit-and-miss; some are done fairly well, but for some (e.g. the golems, the art looks very messy)\n= A number of small (and some not so small) bugs. However, the creator, Craig Stern keeps close tabs with his forums and address and fixes all bugs and issues very quickly.\n= No in-mission saves; the only saves are just before events and missions. While not good or bad in of itself, it should still be noted. I believe the game is best like this, otherwise a player could save and reload once they know what will happen.\n= There is no wandering in towns, or random encounters. The game simply goes from mission to event to mission.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some persistent bugs, such as an equipment-swapping bug, and animation slow-downs over long missions can cause some inconvenience.\n- Sometimes a bug may cause your game to crash, losing your progress of the mission. It's not the end of the world if it happens though, just press 'L' to produce a log, and make a bug report on the steam forums or the Sinister Design forums, and Craig will fix it as soon as possible.\n- The fact that there are no in-mission saves means that if the game crashes, or you decide a mission is taking too long and you want to finish it another day, you aren't able to keep that mission's progress.\n\n**Overall I would currently rate this game a 9/10**\n\nWhile this game does have some kinks to work out, Telepath Tactics is an exciting, mentally-challenging constant struggle against the AI. I personally love how this game has turned out and how unique it is, in that all damage is static.\n\nFor people who don't like a tough challenge but still like the game's concept, the Casual difficulty is strongly recommended, where killed characters don't die permanently, but lose some permanent maximum health instead.\n\nFor those who like a good challenge, and who like to think tactically and outsmart their opponent in various cunning ways- this game is definitely for you.\n\n~Thaecrasis\n","May 21, 2015","true","56.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For starters, every sprite looks the same (this makes it hard to talk and befriend a former enemy because they look the same as all the other archers/fighters/etc unless you right click on everyone to see their name/stats) which leads to confusion, the game gets incredibly slow at times...I'm talking you see every single frame--It's not object limit--it's probably memory leaks or something because the more enemies I took out the slower the game became. The explanations of the skills in the game are kind of poor, it would be nice if it would tell you if you still get an extra turn or not afterwards (pushing/pulling takes a full turn but casting 'sprint' or building barracks doesn't).  As far as I could tell, it doesn't show what the attack range is for enemies just where they can move.  The "instant" setting for enemies moving isn't really instant, it's just a faster version of them moving.  If you surrender you have to read the dialogue all over again (a retry would probably be better where you just start with where you position your units).  I think if a lot of these problems were cleared it would be worth playing (the memory leak slows especially), but I can't recommend this to anyone who likes these types of games.","April 21, 2015","false","14.7"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","19","32","0","1"

If you are a tactics fan, I absolutely recommend this game 100%.\n\nTelepath Tactics improves on Fire Emblem in one very important way: tactics. Where the gameplay loop of FE consists entirely drawing individual enemy units toward friendlies who are strong against them and staying prepared for the occasional ambush, Telepath Tactics employs a host of mechanics that precludes simple gameplay.\nThe AI is much better\nMany enemies are aggressive and will actively pursue and attack your party members\nDestructible / constructable terrain elements\nMany levels contain a "base" that, if destroyed, results in a loss; this encourages more complex tactical thinking\nTime-sensitive events, such as recruitable NPCs that will be killed by the enemy if you don't act fastAnother area in which this game excels is the music. It's actually very, very good. I'm quite impressed given that this is a one-man, low-budget effort.\n\nThat being said, the one thing this game does not excel in is the visuals. They're perfectly fine for a $15 indie release, but it stands out in that it's the one thing about this game that doesn't exceed expectations in every way.\n\nThis is a very fun and challenging game.

Great 2D art. It's clean, well animated, and beautifully colored. Again, very close to its FE roots. Some people might compare it to RPGmaker, but they'd be dead wrong. The art direction could use a bit of help on the intro screen, but overall, it's crisp and pleasing to the eye when playing\n\n2. Tactical Depth. If you haven't read his take on RNG vs. deterministic play then check out his blog. Regardless, this is a game that punishes bad tactics, has RNG elements in the right places, and gives you the tools to beat levels in different play styles.\n\n3. Great encounter design with varied maps. From my understanding, there are a variety of maps that are procedurally (sp?) generated, but most are hand crafted encounters. and it's easy to tell. The difficulty is ramped up as you find yourself normally outnumbered, so positioning, movement, and tactics are key to try and beat the enemy\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. No in-game save. The battles are tough and long and having this missing is the biggest weakness of the game. My understanding is that the dev is working on it, but it's still a big eyesore in an otherwise nice gem.\n\n\nOverall, I'd recommend anyone who is a fan of Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, or X-Com to pick this up. If the lack of in-game save is an issue with you, then I'd still pick it up but would shelve it for a month or two.

I was super excited leading up to its release. The game is basically a PC Fire Emblem, with features (for better or worse) from that series like weapon durability and unique characters with perma-death.\n\nThe thing that led me to trying Telepath Tactics was the trailer that showed a lot of pushing and pulling enemy units around and also building features like traps and bridges. All of those things are, in fact, really neat! I have waited a long time for a good grid based game with knocking enemies around like fourth edition dungeons and dragons.\n\nThe battles themselves have an impressive degree of tactics and strategy to them. One major difference between Fire Emblem and Telepath Tactics is there is no weapon triangle rock-paper-scissors mechanic where one attack type beats another. On one hand, this makes it so you don't get the instantaneous little thrill of easily dispatching an enemy because you "did the right thing". On the other, it makes you look a bit deeper for the tactics you have to use to win each battle.\n\nBattles are largely won through zoning and facing.  You lead a quite large force into each battle. The game has facing rules with backstab damage so the large amount of units are very helpful to cover the backside of your troops. It is important to figure out exactly where each enemy can move to and attack and plan accordingly. Thankfully, you can highlight each enemy's movement range and closing with enemies is generally done by staying just out of reach. You will want to limit your exposure to enemies and can do with by guarding your backside with other units, luring enemies into traps to cancel their actions (very satisfying), tactical withdrawals and front line cycling which you can pretty much  ignore in other tactics games, bumping enemies into lakes or off ledges so they are no longer a problem, etc.\n\nAlso, battles are largely deterministic. There are no critical hits, as far as I can tell. And there are no misses on regular attacks. So you will never get screwed over by dice rolls where an enemy crits you out of nowhere and perma-kills a party member or you whiff all your attacks and get steamrolled because luck wasn't on your side. Special moves that are super far range have a chance to miss and certain status afflictions that are bonuses to attacks can also miss. I like this a lot. It makes me feel like my choices matter a whole lot more.\n\nThis description might sound a little bland but I assure you the combat is involving, mostly because the rules for it are so well thought out and balanced. Each encounter feels like a little puzzle. As you click your units around, you will start to notice opportunities for moving in really precise ways and absolutely maximizing the actions of your units. Setting up escape routes, shuffling people around in ways that get you extra backstabs, etc. There are a lot of advantageous circumstances that will arise constantly from the rules and they feel real satisfying to exploit.\n\nNow for the flaws.\n\nSome bugs, mostly performance issues. The developer is actually real good at fixing these so they are less of a problem now.\n\nThe game can be brutally unforgiving on regular difficulty. One small oversight will cause you to permenantly lose a character and by "permanently lose a character", I mean "loudly curse and restart the battle because there is no way in hell you are going to lose that character." The theory behind perma-death in these games is that it should make every battle feel high stakes. Instead, it makes every battle feel rage inducing.\n\nThe reason why this is so frustrating is because many of the battles can be utterly massive in scale and take about an hour to play through. There are no interim saves. No. Interim. Saves, So when you lose your one and only healer on the home stretch of a map you have just lost a huge amount of time you have invested. Not like 5-1o minutes. Like 50 minutes. Do this a couple of times and you will ragequit and put the game away for a few days before coming back to it.\n\nI honestly don't know what would fix this problem or make it more fun for me. Perma-death is a pretty ingrained part of the game's design and everything is balanced around it.\n\nThere is a Casual difficulty where if characters die you get them back after the battle but the game isnt balanced for it at all. I mean, it is pretty easy to win each battle, it can just be difficult to do it without losing a character or completing the bonus objectives like getting far off treasure chests. So this kind of feels like cheating and doesn't feel terribly rewarding because you are prettymuch going to win every map with it.\n\nI am going to tenatively recommend this game and see if my opinion changes over time.","May 13, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Manage a roster of units through a campaign of battles, each of which can take over an hour of game time.  Death is permanent and saving during  combat is not allowed, and the AI punishes any units you expose, so it's challenging.  The developer also goes the extra mile to support the game, releasing constant patches and improvements to game balance.  Definitely worth playing if you're in for a challenge rather than fancy graphics.","May 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackfangx/recommended/357940/","Blackfangx","Blackfangx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackfangx/","115 products in account","I'm just going to come out and say it; I love this type of game and keel-haul it all it's nice to discover one in this extremely niche genre. If you're like me, there's a good chance you'll buy this game just because there's so little variety on the market. Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, FFT...this game pays homage and stays true to what we cherish in those games.\n\nSo why the not recommended? Well, because I believe that just because you find an miracle oasis in the desert, you shouldn't neglect to put up a sign warning other travelers that there's Ebola in the water. Here's three points that I think you, the reader, will need to come to terms with before this is worth buying. Beware, there are light spoilers, but it's mostly things you'll discover in the first fifteen minutes of play.\n\n\n\n1) This does not have a lot of difficulty, and it will get increasingly easier as you go along.\nAt first, I did not think this was going to be an issue. I really didn't. This game starts off pretty solid, with not a 'lot' of difficulty, but enough that it keeps you on your toes while teaching you the ropes. The problem that began to happen though, was that as my army grew, the opposing army lost a major part of it's bite. Knocking people into the water with shove was hella cool at first, but it became downright overpowered fairly quickly. Making roadblocks and creating ice paths was awesome, but again quickly threw the game's balance out of whack. Healing is quick and spammable; a well-maintenenced army isn't going to go down under normal circumstances. The enemy WILL get you by cheaply shoving you off a cliff though.\n\nMost fights are going to become obstacle control fights; it's less about your gear and level, and more about shoving and bottling hallways so your mages can aoe the living hell out of them. This is really fun sometimes, but you as the reader need to understand that your army's going to be either a snail's pace fortress, or you're restarting when your cute archer 5 panels away gets kinectly shoved off a cliff for an auto-kill. Speaking of cute archers, here's the second glaring issue...\n\n2) 90% of your army is female, and the 10% that are male will suffocate from the estrogen in the air.\nYou're laughing now reader, but I'm dead serious. There is so many f'ing girls in my army, I'm almost certain that the girls on the isles are genetically born to battle.  The main character, Emma, is a stereotypical 'I'm an independant (non-black) woman who needs no man', and is like a crude, not-cute version of Xena, Warrior Princess..that's a lesbian. Her (female) sister accompanies her as she travels the isles, making Team Rocket-level traps and pitfalls. Along for the merry ride is; A   (female) archer, a (female) lumberjack, a (female) cleric, a (female)crossbow(wo)man, a (female) knight, a (female) demon, a (female) mage, a (female) engineer, a (female) shadowling, a (female) mage, a (female) lancer, a (female) lizard, and many, many more (females)! Also starring for literally one scene, one male scummy thief, and one male mage.\n\nI asked the female mantis knight about her mantis, and how long she had known him; she got snippy at me for assuming only male mantis can be armored harbingers of war. Remember that folks, female mantis can be knights too.\n\n3) This is honestly a minor thing, but Yawah help me if I can't pick between my units. You obviously can't bring half your army into battle, but I've never had so much trouble picking units before. In tactics ogre, I have trouble deciding between subbing one or two, but here it's like I'm benching half the units I 'want' to use, but can't. Emma and her sister have to be there, and that's two of the same generic warrior class. Hell, I'd rather take Team Rocket girl over Emma, at least badly-hidden traps are a fun mechanic to watch ppl fall into. You're bringing an archer-unless you enjoy being one shot by a pyromancer. A cleric has to be there, and they're basically a healbot. Then there's one or two push-pullers...and now you have your army basically set.\n\nBut wait!; There is so many cool classes out there. The issue that shows up is how outclassed they are, or that there is never enough room. I love my lumberjack girl, but I'm gimping myself if I bring her over a lizard...who already I don't have room for. I like my bow archer, but I'm not going to deny I get way better mileage out of my crossbow user. And Ms. Mantis is only around cause she's riding a F'ING MANTIS, she's outclassed in every regard by my robot...\n\n\nSo there you have it. Those are the three things that going into this game, you need to accept and embrace. Is this game fun? Yes, yes it can really be a blast. But these things hold it back, and can repel you from really getting into it. If these don't bother you, buy it. If they do...watch a let's play first and see. Especially if the second one bothers you, because I'll admit the story and mob of females really drive me off of really getting immersed. But even then...there is something oh so satisfying about pushing that heavy knight of a cliff with psyenergy.

Imagine when you buy all your hard earned gear, save your game and reload to find that all your gear has dissapeared or replaced with something you dont need!  This happened to me after beating about 6 stages.  Besides that horrible bug,  there is also an issue that you only have acess to a shop once every few stages and once you exit a shop you cannot go back.  This makes it very difficult to gear and plan for upcoming fights.  The worst part in my opinion is that the battlefield is litterally littered with chests.  But in order to get them you are seriously inconvenienced, such as wasting rounds on a map that is timed,  getting beat on until you get the item because if all enemies die you leave the map,  Sometimes that does not even work due to the stage ending abruptly for various reasons.","April 30, 2015","false","15.9"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","1"

Otherwise i recommend giving it a miss.\n\nI'd have loved for this to be a recommendation, and i had even helped kickstart the game.
