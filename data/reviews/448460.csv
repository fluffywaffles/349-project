Civilians spawn with nothing and the main goal is to collect stars and help the sheriff find the killers.Civilians can pick up weapons to help the sheriff. Killers are disguised to look just like everyone else (unless you purchased one of the skins in game then their appearence will change once pulling out weapon) and is armed with a knife or any weapons youve gained through the game (same for sheriff and civilian) and their main goal is to kill all of the players befoe the time goes out (best to go for sheriff first because thats one less shoota with a shoota). Well lets get to the pros and cons\n\nPROS:\n~ very easy to run (even with very cheap computers)\n~ is alot of fun even though it is in very early access\n~ has a great concept to it\n~ gives an adrenaline rush when trying to run or fight the killer\n~ combat system makes it to where its not too easy for anyone to get the kill (unless you play alot)\n~ a very nice community\n~ lobbies fill fast\n~ much more to come\n~ the cartoonish player designs are very fun and not glitchy at all for me\n~ easy to level up and get coins for items in shops\n~ everything is very easily attainable and no pay to win features (YET)\n~ playing with a few friends very much enhances your experience\n~ cause alot of paranoia knowing that any one around you can take your life at any given moment\n\nCONS:\n~ alot of glitchy areas where people can walk of edge of something and hide in a glitch\n~ no actual servers just a random setup so you can be paired with a lobby of russians (not racist just it gets annoying being surrounded by another language so it doesnt help you at all because you cant communicate)\n~ frequent crashes\n~ things from shop come in packs  EXAMPLE: purchasing a freddy krueger costume can only be used a certain number of times so you haave to keep repurchasing things instead o having a inventory where you can choose what you wanna wear cause i mean we did earn it so we should only have to get it once\n~ the mic system bugs out alot so i had to turn off the mic in some games\n\n\nI totally recommend this game and cant wait to see other improvements and things added\n10/10 would get rekt by freddy krueger using a crowbar again","April 27","true","1.8"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","26","36","8","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/looiqihui/recommended/448460/","looiqihui","[M]aster Shifu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/looiqihui/","141 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCrazy Killer is still relatively based on the pretty famous party game by Dmitry Davidoff in 1986, or rather commonly known as the Mafia; Werewolf; Town of Salem. However this game is much more simpler compare to the original gameplay. Crazy Killer consists of the Killer, Sheriff, and the Civilian. The maximum players in a round is 14 players, 2 Killers, 2 Sheriffs, and 10 Civilians. This game doesn't have a day/night phases. Players will be given a non-weapon period from the start, where you can explore and hide your positions or collect stars. Stars will later be converted to silver coins; in-game currency. There's also gold coins to be earned to buy special items from the Shop. At a start everyone will be logged into the Lobby area, where you can purchase weapons, skins, tutorials, and banking. There will be a round countdown timer before it starts, or when there's an ample amount of players that are ready for the next round.\n\nBasically the Killer will have to kill all the Civilians and Sheriffs in the round, in order to win. While the Sheriffs will have to kill the Killer. Civilians will basically be staying alive throughout the round, without being killed. All players have a chance to point to the public which Killer is, while the Killer also have a chance to divert the attention of his role. A fancy box will also be spawned at random areas, should the Killer be not found after Sheriffs have been killed. However the weapon will only last for that particular round only, for one usage. The items go by the per usage round, so there's no items that are permanent usage, probably they might implement them as a cash item. However the weapons shouldn't have an issue, since all weapons does a relative same amount. The guns will have an set amount of ammo though, so it's best to think whom to shoot for the Sheriffs.\n\nThe game is build based on the Unreal Engine 4, so you can expect pretty smooth gameplay. However though this is still in the Early Alpha stages of this game, there's no other features, like servers or graphical enhancements, inventory or cash payment system. For networking wise, I'm getting around 300ms ping that's connecting from Singapore. The framerate will be capped at 80 fps, on high settings. There will be times when you leveled up, the leveled up items doesn't show up once you completed the round. You might have to exit to the menu and enter the lobby again. There might some desyncing issues when you try to pinpoint the players whom are the killers, because of the camera view and the cursor movements. In overall this game is worth to be downloaded if you like funny TPS games.\n\nImprovements can be made for example indicating whom is the in-round names matching to whom is the Steam name. Everyone will appear as in-round randomly generated names, but once after the round ends the overview shows everyone's Steam name and their roles. Which I think it might make a confusion to players, as to did Killer killed his mate, or even Sheriffs killing their own mates?\n\nhttp://crazykiller.com/","April 28","true","3.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It's trying too hard to be TTT and feels like a ♥♥♥♥ing Roblox gamemode. It has next to no potential from what I've seen. I can tell you a few things that will ♥♥♥♥ing kill this game.\n\n-Pay 2 Win (not yet but it will be)\n-Character models are limited (10 uses, 10 ♥♥♥♥ING USES THEN YOU NEED TO BUY IT AGAIN?) It's not very expensive but it's ♥♥♥♥in' stupid.\n-Bad combat\n-Russian callouts do not auto-translate like they should. THEY STAY IN RUSSIAN!\n\nAll over I'm sorry to say but I think this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing flop. Play it now to make your YouTube videos on it. While the players are still stupid enough to play this. I cannot say I enjoyed myself like your "playtesting" team did. Sorry to ♥♥♥♥ on your game but I have to be honest.\n\nThe game in it's current state cannot be reccomended and I have to say I'm not suprised with the amount of F2P trash coming to steam recently. Thank you for your time I will not respond to comments.\n\nP.S. (Later Edit) I want to say that I have played a good 10-15 rounds of this game but the rounds are so short that they don't even last a decent enough time to warrant having a fun time.

(Not good, not bad, standard game music)\n\nOverall: The rounds are poorly balanced, its controls are sloopy and irrititating, without a whole team of mic users the murderer is almost guareenteed to win, the sound design is bad and gives no feedback, the graphics are laden with mismatching assets that clash and very little seems to have been done to aliviate that problem and the music is generic.\n\nThe free GarrysMod mode Murder pulls this idea off much better and frankly very little has been done to make this worth it.\n\nBy the way I've worked on unity projects before and frankly being early access is no excuse, I could easily make better assets then whats in this game in a short period of time and I've made better looking and working projects in 3 days even with no formal scripting or formal modeling knowledge.\n\ntl:dr Its just not very good and unless they completly overhaul the game (mainly the controls) and get a modeler I can't see it getting any better.","April 27","false","0.7"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","4"

I kinda like them but they can be a bit weird at times. I give the graphics a 5/10.\n\nSound: The sound effects sound like they were taken off the internet. They do sound high quality, though. I give the sound an 8/10.\n\nMusic: The music is a wacky type that sounds like it has been used in other media before. A 7/10 is in order here.\n\nControls: The controls are easy to learn, and you would kind of expect that for a game like this. But, when your using a gun as sheriff you can't aim, making it really hard to shoot. I give the controls a 6/10.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is extremely fun as it puts you as either sheriff, killer, or civillian. When your a civillian, however, it can get extremely boring. You may have a chance of never finding the killer and having that feel for excitement. As the murder it is really fun. I love stalking people and killing them. As sheriff it is kinda hard, because as I said before, you can't aim, making it really hard to kill. I rate it 8/10.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game is ultra fun, I feel like it is a nice spin on the gmod murder gamemode. Although it has it's wonky bits, it IS early access, so I expect more to come. I look forward to the updates. I rate this game a 7/10.\n\nI will be making a video review soon, so stay tuned!","April 29","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Only problem is that it lacks some action when you are a civilian in the game because you literally have nothing to do but run. Every 20 minutes it crashes  for me as well.
