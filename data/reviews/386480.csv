While mostly gramatically sound, the sentences aren't natural conversational English and read like they come from an auto-translator.\nThe character voice audio quality isn't uniform and the voice acting quality itself isn't very good (subjectively). It was distracting to the point where I had to turn the voices off to continue playing.\nThe manner the characters are introduced is very awkward.\nThe beginning of the game has little to no cohesive structure. It jumps from day to day in order to shallowly introduce new characters.\nThe protagonist is not introduced well and there is no exposition regarding her character.\nI'll update this review as I continue in the game. I'm interested to get to the actual meat of the game, but honestly my first few hours don't inspire me to want to play much more. While cheaper than most games like this on Steam, it feels like the quality of the game has suffered a lot for it.","December 31, 2015","false","10.4"," 56 of 69 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","56","69","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theNoizyBunny/recommended/386480/","theNoizyBunny","theNoizyBunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theNoizyBunny/","15 products in account","There are some errors with translations and grammar not quite sounding correct, however, that will be easily fixed as more updates come out. The game itself is beautiful art wise, and the soundtrack is relaxing and pleasing to listen to. (There are a few area where the music will jump in volume to be quite loud though, so please be carefull of that.) The backgrounds are stunning, and the badges and emotes are pretty cute as well, the cards are pretty dull in comparison to the rest of the unlockables, but they are still fairly adorable. (backgroud and lvl 1 badge examples are on my page, as my background and featured badge)\n\nThe gameplay is slightly different to other sims I've played because of the schedule planning, but when it comes down to it, this is a stat raising game. Although it's still easy to enjoy since the stat requirements don't need obsessive grinding to pass the test at the end of each game month, and the stat test only raises by about 200 points each time, so as long as you have 2 or 3 study days a week you're good. You have to visit each place once or twice in order to unlock the jobs, and then you can start earning money for items.\n\nIt reminds me of Nicole, due to some aspects of the story, but I don't think you can actual investigate in the same way you stat raise. You just have to let the mystery unfold along with the game's cutscenes. However cutscenes happen at least once a game week, so it's not like Dandelion where you have really long wait periods of nothing but stat grinding. And the stat skill are all counted as one stat for the end of game month checks, so the only stat that actually matters on it's own would be the one that corresponds to your chosen route.\n\nThe characters are charming, and although there are cliche aspects, they are done in a way that makes it hard to hate any of them. The designs of the characters aren't super unique, but the changes in their faces and stance when you chose different dialogue options are amazing details that allow their personalities to shine through. The voice acting however is the one thing I wasn't too happy with. The voices are great fits for the characters, but the lines tend to be read emotionless. (Or maybe I just can't pick up emotion very well in chinese.) And, again an audio problem, the voice actors can be very hard to hear due to the music spiking in volume for certain tracks, so I found myself having to readjust my audio settings quite a few times.\n\nOverall, it is a very nice Ootome, and I would absolutely recommend it just for the art alone, but the entire game is just so well done that it makes it well worth the price. Although it's already very cheap compared to most of the Ootomes on steam at the moment.\n\nNOTE: I haven't finished any of the routes yet, but I'll be adding to this review as I go through. Based on the fact that I have over 4 hours so far in the game (and I think not even half way through my first route), I'm really happy with the length and quality of the stories. I say stories since a good half of the main story cutscenes so far have been centered more towards the guy I'm going for first, so I assume I can safely say that you won't have to go through the same exact main story and cutscenes each play through like quite a few of the Ootomes I've played.","December 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 52 of 64 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","52","64","2","7"

I've seen it in the otome section for months, and I was waiting a really long time for it to come out. There aren't enough otome games on steam and this one looked really promising and looked a lot better than a lot of the ones on here. I just didn't like it at all.\n\nPositives:\n\n-The art is amazing, I like the character designs.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-The story has so much potential to be engaging and interesting but it's just flat. I like its concept, but it just doesn't deliver.\n-I can't get attached to any of the characters at all. All the love interests have a flat personality that seems more robotic than human like. In an otome game I expect to get emotionally attached to the love interests in some way, and actually care about them. They're dull. None of them evoke any emotion out of me. All of the side characters also have a flat, dull personality that makes you unable to get attached to them.\n-It's really hard to emotionally connect or empathize with the main character. Her personality is really shallow. Just really uninteresting.\n-Just eh writing in general. It won't get you immersed in the game. I had to stop playing a lot because I just couldn't stay interested.\n\nPlus I'm kinda creeped out that an aged 25+ teacher is a dating option for a 14-15 year old girl. It's optional, but it's still there.\n\nBut if you want a game that will get you emotionally attached to the characters and immersed in a story, this isn't it. Really disappointing.","January 11","false","6.6"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","47","60","0","0"

The prologue jumps around talking to different characters with no sense of time passing. In the beginning it feels though they cut the scenes with the love interests out of a story that might have been taking place, and pasted them together. Unfortunately, the writing just isn't up to par, and it's obvious that it's not just a translation problem.  Clichés are ok, but there is not much beyond that.  Some of the voice acting wasn't very good, either.  Comparing it to similar games, Blood Code falls short. Magical Diary has magic skills you improve and use, it has friend characters that feel like real people, and an interesting story and love interest.\n\nOtome games on Steam in a similar price range where your money would be better spent: Date Warp, Magical Diary, How to Take Off Your Mask, Cinders","January 9","false","6.6"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzkustid/recommended/386480/","dzkustid","Naizoutan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dzkustid/","23 products in account","Good game thats worth the price. The translation can come off as rather rough, its not incomprehensible but if you're bothered by minor grammar and spelling errors and a wooden way of writing, then you might want to look at other Visual Novels. The CGs are okay, but overall the art is very pretty, and the music is very soothing. The voice acting is decent, but all involved characters besides the protagonist are voice, which is impressive.\n\nThe stat building isn't tedious, there are very little elements you have to keep track of and they're mostly explained to you by the beginning of the game. You can even call the boys you want and they'll flat out tell you what gifts they like, and after that the game has icons to remind you of their preference. There's a decent amount of room to explore the mechanics of the game, and what gets triggered by what so you get certain dialogue options, events, CGs and endings. The element of stat building and time management, however, tapers off around the second half of the game as it begins to focus on tying up the story and the outcome of your relationship, which actually makes it rather boring since a lot of your investment in this game will be making sure you're adequately investing in your needed stats, passing monthly benchmarks, scheduling dates and hording money so you can buy your boy presents.\n\nThis game isn't for you if you're not into micro managing, though it is a good gateway game for those who want to learn the basics of strategizing around those games. Storywise, its passable, the magic and vampire backstory adds some mystery and style to what is essentially a high school romance game. It creates for itself some kind of lore, but generally you don't need to immerse yourself in any of it to follow each route.\n\nOh, from the initial three boys I've played through, the story and its triggers remain the same. There's no alternate side of the story or layers, the different boys you pursue will offer different subplots and a slightly different outcome that puts the at the forefront of wrapping up the protagonist's conflict. Still, its decently replayable for the CGs and alternate endings.","December 29, 2015","true","18.3"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamWhatonearth/recommended/386480/","IamWhatonearth","Michelle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamWhatonearth/","26 products in account","Overall, I really like this game but I think it appeals to a pretty niche type of player. The boys are different enough but they all fall into a certain type, basically they're all kinda reserved. Even the most enthusiastic one isn't quite as over the top passionate as some other games have the guys. Personally, I think this is expected, it is a vampire game afterall. The boys in here reminded me of Kaname and Zero from Vampire Knight.\n\nArt: Gorgeous! My only complaint is that some of the CGs aren't as nicely done as the others.\n\nStory: As far as plot goes, it's a bit choppy and not much to write home about. I think the story of each guy is a lot more interesting than the overall plot that I just skipped over on replays. This isn't a deal breaker for me but it might be for you.\n\nTranslation: There aren't any points where translation is so bad it's hard to tell what's going on but there are grammatical errors here and there, these might eventually be fixed by patches though.\n\nBoys: I really liked Christ, Locke, and Jesse but I felt that Leo's route was really boring. All the boys get a big of back story and you can go on dates with them and call them on the phone so I don't think they're undeveloped (well other than Leo, you don't get too know any of this backstory past where he explains where he worked before in the school.)","April 14","true","12.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It might be better in the original language. So please keep that in mind.\n\nAs far as it goes in the English translation, I wasn't enthralled. I felt battered around a lot by what was going on without a real idea of how things lined up or why. The writing was a bit too 'young' for me and maybe that's why it didn't appeal. (I'm a little older than most people who are probably playing these kinds of games.)\n\nPros: I did love the art and I do appreciate that I hadn't heard of this designer before so I won't be asking Steam for a refund. I liked that the game had stats to skill up and a few aspects to think about while I was working on things.\n\nCons: A bit more of a complex and deeper rooted story would have been great. I guessed the arch villain a little too easy. Renpy occasionally had errors while I was playing so I had to restart. SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN. Usually it corrected itself.\n\nAs a whole, I'd say give it a try if you want to support a game creator and growth to further improvement provided they pay attention to what's reviewed about their game. If you want something really on par with more well-known titles and heavy duty for your dollar, then it isn't Blood Code.","January 1","false","5.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I quite like the artwork as they put a lot of considered. I can hear the voice actor put a lot of effort into their character. I love the music it is pleasant to hear. State raising is easy to do and follow~\n\nBad point: Story can be developed a bit more, in some part i can feel that it a bit rushing the story which make me feel quite a bit confused why are they developing this way. Voice actor i can give them point in effort but not in emotion, abit too emotionless just feel like they reading the script instead of creating their character. At the moment the volumn (actors) between lines is unstable, needed a few more patched. The english translation gramma is..... well i cant say it is good but not bad either (I as well not an Europian person so i can not evaluated this part well)\n\nConclusion: well it seem that I point out bad point more than good point (as I am sorry for this). But its quite relaxing to play getting out of some heavy concept japanese otome game *gohonamnesiagohon*.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kupokko/recommended/386480/","kupokko","Kupokko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kupokko/","22 products in account","I think this is a good game:\n\nArt - The art looks nice! It looks like different artists may have worked on it since the artwork isn't totally consistent, but the still looked good in their own ways. This was a huge reason for me to continue with the game, as it was easy on the eyes.\n\nWriting - It has some clichéd moments, but it's not totally predictable. There was also a certain part in Jesse's good ending about Leia's dad that made me go "what" because it felt out of place with the rest of the story. There was no explanation. On the other hand, I did like Locke's endings. His endings also had more content than the endings for the other characters.\n\nTranslation - The English translation is a bit awkward. I found myself trying to understand or mentally replaced words in the dialogue and narration. It was almost literally translated, so the flow of the dialogue and narration seemed unnatural. For this reason, the game loses some of its appeal.\n\nGameplay - Part visual novel, part stat-raising. I tend to dislike stat-raising, so I'm glad it wasn't too grind-y. The stat requirements were not high and I didn't have to worry about it. I held the CTRL button whenever I got through the week and it was easy to get to the next week without waiting it out. By January, I didn't even have to study anymore and just did whatever I wanted. It also wasn't always easy to tell if I picked the right answers or had the right stats, so I would have several saves to go back and see what I did wrong. Pretty much like any other visual novel/stat-raising game.\n\nMusic - Light and pleasant to the ears. Spending some 13+ hours on a stat-raising game and listening to the same tracks would potentially be ear-grating, but surprisingly I didn't mute the game. It was a very easy listen. I'd mute other games after a while, but not this one.\n\nVoice acting - The voices are in Chinese. To be honest I didn't really pay much attention to the voice acting, but it was a nice touch.\n\nAnyway, it was very easy to pour hours into this game. It's decent, but not great. I think it is worth the price for how much it goes for. For all that was put into this game (translating, art, writing, music, and voice acting), the price isn't bad at all.","January 1","true","13.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Regarding it only costs 10 euro I would advise you to buy it if you're a fan of romance games.\nHere is why :\n- Although the  storyline itself is 'short' with just around 4 hours for a playthrough it is sweet and entertaining.\n- It has a nice graphic, especially in the cgs and the normal gameplay although it sometimes seems like they had different artists painting  the cgs (even for the same characters as they can look kinda different through the game )\n- the music is quite calming and while it kinda loops and does not get annoying (unless you're playing it for 4 hours straight ^^')\n- The story itself is interesting but a little bit predictable\n- There are four routes each with at least two endings.\n- Steam achievements and Cards\n\nThinks you should consider about this game are:\n- The story itself does not change much in between the routes it stays the same to more a less 85 % or so some special events change but the rest remains the same.\n- The cgs ar not necessary to get a 'good' ending, therefore you can miss important story parts quite easily ^^'  Yes I am talking about Locke's route here where your suddenly his girlfriend and he ask you if you should end this thing. I wasn't even aware of the fact that 'I' was his girlfriend because I missed that scene and cg\n- The whole time planning and studying thing is well more a less useless, it does not have much influence on the game.\n- there are a few logical faults, like suddenly changing the name of an NPC.  Or Leos death in his bad ending in wich I still asked Jesse for his blood and made the potion but seemingly forget to give this lifesaving potion my lover. My bad\n- Leo's route is sometimes kinda bit weird, regarding he is your teacher and more a less bluntly flirting and favoring you above the other students. they send the main characters to a date with him because he did so much for the class and she seems to get most along with him.\n\nWell I personally can't say much about the complains about the English text and translation frankly because I don't remember it being such a nuisance\n\nThe bad stuff may look more than the good but trust me it is a nice romance visual novel, that will get you to like the different characters and to want to play the different routes. At least that is what it has done with me.

Yes.\nBlood Code is an otome game; more specifically, it is a dating and stat-raising game targeted towards women. Queue a school filled with vampires, witches, wizards, and a world brimming with magic, and you've got yourself a decent setting for a plot. The main plot, however, is not the strong suit of this otome in my opinion; instead, the individual stories of the available candidates take the spotlight (some more than others). They are not world class by any means, but compared to some of the other otomes which are much more highly priced, Blood Code provides a great alternative. If the price is really too much for you to justify, try catching it on sale (I was able to purchase it for about $3 recently with the anime sale).\n\nI've spent about 16 hours alone on only 2 and 1/2 routes completed. If you base the game around $1 an hour, I've more than made up on the price with how much time I've spent on it. And this is when skipping through already seen text. I may be a little slower than some, so give or take a few hours if you'd like. I'm the kind of person who likes to go back and read through -all- of the options I didn't take before, as usually they add some background info or other snippets to digest and make the world fuller.\n\nThe Good: Beautiful art and CGs (CGs are computer graphics which really are the selling points of a lot of otomes. Without good CGs for your players to collect and immerse themselves with, it would basically just be a normal novel.) There are a decent amount of them for each date-able character.\nDecent main plot: not really the best, but nothing horrendous either. I'd say it's more than passable when combined with the character plots.\nGood character plots and progression. You slowly learn more about the date-able candidates. I will say, however, that characters aside from the main 4 guys (and perhaps one or two other side characters) don't have enough growth in comparison. EDIT: I do want to mention that in -meeting- the candidates it's a little awkward and could have been more natural; however, I feel the beginning of the game is the poorest part of Blood Code. Just try to get past it.\nMusic is pretty decent. I actually enjoyed listening to it, even when not playing. (You can set the main-menu to a different tone and leave it on, which is quite nice).\nThings to discover. Secret date-able: this is always a plus (it's great to see they don't just spoon-feed you every guy). I also really like the fact that they have some achievements which actually require you to think and play around before you get them. Generally, otomes usually just give you the generic "finished this route!" achievements.\nEASY. For a stat raising game, I found it extremely easy to deal with. The game gives you enough money at the beginning so that you never have to work or anything as long as you spend all of that money on the right gift (prioritizing the expensive gift) for your chosen guy. Other than that, simply focus on the one stat of your guy and you're good to go. There's a great guide in the Blood Code community section that can further help anyone if they really need it.\n\n\nThe Bad: Chinese voice acting: I don't know if it's just the language and culture barrier, but I could not stand the chinese voice acting. It just seemed to lack emotion or something similar. This may be due to cultural differences or the like, but I couldn't get past it. Like some other reviewers, I simply turned off the voice sound completely. The game was a lot easier to get into once I did that. (So do yourself a favor - turn it off too! Unless you like it for some reason, then all the more power to ya).\nGrammatical errors were numerous; however, this isn't something that ruins the game for me. In fact, it sort of endeared it to me (I'm weird, yup). To be honest, even though the grammar issues are very apparent, I could still easily understand what they were saying. The grammar errors were more tuned towards a lack of natural english sentence structure.\nLack of growth for some side characters (I sort of mentioned this in my bulletin in the good section, but I thought it would be fine to mention it once more here).\nBeginning of the game is lackluster. Get past it asap.\n\n\nAll in all, I highly suggest grabbing this and giving it a try. If you're wary though, get it on sale. Once I've completed all the routes, I will come back and edit this review if my opinion has changed on any of the points I've listed.","May 4","true","17.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's nothing truly remarkable for the genre, but it's got the cuteness factor and pretty boys to look at, so I suppose it's doing its job. The artwork is very pretty. It has this soft, watercolor look that's very charming to look at. I wasn't blown away by the story, but that said, I didn't go in expecting anything more than fluffy romance. There is some unique mythology that the story features (and is pleasant), and the storyline itself isn't awful.\n\nAs for cons, the sound quality for the voice work is not at all consistent, even within the same character. At some points, a character would become significantly louder or softer. From the context of the dialogue, I figured it not to be due to the characters shouting or whispering. Also, the introduction does drag on for quite a bit. There are quite a few translation errors, some more obvious than others, but these will probably get fixed with later patches.\n\nAll and all, yes, I would suggest buying this game if you're in the market for a cute visual novel with nice art.","January 18","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Stat-raising felt smooth, art was nice and it was (in my opinion) fun to try to get the romance events that only occured when you had certain stats. I bought the game and played it almost 6 hours on first day. Ended with a disappointing 'normal ending; no romance' and I am in my second playthrough now, trying to get a better end. Really enjoyable otome with nice art, good voice acting, long enough story and a lot of options.\n\nOverall: I'd say buy it. I'm not a big visual novel player, but I really enjoyed this one. The characters are a bit flat and maybe even cliché, but it didn't bother me at all. I'll probably spend some more time in this game in the coming days.","January 12","true","8.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It also includes a closet in which you can change Leia's clothes (though it doesn't seem to change the story at all)  I really loved the bookmarks and the little options you get whenever you plan out your schedule. There are some grammatical errors but nothing too bad. There were 2 or 3 scenes that when it went black (normally to say time went on) had Chinese letters. Also whenever you buy something you can consume for yourself a box with Chinese words appears. I'm guessing it says if you want to use the item. But nonetheless good game it is rather long which is worth the price. Whenever you can go out and you see the guys the dialogue is repetitive. There are some parts where the voice gets too loud mainly with Dina- The cafe manager) and some voices are a bit too low that you can barely hear. I was able to get the happy ending with Christ on my first playthrough so its not hard to figure out and get an ending.\nThe game does a good job of mixing high school romance, mystery and fantasy.\n"NOTE": I have only done Christ route got happy and sad ending, Forever Alone ending, and Jesse's happy ending and should of helped him ending.","December 30, 2015","true","16.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","1"

The English language translation has been improved since I first played, which helps; also, a big plus for me for the game is that I really enjoyed the voice acting for the main characters.\n\nNice art and good storylines (especially the one you can unlock after you've played through at least once).  One of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while - but then, I enjoy piano and piano-based music.\n\nI played through three storylines when I first got the game and found the conditions for various endings slightly obscure, but when I went back recently to complete a few more I found I enjoyed the game quite a lot.\n\nA solid entry into any otome / anime game library.  I definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre.\n\nCons:  True for this game and many others, there are some features I thought they could have done more with.  For example, it would be great to have more opportunities to actually use magic, not just raise stats.  And it would have been neat if the outfits you can buy actually affected the game, even a little.","March 2","true","57.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's main downfall is it's terrible translation. Most of the time it's just that words are added, missing or aren't used correctly. In rare cases, the sentences make no sense what so ever – even after reading them a few times. With visual novels this is a huge problem!\n\nThe voice acting isn't the best, especially when it comes to minor characters. Their voices are blank, monotone and completely without emotion. I felt this took away from the experience for me. The main characters are better, however, it just still wasn't for great.\n\nThe story itself isn't that bad for a VN based around a high school scene but the beginning of the game is defiantly rushed. Your first few days playing it will be really short in what felt like a desperate attempt to make you meet all the characters. Two or three sentences and then it's suddenly the next day. I can understand that they want you to meet everyone ASAP but it really felt unnatural. That begin said, there were parts in the game I laughed at so there is some humour in there, if you're at all like myself that is!\n\nThe protagonist is the typical girl you'll find in a lot of otome games sadly. She's classed as being weak, constantly putting herself in danger and then needing to be rescued. She's also a huge hypocrite in my opinion. She constantly gets upset because people keep their secrets from her but she refuses to tell anyone her secrets unless it's completely necessary. Goodie-two-shoes, kind to everyone, always feels she has to do the right thing, even when it's dangerous to her personal health. She also uses guilt to get what she wants a lot, saying a few times in the game how someone wont tell her their secrets because they don't trust her and therefore mustn't really think of her as a friend.\n\nAlthough the story has 4 routes giving it some replay value, the stat building does become tiresome after awhile.\nThe game has also been coded with many part-time jobs the protagonist can partake in which will give her different stats, money and/or crystals. It's a nice touch but completely unnecessary as you begin the game with enough money to buy all the presents you need to get your love-interest to max affection and still have some money spare. The only use I can see for this is if you'd like to buy one of the outfits available which also seem to have no impact on the game. The stats you get from the jobs could be easily obtained by studying in school that day instead which also gives you less fatigue.\n\nThe art isn't too bad. I did enjoy many of the backgrounds but found some of the CG's a little awkward. In some of them I felt more time was spent on the boys and not the protagonist and the body positions could use a little more practise.\n\nOverall, I really wouldn't suggest this game and that is mainly due to the terrible translations. I think to improve upon this VN they really need to spend more time making the text understandable and less like it's come straight from google translate. Maybe encourage people to do the part-time jobs by starting them off with less money and working on the voice acting a bit more!","March 23","false","14.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's uncommon for me to drop or find a game unplayable but unfortunately Blood Code files under that category which is sad because I really wanted to like the game, but aside from the artwork there's really nothing this game has to make it worth it's price.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great artwork. The artwork is top notch, no doubt here.\n\nCons:\n\n-Awkward translation. It feels robotic, hard to comprehend at times, it really makes it hard to get into the story when you're cringing at the bad english.\n- Shallow characters, none of the characters have any depth, interesting interaction or anything to make you care for them at all\n- No proper story, the premise is to find out who killed your father among other things but the game barely touches that.\n\nWould I recoment this game? No. There are many other otome titles that are far better and can offer more than what this tried to do. If you really want to check this out, wait until there's a sale since it's not worth the $10 price tage to play a bad game.","April 2","false","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Sometimes it took me three minutes to decipher what was trying to be said.\nThe music was good and what I understood from the characters dialog, so were the characters.\nThe poor translation does get really annoying though.\nI wish I could give this game a 50/100 score, but I can\'t. For me the confusion I had toward the game caused by its poor translation was more a deal breaker for me, than the beautiful artwork and music.\nA visual novel needs a good story, artwork, music, and possibly good voice acting if it\'s in the budget. If a visual novel lacks any of these things with the exception of voice acting, it will not be very popular with its audience. And Blood Code\'s translating made the story very confusing and hard to enjoy.","June 1","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
