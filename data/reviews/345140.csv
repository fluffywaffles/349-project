Currently only act 1 of 3 is available to play through in the story. An interesting aspect of this game is the letters that you find which slowly reveal bits and pieces of what is really going on and what happened beforehand. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay/Controls\nThe area you go through is based in a square grid system along with your movement. it sometimes will look like you can reach out just a bit more, but the moment you go forward you will die. You can slowly get used to the grid system and it is probably why the editor is available for use. The first act consists of a number of levels which you must traverse, each leading you down a set of stairs deeper and deeper into the unknown. I played on normal with normal scares and the atmosphere this game created was very well done. The save system is quite fair and the puzzles are of an easier difficulty. The controls took me quite a while to get a feel for. The right stick used for moving my head was quick and snappy, and to turn I had to use my LB and RB, however I was able to get used to these controls. This game feels like it is more optimized for someone who owns an Oculus Rift (which I think it is). The controls are most definitely odd and could maybe allow for some options to change them in the future.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nAs soon as I entered the game I liked its music as it is well played, and was quite relaxing. The sounds in an creepy aspect were done well, but the moment that really shined is when I was alone, in the dark, and heard a voice whisper into my ear "I see you". Creepy yet lovely. Through the game you will see these shadow figures, or as I like to call them, "Bobby". They will stalk you through the game and are well-placedl to really give the atmosphere of you being alone, and having an unknown number of entities watching your every move. This game does not rely on cheap over-used jump scares. The graphics of this game are ok in my opinion.\n\nEditor\nI think that the editor in this game will be one of its key aspects in the future. In the level designer you create your own dungeon and plant your own scares and effects along with puzzles and traps. I do like the editor, but was unable to find my saved dungeon within the game and I did not know how to test it. I definitely hope that in the future people will be allowed to share their dungeons with other players.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ music\n+ letters to find which tell a story\n+ atmosphere\n+ fun little puzzles\n+ interesting story\n+ creepy\n+ editor to make your own dungeons\n\nCons\n**Note that since this game is currently in early access that some of these issues will be fixed when the game is done* 	*\n\n- controls are annoying\n- no idea where editor saves to/ how to test maps\n- there are two of the same letters in some spots\n- only one whisper ("I see you")\n- if you play the main game and exit to the menu the editor is locked\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my personal suggestions for the future of the game. They do not need to be taken seriously as they are only my opinion.\n\n- expansion on the editor\n- ability to share created user-maps with other players\n- options to set controls to use example: only right-stick and ignore bumpers\n- ability to set sensitivity\n- expansion on the controller\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI am happy with Crystal Rift and will certainly check in once the other acts are released. Through my journey I met a friend in this game who I named Spidey. He would always appear when I needed a friend and I could always look forward to seeing Spidey again. The controls were quite annoying, but I was able to get used to them. I look forward to the future acts and to see more of the interesting story I have started to piece together.\n\nTL;DR\nCrystal Rift is an enjoyable game with an interesting story to discover. Currently only 1 of 3 acts are available. The music is good and the atmosphere is well set. This game (thankfully) does not rely on cheap jump scares. The puzzles in this game are not exactly difficult. The game itself is set into a square grid as you move as if you were on a square grid. This game is probably much better suited with an Oculus, however once you are able to grasp the controls it becomes quite enjoyable. There is a game editor which allows you to create your own dungeon with your own scares and fun puzzles. Overall it is a nice experience that creates a good sense of creepiness and a great atmosphere.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 101 of 118 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","101","118","4","17"

Here, based on what I've played so far, you're simply exploring dungeons, solving puzzles, and trying to stay alive.  My only concern is the price tag...which is about the same as the aformentioned "LOG" and "LOG2".  The EA description mentions that:\n\n"What is the current state of the Early Access version?\n“We are really proud of our current state and are ready to share how awesome it is. The level editor is working well and the first act which is about 2 hours of game play"\n\n2 Hours of gameplay for $25 seems a bit steep...I honestly would have pegged this game to be $5 or $10.  It's not a bad game mind you, but I would honestly wait a while until more content is added before dropping that kind of money.\n\nSo would I recommend it?  At present, based on the price tag, no.  It's not a bad game, but it doesn't do enough to justify the cost right now.  I think the devs should have opted for a cheaper price and increased it as the game developed, like many other EA games do.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKL64ghSSdA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY_Xxstfom8","April 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 82 of 119 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","82","119","4","12"

I recommend this game only if you have an Oculus. I think this is one of the most polished games available for Oculus at the moment, very nice and decent graphics. But yeah, to be frank- game itself is pretty simple. (And also I can agree with those who think $25 might be a bit much for such simple game.)

It's focused more on exploring, solving light puzzles and moving through challenging obstacles rather than combat.\n+ The lore or story that you find written on paper from "staff" or workers who once inhabited these dungeons is very interesting and well written. They make you actually want to find out more and keep advancing further.\n+ Horror elements such as hearing your heartbeat, sudden spooky sounds, and ghostlike figures although even casual users who don't like horror will likely enjoy this game as these are used sparingly throughout the game. Personally, I felt like it was just enough to feel excited without it feeling overbearing.\n+ Each level seems to add completely new enemies, challenges, and mechanics to the game that really made me excited as to what I'd find next.\n+ A map editor\n\n- The combat is pretty basic. Basically you step forward swing, step back to avoid the attack and then repeat until the enemy is dead.","April 30","true","0.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This is not a room scale action adventure with 1/1 motion tracking, nor is it an RPG. It's an easy mistake to make and I think a lot of prople are getting disapointed.\n\nThe dev has provided the option to play standing and with motion controllers but it dosn't add to the gameplay. I think it takes away because the mechanics are so simple all that imput just adds confusion. The player has 2 dimensions of movement and can only face in four directions. VR allows them to look freely and get a better idea of where they should be and what direction they should face but dosn't actually effect to outcome of a situation. Unless the option that was added after the game was released is checked. Then you move in the direction you are looking which actually negates the advantage on VR. I don't think it improves the game.\n\nOnce I figured out what the game really was I had a great time. There is a great deal of variety for the very simple mechanics. There is little time wasted between puzzles and It's used to establish a little background and poke fun at itself. It's like beinlg inside of a top down 8-bit dungeon adventure with the monsters and traps made real in front of you. I probably wouldn't be interesed in playing on a flat screen but in VR it's a childhood fantasy come true.","May 15","true","0.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It doesn't try to be either. It's first and utmost a nostalgic homage to the old dungeoncrawlers, like Dungeon Master and EoTB.\nCurrently in early release there's not much in the game either. It's basically just a few pizzles per level, and that's it. The monsters are a few slime blobs that's on a track, so it's easy to avoid them.\nI sincerly hope there will be some kind of fighting system in the end, with actual monsters as well. Would also love a inventory/looting system, but I'm not sure if that's where the game wants to go.\nGraphically it's really nice. Its got a cartoony feel to it, but it plays it very well.\nThe main thing though is to play this game in the a VR headset. This is the strenght of the game. It plays beautifully here. While the scale feels off, it does give you a feeling of actually crawling through the dungeon on your knees. It has a very creepy and claustraphobic feels to it because of this.\nthe controls are easy as well. It's front (w), back (s), sides(a, d), turn (q, e), and action (space). If you don't have that down in under a minute, I don't know what to tell you.\nAll in all, if you don't have a VR headset even if you like dungeoncrawlers, this might be a bit pricey. If you do however have a VR headset, I'd say it's a must, specially if you're like me and grew up on EoTB I & II.","April 20, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

At first glance, I went in expecting a hack and slash or something to compare with Vanishing Realms. This is not that kind of dungeon crawler. You do have the ability to slash at your opponents with your sword in melee range, but as a grid based dungeon crawler, you have to be quick to move your character out of the grid when you're done dealing your hit in melee. You cannot tank these enemies down; every hit drains a crystal heart, losing crystal hearts causes you to respawn at a nearby location. If you do this 5 times, you end up having to restart from your last save point.\n\nIf you hold down your trigger attack for about 2 seconds, then let go, you'll release a charged attack from your sword. I'm only on level 7 right now, but so far I've seen 3 sword upgrades. There may be more, but if there is, it's not too important to me. Combat seems to be something to break up the pacing of the puzzles.\n\nYou see, so far, I've noticed each floor requires a puzzle to complete before the doors unlock and I can go onto the next level. Usually the objectives are simple: Find a gemstone that matches the color of the gemstone of your door, or find an appropriate key for key slot. To do this, though, you'll need to navigate through floor traps; ceiling traps; deal with enemies that spawn; and figure out ways past the invincible enemies that patrol some parts of the dungeon.\n\nThe second and third sword upgrades work as ranged attacks, Once I realized that I should approach combat more as legend of grimrock than skyrim, the game became a little more interesting. Shortly after figuring out how combat works I realized I could play as a melee damage dealer or a ranged damage dealer. Versatile combat is nice, even though combat doesn't seem to be a rewarded effort. It is more of a means to an end, which is to get out of the dungeon, I guess? I'll know as I play longer, but I may take my time. Puzzle games are not my forte and I haven't felt the need to check if there's a walkthrough.\n\nOn one particularly large puzzle (floor 6? I can't remember now) I noticed the developer did an excellent job of making the map not too confusing to solve: clever usage of lighting and switches that don't have multifunctions are very good things to keep the pacing right for a casual gamer like myself.\n\nI read somewhere there's upwards of 25 levels in this game. I wonder if the puzzles get significantly harder. That's probably when I"ll take an extended break, knowing my track history.\n\nAt any rate, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of grid movement based dungeon crawlers. There's no experience points, though, and there are no classes to choose from. The puzzles are engaging and the combat is challenging enough that there requires some practice to perfect.\n\nMovement was a little rough for me with the default control setup prior to patch 1.2.9. Once 1.2.9 hit, I switched to a controller setup that works well for me using the Vive's tracked controllers. I think what I eventually learned of how to move pre-patch was to not press the very edges of the thumbpads, but keep my finger about halfway to the edges of the thumbpad when choosing a direction to move.\n\nThanks to the developer for the fun game. For $10, I am very satisfied with the content.","May 28","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, you can play this game normally without looking like your a future gamer or one from the 90's.\n\nCrystal Rift is a nice looking game. Controls well. And that's where I have to draw the line.\n\nI didn't find the puzzles all that challenging, however, I did only play the first 4. And they were on the uptick in difficulty. You must navigate pressure plates, dodge fireballs and spike traps to collect a crystal and open the door. Then you move on to the next puzzle.\n\nIn normal mode you start with 5 lives which can be lost by getting hit by any other aforementioned traps or by an enemy. The harder Knightmare mode starts you with 1 live. So kinda making it harder.\n\nOne feature I think people will enjoy is the level editor. You can create your own puzzles brick by brick and locked door by locked door. I would love to build a level with the Oculus.\nIf it sounds boring, it's because it is. I think this game needs the Oculus Rift to be playable imo.\n\nBelow is a first look of those 4 puzzles I played.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pmzPkR6zsew\n\nNow even though I find the game boring, I still think it's worth playing with one caveat. YOU MUST HAVE AN OCULUS RIFT! It's just not a game I can recommend other wise. Especially at the $24.99 price point.\n\nSo if you're one of the people out there with the Oculus Rift DK1 or DK2 and your itching to play something, then I think you'll enjoy the experience.\n\nFor more reviews and a bi-weekly podcast about Early Access and Indie games check out EarlyAccessPodcast.com and youtube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","April 20, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I first played this at EGX on the vive, it was good there, i then bought it for my DK2, was good there also. I would point out that there is more horror than i was expecting, but the fear factor can be turned down in the sttings menu. The movement system is excelent, and induces no motion sickness while standing or sitting.\n\nThe game it's self i find to be quite difficult, as the player's hitbox is huge, leading to bad judgement of the proximity of threats. The game is also a bit glitchey in places, mostly the different swords becoming invisible, making it combat difficult.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this is a fantastic VR or non-VR game, that hits all the feelings that it needs to be convincing and fun, 8/10.","March 19","true","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

It has a very good soundtrack, great immersion and some very cool ideas. However, the controls are kind of clunky. Left analog stick to move is good, but shoulder buttons to turn and right stick to look is kind of strange. Personally, I would have mapped turning to the right analog, moving to the left analog, standard hit to right shoulder, special attack to either left shoulder or right trigger, and interact to the A button. One other error I noticed is that 'lives' is misspelled on the difficulty selection screen (being spelled as lifes).\n\nHowever, this game is worth playing, and it could become brilliant, but I personally found the control clunkiness to be too much for now.","November 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

That needs to somehow be corrected.\n\nMoving with the VR controller doesn't make any sense. It doesn't change direction based on where you're facing, this gets disorienting fast, causing a lot of deaths just because of the controls.  Forward should always move you forward etc. Right now it's locked for north, south, east, west.\n\nThere's a lot of missed potential with VR.  Why can't I reach out and grab a lever?  A button press?  Same for swinging your sword, a button press.  That's weak.  It's the little things that make VR satisfying, and this game misses the point entirely.\n\nCombat seems janky and the movement of the enemies doesn't seem in line with VR, It's very hard to dodge attack ETC it feels like you're supposed to just move back with the controller, again, missing the point of why VR is so good.\n\nOther than that it's a decent old school grid based dungeon crawler, it just needs to be worked out for VR a lot better, so it gets a thumbs down until everything is worked out.","May 8","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Breaks often, looks like it's from the early 2000s, can't even detect which controller is right and left.\n\nCombat is not fun or satisfying, which is surprising since it is the game's only mechanic.  It is tile based but not turn based and you die in one hit.  You swing your sword not by swinging it but by holding the trigger to power it up then releasing it, where is does some level of damage that I can only assume is somehow related to the charge level.  The thing you were swinging at _might_ die.\n\nIt basically is a bad dungeon crawler with VR slapped on top.

The movement system is very rigid and put me over a toilet to collect my lunch fast. I loved what I saw of the game before that though. Dungeon crawlers were the first type of game I ever played and the toggle in the setting menu for level of scares had me very intrigued.
