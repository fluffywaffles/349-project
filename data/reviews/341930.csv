"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LiquidT/recommended/341930/","LiquidT","Liquidje","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LiquidT/","405 products in account","So, I checked the game out yesterday. The game is one of those semi-roguelike basebuilders, not that different from Prison Architect or Banished. However, compared to those titles, the game is quite shallow. You generally deal with money, power and oxygen. Money comes from residents and visitors, power comes from solar panels and is used by components on your ship, and oxygen is generated by some of these components and flows through your ship depending on the status of your doors.\n\nAnd for just that, the game is quite easy. Getting a net profit is not that hard, and getting power consists mainly of building lots of solar panels. Oxygen is easily managed with air locks.\n\nThe only real problem comes from random events (of which there are not that many it seems, I got some of them multiple times in my playthrough) and meteors. You eventually research equipment to deal with that. Until then you have a cycle of buildup -> damage -> people die -> buildup.\n\nTo make things interesting there is research, but there are only 7 or so subjects which do not offer more in-depth mechanics. The game suffers from the same problem I had with Banished. After a while the real challenge is out of it and you can just expand until everything eventually crumbles apart. On my second try, at took me 1,5 hours to build every facility there is, net 2k each day and I did not have to care about asteroids or supernova's. Getting the last achievement would only consist of me walking between my pc and the couch to check for random events and otherwise let the game run at max speed.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the user interface is functional but a bit weird, and that the game lacks explanation. Yes, I think pointing out after the tutorial that "the hand-holding comes to an end here" is very clever, but I could not find a way to use the stairs to actually build a second floor. The game just "lacks", it lacks content, it lacks challenge, it feels like an early access game with way too less stuff to do.\n\nIs it worth the money? Well I got 3,5 hours of minimal fun and I feel like I've done everything there is to do. Since the game cost me 5 euros, it was not a complete waste. But I don't think the game is good by any means, maybe a 5/10 for effort and only considering the low price.\n\nYou want something like this? Get Prison Architect. Maybe Banished. Or Dugeon Keeper. Or Evil Genius. Just not this game.","March 1, 2015","false","3.4"," 74 of 86 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","74","86","2","0"

The AI does not work well (robots will just stop doing their assigned jobs), building structures lacks sanity checks (you can have solar panels overlap each other on the same level), zoning causes problems when walls are removed* and asteroids destroying the floor makes rezoning necessary.\n\nThere are nice ideas in this game, but at this point it lacks a ton of bugfixing, polish and ui redesign to make it more intuitive. Glad the developer is still working on it - but, at this point, I can only advise you against getting Space Station Alpha.\n\n* and why, WHY am I not allowed to have oxygen generators outside of living quarters? I had passengers dying on arrival just because the only oxygenated room was the living quarter which they couldn't reach in time... Wouldn't have been so bad if the robots at least bothered opening the door from time to time - but no... tasks piled up and they must have felt too overwhelmed to even get started.

The research "tree", for instance, is very small and quickly completed (no teirs, just a few boxes to click on the screen). The settings menu lacks any controls for sound volume. Instead, it lists a series of screen resolutions which happened to be missing my 1920x1050 screen size.  The game also lacks any real documentaiton on how to play after you get your first resident.

Kinda reminds me a little of a sim city game, but in space with the threats of asteroids smashing into your spaceship (space cty) as you have rooms for science, guest services for alien visitors who pay you for such services, and more.

I really like games like this one and Prison Architect but neither are finished games I can just play. Prison Architect (a really great game by the way you should buy it now or when released) crashes and Space Station Alpha is nearly unplayable due to workers getting perpetually stuck unloading.\n\nWhat happens is sometimes when a shuttle lands it will not be unloadable. Up to 4 of your workers will try to unload it, some freezing right where they are instead of going to the shuttle. At this point the launch pad cannot be deleted and 4 of your workers for the rest of the game must be stuck unloading" nothing. Deleted workers causes new workers to "unloading" the unloadable shuttle. You can try various things like not accepting deliveries, closing your station, waiting a really long time, turning off your launch pad, etc. but none of those will fix your issue.\n\nThe only way to get past this is save the game, close game, and load your saved game. You will have to do this often. I usually use this trick to remove things i mark for destruction but never actually seem to get destroyed. I simultaneously enjoy and hate this game. I keep comming back to some of the same issues.\n\n\n2015-06-05\nbugs not fixed. super annoying to have workers just stand in one spot for enternity while your shuttle on the launch pad waits for said worker for eternity.\n\n\n\n2015-03-20\nAfter 69.0 hours I am happy to say everything seems to work as it should ingame. It is always a good feeling seeing certain bugs being juicily squished by a devoted creator.\n\n\n\n2015-03-12\nAfter 52.3 hours these are the nasty: Saved game bug makes saves somewhat worthles. Shuttle stuck on launch deck and is no longer destroyable bug. workerbot stuck in invisible and remote area of the map-but-is-thankfully-destroyable bug. The somewhat difficult process of placing floor to align the way I want too not-actually-a-bug-I-have-OCD-sorry bug.\n\nMy take is this game is fun (if you like these type of games) but still needs polish. As evidenced in the comment below, the developer is accepting feedback to make the game better. This game is his beloved creation. If you help him test it, he will fix it. Even after just a few days, many things have been patched. My outlook for this game is rosey, I just hope it can get some attention and more positive reviews as time goes by.\n\n\n\n2015-03-05\nAfter a mere few minutes playing I only encounterd one bug so far and it occurs when you try to load a saved game. I am thumbing this game up with the expectation this will be fixed.","March 5, 2015","true","80.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","1"

You try to run a space station but some advice, trying to build multiple floors bugs out, have to many residents and robots the ai crashes and then nothing is maintained so your station dies, and never build the fusion generator in a room that has oxygen. So have two engineering rooms. For no oxygen means fires are instantly put out. I would let the game sit for a few updates before it is more playable.","May 22, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
