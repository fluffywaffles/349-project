Then, the other Developer wants to come here and say that this review contains "misleading information". I really tried hard to support these guys, even AFTER the debacle. But the dishonesty and lack of integrity is just TOO much. Have some integrity, Developers. Your reputation only suffers when you behave like this.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone. "Early Access" is that in name only. read the forums for yourselves, the Developer has already stated that the game is complete and any feedback would simply be put to use for a potential sequel. What you see here is a completed game that is only in EA to detect potential bugs. Wile an interesting concept and one that seems could have used the Early Access to it's advantage, the state that it is in will leave you very disappointed.\n\nSpeaking of disappointed, let's talk about the developer for just a brief moment. In fact, I will simply ask you to go check the forums for yourself. Particularily the thread regarding obtaining the Steam Keys. The developer is not only rude but the developer also refuses to interact with anyone BUT the trolls! No effort was made to discuss valid issues with early supporters that had raised some concerns regarding the game, it's "finished" state, etc. Not publicly or privately. It got so bad at one point, the developer decided to try to only give keys to the people who would stroke their ego. Again, you can see this for yourself in the forums. This behavior is beyond despicable. The developer goes on a rant about how people who bought the game are not customers to them (mind you, these are the very people that bought the game early AND voted to get it Greenlit!) , and compared said customers to terrorists. No joke. Several people had to reach out to the fine staff over at Groupees in order to get the keys that were paid for months BEFORE the Steam release. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and read the forums prior to purchasing. If you decide these developers are the type you'd like to support, that is your decision.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/317950/discussions/\n\nLastly, in case you think I am just trashing a developer for the sake of trashing a developer, I urge you to check out every other interaction I have ever had on Steam. I have NEVER left a negative review. My only interactions in the forum prior to this have all been not only positive, but extremely helpful to most (mainly, fixing broken games!). I have no desire to be negative in any way, however, this is one game/develppment team I STRONGLY urge all of my fellow gamers to avoid.","August 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 139 of 171 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","139","171","0","33"

The game is devoid of general polish, narrative, character or even good honest raw charm.\n\ncons:\n\n- Boxy/VERY small gameworld. I've seen larger tutorial levels in many games\n- Generic butcher/baker/candlestickmaker characters. There are a mere 10 NPCs in the entire game\n- Light on game assets, music looped over and over, no speech, light on gameworld and environment SFX/atmosphere etc\n- Repetitive gameplay generally involving fetching items over and over and over to gain favour with characters and procure other items which then allow you to gain favour with other characters over the space of what is a 4 screen gameworld\n- There's an abruptness to some of the game mechanics and transitions. Dieing for the first time was one of those what just happened moments as I kicked a bunch of kids and was insta-killed with accompanying black screen and a few lines of text\n- Ropey animation and effects here and there, transformation from skeleton to human is the obvious one but I also experienced glitching with the main character becoming transparent at one point\n- The "humour" and dialogue generally, please refer to UNepic for an example of well done humour/dialogue. Cringeworthy would be my appraisal of KEL\n- Limited narrative & story\n\npros:\n\n- none\n\nI can't recommend this product. Indie games are a dime a dozen nowadays, good indie games, the ones which people will actually remember don't cost much more than this. There are many F2P games which are significantly better (Ascend HoK springs to mind). To put this into context I bought Don't Starve for a mere £1 more than this game costs on Steam (in a sale admittedly but I digress), Legend of Grimrock has repeatedly been on sale cheaper than this, likewise UNepic an Early Access game which has just came out of that process - the list is endless, certainly in my steam library.\n\nTo summarize this is a short, painfully repetitive game with 10 NPCs, an environment that can be traversed in less than 2 minutes and "arrow to the knee" belly laughs.","August 31, 2014","false","1.4"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","46","60","0","4"

This game is an absolute mess. The gameplay is virtually nonexistent, unless you enjoy walking around aimlessly, and there are no real redeeming qualities to actually encourage you to progress. Unless you like clicking on people and things randomly until you somehow make vague progress, I cannot recommend this game to anyones unless they're either a masochist or someone who runs a YouTube channel specifically for the purpose of mocking abysmal games. There are corners that have clearly been cut throughout development too, with the functionality to sort of 'trade' with plants existing for some unspecified reason (but I would assume it was so the developer wouldn't need to program more than one menu or something).

It has gotten better since then. They now have a menu that lets you know how much they dislike you and some other stuff. The game offers more tips now so at least you understand what is happening. When I first played this their were little to no tips. So thats good. The game also has an inventory so thats another plus. However I still am not fond of the game.\n\nIts insta kills is annoying and not needed at all. I talked to a villager  and all was well. No problems at all. I offer to trade  for gossip and he kicks me to death. Fun? Not really. Now true I was in true form a skeleton but then why did he bother to talk to me at all? The game is super small only having one village and some NPC to talk to.\n\nThe price is cheap enough however I just dont find any enjoyment in the gameplay. Its not a very witty game. Its just a standard somewhat tired adventure game. I do like the graphics its the gameplay that bugs me. Being insta killed for nothing is Irratating. The game reminds me of a game where your supposed to figure out what the developer had in mind. So if you dont get what he had in mind? Insta killed. Fun? I will let you be the judge on that.\n\nIf your dying for adventure then I would say stay far far far away from this game. If you have some money that is burning a hole in your pocket and feel the need to waste it then by all means buy this game and try to enjoy it.\n\nAlso I see that "I kicked a bunch of kids and was insta-killed with accompanying black screen and a few lines of text" is still in the game.

Let's start by talking about the positives. The game has allot of character, the dialogue is well thought out and funny. It also has a completely original storyline unlike anything I have ever seen in other games, the first thing I think of being Dungeon Keeper but obviously this is of a completely different genre. I say that because in this you play as the evil Skeleton named KEL who claims to represent all the enemy sprites in previous RPG games through the ages. World design is fantastic and you can tell that allot of imagination has gone into creating and realising not only the development of the town but also the easter eggs like the Skeletons banqueting round a table and the retired mage who claims to have 'lost allot of weight' (you will see why), but thats where the positives end.\n\nThe gripes I have with this game are few but weigh heavily. The world is very small, one town, a wilderness, a number of easter eggs and the occassional lonesome hovel. This does make the game feeling lonely and enclosed in a small place, leaving you wanting a whole lot more. There is very little combat, you basically have to use your intellect as if the game was almost entirely a puzzle, althrough that might be a positive. The final problem I have is that you have an inventory of items that can be used but rarely anything equipable and there is no stats at all it would seem.\n\nTo sum up, I really think the positives save this game. The atmosphere of the OST and design are more than satisfactory and the puzzles quickly become addictive once you start to solve the early ones. The negatives are always present but let's remember this is in early access and you certainly get your £2 worth. Final verdict: The game deserves the mixed review status it currently has.\n\nHere is my lets play of KEL Reaper of Entropy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0VLAheJah4\n\n","November 18, 2014","true","1.1"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","3"

Although it possesses the locked isometric view and aesthetic of a dungeon crawler like Torchlight or Diablo, to compare them one to one is like comparing Outlast to Call of Duty just because both involve first-person gameplay.\n\nI would compare it instead to a point and click adventure based in a dungeon crawler's world. You play as a skeleton named KEL whose goal is to either kill or have all the denizens of a nearby village died of "indirect" causes. Combat is rudimentary and revolves around choosing to kick people and cursing at them with spells. The "true" gameplay of the game lies in it's point and click nature, you gather quests from people and explore the village and surrounding areas. It is through this exploration that you gather items that you can use to either fulfill quests or gain the favor/ire of the villagers so that they will grant you additional quest.\n\nKEL's strength lies in its writing to me, the dialog and story is truly enjoyable and are supported well by the game's art and visual. The save system works, though it appears to be limited to one save file.\n\nIssues that I have had with KEL Reaper of Entropy are as follows. Graphics controls - there is not a real way to adjust graphics outside of changing resolution and there is NO windowed mode. As per usual for Early Access games, some functions were buggy/inconsistent, eg - not all of the villagers had voice acting. I was perfectly comfortable reading out the dialogue myself but upon walking up to some villagers, an audio clip would play.\n\nFinal Verdict\nYes, I would recommend this game. For a small sum of 4 USD, it offers a nice casual point and click game that allows for some odd discussion to be had over the villagers different reactions to being kicked, scared or charmed.\n\n-Supervinh47\n","November 8, 2014","true","0.8"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","1"

Instead of having to kill monster after monster to progress, you explore and do small quests, which appeals to me more than needless violence. It's slow-paced and great for relaxing in front of. And as I'm not used to playing with a keyboard, I appreciate it greatly that the controls are so simple. Another thing I like about the game is the humor (kicking the town gossip!). I found myself smiling at many things while playing, and I'm looking forward to playing some more.\n\nThe inventory thing was a little confusing to me at first, despite the little tutorial, but after a few times of combining items, I started to get the hang of it. I'd also appreciate it if you could click on items/people from afar, which doesn't seem to work at the moment.\n\nUnfortunately, the game seems to be a bit on the short side but with the low price, it's to be expected.

It is entertaining and fun. The only thing I quite didn't like is how the fighting is not like I expected.\nI kind of expected this to be like a fighting RPG with loot like Swords, Armor and everything but oh well :)\nStill a good and fun game! I just wish it would be more like Diablo 1 Styled RPG :)\n\nBottom Line: Good and fun game with good gameplay for few hours at least :)\n\nSure a game worth of 2,99€","January 27, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

It has a slower pace to it, but but  it's enjoyable. My only complaint is the menus are a bit rough around the edges other than that I recoomend it to people who are fans of adventure games.","October 26, 2014","true","1.3"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

Its a great idea for a game and i hope that they take the concept futher in the future. Game was made with the Unreal engine which is always cool to see. The dev team was small, 2 people so dont expect an enormous game. I've heard its got about 2-3 hours of gameplay but so far (30 minutes in) I'm enjoying the back and forth banter between the main character and the other items/npc's that i've discovered. It's my kind of humor and the story feels well structured.","October 26, 2014","true","2.0"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","7","24","0","0"
