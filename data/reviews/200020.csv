I once used to play alot of First Person Shooter's, but went abit away from it, given i wanted to try out some other types of games -a choice i'm glad i made- but lately I've been missed it, so I asked around and some of my friends recommended this, so I checked it out in the store, and it was on sale at the time, so I figured, might as well give it a try.\n\nStoryline:\nGlobal Ops: Commando Libya is based on the typical evil communist/terrorist and good americans that's saving the world, this time they are stopping the Arab terrorists from getting their hands on- and using- an atomic bomb which will lead to a catastrophe, the idea might have the slightest potential, but they do not take advantage of that in this game, it feels abit like it's just shooting non-stop, dialogs is to be honest pretty bad too, i know that's not the main focus in a FPS(3rd person shooter in this instanse) game, yet i like when a bit of effort has been put into the storyline, so it's not too uniform,\n\nthe AI is just terrible, even at veteran difficulty, at one point i got up, and slowly walked through a small passage with 5 gunmen shooting directly at me, without any trouble. oh, and when they realised just how pointless their shooting was, they saw it fit to run directly up in front of me, to block my way.\n\nand as the top of the iceberg every now and again glitches happened, and finally the messed up controls didn't help much.\n\nTo sum up:\nI do not recommend this game, the AI is aweful, controls are bad (and can't be changed) and storyline is terrible. I give this game 3/10 at best i will not be bothered to finish this game given i have lots of good games waiting for me","December 27, 2013","false","2.2"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","64","84","0","2"

There is nothing new about this and it's only breath taking because of how BORING it is that you'll be wasting all your breath yawning.\n\n\n-"Diverse missions and a series of new assignments: complete all the challenges; action-packed Combat missions, stealth missions and hot pursuits in vehicles! "\n\nChallenges? There are none. It's not diverse at all. Run in and kill everyone. That's every single mission. EVERY SINGLE MISSION. They are completely lying that there is any stealth.\n\n\n-"A massive arsenal of different weapons and vehicles: use all the means available to you to catch the criminals!"\n\nThere's like six weapons. That's it and I'd hardly call that "massive".\n\n\n-"Hours of gameplay fun: either solo or with friends: complete 9 single-player levels and show what you’re made of in 3 different online Multiplayer modes!"\n\nHours as in five. That's about how long the game will take most players. It's only taking me longer because of a lag/optimisation issue which results in a lot of restarts.\n\n\n-"Detailed graphics: fight in realistic settings from Greenland to Libya!"\n\nThey're completely mediocre. Boring and bland. And so many boring hues of brown terrain.\n\nWell. That's me disputing the description. Onto the review.\n\n\n\nFinished the game on toughest or whatever and got all the achivements so let's start this trainwreck of a review.\n\nLet's start with the good. The graphics aren't terrible.\nThe achivements are all relitetively easy.\n\nThat's it. On to everything else. In otherwords.\n\nTHE BAD.\n\nFirst for me is LAG. For some reason at least for me, It was horrifyingly laggy. everytime I tried to move the camera ended up with a huge lag spike. It finally fixed itself when I changed the affinity to two cores and back to eight while the game was open. Who knows if that fix will stick though.\n(Update. It didn't. Seems like it's a texture issue. A very poor one.)\n\nFacial animation. There is none. At all. If they speak it's a blank face. ALL THE TIME.\n\nThat brings me to the next point. Voice acting. It's HORRIBLE. They sound bored and not at all natural. And even though the game involves a russian and libyan in a cutscene they both speak english with really poor accents.\n\nWeapons. They don't feel like they have ANY impact. It's like your shooting marshmallows. And on top of this the weapons themselves are kinda crappy for accuracy. Have an enemy a bit of a distance away? Be prepared to waste half your magazine hopeing that one of the bullets hit the enemy you're aiming straight at. Sniper isn't bad but obviously a pain in close quarters.\n\nThe story itself. Completely and utterly forgettable. Bland and boring.\n\nA.I. - Utterly horrid. Half the time they just run past my ally and run to me. Sometimes they'll just APPEAR next to me. As you play harder difficulties the game doesn't make their AI any better. Just stronger weapons. That's it.\n\nIn game dialouge. It's like they got a bunch of teenagers to write it. Every other word is either a swear word or a ridiculously stupid joke. It's not even fun to listen to.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThey didn't pay any attention to detail. There was one moment where I noticed that the character's head was the SAME height as the doorhandle. The couch nearby reached up to his waist. The turret gunners, if you get close to them you can tell that the character's are only standing there with their normal guns in their hands. There was no attempt to make it seem like they were holding it at all.\n\nThere was a few moments where enemies came in a car and the door opened and closed. No one came out or anything. The four enemies just appeared outside it.\n\nThere are some parts. The vehicle parts. They aren't nearly as good as some say. The enemies are hard to hit while moving and due to the lack of impact you don't know if you hit them. There is no on screen reticle while fireing in a vehicle aside from the first one. UPDATE.  When you're in a tank later you actually have a reticle.\n\n\nOverall. This is a painful experience that I urge no one to attempt.","August 20, 2014","false","9.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

And that's exactly what Global Ops: Commando Libya is. Only that it's a bad action movie. In fact, it's so bad that it becomes absolutely hilarious. The homosexual remarks between the protagonist and his companion (who sounds like such a twink that he could only sound more gay if he was drinking Fristi or something), the fact that one of the main bad guys keeps talking about how we will never get his ♥♥♥, the almost insultingly bad accents and so much more. The game itself is gameplay wise a cheaper version of Army of Two with extra genericness, bad dialogue, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Call of Duty-esque storylines and gayness. Lots of it.\nThe best way to have a good time with this game is to buy it cheap (I bought it for 1 key and consider that to be a fair price, considering the campaign takes about 5 hours to beat and MP is dead) and to laugh at all the awul everything. One of my personal favourite things to do was play this game and analyze it like it was all a metaphor for man looking for his partner of the same sex while struggling with the difficulties he faces in such a 'manly' world. The chopper would be a metaphor for his doubts about his sexual orientation, the fat Russian talking about how you will never get his ♥♥♥ would be a metaphor for all the potential sexual relationships with women he is 'throwing away', etc.\nIn other words, it's great fun and the perfect thing to do when you're really bored and want to do something gay that doesn't involve other men or porn.\nAnd don't get me wrong. I'm not even against homosexuals or anything, but this game is probably the gayest thing to ever be featured on steam since Gone Home. That's just a fact.\nIn a more serious note on the game itself: it's just extremely generic and since it's developed by a smaller studio, not as polished as generic AAA shooters. It's really the worst of two worlds, sadly. There's plenty of work put into this game, and I can see that, but nobody's interested in a generic shooter like Gonorrhea Flops: Cummando Labia, especially when you compare it to all the creative content smaller studios have created before in the indie scene.\nOveral, I can only recommend this game if you're the same type of person who plays stuff like Ibn Battuta for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles and you can get it for cheap.","October 4, 2014","false","5.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","12","17","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/200020/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Reviewing Global Ops: Commando Libya is like reviewing a trip to the dentist, if you enjoy a little pain then you'll enjoy playing this game.\n\nYour mission is to take control of half a two man special "special" ops team as they make their way through 9 or so levels of corridor shooting one-dimensional gun play,  The action is experienced as a third-person cover shooter in that you must use the environment to avoid taking damage as you shoot the hordes of dumb ai controlled enemy soldiers.  You must run through various locations that are distinctly the same, moving from cover to cover, avoiding a barrage of shots that do not easily kill you (at least on regular difficulty) until you get to the end of the level.\n\nThere is barely any variation to the core gameplay.  In some sections you must avoid lethal fire from tanks, helicopters or hvg. machine gun emplacements [that you cannot destroy,] or the like, while picking up ammo and grenades from fallen enemies, until you find conveniently placed weapons at the end of a level section.  There are a few locations that require you to use some sort of heavy weapon to destroy a boss (helicopter, tank etc)\n\nGraphics are nothing better than okay, while music if fine.  The overall look and feel of the game is that it is something from the 1990s - probably due to the game engine being used.  Story and voice-overs though are bad, really bad.  I mean the stuff of bargain basements, not legend.  Truly the narrative is something out of a Hollywood Z-list action movie.  While the voice acting is just as bad.  Your AI controlled buddy is practically useless, getting lost most of the time or moving out of position into the area ahead where the enemies are pouring from but, without actually killing anyone.  Though he does chip in with the odd kill from time to time.\n\nIf you are wondering if there is anything positive about the game its probably that you can use numerous guns, even if there is little to differenciate them apart.  Weapons include: UMP-45 SMG, M16+M203 grenade launcher, the latter of which doesnt work, AK-47, M1014 shotgun, frag grenades, M249 light machinegun, the Draguov SVD sniper rifle and M136 anti-tank/vehicle launcher.\n\nI still cant believe I am recommending it.  You maybe asking why... and how.  The thing is despite all the negative aspects of the game, it actually feels fun to play.  Yes the story is pants.  The audio amateurish.  Gameplay is basic but, if played in short bursts it can be mildly enjoyable in an old-skool kind of way.  I found myself smiling as my AI buddy and me took on hundreds of cliche enemies ala Rambo style.  I guess if you played games twenty years ago this may remind you of the titles of the same franchise and bring a smile of nostalgia to your face.\n\nOverall though I would only recommend getting this in a sale.  Its definitely a guilty pleasure.  Though the game is over quite quickly and is nothing special.  The ending is maybe worth getting too also. If you dont play it, you wont miss much.  However Im off to replay this on hard.

The game starts off with a small, but basic intro as to what you're doing.  Fortunately, the game has sub titles on by default, which I find to be very important in all games.  You don't get much information about your character specifically, which is a bit disappointing.  I'd like a little more background on the guy I'll be controlling throughout the playthrough.\n\nI use a DeathAdder mouse, and something I always do is change keybindings and make use of my side buttons.  To my surprise, GO:CL makes use of the buttons by default.  One button had been pre-assigned as my reload (which is VERY helpful), but the other wasn't given a function.  I'm really impressed that the developers thought ahead and considered users who have side/extra buttons on their mouse. On the topic of keybindings, I could not find an option to customize the keybindings.  If in fact there is an option somewher, I apologize, but it's not in the options.  I will never understand why developers don't include the options to change keybindings, especially in shooter games.\n\nThe game is okay to look at graphically, but it's nothing amazing.  Some of the effects, such as explosions, look a bit too cheesy for my tastes.  You really start to notice the lack of graphic quality when you lok at character's faces.  In more than one instance, the face appeared to be too cartoon-ish.\n\nThere is a take cover and roll mechanic, which is quite nice, until you realize the keys to roll are your movement keys.  There have been SEVERAL times where I've tried getting out of cover, and I'll roll away because roll is bound to the move key.  This is where it'd be incredibly helpful if we could rebind keys.\n\n\n\nPositives:\n\nSubtitles (and they are on by default)\n\nSide buttons on mouse automatically are assigned a function.\n\nA small, but good amount of destruction (can destroy doors and walls)\n\nBlind fire.\n\nDriveable vehicles\n\nNegatives:\n\nNo options menu when in game.  Have to go to the start screen.\n\nIn-game music is on by default, and is a little on the loud side.\n\nNo character customization.\n\nCan't modify the keybindings.\n\nThere were a few missions where I'd run into invisible walls.  I'm not sure if these actually were invisible walls or just glitches.\n\nBad voice acting.\n\nBad animations.\n\nMediocore graphics.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","March 17","false","2.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UpsideDownShark/recommended/200020/","UpsideDownShark","UpsideDownShark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UpsideDownShark/","122 products in account","Possibly the worst game I've ever played.\nTo start off you're an American soldier who is fighting against Russians because they have, you guessed it, weapons of mass destruction. Imaginative.\nYou're character has all the personality of a homeless man's shoe, and is constantly coming out with the most cliche one liners along with some awful original ones that don't make any sense... You don't have to announce a special delivery everytime you throw a grenade, dammit! Just be quiet and shoot the 'Ruskies'!\nIt's a cover based shooter, which I guess would be okay if the cover mechanics weren't as smooth as the rear end of a porcupine. I'd love to be able to sneak from one bit of cover to another but he just stands up and strolls about as if he wants a couple of extra holes for him to go screw himself.\nAs soon as I started playing it, I was already in a bad mood with it. This is because it throws you in, and doesn't tell you how to do anything. And yes, I understand that this is an occasional thing that happens in games, and I can alway go to the settings to look at the key bindings. Apparently not. The settings aren't available from the pause menu. That's fine I guess, I've just started so exiting the mission to go back to the main menu so I can see them isn't really a big deal. But when I opened the Settings Menu I had to ask... WHERE ARE THE CONTROLS?!?!?! It took me forever to figure out how to crouch, because it was the same button to get into cover, sprint, do a barrel roll, dance to the maccarena, high five the postman and murder my whole family, and if you are within a miles radius from a piece of cover you will automatically cling to it like Katy Price does to any tiny piece of 'fame' she can get her hands on.\n\nIf I had a physical copy of this game I would not hesitated to set it on fire.","December 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","9","15","6","1"

Let's go through the checklist: Russian stealing a superweapon? Yup. Sells it to a Middle Eastern warlord? Yup. Enemies running around yelling Arabic phrases at you? Yup.\n\nLet's discuss what this game is. It's a third person shooter, in the same lines as Gears of War or Spec Ops: The Line. While those games implemented story tremendously, and had some intriguing and intense moments; this falls short. There's something a little weird about running through Libya shooting people while you play as "Pope." The sheer American-ness of it all was a little disappointing because it was done seriously. It wasn't tongue in cheek like Team America. It was done with a sense of legitimacy which detracted from the entire experience. The writing for the plot was as xenophobic as you'd expect (come on guys, the cold war has been over for 30 years. You don't need the obligatory Russian arms dealer); the dialogue feels like it was written by that girl out of the movie Paul (remember when she swears for the first time then just can't stop? Yeah, that's our protagonist in a nutshell) and there are more than a few moments where I found myself going "people have to be warned."\n\nI found myself yelling at an Apache helicopter and all I could think was two simple things. Firstly, how did the pilot hear me through the canopy, over the arctic winds and the sound of the helicopter engine. Secondly, well done writers for not making it a Hind; you've at least showed you can avoid SOME stereotypes. Then I just found myself using a rocket launcher where the smoke obscures your view so you can't tell if you hit or missed. It was far too obtrusive and frankly made the section alot more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThen we can top that off with so many sections where you do the standard run from cover to cover to avoid a heavy machine guns dreadful maw. Except, the cover mechanics are broken and uninteresting. There was no rush or desire to push forward. I had to FORCE myself to go past it, especially because after getting close to the end of a minute long cover dash; it instant killed me with no warning because tank cannons; why not? Then I had to go all the way back to the start.\n\nNow lets think about a very important aspect of third person games: animations. Quite simply, there's a bit of a lack of decent animations or bump mapping. You can punch or hit with your rifle butt to kill enemies instantly. They can also pretty much do the same to you. You can die in two punches but it takes nearly a full magazine to kill you on the hardest difficulty. Speaking of magazines, you'd think reloading would require you to remove the magazine from your gun and replace it with a loaded one? Nope. The magazine NEVER leaves the weapon. It remains there while you wave your hands in a reloading fashion.\n\nFrom a game where you kill half a thousand or more indigenous peoples; you'd think there'd be a variation in guns. Nope. There's an M16, M249, AK47, SVD, M136-AT LAW (which they call an "RPG"), M1014 and a UMP. That's a total of 7 guns, between over 500 enemies. Not exactly varied. And they don't handle or sound good. The crosshairs don't change size, they just jolt when you fire. Then top that off with their lack of accuracy and inconsistent damage and you have for a shooter that lacks the fun of shooting.\n\nAll in all, this game is a colossal disappointment which I genuinely only completed in order to have all the achievements in a game. The story of Pope killing Arabic men to protect the freedom of America is one which I realised halfway through being told did not even need to exist. It's arguably the most disappointing third person shooter I've seen and actually proved something to me. I thought all Modern Military Shooters nowadays were just the same tired rehash about terrorists, Russians and "America! F**K YEAH!" but I was wrong. Somehow, there's something about the Call of Dutys and the Medal of Honors and the Battlefields that makes them at least decent, if not fun. This was a formulaic attempt to recreate those games and hope to do just as well. But it turns out, it's much like a home-made chilli or a savoury mince. You can't just look up the recipe online and everything's fine. If you take 50g of America, 2 tablespoons of Freedom, a pinch of Xenophobia and fry that with 400g of Questionable Views of Foreign Nations (add water and stolen superweapons to thin the sauce) it doesn't necessarily make a good game. This is what happens when you follow a formula to the letter. It lacks originality and character; which is pretty much essential for a good game.","July 5, 2015","false","5.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","11","24","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/200020/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Global Ops: Commando Libya is one of those games where they try to cash in on a "theme", but ended up being "overtaken by events". The plot is as generic as can be: some bad guys found a nuke, and some tinpot dictator wants to buy it (for what, exactly?) and the good guys have to hunt it down. The plot's pretty interchangeable, and the things you can do in this game? They try to do a bit of Call of Duty type game where you get both third-person and rail shooter sequences, but not that interesting overall.\n\nTo be honest, graphics are not that bad, but the result is you can't really tell where the ammo and such are. Also, while I like a commando who's properly armed (an assault rifle, AND a LMG? Please) the enemies are hilarious... As they are armed with... Apache gunships? and Blackhawk choppers? Shouldn't it be Hind gunships instead? Also, right at the beginning, they are showing an Antonov An-255 Mriya, pretending to be a B-52?!  This game is a generic shooter that was hastily put together to take advantage of the death of Moammar Ghadaffi.\n\nWith that said, the game is below average. The levels are kinda... meh, feels like MOH redux (the EA revamp) but with clear levels instead of lots of up and down slopes and hints of "uneven" terrain. There are ways to flank the enemy... sometimes.\n\nYou are limited to two weapons and grenades, but then, there only are like, well, M-16, AK-47 (or 74, can't tell), Dragunov sniper rifle, shotgun, UMP (submachinegun), and rocket launcher. There are attempts to make a cover shooter, as "space" is context sensitive enough to let you slide into cover and peek out and so on. Occasionally you get to use a mounted weapon, but that's about it.\n\nYou do have a shadow... I mean a fellow shooter, who will tell you the obvious stuff like "turn right here!" or "let's go through that warehouse!" but he's actually impervious to damage. At least he will occasionally kill an enemy. However, he gets stuck on the weirdest things, then materialize out of thin air. AND he doesn't shoot the enemies that comes between you and him... and the Enemies mostly ignore him too! However, you have to follow him around, since there is no map, no nav marker, nothing. Only by following him will the plot advance. If you lost sight of him, well, good luck, but generally the game is a rat maze... single path. It will open a path for you if it appears you have nowhere to go.\n\nEnemies... Heh, you get everything from generic "towelheads" to generic "balaclava goons" generally armed with AK's, and only later you see some "red berets" (armed with UMPs? In Libya?)  and some security goons (wearing "suits") And they all sound the same and die the same... From a Russian renegade ship to deserts of Libya. And the random comments by your guys? Are just as bad, or perhaps, worse, as they seem to be written by some amateurs, who thought Rambo and Arnies are actually representative of US military, would write. And they *sound* that way too. "Don't f*** with Pope (call sign for your character)"... Yeah, right.\n\nAll in all, it's a cheaply made game, and at 2.50 it's... barely tolerable. You can find better games for that 2.50. And if it's any more, forget it.\n","August 23, 2014","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Russian not American lol" so I'm letting the intro sequence play on and notice how funny the characters look and how they move.  The movement seems almost limpish as if everyone was limping which just breaks the feel to the game.  The action is mediocre wether you're using melee attacks to take out an enemy silently or the shooting aspect where you need to be in the over-the-shoulder view (iron sight) if you want to see the crosshairs.  Then there's the cover system which is hit or miss and just like in Gears of War; you will die quickly if you're not behind it.  The voice acting is sooo stupid it's beyond hilarious :) makes you feel like you're playing thru a parody of Rambo or Commando lol.  All in All, I cannot recommend the game unless you want to get a good laugh and a few thrills here and there","May 20","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
