My favorite feature is the local coop and controller support, not many music games have coop. I find some of the zoom in and out quickly animations a bit queasy but I know intense animations are often a staple of the music genre. Would be nice to be able to disable that though.\n\nCurrently the game doesn't take advantage of any free Steamworks features (no Steam cloud, leaderboards, achievements, online multiplayer etc...) but perhaps some of those will be added in the future.\n\nOverall it's a nice game to pick up and play for around 20minutes at a time. I'd recommend buying it to anyone that likes music or local multiplayer games.","October 30, 2014","true","0.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

I really like how the game ramps up, each mode starts smoothly but the longer you go the faster the tempo gets - the gameplay, the music and the visuals get faster and more intense - but the game doesn’t get frustrating, when you lose you just want to try again or go about your business.","January 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There is a way to make the blocks go slower, but this is not endless, which makes that at least I had to play on a really hard mode sometime, not being able to slow down the blocks for some time.

Very funny. :P\n\nIf you have a Mac, like me, I recommend playing it on Windows. I didn't get my achievements while playing on Mac, I thought I read something about this that this is normal, not getting achievements on the Mac.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MHartman/recommended/329320/","MHartman","MoeHartman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MHartman/","2967 products in account","With all the falling block games out there, it's rare that one will really stand out, but somehow, QbQbQb does. The basic game is simple. Blocks fall from outer space towards a small planet, and it's your job to rotate the planet so that the falling blocks will match the onest that have already hit the ground. If the blocks stack too high, you will lose one of your three hearts, and losing all three hearts means a game over. There are also meteorites which will instantly destroy whatever stack they happen to hit, which adds another layer of strategy. The game has several variations on its basic premise, which helps to keep it fresh. You have a match three mode in which any three touching blocks of the same color will disappear, a stacking mode, in which you must stack three blocks vertically, and finally, a mirror mode in which you must match two blocks on opposite sides of the planet, a truly unique and clever game mode that I have never seen.\n\nThe game is good enough on its own to be worth a look, but the greatest virtues of QBQBQB are its aesthetics. Although the graphics are simple, they are extremely colorful, and they are yet another distinguishing feature. Best of all is the quirky electronic music. The game is ushered in by a "karaoke" singing robot who explains the rules with a funny little song. The humor is downplayed through most of the rest of the game, but each stage has its own background music, and the compositions are excellent, both fitting the action and visuals of the game and also serving as memorable pieces of music on their own. I cannot recommend the soundtrack highly enough, and even if you normally don't like electronic music, I think the soundtrack will grow on you as you play the game.\n\nOn a final note, the game is extremely adaptable to the player. At the beginning of the stages, the game will be breezily easy, but after you have been playing for a while, the music becomes more frantic, and the blocks start falling faster. This makes it easy enough to draw in less skilled players, but if you are more experienced with puzzle games, you will still have some challenge.\n\nQBQBQB is the rare puzzle game that people really ought to try. It may feel like everything has been done before, but this game is expertly crafted and has a few tricks up its sleeve that will feel entirely new. It's incredibly easy to pick up and play but also has depth if you're looking for it, and whether you enjoy playing or not, the audio and visuals are simply outstanding. Altogether, this may be the best puzzle game since Puzzle Bobble/Bust a Move.","March 8","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In this case, players must clear blocks either by stacking three on top of one another, matching three that are next to each other, or even matching two that are across from each other. The twist (literally) is that the blocks fall onto a circular playing field and you have to direct them by spinning the planet. It's a very fun action puzzler and an addicting one too.. The music is also catchy and gets better depending on how good you're playing, which I love.. :) ..Only complaint is that there's no vs CPU option but it doesn't bother me that much..\n","June 21, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An entertaining puzzle game. The split screen mode is suprisingly fun and the music is cute. Its not without its flaws though. The co-op mode is virtually unplayable because you can never tell which is which. It feels like it was hacked to get a multiplayer mode on the same screen, but would benefit from being split screen. The pieces don't give you much warning either, unlike Tetris. If your stack is too high, there is zero chance to plan your next move, resulting in instant death. The menu navigation is also unintuitive with a gamepad. All up though, its not bad for the light casual gameplay.","February 17","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is beautiful, the graphics are cute, and the game is very addictive. Although, the game lacks customization. The way the game controls is very disorienting to me, and makes it very challenging at some stages, where it really shouldnt be. Although, it's usually very forgiving. And it's only about $5 Canadian, so you can't really complain. I'd give this game an 8/10. It's great, but a few simple and vital features were left out.","January 25","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittutmord/recommended/329320/","tittutmord","Ongo Gablogian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tittutmord/","99 products in account","Pros:\n+great soundtrack\n+familiar, challenging, interesting\n+nice aesthetics\n\nCons:\n-no means of building a strategy, which takes away from the puzzle aspect of it\n-rotating the planet (the crux of the game) isn't smooth with the keyboard. its a little better with the mousewheel. havent tried the gamepad just yet but I'm hoping that's the smoothest.\n\nmy biggest gripe with this game is that there's no intuitive/smooth way to rotate the planet...which is the main control mechanic. It's not unplayable, just frustrating, and requires the player to have extreme finesse with keystrokes/mousewheels. You know what would make it better? click & drag to rotate, spacebar to drop\n\nUnlike tetris, this game requires you to be precise with 2 aspects when placing blocks: rotation and gravity, whereas tetris just has the gravity aspect. this is a curse and a blessing because while it adds a layer of complexity, it also adds a layer of frustration if you've lined up a great match, but move your mousewheel up a tiny bit, making the whole move useless. it's similar to the feeling in tetris when you slam down a stick piece only to have it be off by 1 block and instead of racking up points, you now have a mess to clean up. HOWEVER, in tetris, that's 100% your fault. in this game, other factors like mouse wheel sensitivity and randomization come into play. combine that with no indicator of whats coming next, and sometimes this game feels a bit unfair. Less intellect based, and more luck/reflexes.\n\nWould be a much better game if they had at least the option to have an incoming drop indicator, to adapt to different play styles\n\n\nI can't say that this is my favourite puzzle game, or that I'll even go back to it very often. but I definitely feel like the pricepoint is fair. It's a challenge, that's for sure. just sometimes not for all the right reasons.","January 5","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
