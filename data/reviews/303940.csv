In some ways I consider it a combination of a sci-fi / puzzle / horror type of game.\n\nWatching a wavy radar-monitor screen while piloting something like an underwater mini submarine, or "Capsule", and there is an almost constant sense of tension as air and power can quickly deplete along with other lurking dangers hiding in the murky depths.\n\nYou’re kind of dumped into the game and left to figure out what to do or what the heck is going on, but I think that’s part of the enjoyment of it.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is well done. Sounds are good and an important part of the game. Graphics are minimalistic, but for this type of game it works really well.\n\nTo best experience this game I suggest to play with a headset, turn up the sound a bit, turn down the room lights, let yourself be immersed; Put yourself into a frame of mind that you're piloting a leaky cramped mini-submarine, or “Capsule”, with only an old flickering radar monitor screen for visual feedback, and your ears listening carefully for sounds, to help let you know what might be out there around you.\n\nHearing the last gasps of breath as you desperately search for a much needed air-pocket, then at the last moment you find one, you’ll be taking a big gulp of air and have a brief sigh of relief and you contiue to limp your way to your destination while always on the lookout for sources of air and power to keep you going.  But, oh noooes! *Shhhriiieeeak!*. What was that aweful noise? Something's coming in... fast! Com' on, move faster you leaky tin can. Don't let me die here. I'm so close to the next base... So close!\n\nOverall; I think it's quite a good game with a well done atmosphere and I felt well worth the few dollars I spent to buy it.\n\nBelow is a little game-play video of me playing Capsule.\nCheers! :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Z8ebDSWro","June 18, 2015","true","2.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/303940/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","tl;dr: Superbly immersive in its minimalism, and definitely not recommended for people who are afraid of facing a basic existential horror: running out of breath and dying alone inside a tiny escape pod in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAfter you turn off the lights and put on your headphones, you are immediately immersed in what appears to be an otherworldly underwater (or space) environment that you can only experience through the minimal UI of a radar screen. The sparse, grirtty interface elements and visuals (and the even sparser controls) force you to surrender to the brilliant and shockingly uncomfortable sounds of your breathing, the whining of the engine and the blips of the radar's pulse. And it is this sound design that makes Capsule what it is: an experience much more so than a game. Mainly because your desire to survive has less to do with winning and more to do with avoiding the desperate gasps of running low on oxygen.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and repetitive, but it does manage to keep you tense throughout. Alone in your claustrophobic capsule you traverse this unidentified alien space, using the radar to help you locate pockets of air and power while avoiding dangers, and using the compass/distance readout to navigate to your next destination. Balancing these simple decisions of speed and direction feels like a constant gamble stacked against you, so expect to die alot. Still, despite the very basic controls there are a couple of secrets and subtleties to be dicovered in the gameplay - a look at the achievements may give you a couple of hints.\n\nThe game has no pause button but saves at (and restarts from) the last base you have managed to reach. Those are also the locations where you can refuel and uncover your next destination, while skimming through the few lines of communication leftovers you can access - the only way the game delivers explicit story. There is of course a bit of mystery there, an anomaly, elements of the strange. But the snippets that mostly hit home tend to be the mundane communications of daily life: a greeting to a daughter, a joke, complaining about those working in the other department, life as it is lived day-to-day. And they hit home because underlying them is the same existential horror that underlies every design aspect of this game: the mundane sound of a breath turning into a hopelessly lonely death rattle amidst the uncaring void.\n\nSo is this a good game? Not... really. The narrative has those fascinating little moments, but never develops, and the ending is at the same time experientially satisfying and way too abrupt. The gameplay, while tense, is repetitive and doesn't evolve, the difficulty is only scaled up by increasing the distance between bases. In fact, the minimalist retro-futuristic aesthetic and the sound design are all that holds this game together, but they constitute such a superb achievement of immersion that they are enough for me to absolutely recommend this game. This odd collection of 4 buttons, colourless dots on a screen and a couple of sound bites took me on a journey that I will have a really hard time forgetting any time soon.","November 25, 2015","true","2.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/303940/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Immersion is a tricky thing to get right, but when it works it can take a game much further than the gameplay alone. CAPSULE is an excellent example of this, because the presentation really carries the short and simple content. You play an unnamed spaceman stuck in a titular capsule, stranded in the depths of space. You have dwindling air and power supplies, and must find your way to curious outposts to survive and uncover the mysterious circumstances unfolding in the area. Along the way you'll find numerous points of interest that must be identified with a sonar system. Some will be resources, some will be debris, and some will be alive.\n\nAll of this plays out on a fuzzy, faded CRT display that looks ripped right from a Soyuz capsule. Much like with Deadnaut, you're experiencing the game through a low-fi monitor that leaves the true nature of the ships and creatures you encounter to your imagination. Some incredible sound design helps put you in the right place for it, too. Outposts buzz with static numbers and messages, satellites beep at you, and your capsule creaks and groans. Perhaps the most effective is your own breathing, which gets more choked and panicked as your oxygen runs low. With a good set of headphones in a darkened room, you can really start to convince yourself you're lost in space in a tin can.\n\nThe story is plenty interesting, told through logs at the different points of interest. Honestly it's probably good that the game is only an hour long because there's not much actual exploring to do, and the gameplay gets repetitive quite fast. Once you recognize the pattern to navigating, it can start to drag. That being said, the presentation and the story more than justify the time and money spent on this one.","October 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SweetJackal/recommended/303940/","SweetJackal","Sweet Jackal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SweetJackal/","679 products in account","The initial concept of CAPSULE is very simple but the execution is where it shines.\n\nThe game does an excellent job with the atmosphere and immersion.  They aren't joking when they say that if you have anxiety trigggers then this game might not be for you.  What should be a simple matter of managing your resources has some very surprising refinements and is complicated by the way the world reacts to you, the subtle signs, sounds and behaviours.  There is that very strong tension that comes from the warning that your fuel is low, or the gasping breaths as your oxygen supply runs out.\n\nThat said, there are some frustating points.  The world is randomly generated every time you leave a docking station along with a sensor ping.  This can lead to some cheap shots that cost you your resources.  Sometimes it feels like the difficulty randomly spikes because of the generation and the immersion is lost as you just accept your death to restart and try again, this can make the death sequence annoying after the first few times.\n\nStill, I enjoyed it and even after being able to manage my resources to maximum efficiently and accurately guess what things were based by their natural behavours and sound alone there were some heart pounding moments of near panic.\n\nThe game does very little to explain itself and instead leaves you, the player, to figure things out for yourself.  You only get the basic controls once at the start of the game.\n\nIn technical terms, the game is set to fixed video options.  It locks the aspect ratio of the game and gives you either Stretched Fullscreen (with blackness in the wasted space at the sides), Fullscreen (with blacknes around the game area) and Windowed mode.  It can be forgiven as it is a point behind the immersion.  You also cannot rebind controls.\n\nIf you enjoy games centered on immersion and place that above mechanics then I cannot reccomend CAPSULE any harder than I already am.  If you enjoy exploration and figuring things out for yourself then CAPSULE is a fun little title.  For mechanically focused players like myself, there are surprising refinements to be found and enjoyed.  If any of those sound don't sound appealing to you then CAPSULE may be more frustration than anything else.","May 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I absolutely love lo-fi sci-fi, I loved the graphics, the sound, the sense of loneliness. I loved everything, and was ready to praise the game, but then I moved to later stages. It gives you more and more distance to cover to the next objective, but gives no new content.\n\nAnd I found damn Shrieks and Drones just INFURIATING. I try to approach slowly and scan for resources, but then one of these show up and choke me in seconds. Sometimes jumpstart works randomly, other times I just die with full tanks of oxygen, failing to start like 10-15 times in a row. When I try to flee from enemies swearing like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I only run into more of them, to lose my direction and then just die again.\n\nWhen I started I thought Capsule would be the new best thing for me! I wanted to love the game, because it looked and felt great. I ended up hating it and cursing into the screen.\n\nGreat idea, great experience, amazing atmosphere, but damn frustrating and irritating game with clunky controls to make things even worse.","December 1, 2014","false","1.6"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","19","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midniteneon/recommended/303940/","midniteneon","midniteneon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midniteneon/","286 products in account","Wow, to think such a simple, familiar concept could be executed so well. Have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket?\n\nCapsule isn't a AAA title, but don't let that fool you, this game has more substance than anything else I've played, spare for a few titles.\n\nWhy? First of all, this game is a nostalgia trip. Think of all the great sci-fi and horror films of the 1960s-1980s mixed into one place, that being this game, Capsule. Capsule is a minimalistic survival horror game where you control what appears to be a submarine through a large, hostile environment via a radar screen. The GUI of the game itself looks like you're playing through an old CRT monitor left in a space ship for a few decades, complete with scan lines and vignette.\n\nOf the game's many strong points, the first off is the emotional sense this game leaves. In the store's description, it warns players that this game is potentially triggering towards people who suffer from misophonia-- the fear or hatred of certain sounds (more on sounds later.) Going into this game leaves you to wonder many things. This is a visual adventure, though through mostly your brain. Your imagination is what does most of the work while you play. The player is presented with familiar, and cold concepts such as: desperation, isolation, depression, mystery, fear of the unknown, and survival. Everybody will get different things from this game, but that's what I got out of it on my first playthroughs.\n\nThe game oozes of substance. Think of Alien, mixed with The Abyss, and some elements from 2001 and The Thing placed in, for good measure.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that you have to do what you can to survive. If you are easily bored, I would not recommend this game as it can be tedious, going from checkpoint to checkpoint. The fact that the basis of the game is pure survival is frightening; to envision an actual scenario where the goal was survival at any cost is equally terrifying, which is part of the reason why this game hits home.\n\nSimple controls, easy to use, hard to master. Learning to control power levels takes a bit of skill, as you could speed your way to the next checkpoint, saving oxygen, but draining power like a faucet, or take your time, saving power, but draining oxygen. Calculated, mature decisions will need to be made to ensure your survival during this game.\n\nVisuals are top notch, the retro-futuristic look of CRT monitors and clunky keyboards and tons of vector graphics has been achieved. If you appreciate the artwork of Moebius, Syd Mead, Ralph McQuarrie, or Ron Cobb, you will be right at home with the themes of this game. Though there's only mostly geometric shapes in the game, the mind paints a picture of what the objects are. I can imagine the "capsule" picking up oxygen tanks or bumping into lichen on rock formations on the sea floor.\n\nEnemy encounters are genuinely terrifying, and the fear factor of this game in general is pretty scary. The isolation and fear of the unknown come up a lot. The first time I encountered an enemy NPC I nearly exited the game, it was such a surprise to see (SPOILER) a fast moving square come at me. Okay, I lied about the spoiler, but beware-- tripping a radar wave alerts enemies to your presence, making you think twice about your searches. Also, when you run out of power, you are doomed to a fate of slow death by asphyxiation (unless you can restart your capsule.) The screen fades to black and your last checkpoint is reloaded. Very scary.\n\nSound design is my favorite part about the game next to the visuals. The creators of the game present a meticulous array of perfect sounds. From small things like thruster jets, to the big things like docking with a base, or bumping into lichen (or an enemy hehe) it's all there and paints a huge picture in your mind. You feel like it's actually happening and you're experiencing it (or at least, I did.) When you bump into lichen you can hear scraping noises that are muffled enough to convince you that maybe you hit a rock or large plant. The beeps and fuzz of the monitor were a small, albeit nice touch.\n\nAll in all, for $5 I would be hard pressed to find a better game to test my wits and scare the bejeezus out of me without doing much. Very short story though! :l\n\nSome final words, this game requires you to think, and isn't easy. Prepare to spend a long time retrying checkpoints. It's more of a mental experience than a traditional video game in that sense, but it's tons of fun, especially if you're in for a good scare.\n\n9/10","June 6, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I was not expecting a game like this to get my adrenaline pumping like that!!","November 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound effects (e.g. coughing, gasping for air right before you suffocate) add to the claustrophobic feeling of being inside a small vessel.\nThe goal for each level is to reach the next outpost before you run out of oxygen and fuel.\nManaging your oxygen and fuel resources while attempting to dodge enemies and hazards make for some tense and exciting gameplay.\nStory is told through communication logs between each level and is quite minimalistic and cryptic towards the end.\n\nGame length is short (~2 hrs to complete on first run) and there is no incentive to replay the game after it's finished. The game is initially difficult, but gets easier once you understand the enemy patterns. The key to this game is to move consistently and methodically and never rush through the levels.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy games with an immersive atomsphere, and don't mind its short length, this title is worth a try.","January 8","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, it starts out simple enough - you're learning about the environment and the limitations of your old space junker, and boy howdy do you have no idea what's gonna be store for you once you get past the first few stages, because once you do, you're gonna realize that your lackadasical behavior towards space survival is not going to be enough, and the game will houndlessly kill you until you learn how your ship works. Maybe ease off going full throttle so you don't run out of fuel and choke to death in space. Maybe don't pick up the Nitroxes, because they make your ship blow up. Maybe figure out how to jumpstart your ship when you run out of fuel. Hurry up, buddy. Your oxygen's disappearing.\n\nThe thing I really like about Capsule is that I became a pro at knowing what I could and couldn't do with my old piece of ♥♥♥♥ Capsule spaceship. I learned from it while I operated - it's reliable, but energy-hungry, and I eventually started tweaking how I operated the ship to get the most mileage out of it as I could. Once I started intimately knowing what my ship did at what speed, I easily beat the game. It's all about intuiting what your ship can and can't do. If you can't intuit, prepare to hear that asphyxiation noise before you restart a LOT.\n\nIt's five bucks, and judging from the mealy-mouthed complaining about how FLASH GAMES SHOULDN'T COST MONEY ON STEAM in the comments, it might be a bit higher than what you're expecting to pay? Hell, I don't know many people who find the idea of pretending to be in an extremely cramped spaceship desperately searching for a gulp of air before they die to be fun. I like it, but then again I'm a sour, depressed first-world problems having dork who thinks the concept of other people is a concept that should be set on fire.","May 19","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: A common trend thorughout this review will be my usage of the word "minimalism." The gameplay itself is very minimalistic; you've got five controls: throttle up and down, rotate left and right, and scan for debris. As the title and the trailer imply, you're basically trying to go from base to base in an attempt to escape from... something. Your escape pod (or capsule) will only keep you alive for so long, as the main character sucks oxygen in like a combustion engine. You can find oxygen in a few different cases: either in air pockets, in air tanks, or by ramming into a Dopter (an organism which ramming into will net you an achievement). For those of you who know a little bit about scuba diving, Nitrox (a mixture of Nitrogen and Oxygen to simulate air) doesn't increase your oxygen levels. Don't ask me why it doesn't; it may have been an oversight, but I cannot say for sure. The other thing you have to keep track of is your ship's fuel levels, which can be increased by either picking up Ion Vents or Fuel Cells. Ion Vortices, however, drain your fuel; a quality I learned firsthand.\n\nUntil you scan an item, you don't know for sure what it is, although some of the bigger targets have some telltale signs. Scanning items does take fuel, so there is an element of strategy. All of the items are randomly dispersed throughout the map, which gets to one of my big problems with the game on the gameplay perspective. I noticed a sort of rubberbanding in the rate of appearance. If you scan for things whenever you're topped off on Oxygen and Fuel, you'll find largely useless things. However, once you start dropping low, fuel and oxygen appear like crazy. It can kinda kill the atmosphere somewhat when you learn this, as it eventually becomes a game of "get low on everything and then go into a huge pile and top off."\n\nThe biggest thing that took me out of the atmosphere were the Shrikes, which have an alarming tendency to one-shot you. If I were to guess why this happens, I'd guess it was because of them being on top of you and you having no invincibility frames. That's just conjecture, though. Either way, there's nothing to take you out of the mood like being one-shotted on a longer run between checkpoints. Overall, regarding the atmosphere, I found that the earlier portions of the game were the best, as there was less chance of getting screwed over last minute. It's not the kind of game that I'd play all that often because of that. Raw gameplay isn't necessarily the focus here; atmosphere is, and atmosphere it does do very well, leading me to give this game a 7/10 for the gameplay.\n\nStory: The description of this game says that this is a "classic Sci-Fi story." Well, they weren't kidding. I wouldn't necessarily call it cliched, but it's certainly a story that's been done a fair bit. Rummaging through the messages reminded me of sifting through messages on terminals in Fallout 3, specifically Vault 87. Vault 87 was my favorite area in Fallout 3, so that's a good thing to be reminded of. When looking at the whole picture, this story's been done a fair few times in the past, but it's enjoyable enough here. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Minimalism. There's that word again. The game is viewed from the screen of your escape pod, which lends one hell of a great deal to the atmosphere. Other things that add to it are the representations of everything as being blips on a radar, the frosting over of the CRT display, the refresh line, the afterglow of phosphors... a great deal of attention has been put into this game from the visual side of things, and I certainly can appreciate that. 5/5.\n\nMusic: Minimalism. There's that word again. Yes, I did intentionally re-use the first two sentences again. That's because this game understands that pure silence can do so much more for atmosphere than harsh orchestration can. It works perfectly for the environment as well, given that you're in the dead of space with nothing but the hum of the engines and the sound of yourself gasping for air. Hearing monsters, specifically Shrikes, is a little weird given that sound can't travel through space, but I'll let it slide since it was an artistic decision. 5/5.\n\nOverall score is 7/7/5/5; 8.0/10. Despite a lot of frustrating instances regarding gameplay, the atmosphere more than made up for it. It's such a surreal feeling when you find yourself begging for air or fuel when that's what the player character would be begging for as well. $5 is pretty worth it for a fairly unique atmosphere and certainly unique gameplay that may work better for you than it did for me.","June 1, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can pick up air pockets and fuel cells from the various debris you scan (with Spacebar). The problem arises from the hit-or-miss game mechanics that rely mostly on dumb luck. You'll be mostly trying to refuel or fill your oxygen while space drones and these things called "Shrikes" persue you and drain your fuel. You lose your fuel and you stop in your tracks.\n\nNow this is my biggest problem with the game: The restarting of the engines. When you run out of fuel, you won't be able to move until you prime your engine and try to restart it. The way I see it, whether the ship starts going again or not is decided by a dice roll which may not be on your side. You'll be trying to move again and again without results as you run out of oxygen and eventually die. This becomes rather infuriating as you may have a full oxygen tank but won't be able to start the ship before it completely runs out.\n\nIt doesn't help that from the second station on, almost every damn bleep on the radar is a hostile trying to take you out and it takes around 3-4 seconds for the radar to identify nearby objects.\n\nThe atmosphere, while minimal, is very nicely created. There is always a sense of looming death surrounding you and reaching that next station can become quite a stressful ordeal.\n\nAll in all, it's a cool little game with interesting atmosphere but the gameplay falls short and relies too heavily on dumb luck in order to proceed. Fortunately, you'll reach the end before it gets all too much. If you've got the patience, try this one out on a sale.\n\nP.S This game will make you fear the word Shrike for the rest of your life.","September 3, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you watched the trailer and read the description? That's what you get. Solid sound design, a rather minimal aesthetic choice, and simple gameplay.\n\nThe story is a bit on the light side, and while this can partly be attributed to the game's interface (between the choice of more story or maintaining immersion, the decision to opt for the latter is better) and the creative freedom allowed by ambiguity, a message or two more per outpost about the anomaly or further fleshing out the personnel at the outposts would have been nice.\n\nSimilarly, the ending makes sense within the context of the game, but provides very little information about what happened. I was ever so slightly hesitant to reach the final destination, tempted into making a decision remiscent of the ending of The Thing, where perhaps my survival is less important than ensuring this unknown remains isolated in a wasteland. I didn't, though, because I wanted to see what the creator's conclusion to this story was. And my reaction to the ending was a "What have I done?" Not in the sense of a horrific revelation, but more disoriented confusion. There's potential room for a sequel, and I'd buy it if it gets made, although I'm not especially expecting one.\n","January 2","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire game is played from the vantage point of being trapped in a small pod, floating your way from checkpoint to checkpoint, gathering fuel and air, and avoiding hazards and monsters. It's such a huge soul drain when you begin running low on fuel and your next sonar ping activates a Shrike :(\n\nI enjoyed this game, but I feel that there is definitely more to be done here. I like the concept of the game, and the execution of it nearly nails it. But I feel that, in order to be immersive enough to truly capture the feel that it needs to bring, a port (or a direct rewrite) needs to be made for the Oculus Rift. If the game were played through the OR, the inside of the capsule could be rendered, giving the necessary claustrophobic feel that the game is desiring. This would also make directional sound better (when a Drone hits you from the left, the bump on the capsule would be heard from the left).\n\nIn general, this game was quite good for the short duration that it lasted.\n8/10, would suffocate in my pod again.","July 4, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You find yourself with a capsule with limited ion fuel and air supply.\n\nUsing your sonar you slowly uncover mysteries.\n\nThe game is very simple, but really immersive and definitely worth playing.
