The music is quite nice. The voice acting is actually surprisingly good. The lines they're voicing are fine if you take them as two characters who are not particularly worried about anything. The only thing that worries me is how long the game will be until I end up completing it. There's only Easy and Normal difficulty so I can only hope that maybe there is a New Game+ mode of some sort.\n\nHowever, based on what I've played thus far- I've found a game that I'm not tempted immediately to refund.\n\nCheck out a youtube video- see if you may like it. It's worth a try in my opinion.","June 3","true","6.5"," 72 of 110 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","72","110","6","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vecturin/recommended/380750/","vecturin","АlphaWhelp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vecturin/","1028 products in account","The video trailer in my opinion gives a pretty poor opinion about what this game is actually like.  It's a combo based action game like Devil May Cry or similar types of stuff.  You have a basic combo or whatever, and then eventually it'll end, but you can switch characters to keep the combo going.  There are skills that will help you follow enemies and keep the hit count up.  Every so often, you hit a combo threhshold that permanently increases your damage by 10%, so the better your combos, the more damage you do.  You lose significant damage buff if you get hit, so it's a win=win more, lose=lose harder type of rewarding system that really plays to the type of person who can attack enemies relentlessly while not getting hit in the process because mindless button mashing.\n\nThis is actually the second Anima: Beyond Fantasy based Video Game.  The first is called Anima: Ark of Sinners, but it is a totally separate side story that has nothing to do with this game.  If you're not familiar with Anima: Beyond Fantasy, a lot of people will probably tell you it's some Final Fantasy-inspired P&P RPG, but the truth is, it's got way more inspiration from Xenogears than anything else.  There is quite a bit of backstory that players not familiar with the RPG won't know about, but they are not necessary to understand the plot of the game.  The significance of some characters like Romeo Exxet might be lost on you, but overall it's not a huge deal to the plot of the game itself.\n\nIt has a slow start, but it's very good if you give it a chance.  After the first few stages is when you unlock the game proper and gain access to skill trees for both characters and such.  It has a little RPG style elements, obviously, but it's still predominantly an action game.  I highly recommend checking this out.  If you like the game and want more, I highly recommend checking out the P&P Anima: Beyond Fantasy game which is among one of my favorite P&P RPGs.  Just be aware it's a Spanish game, the English-translation is kind of mediocre, and being European, the rules are fairly crunchy.","June 4","true","4.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

The graphical execution is meh, but they nailed the Anima Look from an aesthetic point of view. Combat is brisk and fun, kind of DMC-Lite.\n\nAnd it *feels* like Anima: Beyond Fantasy to me. Which was all I wanted. YMMV\n\n(EDIT)\n\nIt reminds me of Nier, with its weirdness, talking book companion and shifting camera angle. I consider that to be extraordinarily high praise - that game was criminally underrated.","June 3","true","2.1"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","27","34","4","2"

It's all over the place and very little of it is good. It's tolerable, sure, but it could have been so much better.\nThe combat is kind of dull. I really dug the idea of switching back and forth between the characters, but untill I have the chance to unlock the later tiers of abilities, I don't know how fun that will actually be.\n\nThe good.\nThe music is wonderful and fits the atmosphere of the various areas perfectly.\nThe overall setting and atmosphere of the game is wonderfully presented.\nThe story is familiar enough to ease me into the world of Anima, but unique enough to keep me interested.\n\nOverall, this is a good, if just shy of great, game. There's some slight technical issues that I'd like to see addressed. (Why can't I use the D pad in menus on my 360 controller?) but they are annoyances, and nothing too serious.\n\nI'd say, if you want to try a bizzare cross between and older Devil May Cry game and a traditional JRPG, this is worth $20.","June 3","true","8.6"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","25","34","3","9"

Unfortunately, the bugs are also there, including one where if you die then continue your character is revived with no health and that stops them from being able to interact with the world. You can't go to the next area, talk to people etc. I managed to switch chars to continue but when I tried talking it switched back to the (dead) chick and the game pretty much froze.\n\nBut even for all that, I can really tell there's a lot of soul put into this and I'm getting a kick diving into the world. The action is quite nice, but I would say that's not the jewel of the game as the story is really shining brighter. So this may not be your cup of tea if you dislike story in games.","June 4","true","6.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anyanyany/recommended/380750/","anyanyany","anyanyany","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anyanyany/","104 products in account","Great Game  (3rd of June 2016 review)\n\nNormally i rate my games on their choice of music and whether it fits in with the theme but this game's music is absolutely outstanding. The game is so beautiful i took 50 screenshots within the first hour of playing it. The story is interesting,  You begin your journey as the bearer who is a female that has been cursed with the power of a monster that you are told wanted to destroy the world. This monster was sealed away in a book and given to the bearer for her to unlock his hidden powers and use them to stop the woman in red. You are then taken away to a place that limits your powers meaning you need to unlock them one by one through levelling up.  You find many pieces of text telling the background of the messengers which are needed to be read in some areas in order to progress, the puzzles are fun and the platforming is great.\n\nAnother interesting thing this game includes is it's use of camera angles. The normal camera angle when you're roaming is 3rd person but sometimes when you enter a room, the game likes to switch it up and make the view top-down for the room, or another time you're searching for a way to go and you enter this area which gives you a 3D side-scroller camera angle. It's interesting to see the game from different angles when you're beating up enemies, especially since it's in 3D whilst giving you the usuall 2D camera views.\n\nThere are a few bugs here and there,  such as for example climbing up onto some rubble and then jumping out of the map through the gap in the building within the cathedral in the 2nd messenger's area  or enemies not being able to walk down a set of stairs making them get stuck and easily killed with magic abilities, but those are probably going to be fixed soon.\n\nIn conclusion, looks pretty, including a launcher that you can set your graphics settings, amazing music and an interesting story with good voice acting, however the protagonist female could have been done much better i think. The main things that bother me are that i cannot have 1920x1200 graphics on windowed mode, only allows up to 1680x1050, the there is no windowed borderless mode, a few bugs which need to be fixed since they can get you out of the map and when reading the stories of the messengers, the female's narration is different from the text. Which can get very confusing sometimes and you can get lost in the text. Other than that the game is a must buy for Anime RPG lovers. And for those of you wondering: yes, Cr1tikal does voice act in this game, he is the  Zero Mask .\n\n"Romeo! Romeo!

It certainly displays how Anima feels with the casual use of existential barriers and destruction on a temporal level and offers an interesting perspective lorewise. The Bearer's voice is very flat for a protagonist, no wonder she's got no name, but I personally enjoy the likes of Ergo Mundus's lewdness and Zero Mask being voiced by Cr1tikal/Charlie, as well as Romeo Exxet's narration. Combat is enjoyable, though I'm admittedly not the best at this. The camera sensitivity on a mouse and keyboard really is insane though, I had to drop it to about -36 to get it to an acceptable level of not spinning my screen three times with every motion, but it being a fixable problem is good enough for me to give it a pass. It's still awkward on a keyboard set-up for me but that's my personally being better with controllers than a game fault.\n\nThe art style is questionable in some areas, primarily some of the faces, but the environment looks beautiful and I don't mind the models after sufficient exposure. I'm disappointed this game didn't get all the funding it wanted and it shows with freeze framed cutscenes and nowhere near all 21 Messengers being actually within this game, though at least a respectable selection of ones yet to be revealed in-depth within the tabletop were chosen. All in all, the plot offers an interesting perspective of the Empire's ♥♥♥♥ed situation and characterizes several important figures in Gaia, while simultaneously making for an engaging story so far.\n\nNew Challenge: Defeat Jonathan with melee only. Nothing is impossible. Just do it.","June 4","true","4.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

Ergo's constant use of "baby" in the beginning of the game really had me questioning whether or not voice acting would have been a good choice, but now that I'm getting into the meat of the game, I can see now that the earlier segments were just a little off.\n\nNow, there are times when you can definitely tell the recording equipment that was used was not the best, since I have encountered about five times when certain words come out too "staticy" akin to when you hold your  mouth too close to your mic and speak.\n\nAlso, the combat is very fluid, responsive, and reminds me of Legend of Zelda with their targeting sytem. HOWEVER, I can say that the knockback and need for using Dodge in combat is quite frustrating.\n\nThe three bosses I have fought so far have been challenging, but not too tough that I couldn't go back to earlier areas and do some leveling.\n\nAll in all, as a Kickstarter backer I am thoroughly impressed with the game so far and can't wait to see how the game will end.","June 4","true","19.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Based on a Franchise of tabletop games (Anima: Beyond Fantasy being the TRPG), Anima: Gate of Memories is an attempt at an action RPG that is an excellent game for the price.\n\nPros:\nFun action gameplay\nInteresting enemies\nPRETTY AS ALL ♥♥♥♥\nNeat little level-up tree for each character, allowing you to spec them out as you choose\nA good amount of time, I estimate I am 1/6th or 1/7th of the way through the game.\n\nCons:\nVoice Acting needs work - the voice actors seem to lack direction at times, or are unsure of context.\nOccasional bugs - I have had two bugs that required me to revert to a checkpoint and one CTD.  That said, the game autosaves frequently, mitigating the effects of this\nNeeds optimization - The 'Pretty as all ♥♥♥♥' comes at a clear cost.  I was dropping frames regularily during my gameplay, though my graphics card is out of date and I was also streaming at the time.  Still, it could use some work on that end probably.\n\n\nI'd give this a 7.5/10 overall, and a 9/10 in its price category.

The story takes a while to get into, the voice acting physically hurts my ears and the combat is meh. It doesn't make you care about the characters at all, and the RPG aspect is pretty weak.

Enemies vary little. I want to give it more of a chance but it doesn't look very promising. The only reason I bought it was because Cr1tikal voice acts in it. I feel bad for him.
