I really enjoy the turn-based battles and the different ways you can use your troops. The writing is weird and funny and actually really great. Your protagonist basically likes everybody and is willing to go on super random quests just because some random lizardman/skeleton/orc/witch/whatever asked her to.  although at one point she does call an owl a "stupid chicken", which for some reason made me laugh for five straight minutes\n\nHighly Recommended.","February 14, 2014","true","54.1"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","37","41","15","0"

This is exactly what happened to me when I have finished King's Bounty: The Legend. The game was not perfect, but I have grown fond of her and did not nearly have enough. At that moment I had to have more, so I have taken up on Armored Princess.\n\nAfter finally finishing the installation and starting the game a feeling of familiarity spreads inside me. However the game is little too familiar. How would it not be when it uses the same engine as The Legend and changes only little. Developers went as far as to using the same models and pieces of artwork as in The Legend. As you have probably guessed, the first impression was not one of the best. However do not let appearences fool you, the important thing is here. New challenges, locations and even few units.\n\nThe story continues few years after the happenings from The Legend, where you have (have you?) succesfully saved the World from demon invasion. However peace was soon to fade, after the hero left to seek adventure in other dimensions, demon army have returned with newfound strenght. At this point you take control of princess Amelie and set on a quest to find the old hero and bring him back. Same as in The Legend, story provides nice background to the exploring and fighting, developers follow the example set in The Legend and provide you with plenty of texts and bits of humor.\n\nSo should you get the game or not? If you are new to the series I would first grab either The Legend  so that you can follow up on story, but it is not necessary. And if you have played The Legend and liked it, you should definitely get it, because it takes everything that was good on The Legend and adds some polish.","January 1, 2014","true","70.5"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zompist/recommended/3170/","zompist","zompist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zompist/","154 products in account","This game is really quite charming-- cute colorful graphics, nice animations-- but also fairly challenging. It's turn-based combat, more like Civ than any RPG. You can run five creatures at any time; you'll have your favorites, but as you have to buy replacements and the supply varies by region, you'll end up trying quite a few different fighters.  (It might be overwhelming if you had to learn them all at once, but you get introduced to them region by region.)  It's very satisfying to win a battle with no losses.\n\nKing's Bounty seems to be largely remaking the game every couple of years... the next game, Warriors of the North, is very very similar to this one.  Given that, might as well go with Amelie who is more fun than the barbarian hero of the other game.","June 17, 2014","true","210.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

It plays much like Might and Magic in terms of the view and interaction with gold,Treasure and packs of monsters. The graphics are better and has a good soundtrack. The difference between this and M&M is the use of castles and keeps. The castles here are really places to recrui different types of monsters or soldiers, you dont upgrade elements of it during gameplay this game is more bout the battles. You can also run around the map as much as you like as there are no turns during exploration only during combat\n\ncombat follows a turn based approach where it goes into a grid mode and you move and attack then the enemy does the same, The game is a much faster paced game than the might and magic franchise and looks great.\n\nThoroughly enjoying it","November 13, 2014","true","21.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I'll make my review positive only for that, because I don't like this sequel. Here is why: the overall story is really bad.\nWhen I say bad, I mean REALLY BAD. The dialogs are cranky and jokes mostly based on the fact that the main character is a woman. Isn't that bad enough for you? Well, remember that box full of guardians you had in The Legend, which was so much powerfull back up for the main plot? Here you got a pet dragon! Yeah, you get him RIGHT on the beggining a-and... nothing. It's just same box, but looks like a dragon. No dialogs, no cool sense of something awesome (because you always can have a dragon or two in your army... i mean, seriously, just a dragon?). Yeah it's cute, so if you like ponies or something you can get the fun of it (before he become grown up).\nSo I'd better buy The Legend again and play it one more time (plus to another 2 times i played it before). I still return to this game sometimes to fight the battle or two, but I can do it by playing HoMM3 with my friend, which is more preferable.","July 25, 2014","true","5.6"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

I loved the original (The Legend) back when it was first released, although it did start to get a bit repetitive as time went on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vimsey/recommended/3170/","Vimsey","Vimsey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vimsey/","181 products in account","This is an old school turn based RPG game.\n\nThe storyline isnt going to knock your socks off but the gameplay will.  There are many different tactics to win battles even within one class and there are 3 to choose from.\n\nHow you build your army often dictates your tactics and vice versa.  The locations of items and spells are random so you wont always get the same items or spells available making it a very different game every time you play it.\n\nThe only downside to me is once you get deeply immersed and want to get the best score or go for a no loss playthrough then you do have to adopt an element of cheesyness like running past encounters to get access to better items and armies.  But the game has already got you by the balls at that point.  Enjoy.\n\nFor people who have Kings bounty I liked the improvements they made with this sequel.  The classes are a lot more balanced out and the rage system improved.\n\nOh and crossworlds is essentially this game with a lot of extras so if you can afford that I would recommend getting that as well rather than think of buying it later.","December 21, 2013","true","299.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Faithful to the old King's Bounty and Heroes of Might and Magic games, great music, tons of stuff to do, meticulously crafted environments and enemy placement, and quite a challenge at the harder difficulties.\n\nCrossworlds is not that great of an expansion to Armored Princess. The new Orcs and the adrenaline system feel tacked on as the three classes have little to benefit them as they do for the other units in the game. Balance is stil a bit of an issue. The mage is still the best class in the game (although not nearly as broken as in The Legend), dwarven units are far too strong, and the upper tier human units still feel somewhat invulnerable. Still, there's little reason not to get all three games (The Legend, Armored Princess, Crossworlds) if you're thinking of picking up what is probably a swan song to New World Computing's classic.","December 27, 2011","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Completely average and muddled with uneven difficulty, this might be worth picking up if you're a fan of HoMM.","December 11, 2012","true","43.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timmyfish/recommended/3170/","timmyfish","timmyfish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timmyfish/","143 products in account","King's Bounty is a suprisingly lavish production: an entire, non-linear world to explore, filled to the brim with vast armies to fight.  Its turn-based gameplay is surprisingly deep and varied, and in between battles you have the freedom to explore the map and hunt for treasure. It has addictive RPG mechanics and dozens of hours of playtime. Its story is grand, although it is told primarily through text. It's beautifully designed and fun to play. There are also drawbacks though. The game doesn't do a good job explaining its systems. Figuring out morale, leadership and stacking can be a challenge. My biggest problem was with the blatant misogyny in the story though. In the world of King's Bounty, women are defined by what men want from them. Quests involve saving women, changing their appearance to make them suitable lovers, giving them gifts and proving their suitor's worth, more than once even convincing women to give their misogynistic stalkers another chance (or optionally, kidnapping them). The relationships in the game are possessive, superficial, and even abusive. The player can not intervene, only support them or choose to remain neutral (which costs you). Even the protagonist, Princess Amelie, has to convince her father to let her save the world by either pouting or throwing a tantrum. After she saves the world from demons, she is effectively told that her primary duty is to marry and have kids. The game does not critique this nor allow the player to critique it. It's even part of the gameplay: female warriors can have the 'beautiful' stat which causes men to miss them, Amelie can wear dresses into battle, and in one of the standalone expansions, you can pick a wife and her babies will give you bonuses. Women in KBAP are shown as shallow, greedy, treacherous and dependent wretches. Those who are supposed to be sympathetic are obedient martyrs. But I guess the cover gives it away: Amelie's 'armor' is obviously designed with something other than battle in mind. So, good game, but so ♥♥♥♥ed up that I'm not going to recommend it. Yes, I think sexism is a bigger concern than whether games are good.","November 30, 2013","false","49.0"," 32 of 96 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","32","96","0","2"

Since we're at it, while in the first game the mage was one of the best choices, here in Armored Princess it's the hardest class ever. If you don't wanna have a headache, I'd say go for the warrior class, it's always a safe bet. As for the "special powers", instead of having a Rage Box, this time you're gonna have your own personal dragon to assist you on your quest. There're plenty of troops for you to choose, many special items and countless side quests as well. Either way, if you're not really a games collector nor you're purchasing the whole franchise's pack, I strongly advise you to get the "Crossworlds" version instead of this one alone, as it comes with this game included and also an expansion for it.

This time you are stuck with a dragon pet; which isn't the same as the summons from the box in the first game, but does the job all right. You play as the princess from The Legend and you engage in the same battles, same type of story and same type of locales. This would be bad if the first game wasn't a lot of fun, but it was and thus Armored Princess is more of a good extension of a great game. If you played The Legend and loved it and want more of it, Armored Princess is for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/3170/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","In King’s Bounty: Armored Princess you take on the role of Princess Amelie in a time period set after ‘The Legend’ in which the previous hero left to seek out other worlds and find new treasures. In the hero’s absence, the demon Baal invades your world in an act of revenge (for being banished by the hero in the previous game) and through a slight accident, you are sent to another world instead of the royal advisor. Upon arriving there, you discover that you are the prophesized daughter of the gods and are tasked with retrieving 7 stones scattered across various islands.\n\nGameplay in Armored Princess is very similar to ‘The Legend’ and returning players will find the new changes very easy to adapt to. Instead of a chest of rage with 4 spirits, you now get a single dragon who learns a slew of different special abilities. Also unlike the chest of rage, the dragon is actually useful throughout the entire game except for boss battles, where dragon use is disabled. Another new addition is the use of “wanderer” magic, spells that can be cast on the world map that give you a buff lasting a set number of battles.\n\nI found the game’s interpretation of risk, where enemy armies are ranked by their leadership, to be very misleading as some heroes that had ranks of “impossible” or “lethal” late game were pretty much a pushover for easy XP and gold. Had I realized this sooner I probably could have shaved another ten hours off my playthrough. Additionally, the game seemed kind of small with its “buffet table” style of serving up different locales across an archipelago (compared to the huge areas in the previous game). There are also various graphical glitches and typos throughout the game, and some of the writing is a bit hackneyed.\n\nThat being said, Armored Princess is a fun-enough sequel to ‘The Legend’ and is worth picking up, especially since it frequently goes on sale for less than $5!\n","November 8, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, you need to advance in rank to handle more difficult adversaries. However, there's no way to level-grind and there's a limited number of adversaries.  I'd suggest playing once for 5-10 hours, figure out a few things, read a guide, then start over. When you start over, get a good troop mix and try winning with no losses.\n\n3.

There is a lot of mildly aggravating back-and-forth time spent finding units available for hire to replenish one's troops, as well as finding enemy parties weak enough to assault without taking catastrophic losses.\n\nAlthough the story is not the focus of the game, I enjoyed the writing. There is a sarcasm and a cynicism about government authority and an irreverent sense of humor throughout. The story comes satisfyingly full-circle in the end, with a victory of the now fully-developed hero over the enemy who had threatened destruction in the beginning of the game.\n\nThough the plot is almost entirely devoid of choices, and the player ought to accept and complete as many quests as possible along the way in order to level-up, there is room in the selection of units and of player class to style your hero according to your personality. For example, playing as a Paladin, I used mostly human units (from among the several races) and made efforts to protect and/or revive as many of my fighters as possible during each battle.\n\nThe music is quite good, particularly the Sacred Quest / Sacred Campaign / Siege theme (the latter of which, the combat incarnation of the theme, imparted an epic quality when it kicked off at the start of the final battle).\n\nEDIT: Oh, and as others say, you should buy the "Crossworlds" version of the game rather than this one, as it includes some additional content.","June 15, 2015","true","108.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quick to load and not a single crash while playing. I found the mage a little hard going for the first third of the game (lots of island jumping to find mobs I could beat) but once she had some descent spells it was plain sailing. Don't worry about losing units in this game. There're plenty and lots of money to buy new ones. The last boss battle was relatively easy and finished with units you could buy from the nearby keep.","May 26","true","102.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just can't quit you...\n\nKBAP, otherwise known as, KBAP, is the long long overdue sequel to King's Bounty, and the predecessor for the Hero's line of games. I don't really feel like getting into depth here, so let's do a TLDR version.\n\nGood,\nConstant challenge, fun "mini" game of kiting strong enemies when exploring in order to get access to powerful stuff early on.\nWays to cheese the early game if you are patient enough by grinding spells/rage use in the easier battles.\nJust overall a great meta game, no play through feels the same, since all the gear and available armies to recruit are randomized. You learn to work with what you got, or get pummeled. Or just restart.\n3 different ways to play, so it seems. Mages sure to kill all the way up to the late game, then spell damage just won't keep up. Though it's still possible to dominate, you just need to focus more on status magic and summons first. Fighter is easy mode, except when facing bosses. Pally, I dunno, end game was just a weaker fighter. Seriously, that resurrection focus blows because the best troupes can't be resurrected, the spell may not even appear in game, and uses SO much mana.\n\nIs this a proper game review? Probably not. Anyway, it's super addictive, goes on about ten hours longer than it should, and has quite a lot of depth to it. I was 200+ hours in and still learning stuff about the game mechanics. A must by for strategy buffs.\n\nheh, forgot the cons:\nrandomized game elements can Eff up a 30 hour game or so, and the mid game is hell, for around 5 fights or so.","May 26","true","318.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
