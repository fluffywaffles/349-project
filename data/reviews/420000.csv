Yes and no. Read on for more info.\n\nSince they don't show you a full-screen screenshot, you can't see how badly the texture qualities are. Many of the textures go onto surfaces wrong and you can't correct it either. If you're thinking of buying this for fun, then you're probably better off just buying the Sims.\n\nUpdate: If you are buying it for fun (as opposed to professional reference and useage) then you would be better off to buy the game I mentioned. There are other tools like this one out there that you can get for free and this one in particular is also available on iOS and Android from what I've read.\n\nThere is no denying the tools usefulness, but better textures and more customization items would be good too. But that's me being picky.\n\nCan you lay out a room plan with this product?\nYes.\nYou can work to accurate measurements based on your room. The tool does what it's for, but it could have been improved upon.\n\nThere are 10 items in Home Design 3D which are unlocked via liking the Dev's Facebook page.\n\nAnd since a commenter asked me to suggest any other programs that do the same or better, there is  a program called Sweethome 3D. It's the only one I recall the name of right now, but there are android apps and according to one of the other reviews here, Home Design 3D here is a port from that app. Wether it costs on the appstore or not I can't tell you, but if you Google for home design or interior design apps, a few recommended apps come up above the rest of the results.\n\nIf you're willing to do a few Googles or search the Android and Apple App stores, you'll come across programs much like this and save yourself some money.","November 21, 2015","false","0.7"," 158 of 195 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","158","195","6","14"

Here are some missing features:\n- No simple vector drawings - every wall has to have a non-zero thickenss, which makes drawing a flat based on interior measurements a nightmare.\n- There can't be rooms within rooms - it's not allowed\n- No multi-select\n- Cannot manually punch in the length of a wall\n\nI also encountered a glaring bug 5 minutes into using the program: For whatever reason, the program will try to drag me to the edge of the drawing board. The only solution is to close the program and re-open.\n\nI might as well use Paint.NET to draw my flat.\n\nNote: I didn't spend 8 hours on this program. I simply have it minimized for 7.5 hours.\n\nEdit: This program has a functionality to split walls under "Create a new angle" option. This can help with creating more complex rooms. The developers also seem pretty active in addressing concerns for now. I am willing to withdraw this negative review if the program improves substantially after a few patches.","November 22, 2015","false","9.4"," 109 of 134 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","109","134","8","2"

Shift+click does not let you select multiple walls. Shift+move does not allow you to adjust an entire room keeping its original proportions. Instead you move one corner of the room regardless of which command key you press while moving a corner, making it impossible to easily manipulate rooms. You cannot place a room inside of another room, meaning that you have to put up individual walls, which also is not easy. You put up one wall with the intended length, and then the wall next to it magnet clips onto the INSIDE edge, meaning you have to add half the width of your wall to the length of the wall you're currently placing. This occurs irrespective of your choice of magnet clipping in the settings option. It should connect to the outside edge of the wall so that your inside measurement stays the same (this is particularly important for odd widths of walls since you cannot make walls through half inch intervals). To make matters worse, once two walls have connected against your will, they still have two different drag points, so moving the corner does not move both walls, once again making it impossible to easily adjust corners. Additionally, measurements do not update as you're dragging the wall, so you have to guess where the right placement is. Never purchase this program. Zero thought went into its production. Right clicking does nothing, when it could have added additional functionality. They obviously wanted the program to be highly flexible, but then don't make easy alternatives to painstaking and difficult modifications. Shift, cntrl, right click, any of these could have been utilized to successfully create a program that is both flexible and easy. They had obviously never used Photoshop or GIMP, which both have incredibly intuitive interfaces, from which these programmers could have learned. This program is a prime example of why you need not just UI programmers, but UX experts who design the program for the UI programmers to realize. 0/10.","May 15","false","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I definatly reccomend this software.","December 3, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It takes just about less than hour to figure out how it works and then the fun begins. Switching to back and fort between 2D/3D views is very smooth and fast. Navigation works. One other thing that makes usage even easier; language support. For Even Finnish.\n\nIt has some issues with selection stuff though. Sometimes area screens down to red marginal and stays there. Something it shouldn’t be doing on it’s own. In 3D view sometimes the image angle bends objects into interesting abstract shapes.\n\nWish there was variety of European windows and door types too.","November 23, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","3"

For the price, this is a great program.  Whether you are moving to a new house, or want to rearrange your current house, you can find almost every piece of furniture, windows, and doors, or atleast something similar.  This is very simple to use with a lot of potential.

Observations and comments, whether positive or negative, are entirely my own. If you would like me to review an app, check out: fiverr dot com slash ThatAwesomeTerr.\n\nI wouldn't classify this as a "game". That being said, Home Design 3D does serve as a very snappy planning and visualization tool for room layout and decoration.\n\nIt feels like it might be a port of a mobile app. As such, it's system requirements seem fairly light. But, it's interface has some quirks.\n\nMost of these interface quirks stem from a lack of direction given to the user. Case in point, it took me a few tries to realize that I had to double-click to open projects. A better example is dragging the camera around. Normally, I would expect the mouse cursor to change into a hand as a kind of prompt or indicator that such an action can be performed. Instead, the mouse cursor stays a pointer. I think it could do with the occasional informative pop-up, but in my opinion a full-blown tutorial would be overkill.\n\nAll in all, though, it didn't take me very long to get comfortable with the app. The learning curve is very shallow. For instance, I was able to re-create the floor plan of my whole apartment in less than 15 minutes, complete with furniture.\n\nPerhaps my most favoured feature (besides how easy I found it to use) was it's selection of fields of view. There's a 2D "top-down" view, a 3D isometric view, and a first-person view. I found all of them very useful for planning and visualization.\n\nIf you're the type of person who's looking for ideas on redecorating your apartment or house, or looking to try out some renovation ideas, it's a VERY useful tool.","December 1, 2015","true","5.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Not sure about the £6.99 price tag but upon use, the application appears very sophisticated and easy to use. I use a mix of keyboard/mouse and touchscreen devices. Despite it being easier on a keyboard and mouse, the touchscreen use in this app still worked inuitively. The application is not for professional use, despite some reviewers writing reviews as if it was. Granted the application is not perfect and the choice of furnishings and objects is lacking heavily with minimal choices. However, this app is a life-saver when redesigning a room or a house and beats the old pencil and paper method as the digital version can be shared across devices through steam and screenshot images.\nI have used this application on multiple projects at redesigning rooms and at work and it has impressed many people.","April 22","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its done as though it was a rush port over from and android app and it works simular and it has absolutly no functionality in wich a personal computer was ment for. This program has the basic 3 dimensional equations mostly programed but it is has no algabra added into the algorythin... A wall mounted tv for example... I cam place it, I can change the size of it I can change the width of it and I can even change the height of it.. But I cannot change the view angle at wich it is mounted on the wall.. only good for simple design ideas only, this program has no fuacility to house any real architecture or blue printing capabilities, nor could it even be close to an engineering plan. you could make a rough picture with this, but it takes way to long to enter all the measurements to make it worth it becuase you cant enter fractions of an inch to be correct and in MOST designs- require much percision  or the whole plan will be changed. so its faster to draw it on paper and hand it to an architect. it has no facilities for electrical, plumbing, foundation, ventilation, heating, insulation, roof work, crawl spaces or attic accesses. does not take into account vaulted ceilings half doors, or trim/brickmolding or crown molding, light switches, electrical outlets, breaker box and cleanout drain or anything exterior. the selection of appliances is appauling and it is MOST certainly NOT worth to buy or the time to enter the measurements , in fact the The SIMS 3 ingame builder FAR more sophisticated and is cheaper to buy, easier & quicker to use. I am brash on this review becuase of the User Interface... I cant stand port overs to PC.  then they want an outragoues amount for it. and then they wonder why people pirate software.
