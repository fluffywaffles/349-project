I was bored and looking for a "snack" game, which I'd be able to play with minimum mental capacity. Aside the story being purely lame and the ending being anticlimactic, Nearwood's been a feast within its genre.\n\nThe curtain opens up for us to meet Jane Lockwood, the only daughter of Nathan and Elizabeth Lockwood. Apparently, Jane's mother died out of a sickness and her father disappeared mysteriously just after, leaving Jane to be raised by her aunt. Growing up with many strange dreams of a magical realm, Jane finally decides to go back to the house that she lived with her parents when she was little, to learn more about her past.\n\nThere, a strange little man - either a gnome or a goblin - named Fey welcomes her back and invites her to the mysterious realm of Nearwood: a fairy realm that apparently little Jane and her parents lived in when she was younger. As a quite expected outcome, Jane seems to be the hero that Nearwood's been waiting for. Only she will be able to reveal the mystery of her past and mend the damage done to the realm!\n\nOkay, after swimming in the sea of clichés that stands as a storyline, we should talk about the display: OMG, visuals are plain marvelous in this game!!! Beautiful effects, gorgeous backgrounds in vibrant colors and lovely character designs as if it's all just out of a fairytale book. Environment design being always unique and imaginative, Nearwood manages to set a light and magical tone for you to experience. Added with quite elaborate character designs and good voice acting, this silly magical realm is worthy for you to experience even for the sake of art only.\n\nNothing stands out much for the gameplay though, but we wouldn't expect anything imaginative from a HOG/FROG at this point. We know what we are getting ourselves into when we are buying a HOG: we run around in a predetermined area, collect items, solve some puzzles and call it a day by completing a cheesy story. Oh, wait: puzzles ARE imaginative and interesting, most of them being quite challenging! If you'd refuse skipping puzzles and complete the brief bonus chapter, Nearwood offers you a 4-5 hour gameplay which is quite fair.\n\nThis is a lovely game for you to kill a couple of hours, admire some lovely scenery and call it a day. Hey, if you have kids, I'd vouch for the game being kid friendly too. After your second hour and 40th snoopsee - a fluffy and mischievous creature that infests all Nearwood - you'd feel that you are 8 years old again.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 14, 2015","true","4.9"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","1"

With such excellent visuals no puzzle gaming fan should be dissuaded by this.  There is a guide to help if you get stuck, or just skip the puzzle.  The only puzzle that seemed to be guesswork was the seasons puzzle shown in the screenshot, there is a shoe, and an umbrella, I guess those are only needed during certain seasons?\n(For summer, the shoe coulda been a flip-flop. While for Fall, the umbrella coulda been anything like a pile of leaves. What is that umbrella even for in the fall?)\n\nWhile solving puzzles be on the look out for little creatures that tell their own bonus story in the snoopedia of the hard life of living in a fantasy paradise.  We need more games on this level of awesome, to appeal to the masses those puzzles need to be toned down to more human levels outside the realm of needing to be an Einstein.  Noone wants to bring shame and dishonor upon their family by resorting to the use of the *gulp* skip button on a clever puzzle.\n\nLoses one point because you cant replay the game with the same profile, you have to delete your profile or create a new one to play it again losing your snoopedia progress.

It is one of the most visually stunning hidden object games out there. I was excited everytime I accessed a new area - every scene is beautiful. The characters and creatures look great. Some of the animals are the cutest I've seen. Voice acting is better than average for this genre. The music is lovely AND you have access to all the songs since this is the collector's edition. The puzzles range from very easy to "ack, this is hurting my brain" but you can skip any of them, if you so desire. The length of Nearwood, especially with the bonus game, is longer than most hidden object games. And there is a very cool "boss battle" that most puzzle games lack. I do have to warn you, the hidden object aspect of the game is limited and when you hit them, you're only searching for specific item parts. However, the game is SO good that the lack of "normal" hidden object areas didn't bother me in the least. I really could go on and on about how much I enjoyed playing this. I'll just finish with - I highly recommend it.  :)","October 13, 2014","true","13.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Recently i haven't really been feeling the long and time consuming games, yet this one is somewhere around the middle. It wasn't too long and it wasn't too short. I managed to get around 4 and a half hours of play time out of it. Including the bonus chapter at the end.\n\nThe story is decent, i particularly like the fantasy type world you stumble into. It's nothing too enthralling but it's definitely a decent play and helps it stand out slightly from all the other HOGs.\nI've been playing quite a few recently and this is one of the better ones i think.\n\nThe item finding itself is a little odd in this one. It's not the usual 'list' kind of thing. It was more so shorter item-finding scenes where you are looking for ten or so outlined shapes rather then a long list of named objects. It's something a little different I guess but i found it quite odd.\nIt also doesn't feel like there is actually many item-finding scenes in this game. In ways i liked it, they focused a tad more on the story and i guess it's always good that the game isn't entirely dependent on that factor of the game. But i personally would have enjoyed it a little more if they were a little more frequent. As i quite like the item-finding side to HOGs.\n\nThe voicing acting, art and puzzles are all pretty standard as far as HOGs go really. As in, the voice acting is always that tad bit cheesy, the art is always quite nice and the puzzles are always fairly similar.\nNone the less, i enjoyed it. As these kind of games are great for few hour time killers.\n\nWhen it comes to this genre of game, i think all positive reviews tend to be very similar. It's just usually the bad ones that differentiate and usually for good reason.\nFor a HOG to be bad they must be really bad.\n*Cough* Amazing Adventures Around The World *Cough*\nExcuse me.\n\nAll in all, this is another decent hidden object game for the collection, i'd definitely recommend this one.\n\n\nTL;DR : Another decent HOG, pretty standard but stands out a little from the rest with it's fantasy setting.","January 23","true","4.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual, Normal and Expert.\n\nThere are interactive items in the game, they're marked with a symbol, but sometimes these interactive items do require extra items before they can be interact with.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates something of interest can be done at certain location.  Please note that the map isn't given immediately when the game started. Also, the teleportation amulet automatically recharges itself after being used.\n\nMost of the hidden object scenes consists of fragment items, placing items back. Some of them do require little or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are rather easy to solve without much difficulty. For most of these puzzles there's a reset button. However, there's definitely a skip button, for all of the puzzles. These two features are only present in "Casual" game difficulty mode.\n\nThere are small creatures collectibles in the game called Snoop-Sees. They're scattered throughout the game.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there's a bonus chapter, but it can be unlocked only after the main story of the game's completed. The bonus chapter is the sequel to the main story.\n\nThere's a built-in strategy guide for the game. It can be access anytime during gameplay.\n\nMiscellaneous\nIn the extra content section: Soundtracks, Concept Art, Wallpapers and Snoopedia.\n\n[Please note that Snoopedia can't be accessed until some of its' collectibles are found.]\n\nFinal thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. As for the replay value I would say it's low.

The voice acting is better than normal and they have some nice NON-hidden object puzzles thrown into the game. In particular the last puzzle in the bonus game has, believe it or not, a boss fight.

The excellent voice acting and the highly detailed, absolutely stunning painted graphics all promise to enchant you as soon as you hit the Play button. Sadly this beauty is skin deep.\n\nThe story is as stock as it gets: you arrive in a clichéd fairy land tortured by a clichéd zero-dimensional evil to find a clichéd relic which can deal with this menace. Same in the bonus chapter with an added cartoonish over-the-top villain monologue.\n\nThe puzzles and fragmented object scenes offer a great variety both in types and difficulty, but there are a few questionable design choices. For example the fast travel option needs to be recharged, making the map useless; and the final (match-three) puzzle is actually based on sheer luck with the promise of many retries.\n\nStill, Nearwood is an astonishingly gorgeous game that is worth to be played just for the looks alone.

The music and sound are also great, and the voice acting is good. The game very much succeeds in creating a beautiful and vivid fairytale-like atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of puzzles and minigames, with a few very simple HO-type scenes. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised by the puzzles in this game - they are very different and imaginative, not repetitive at all, and not the exact same puzzles and mechanics you see in most HOG or adventure games. While most of them are not extremely challenging, they are smart and very, very fun to play.\n\nThere is a tad bit more back-and-forth than I'd like between the great number of areas of the game, but at least it's quite obvious and logical where you should be going when you find a new item. I played in hard mode, so I don't know if this would be easier with the use of the map, but I found it was sometimes easy to forget in which of the previous ten areas the lock for the key you just found was located. But I did enjoy the variety of beautiful areas, and, again, the navigation made sense and the game did not suffer from a case of magically appearing objects and HO areas that a lot of games do. Another small criticism is that the controls of a couple of the puzzles seemed a bit fiddly and/or buggy (the rotating hourglass puzzle in particular comes to mind), but it was more of a rare, mild annoyance than a serious problem.\n\nGameplay in hard mode is 4-5 hours, including the bonus chapter, which is decent. There is a lot of content (areas, puzzles, etc) so the game felt very satisfying. I wish the game included achievements as well, but it's not such a big thing I guess.\n\nThe story of the game is nothing amazing, quite flimsy and cliche, but the setting and atmosphere are beautiful and interesting enough to make up for it. I have to admit that there were moments when some dialogue or story bits made me roll my eyes, most notably the part where a whole gnome village was left to languish because all the men had been kidnapped, leaving the women and children alone in the village, so there was apparently no one around to find food or repair things.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the few small flaws and flimsy story, I greatly enjoyed this game. The gorgeous art and interesting, unique puzzles more than made up for anything else.","February 1","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Object-based puzzles (find an object, then use it where it's needed).\n2. Mini-games that utilize rotating discs, matching, pattern recognition, mazes, and other simple challenges.\n3. FROG puzzles (fractured object I-spy puzzles).\n4. Recipes (combine several components together to create a new item).\n5. A global I-spy puzzle that requires you to spot 111 "Snoop-see" creatures across both the main game and bonus mission in order to unlock pages of a book.\n\nThis game did several things right.  The artwork is beautiful (almost Jim Henson-esque), the mini-games are fresh and creative, the adventure puzzles are intuitive, the music and voice-acting are decent, and the FROG puzzles are challenging but not frustrating.\n\nIt is a good gateway game for those new to the genre.  They do a great job of providing constructive feedback to players, and they include both a hint system and a complete walkthrough (including Snoop-see locations) for anyone who is struggling.  Additionally, on easier difficulties, the game map shows points of interest, and allows you to teleport to any screen.  As an extra little bone to players, the pages unlocked by the Snoop-see hunt provide visual clues to the game's puzzle solutions.\n\nI would have liked them to have a stronger story hook, and to use the dialogue more effectively (the start of the game is especially slogged down with cutscenes).  I also would have liked a bit more variety in the object-based puzzles; you can only collect so many keys, handles, triangles, and seals before it starts to feel repetitious.\n\nAnother thing that bugged me was the need for precision when using objects.  If you don't interact with the right hot spot, the puzzle will not recognize the required solution.\n\nOne special note: players who are colour-blind will have difficulty with the mini-games, as many of them require colour recognition to solve.  This is a major concern because the mini-games are a rather large component of the gameplay.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7/10.  It was more child-like than I expected, and there weren't really any true HOG puzzles, but the art was pretty and the mini-games were fun.  It is a decent casual game to waste a few hours with, although I wish I had earned a few steam playing cards or achievements for playing.","December 20, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hidden object scenes were both a little too easy and a little too few in number, but they were enjoyable.\n\nVoice acting was perfectly fine; nothing stellar but nothing that made me want to gouge my eardrums out either, which is important to me in any game where I have to listen to people talk at all.\n\nI clocked in at around three and a half hours of gameplay including the bonus content.  It's about average for this kind of game.  I never feel like a ten dollar price tag is quite fair for that though, though, so I recommend waiting for a sale (as I do for most of these games, honestly).\n\nShort version: this is totally worth it if you're a fan of the genre but consider holding out for a half-price sale.","March 21, 2015","true","0.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fantasy atmosphere.  I wouldn't call this a hidden object game but more a lite adventure  There are not any traditional hidden object scenes, but there are a few mini-games where you need to find 10 pieces of pipe (or whatever) in a background.  Most of the gameplay is going around trying to find objects that unlock functions on things that allow you to get other objects, like a standard adventure game.\n\nThe bonus chapter is along the same vein as the main story.

I wished that some of them got more use, whether appearing later on in the game with another need/puzzle or even just a quick story scene.\n\n+/- I found the ending to come at a reasonable point but it could be viewed as abrupt.\n\nGameplay:\n\n- I played on expert difficulty as I don't like the flashy help and hints, but that was a big mistake and wholly not recommended for 1st playthroughs as many interactive areas are too hidden and not easily recognizable. So unless you want to waste energy clicking everywhere on the screen then I'd recommend at most the 2nd difficulty. I didn't see an option to change it mid-game so I continued on, so a lot of my time was spent going back and forth trying to find the last item of a set needed to progress and tapping like mad (I only resorted to using the in-game guide once towards the end and I was disgusted at how unobvious the spot was).\n\n+/- Some puzzles were a complete pushover while others had more a involved challenge. But as others have said, the rules and need of some of them aren't immediately clear, to which the prospect of figuring out on your own will either excite or frustrate you (you're helper Fey does pop up with a "?" button which I assume will explain things but I never bothered with it).\n\n+ Items found are only needed in areas 1 - 3 areas away so no crazy backtracking.\n\n- I played on a tablet pc, which did work well, but sometimes trying to use an item on the correct area wouldn't register correctly and needed a few extra tries. I'm not sure if the tablet touch had something to do with it or there were very specific spots that needed to be hit but it was annoying.\n\n- Other than a couple of mixing puzzles, there's no manipulation of items. I would've liked to have seen some combining and such things.\n\n\nExtras:\n\n+ Promo art and soundtrack and others. Nice set of stuff so I can't complain.\n\n\nIn the end, many of my gripes are pretty minor and personal so it's still easily recommendable.

I have only played this game for not a long time but the graphics are very good. The story is interesting. Your mother has died and your dad is missing. The daughter investigates this.\n\nI would say the static pictures dont do this game justice. There is just so much movement in the game. This game is a breath of fresh air from playing other HOG games that appear dark and are trying for spooky. I am really liking this game so far. I have finished the main game.\n\nWhile I did enjoy the game. The puzzles and there are a lot of them. I just didnt care for. I would say over 90% or more of them I just skipped. I found them to be  tedious and very dull. I still really like the game however I sort of wish they would focus more on hidden objects or give players a choice of some other mini game. That being said I kind of hope they make another game like this. I loved the people you meet inside the game. The graphics are great as well. More HOG or some other mini games in the future games please.\n\nJust finished the bonus game. Great story. I still hate the puzzles. Their is a sad mini match 3 game. I could not stand it.

Technically, the game is pretty good:  good graphics and excellent voice acting are the big positives.  For minor negatives, there were a couple of puzzles with issues in the main game.  At one point, you have to set a clock.  But, unless I missed something, there's nothing that tells you what to set it to.  Looking at the Guide and some walkthroughs gives an answer.  But, the hints are given for a 12 hour clock and the clock is a 24 hour one.  Yet, the answer works.  Then there's a set of constellations you're supposed to show.  There's no indication anywhere what the constellations are supposed to look like.  So, you're just randomly rotating stars until something takes.\n\nThe big problem, though,  is the intended audience.  The story is written for children.  Young children.  Most of the puzzles are simple enough for them.  But, there are several puzzles that are hard.  Really hard.  So, if you play the game with your child, it'll be fine most of the time.  But, at other times, it'll be too hard.  If you play it by yourself (as an adult), the silly story will irritate you, the simple puzzles might bore you, and the difficult ones might frustrate you.  So, again, there's an audience mis-match.\n\nI got a total of 5.5 hours out of the game (4.2 hours in the main game and another 1.3 hours in the bonus chapter).  So, by my measure, the game is a bit overpriced at it's current list price of about $10.","October 11, 2015","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is nonsensical even by HOG standards, but you keep getting interrupted by your gnome companion to give lengthy speeches about it.  There aren't any regulat HOG scenese, just a small number of limited ones where you have to find list of mostly identical items to complete a piece of machinery.  Most of the game involves picking up junk and wandering around trying to find something to use it on, but navigation from room to room is annoyingly sluggish, and they put use of the map for travel on a limited timer like it's a hint, which makes no sense.

The graphics look stretched and distorted on my wide-screen monitor.  The graphics are probably 1024 x 768 resolution.  The puzzles in the game aren't very good.  I've played this game for five hours.  I've had to skip three puzzles because I couldn't solve them.  There are too many options available when you have to solve a puzzle.  Some of the puzzles can't really be solved by using logic.  Solving some of them is purely a guessing game.  Having to spend thirty minutes on one puzzle does take the fun out of the game.  The graphics are colorful.  The animations are good.  The music and sound effects are great, but this game could be so much better.  An update for 1080p monitors would definitely improve this game.\n\nI'm using an AMD 5770 graphics card.  I have to play this game inside a black box if I enable Wide-Screen mode in this game.  There is a solution to that problem.  I can open AMD Catalyst Control Center and select GPU up-scaling.  That option is in the Digital Flat Panel properties.  The game still won't display full screen on my 1080p monitor, but it does look better with just the small, black vertical bars on each side of the screen.\n\nI've noticed something about almost every hidden-object game I've played.  Many of the games released before 2014 do not support 1080p monitors.","October 28, 2015","false","6.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The story is so uninteresting and boring it's not even worth mentioning. Game actions are meh - too many keys and puzzle pieces to collect, too many "put magic item in magic slot" places. And like Brink of Consciousness series, the items are randomly scattered all over the world so you have to constantly run back and forth trying to find a spot to use them, there is hardly any logic in it.\nTravelling between the screens is pretty slow, I haven't seen such long loading times in any other game in this genre. And for some reason the map travel is limited, after you use it you have to wait for it to recharge or travel manually between the screens. I don't understand how anyone could think this is a good idea.\nYet I'm giving it a positive rating. Why? Well, graphics are nice and the fairy tale atmosphere is cute. Hidden-object scenes are different this time, the objects are not specified by names but by outlines, and I liked this change. And the game contains several original and quite challenging minigames, I'm glad they didn't recycle the same minigames over again like some other games do.","August 23, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found this game on sale for $2.50 so I thought I'd give it a try, since it had beautiful art. It's kind of like a point and click adventure story where you solve a variety of puzzles, put objects together, and help fix things to save this fairy tale style magical realm from an evil darkness that was unleashed when your character's father stopped time by accident when trying to save his wife from a deadly illness and ended up freezing himself and the time lords in the process. The story is a bit of a stretch, but it feels natural within the atmosphere in the game. There are hidden object game parts, but not many, there is a good variety of puzzles most of which are pretty easy and simple. Quite a few of them require trial and error, but really easy to figure out trial and error, if that makes sense. There was only two puzzles that I felt took me a while to figure out, and only one puzzle did I use one of my skips for, but mostly because I was tired and wanted to move on so I could go to bed at the time (lol).There is a timer so if it's taken you a certain amount of time to solve the puzzle it'll allow you to skip it except for the hidden object parts which the timer allows you a hint instead. If you don't want to use a skip but are stuck, on the bottom right hand corner of the screen there's a guide button that provides a walkthrough, so you can see just one step ahead to get your gears moving. But to be honest, 99% of the game is very simple. The sound and art is beautiful and relaxing and getting objectives completed feels satisfying even if it's not that difficult, and the entire mood and atmosphere of the game is what sells it IMO. I love it, it's a good refresher from all those frustrating competitive games. The voice acting isn't very good at all but it's listenable and to be honest I expect these games to have bad voice acting. My only regret is that the voice acting isn't bad enough to be hilarious, but it's not bad enough to really hate it so I guess that's fine too haha. Overall, it took me four and a half hours to complete the main chapter before I got to the bonus chapters. So it's pretty short, but for these games longer would probably mean it outstays its welcome. I'm not sure if it's worth the full price of $15 (if I remember that correctly) but I'm always hesitant to spend money on casual style games because I'm a terrible person. But it was more than worth the $2.50 and I highly enjoyed my playthrough, definitely more solid than many other games of this genre I've played in the past.","February 8","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics were lovely-a storybook fantasy illustration art style with a touch of steampunk tossed in. The voice acting was well done. The soundtrack was quite nice and is included in the Collector's Edition. The story wasn't mind-blowing but it was interesting enough to keep me amused til the end. Puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, with an interesting variety AND there were actually more puzzles than hidden object screens, which was a plus for me. All in all, a great game for the genre. I enjoyed it.
