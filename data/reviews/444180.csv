It's like Front-Mission.\n\nLet me explain why.  Weapons don't just have range limits, they have specific template areas they can hit.  Take the long range missile.  It has a 3-hex wide and 8 hex long area it can hit.  The targetable area is 5 hexes distant from the firing mech.  However, what I consider to be the game's fatal flaw is that you can ONLY shoot in one of the 6 hex facing directions.  If the enemy is one hex to the left or right of a straight line up the row of hexes, you mysteriously cannot take a shot at them.\n\nOk, I get that it makes the game more a maneuver puzzle as players try to get enemies into one of those 6 cardinal facings.  I don't like it in the least, however.  Had I realized this was the mechanic, I would have reconsidered the purchase.  The range bands are cool, but the strict facing limits for weapons fire were very... shocking.   It makes it more "mech chess" than a war game.  That's what the developer intended, so if that's interesting, go for it.","March 18","false","0.4"," 72 of 101 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","72","101","2","1"

It's about conserving armor and putting your mech in the right hex and facing to use the weapon you want (Think of solving a template puzzle over aiming and shooting a weapon and you'll do fine).  You can customize loadouts in terms of favoring shorter or longer ranged weapons.  You can chose whether to put your armor on the right-left-or body facing.  You gain implants as you level up.  It's a leveling game where you get better through unlocks rather than a mech building game where you're factoring size, armor, speed, and loadout.\n\nI admit...at first...I was disappointed that this wasn't a rebirth of a MechWarrior Tactics type game.  But I got over that and the game is what it is.  The PVP is nice and better balanced because of the game's simplicity.\n\nIt's not a bad game. It's a bit phoney (Phone app like :-) ) and shallow for a PC Mech game, but there was enough to keep me entertained.  Your milage may differ.","March 19","true","1.7"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

I really like mechgames – be it as a simulation on my PC or as a tabletop-game with miniatures. But in its actuall state the game Techwars Online seems to come straight out of hell. It looks unready – but it is not an early-acces-title. The gamemechanics are unsatisfiing, the tournamentmode is a joke, the controlls are whacky – but they have no mercy for mistakes. And – just in case you didn’t  guess it yourselves – there are bugs crawling through the code. I know:  somwhere in Russia a bunch of guys have put a lot of effort in that project – I appreciate that. There are to few mechgames in the world. But for example: Why takes the AI the control of my mechs, leves me as a mere wondering spectator and beats the crap out of itself? I wanted to do that! Well, it’s not that bad, because after two rounds or so the whole match crashes.\nFor the first time in eleven years I conntacted Steam and demanded my money back. When I am angry – please let it be because of an opponent that was just better than me – and not because of a halfbaked pseudo-licence-product (the story is „based“ on Mikhail Vlad’s novel Techwars).\nLong story short: Hands off, until these massive issues are solved.","March 28","false","5.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

If you get this game you wont find anyone to play with online.\n\nBoring mechanics:\nAll mechs you buy are the exact same thing so basically you lvl up until you can use the max amount of mechs in a game.  All the mechs you use are the exact same.  This means the only customazation in the game is based off how many ammo for each gun you want to take with you on a mech.  So one mech might have 10 long range missles another might have more cannon ammo.  You can only equip somthing like 12 ammo so you pick, cannon, long range missle or short range so on and so on until you get to 12 ammo.  You chose where to place the armor which is i think 11-13 armor pieces you get to pick like chest R arm or L arm or back.  And thats the game thats it you pick what ammo and where to put armor there is not diff mechs or diff weapons or anything like that its really pretty stupid after the first 15 min you will get bored.","April 27","false","1.7"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

As a Battletech fan I liked the look and saw potential. As of this writing however there have not been any game updates for roughly 2 months, there is a list of promised improvements and features still outstanding, however there have been several DLC releases.\n\nThe game itself is not bad but if left in its current state with very little content or refinement I would say the game is worth maybe a third of the retail price at best.","May 1","false","1.3"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

The game mechanics are not bad, but the customizability is just hideous. If "enormous potential to upgrade" means only able to change number of ammunition rounds and armor plates, then the author clearly hasn't played other games like Armored Core or Front Mission. You can't even swap weapons from right to left. It is also not clear if you can switch corporations later in the game, since you are forced to pick one before you even start the tutorials.\n\nThe UI seems like the game is still in early access, where you can't change the window size nor other settings like mouse speed or controls. Game window size only comes in 2 settings, the default window size and full-screen at a user-specified screen resolution. Other features like neuro-implants have no good in-game explanation on what they actually do and it seems like clicking the buttons to upgrade each implant ability seems to not be working.\n\nThe campaign mode is also ludicrously difficult for a game that's geared to bring in new users. I was on a 10 game winning streak under the "skirmish" mode (1 vs. 1 AI bot battles), but my first loss was on the very first map of the campaign. I then tried the second map and learned that you are forced to fight against 4 enemy mechs. (You only start with 1 mech and have to spend 500 + 1000 credits for every new mech.) I thought it was some kind of rigged event-battle, but nope you had to defeat all 4 mechs in order to win. Currency in this game is a bit weird since it seems like the only use it has is to buy more ammo and armor (hit points).\n\nOverall, I feel both ripped-off and cheated. Ripped-off for paying the price for what I should be paying for a well-polished non-early access  indie game, and cheated for the notion that mechs with fixed weapons & ammo-count upgrades are somehow acceptable for it to self-define "enormous upgrade potential" as a game in the mech genre.\n","May 26","false","1.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"
