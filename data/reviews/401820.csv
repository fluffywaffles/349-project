"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jorgevorg/recommended/401820/","jorgevorg","Jorgevorg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jorgevorg/","68 products in account","I really wanted to like this game and, maybe after a few updates I will but, for now, I can't recommend it to anyone. The experience is short. Very short. You'll be done in a little over an hour. The previews have made the game look like a lot more  polished experience than it is. Below are the issues which I have encountered.\n\n1. The Game Doesn't Launch in VR Mode - I was unable to run the game on muy HTC VIVE until I set the executable ("jottun.exe") into Windows 7 compatibility mode, which was extremely frustrating to troubleshoot.\n\n2. Poor Controls - This game begs for touch controls but the developers have made a choice to have it work exclusively with a gamepad, maing the expeience a sitting one. As the result, the movement is unpleasant and turning, regardless of the choice of control you make, is either incredibly nauseating (it takes a -LOT- to make me sick in VR. I pretty much never feel even a bit queasy. Using the "natural turning"  ade my stomach swim almost immediately). You are able to make choices and communicate by nodding or shaking your head which is terrific. The rest of the control scheme is clunky and unpleasant to experience.\n\n3. Stiff, "Dead" Characters - though the sence of scale is great and the art style is delightful, the characters animate in a very poor, stiff way, stanidng in default poses, barely moving, except for opening and clothing their mouths and, occasionally, blinking. Everyone just stands there, upright and manequin-like, walking and turning in an awkward way. On the bright side, the character models and environments are beautifull.\n\n4. Uninspired Voice Acting - Voices seem fitting to the characters they come out of but feel stiff, boring and uninteresting. Your character's father's voice is particularly flat, as is the oen belonging to the first distraufght vilager you find upon returning "home".\n\n5. Price - Fot as short, clearly unfinished, and unpolished game, "Fated" costs a lot more than it should. I would -gladly- pay $20 and more for a short yet breathaking and engaging game. I desperately wanted "Fated" to be it and it just wasn't.\n\nIf you are looking for a great episodic game on the VIVE, I urge you to try "The Gallery: Call of Starseed" if you want to know what I am talking about here - it's worth every penny and is an unforgettable experience. "Fated", on the other hand is bland, poorly animated and uncomfortable to traverse at this point in time.","April 28","false","4.4"," 71 of 89 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","71","89","0","16"

It is fairly well polished. Its a bit of a walking simulator, with a few puzzles, but the story keeps flowing. The giant actually makes your heart beat because in VR its legit scary.\n\nI can't downvote a game i enjoyed, but i do feel the price is too high for one short episode. As much as i like roomscale games with motion controls I have zero complaints about the lack of motion controls because the game works fine with a Xbox controller while sitting down.

Will there be more episodes or is this is it....it says episodic but it is not clear if it means the episodes included in the 90 mins or future episodes.\n\nLot of potential and the fact that they added many ways of combating motion sickness, including snap rotation to a degree of your choice, or fluid rotation with a choice of speed, or on screen comfort markers, is great and i wish all developers would do this as it will eliminate motion sickness for many and is better than teleportation (snap did it for me, or fluid rotation at full speed with tiny taps on the stick also is great as its kind of like snapping but with more control). Sadly, it's very short, so if you are on a budget £14.99 for 90 mins might be to much.","April 28","true","1.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Like most games this early on its a bit light on content for the price. I still think its worth the purchase. Need more games like this. Not to go in to spoilers it has som nice action sequences with great sense of scale and vertigo. It has standard 1st person controls, but it works great. Using snap turns I didn't get I'll. The walking is slow enough for that not to happen, at least not to me. Recomended.\n\nOn a side note it wouldn't launch in VR for me at first, playing on Vive. That is a known problem with Unreal games when you also have Oculus Home installed. Uninstalled that and worked flawlessly.\n\n\n","April 28","true","1.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Also there's loads of comfort / movement options to choose from and you can change them on the fly in the game which is always nice.\n\nThe only downside is that it's pretty short and it's arguably expensive for such a short story but I guess that's the trend for VR games since it's such a niche market.\n\nOther than that, 5/5, would recommend to anyone owning a Rift / Vive.","April 28","true","1.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elebutt/recommended/401820/","elebutt","elephantbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elebutt/","994 products in account","Played on a DK2 with Oculus' 1.3 Runtime.\n\nThis game is visually stunning, the low-poly environment is brought up to almost Dreamworks/Pixar levels by the excellent texture work. There's lots of techniques done really right for making convincing VR, e.g. a tracked torso that moves as you do (as does your shadow), and characters' gazes follow your own. It's easy to get swept away in the narrative, and the game's world is very lively. I initially intended to play just one act then ended up playing through the whole thing from start to finish. Note that this is definitely a movie-like narrative experience first, and a game second.\n\nThe presence of animated, fully voice-acted human characters really breathes life into narrative games, even more so in VR. This shouldn't be taken for granted, it's something missing from quite a few VR experiences at this early stage. The characters in FATED are all really well done. I've seen at least one review criticize the voice acting, but that's a problem with video games in general and FATED's voice acting is fine, it's at least better than any Bethesda RPG.\n\nFATED's price is undoubtedly steep for a 1.5 to 2 hour long game. Discounting the economic necessities of developing for a niche, budding or unproven technology, I suppose you could compare the price per unit time to paying a similar amount for going to the cinema with snacks, which provides the "immersion" of a large screen and surround sound, both of which are easily surpassed by VR, where you feel like you're really there,\n\nSome occasional bugs are present but not particularly distruptive and will probably be fixed with time, so my only real criticism is the rune puzzles, which are embarrassingly simple whether they were supposed to be created by humans or giants, and really don't make sense being there. I understand not wanting to stall the narrative by getting the players stuck, but really, were they trying to keep out babies? The game's story, lively world and characters are its strength and it seemed pointless to throw these in. (This was just a criticism of the "puzzles", not the handful of brief action sequences, all of which definitely added to the game.)\n\nFATED is well worth picking up for the experience of dreaming while you're awake, if the price isn't an issue for you.","April 29","true","1.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

My conclusion is that it is one of best product for VR out there. The experience is immersive and will take you through a range of emotions. It stands out from other VR games by a large margin.

While it is alot of walking there's plently of dialogue to keep you busy on your journey. Between all that you get some nice action scenes inbetween to spice things up a bit. Althought its a shame it is not longer as soon you get all connected with the story it comes to an end. This does not make it a bad game you just want more of it.\n\nAside from the only game that provides a story progression with intresting characters on your side you get a good choice of comfort options and resolution scale in options menu. I think its worth it for the expierence. The price is what it is beceuse of the niche market currently now. And this game has been in development for almost 2 years thats why they went with controller support only. You cant implement motion controls that did not exist and was not designed for.\n\nIt works for HTC vive and oculus rift and yes you can use your steam controller.","April 29","true","2.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It is short, and the price may be an issue for some.\n\nWhen I started, it spun me out, the colours, the characters, but when I began moving I became nausious, only when turning though. I never get motion sickness so this was concering. I ended up changhed to snap turn and that fixed the motion sickness I was getting.\n\nYes the story is short, but  considering it's one of the longer games on vive I've played I was actually quite surprised. Some games are 8$ for 15 minutes of play, so consider that when buying this game. It's also the first episode, and I can't wait for the second, as in most stories they take you to the point of no return and leave you hanging there.\n\nTo summerise this game, for me it was pretty. There isn't a lot to do in the way of interaction, but again I enjoyed sitting back and watching the story unfold. If you're a hands on person then this likely isn't for you. but if your a fantasy nerd like myself you may find it ropes you in.\n\nNote, I also have a bad back, and I was able to sit and play this game, which was very appealing to me.\n\nHope you enjoy it.","May 12","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
