The community has good and bad seeds and good and bad players. I, for one, can say I've made a ton of friends that I regularly talk to in Steam even if not playing a game together.\n\nThe new patch completely and utterly destroyed the game. It punishes poorer team comps, slower build team comps, and non-premades. Never have I seen a game that REFUSES to let you win if you have 1 poor performer on the team. You can't save them or carry them -- they literally cause the enemy team to be on God Mode.\n\nWorse, I can't even enjoy it. If I play with a premade, we steamroll the other team. There's no competition; there's no chance of a comeback. If I'm playing a premade, there's no hope. We will be steamrolled. It's a zergfest. Get 3 initial kills and 0 deaths as a team, basically auto-win button.\n\nI HATE rage quitters, but what is the incentive to even stay in matches if you're guaranteed to lose?\n\nWorse, why didn't Ronimo listen to the community? Who infleunced this misguided ship?\n\nIf you want a mass exodus, by all means -- keep the game the same; If you want to create competition and engagement -- change it. If you're trying to stop turtling, perhaps nauts who refuse to leave their turret for 60 seconds start taking a 'Death DoT'. If, XP is your bread and butter, then remove all damage dealing skills and make everything about building characters to different utility functions.\n\nBetter yet, bring 2.12 back and create an XP system in Nauts 2 that you have time to test and understand without public outcry. We did not want this. I have sadly, uninstalled the game. Best of luck Ronimo.","December 7, 2015","false","750.3"," 562 of 743 people (76%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","76","562","743","20","38"

This causes a lot of friction in the community. Most Asians can deal with the lag but others cannot.\n\nThe reason I stopped playing this game was because I was tired of facing only 2 possible outcomes\n\n1. You play in a premade and no one can stop you. Stomp Stomp Stomp.\n2. You play solo and you get matched against duo or premades and your teams mates are in league 3-5.\n\nThe game is awesome and you should check it out.

We all have different opinions and there's no reason to fight over it. If you don't agree with me, that's fine. I'm not trying to convince you to change the way you feel about the game. This is just my opinion.\n\nReview:\n\nWith close to 1300 hours played over two accounts I used to love this game. A simplistic side scrolling MOBA that's very easy to get into, what's not to like? A lot of time was spent in the game, I made friends and we had lots of fun. Unfortunately, as time passed the flaws of the game were revealed.\n\nThis game actually favors people with poor internet connections and if you don't have a bad internet connection you might as well simulate one to gain unfair advantage over your opponents. How is this possible? Due to Ronimo being a small company they can't really supply dedicated servers so they designed the game for p2p networking. You have the option to queue in different regions, same or nearby would be recommended. It doesn't matter though, if someone feels the need to queue worldwide (maybe because lack of players) they can join you no matter what your settings are. It gets frustrating real fast playing an opponent with over 300 ms of latency. They can actually pick a naut that favours their ping to get the upper hand because it gets impossible to dodge certain skills because you can't anticipate where a projectile might be on their screen and before you know it you've been hit. If someone choose to queue worldwide you'd think it'd be more of a challenge for them because of latency but it's really the other way around.\n\nAnd if they don't have high latency they might have packet loss and that can actually trigger effects on abilities multiple times. There's a naut that has the ability to pull other nauts to him using his tongue, if the player has packet loss he can actually tongue you multiple times and this is very frustrating. His client registers that he hit his ability but the packet was lost and had to be sent again and maybe a few more times.\n\nThe design wouldn't be so awful if both players had a say in the matter and dedicated servers would make it even better and actually favor players playing on the right side of the globe.\n\nNetworking issues aside, the matchmaking could also use some work. Solo queuing is ok but can be a terrible experience since players can just leave the game without any ramifications. If the player hosting the game crashes and the host migration fails everyone gets a loss. Some maps end in single lanes which makes a choke point and favors nauts that can turtle and just delay the game for as long as possible.\n\nedit:\nI quit playing this game because it was actually making me rage. I still occasionally play the game for the sake of ongoing tournaments and to keep in touch with the friends I made along the way. The game still has flaws, some of them being addressed (slowly). Until all of the major issues have been resolved I will not recommend this game.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to play when the stars align, but whenever people lag (be it due to connectivity issues or if it's intentional) it ruins the experience completely.","January 24, 2015","false","163.5"," 230 of 326 people (71%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","71","230","326","23","25"

My playtime tells alot about my feelings for this game. The game is a MOBA played in 2D and it is developed by a bunch of people who really care about their fanbase. I picked the game up a couple of months ago, and I still find the game to be  fun and exciting to play.\n\nAt the start of a match, you get to choose between 18 characters. Each character has its own set of skills and items. Characters and items are unlocked through leveling up (which is fairly easy to do) and the characters look amazing. I mean... you can play as flying, russian monkey, a french chameleon with a very long tongue, a squid admiral with a very large anchor and alot of others. You will learn how to play most of these characters very quickly  which means that you can get into the game immediately after playing one or two matches in practice mode.\n\nMatches usually take about 20-30 minutes to play and if a player disconnects from the match, another player can immediately jump into the game, which is great. Your goal in a match is to destroy the enemy team's base. To do that you have to destroy two turrets in the same lane. And to do this, you have to push while defending your own structures from your enemies.\n\nMobility plays a big role in Awesomenauts. Not all characters are that fast and not all characters have the best escaping skills. This means that you have to know each and every map fairly well if you want to be able to escape your enemies when playing large and slow characters like Clunk and Derpl. This makes the matches much more interesting.\n\nMobility --> Positioning --> Kills --> Ability to push --> Victory.\n\nThe Awesomenauts community is a friendly and amazing one, I very rarely have to play with ragers and jerks. There is an option to mute other players too, so ragers are not a problem. There are countless of people ready to help you with whatever you need help with, on the forums and in- game, making this the best community I have ever been a part of.\n\nTL;DR:\nBuy this fantastic game.

Awesomenauts with its quirky characters, "saturday morning cartoon" art style, fast-paced gameplay and diverse skills offers a unique blend of accessibility, configurability and depth, making it an ideal choice for those who want to sink their teeth into the Moba genre.\n\nI have to admit though, the game is still not a 100% balanced and for some characters, there is little to no variety in builds that are viable when it comes to competetive play. Be ready to be stomped by certain builds that excel on certain maps frequently. Nevertheless, while frustrating at moments, at 20-30 minutes per session, you won't have to spend too much of your time in "those games".","November 26, 2013","true","647.0"," 143 of 196 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","143","196","0","0"

It is designed to be fun. An interesting result of that is the lack of a real consequence when somebody quits your team. He is replaced by a bot that is often more competent than himself and continues to play in his stead. Another player can join mid-game to replace the bot at any time.\n\nAwesomenauts also has a great community (official forum, not Steam). It has a thriving fanart community, a modding one, a tactics one, etc.\n\nThis game really opens itself up to modders. It allows creators to modify in-game bots and make their own using an AI editor. Modders can also create gamemodes using this tool. If Ronimo likes a bot, it can find its way into the official game.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Awesomenauts. It has a thriving community that you should not miss out on. The gameplay is very fun, if less competitive than its other MOBA counterparts.

The gameplay is reminiscent of Super Smash Bros, and is an instant recommend for anyone who enjoys that series. Like Smash Bros. it is both light-hearted fun and can be very competitive, easy to learn and hard to master.\n\nThere are problems, however. Balancing a multiplayer game can be difficult and is never perfect, and the maps do have some annoying gimmicks. The matchmaking and Leaderboards are kind of broken and are meaningless to most, don't let that get to you and random teammates can be bad mannered.\n\nBut, I believe the core game is worth it 20 times over the problems, and would suggest anyone to give it a try!","December 13, 2013","true","474.8"," 88 of 115 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","88","115","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kongnauts/recommended/204300/","kongnauts","Mr.Tryhard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kongnauts/","39 products in account","A fun game to play but mired by a dire community; I have logged a fair amount of hours in this game and the most common issue I have is the insipid, immature and vitriolic community that play it. Like most games that have any aspect of online play and contact with other people the game is dogged by people who have never learned to accept losing or indeed, dying in a game and of course being a team game the choice is often to blame others for losing rather than yourself.\n\nI have had people tell me to go and kill myself more times than I care to remember for the simple act of dying to a team with better communication, tactics and methods of playing together. There is such a sense of anger, hatrid and disrespect within the confines of the community of this game and therefore I urge people NOT to play this game; play locally with friends or people you know but don't subject yourself to the digusting filth that frequent the online, random community it just isn't worth it. I simply can't recommend a game that houses such disgusting people, the kind of people I play games to get away from.\n\nGoing to answer some of the more mature comments in response to this review by updating:\n\nI can't in good conscience give this game a positive review despite playing it for so long and continuing to do so; it is an incredibly addictive game however addiction does not constitute a good game. (Slot machines are addictive but they are hardly a good game)\n\nThere are far too many aspects of online play (which is the only mode worth playing in  a 3v3 MOBA) that are the cause of frustration such as the ability for players to force the start of a match even when the other team have only 1 or 2 human players they then proceed to feed (increase level) by repeatedly killing the laughable A.I controlled characters (who fill the empty space where another human should be).\n\nThe connection online is P2P (peer to peer) which opens opportunities for incredibly easy hacking and latency issues (if the host is rinsing their internet the game lags and is unplayable) which wouldn't be so much of an issue except that when you lag or another player lags they get castrated by the other players and abused. As I've stated before the community in this game is at times, disgusting but there are moments of gold, they aren't worth the other stuff you have to go through in order to find them.\n\nHow some people have reacted even to this review is a good example of the issue, assumptions and flaming instead of mature discussion with reasoning. I want so desperately to love this game as I have spent nearly 600 hours in it but it seems every day more bad happens than good (as a result of the horrible community and structure of online play) one day I hope to either convert this into a positive review (as a result of various fixes/additions to the game) or leave the game forever, until then this review is staying as-is.\n\nEdit: As of today 29/08/2014 I have uninstalled the game and doubt I will be returning to play it (never say never mind); a new patch was released recently and in all honesty the issues addressed have not been resolved and in some cases worsened. Ultimately my view on this game is unchanged it is an addictive experience but a shallow, frustrating one and I do not recommend you play it unless you have two full teams of three over a stable, local connection.","February 24, 2014","false","618.2"," 942 of 1,452 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","942","1","0","130"

With the multiple match ups (meaning how good certain characters are against other certain characters, on a scale of equal player skill) no session has ever felt the same.\n\nArenas: I cannot compare it to the likes of DOTA or LoL, since I havent played either, but coming from someone whos played the likes of Powerstone 2 for the Dreamcast, I can tell you that this game offers a robust experience. The arenas are structured in such a way that allow you to go miles by taking an inch.\n\nCharacters: The prime beef. Ronimo takes a bit of slack when it comes to balancing certain character traits and abilities, half of which I would say are very much deserved, but at the end of the day using the character in a way that outplays your opponents strengths and capitalizes on there weaknesses will outrule any match up against you. You are bound to find a character, if not half the cast, to your liking~\n\nSingle Player: There is none. This game will not engage you if not played online. Future DLC will patch in alot of match customizablity, so I cant say much on how they will integrate it, but not including the Starstorm DLC, I would not reccomend this game to anyone who is timid of the online environment.\n\nArt: The game is advertised to look and sound like a Saturday morning cartoon. The Musical Score matches this, with catchy rhythmic beats that loop in the background and character specific that play ala reward for killing sprees. The graphics, not so much. Dont get me wrong, the sprites are colorful (albiet small in relation to everything else on screen, but still packed with personality) and the levels looks gorgously bright and tell a story, but the only thing "Saturday Cartoon" about it is the intro video and character portraits. Still, you get what you get, and if youre a fan of the child friendly art style, you wont be disappointed.","November 27, 2013","true","179.3"," 119 of 167 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","119","167","0","0"

The fantasy/myth/RPG styled theme, all the nonsense you need to cram into your brain faster than forgetting to study for a test and doing it last minute (I personally can tolerate that kind of stuff, but not with MOBAs) and the hostile communities make me hate them. Hate's a strong word, too.\n\nHowever, Awesomenauts is a significant turn for the better. Although the online multiplayer has its share of issues, Awesomenauts stands out from the rest and is what MOBAs should be like.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are cartoon-like, with a cheerful (yet dark at the same time) atmosphere. No fantasy stuff here, Awesomenauts is a sci-fi theme and that's something worth seeing after the same old MOBA. I love the visuals for the game, and I see nothing wrong with them.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is simpler at first for the rookie MOBA player. Shoot stuff, (attacking without abilities has a bit of a meaning now, hooray!) use your abilities to get an edge over the other 'Nauts, and much more. But then, when you get into it, you'll start analyzing your playstyle to suit your needs with that 'Naut, how to take on the opponent in a one-on-one, and more. Although I did experience significant amounts of lag that costed me quite a few deaths and also really bad matchmaking, the gameplay is still solid to me.\n\nStory\nThe story is simple and straightforward. You play as an Awesomenaut (or Lonestar in the tutorial) and you need to destroy the enemy's Solar drill. Solar is crucial to your employer for an unknown reason, and you need to destroy the drill so you hinder the enemy's Solar supply. MOBAs are known for their lore, and although this game lacks lore compared to other MOBAs, Awesomenauts doesn't fit in the category of a fantasy/RPG world like this.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is probably the key point to the game. The music (especially the theme song, just play the trailer if you haven't done so already) is outstanding, and the themes really get into your head. My personal favorite themes are Froggy G, Yuri, and the new character Scoop. The voice actors did an OUTSTANDING job with playing the characters and don't seem all bold or shrouded like most MOBAs do. Each one has their own personality that makes them unique from the others, and if I'm not mistaken, popular Youtuber TotalBiscuit even voiced one of the characters (Vinnie and Spike I believe) which I found pretty interesting. The audio overall to this game is near perfection, and I feel empty inside without those "awesome" songs.\n\nReplayability\nThe replayability is pretty massive. I don't want to touch up here much because it's a MOBA. Its easy to get hundreds of hours logged onto a MOBA.\n\nFor one thing though, Awesomenauts has some major pros that don't fit into any of the five main categories. The developers are dedicated, for one. They constantly release updates and even do some charity work. Check out Lonestar's Private Mels (?) skin. A kid came in from the Make-a-Wish Foundation and made his own skin for his favorite Awesomenaut. The updates keep on rolling in, and the most recent (as of this review anyway, 2.7 in case you're wondering) introduces Scoop, buffed every character in the game, gained a new main menu, and so much more it's better I keep my mouth shut. One more thing though that sets Awesomenauts apart from the rest is that the community is much, much, MUCH nicer compared to the other MOBAs. You don't get yelled at for screwing up, you actually GET help when you need it, and so Awesomenauts makes me feel comfortable when I get on.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Awesomenauts may be in my least favorite game genre, but who cares? Awesomenauts still got a thumbs-up from me. Aside from a few online flaws, Awesomenauts is a game that fails to disappoint me, and is one amazing adventure not worth missing.\n\nGraphics- 9.5/10\nGameplay- 7.5/10\nStory- 7/10\nAudio- 10/10\nReplayability- 9.0/10\n\n.:8.0/10:.\n\n+Nice community\n+Caring developers\n+Outstanding voice acting\n+Unique style, executed well\n+Catchy theme song\n+Easy to learn but hard to master gameplay done right\n+Awesome cast of characters\n+Unique character themes\n\n-Lags frequently\n-Awful matchmaking\n-Ranking is meaningless","October 28, 2014","true","38.0"," 106 of 153 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","106","153","0","0"

(People with lag can move freely,killing you while you are behind your turret,because in their screen,you werent behind the turret)\n-The devs complains that there isnt enough playerbase to fix the matchmaking things\nhowever the playerbase is becomen smaller and smaller with every day that passes\nand the devs denies to make the game f2p,or at least free for a few weeks (just like they did in 2012)\n\nSo basically the game is having a really low playerbase,which doesnt allow the devs to fix the matchmaking problems\nand want to know why the playerbase is becoming smaller? Matchmaking system.\n\nNow,I had many,tons of hours of fun,I meet a lot of new friends,I also make fan art for this game,like I said,the "not so functional things" are amazing and that's what attract me the most to this game,but the functional thing that makes it a MOBA is so broken,that I dont recommend to buy it.\n\nIts up to you,but if you still want to get the game,go get it somewhere cheaper for steam,9,99$ isnt worth AT ALL.","January 14, 2015","false","127.5"," 164 of 257 people (64%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","64","164","257","14","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odesseiron/recommended/204300/","Odesseiron","Dedgaem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odesseiron/","110 products in account","Awesomenauts is a combination of 2D platform/side-scroller with a MOBA (3v3), which creates an interesting combination that turns out as a very enjoyable experience for people who are fond of both genres. Like most 2D platforms,  the main mechanics are simple and it's very intuitive, which makes it easy to learn the basics of the game. It's also similar to 2D platforms in how fast-paced it is, and how much it values reaction times.  However, it also has some of the depth of MOBAs; there are several characters to choose (16 so far and counting), each one with 2 unique abilities and a different set of possible upgrades to choose for your builds and item routes. This combination results in a game that's simple yet fast and competitive.\n\nIn regards to some specific contents of the game:\n\nThe developers are active on this game, they produced 15 characters and 4 maps for the base game, plus microtransactions for skins (which doesn't have any impact on the gameplay itself). They'll be releasing an expansion now (currently on beta/early-access) and expand the game from that point on, so if you want to get access to all present and future features (which so far we know are extra characters, maps, spectator mode and custom-setting games), you'll want to buy both the base game and expansion, which is actually really cheap if you buy it on Steam sales or related stuff.\n\nThe balance of the game is not top-notch but it's pretty good regardless. New players might feel some characters are OP and whatnot, but once you get used to them you'll realise all of them are pretty much playable and none is "game-breaking".\n\nThere's a big "luck" factor in the game. Players are not forced to play a full game and teams aren't required to be full to start and continue games (which means you can find yourself alone with 2 bots in your team vs 3 human players, although this doesn't happen often). Players are allowed to leave a game (although they'll be punished by losing ranking points), this happens very frequently, specially on losing teams, which can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ for both teams (losing teams with bots frequently have no chance of winning, on the other side, you can be on a winning team and new players will join the game and make a comeback).  You don't know the map you'll be playing either, which is a problem because some characters have a bigger advantage on certain maps. You don't know what characters the enemy picked either. There's no separated queue for premades and solo players, which is also annoying for a lot of people.\n\nThe game netcode is p2p (so, no servers), this is annoying for a lot of players because you won't experience "input lag" (any actions you'll perform will be instantaneous in your screen), but you will experience a delay in actions of other players (basically you'll see that other enemies will hit you even when it looked like you were out of their attack/skill range). This means that you'll need to deduce the enemy intentions beforehand and estimate the true range of abilities and attacks on your screen based on the player's ping.\n\nFinding full matches is not a problem, and there's a decent amount of players online at most hours, so don't worry about buying a dead game (at least not yet!). There are a lot of players who'll want to play with you and it's easy to make "queue buddies".\n\nThe pool of characters is not as huge as in LoL or DoTA, but all characters have clear differences and they're all fun to play. Character synergy and team-comps are very important and sometimes if you don't pick your character properly you'll find yourself with a team that is incompetent in teamfights or pushing.\n\nAll in all, I think awesomenauts is a great concept and a very enjoyable game, specially for it's price. It's far from being a masterpiece because of it's issues, but despite that, it's a great experience and you'll have lots of fun playing it, specially if you play with friends.","December 17, 2013","true","431.0"," 50 of 67 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","50","67","0","0"

It also has a deep multiplayer with the approachability of a Saturday-morning cartoon.It's surprising just how well the MOBA formula adapts in a 2D environment, it might not be as strategic as others in the genre but it holds its own in terms of how fun the combat is. Special mention also goes to the sound design, very cool soundtrack and each character has their own little jingle, a small touch which I was impressed with, and on top of it all is the great voice acting which adds a welcome layer of charm to an already likebale game.

Ever since I started playing this game, it's a formula that I truly enjoyed in a way that I didn't enjoy something like LoL of Dota. What sets this game apart, from a mechanical standpoint, is that it has much more emphasis on manual positioning of both characters and skills, and that makes it much more challenging and interesting. Aesthetically it is very stylized and pleasing to see, with bright palets and a very well done soundtrack. The cast of characters is really unique and each has it's own unique skils that make them fun to play. And in my experience, both playing online alone (SoloQ) and coordinated team play are fun. Ronimo is always working on adding new characters, balncing them, and interacting with the community.\n\nThe only true drawback from this game, in my opinion, is that the community playing it relatively small for a MOBA, which is a real shame. As a result, matchmaking can be problematic sometimes. Finding a match and filling one relatively quick is almost never a problem, but the problem comes in with the difference in skill level of the players in the games.\n\nI wholeheartily recommend this game to anyone who wants a different spin on a MOBA, wants a fun game to play with friends, or just wants to play a fun game.\n\nI also stream this game semi-frequently if you want to see live gameplay of it: twitch.tv/pyrocheese","October 2, 2014","true","428.4"," 43 of 59 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","43","59","0","2"

This game is available for €10, and offers you lots of fun for that price. You don't have to pay for anything else, except when you want to buy skins for the 15 awesomenauts. These skins are pure cosmetic, they won't give you an advantage in-game.\nSo, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 15 available awesomenauts and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through turrets, robotic minions and of course the other team. At the start of the game you try to earn some 'Solar', the gold of Awesomenauts, and buy upgrades for your awesomenaut with it. And you try to kill enemies of course. Unlike MOBAs like Dota or LoL, this game doesn't feature items or a leveling system. Aeesomenauts also doesn't have a laning stage, which means you can be ganked every 30 seconds. After a while, one team will have more upgrades and more Solar than the other team and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it.\n\nVerdict\n--------\nAwesomenauts offers a lot of fun, and in beautiful graphics. The game feature's Offline Training and allows you to practice with friends. It also offers ranked matches and 15 awesome awesomenauts.\n\nAwesomenauts will keep you behind your computer for at least 75 hours.

The player base went from 228,886 players in season 5 (Sep. 2013) to its current player base of 24,889 (4-11-2015) for a reason. That is a 920% decrease in the number of players. Also not all of the 24,889 players actually play the game on a regular basis, that is just the number of players that have played at least one match. If you check the reviews on steam most of the negative reviews are written by people who have 200-1000+ hours in the game and used to love playing it. Just keep that in mind before you buy this game.\n\nCredentials: I have put over 580 hours into the game as of this review. I am a fairly high tier player and go back and forth between leagues 2 and 3, this means I have a good amount of experience in higher tier matches.\n\nFirst I will list the pros then the cons and then additional information. I do not consider the additional information to be a pro nor a con, I am just providing it for those who are still considering getting this game.\n\nPROS:\n\n-The graphic art and animations are great, and work well with the side-scrolling nature of this game.\n\n-The characters are very unique and have cool abilities that give each character their own personality.\n\n-The fighting in this game is very fun, it feels alot like smite had a baby with super mario bros.\n\n-The abilities (upgrades) menu is very well done, and allows the player to counterbuild the enemy team.\n\n-The leveling in this game is extremely simple. It is based off of collecting solar (currency) for player kills, turret kills, etc. and spending the solar in order to by abilities. This makes the game good for players that are new to this genre of game, and also provides enough complexity to entertain veterans to this genre.\n\n-The maps are well made. Each map has a unique feature in its center. For example one map has reduced gravity, one has a giant worm that can kill you, one has an invisibility orb, and one has fire that turns on and off throughout the match.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The matchmaking system is terrible. As a league 2 player I was frequently matched against players that were league 6-7. There is a huge skill difference between leagues 6/7 and league 2, this made matches boring for me and frustrating for new players. Also the matchmaking system frequently puts players in matches that have already started. It is no fun to join a match in which your team is already loosing by a huge margine.\n\n-The game is P2P. Players will constantly get matched against people with bad internet connection. This causes high latency and frequent packet loss. Since some characters do a ton of burst damage, if the player you are fighting has high latency, you can often be killed from 2-3 hit boxes away. The devs have talked about starting dedicated servers; however, they have been talking about it for over a year and still have not done it.\n\n-Some characters are inherently better than other characters. This means that you will often play against the same characters over and over again until the next patch makes a different set characters better than the others.\n\n-Players can die their way to victory. They do this by attacking the turret until they die, respawning and repeating over and over again. This is able to happen because certian characters do more damage to turrets than other characters. Also the abilities that these characters need to accomplish this are cheaper to get than other abilities.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\n-Matches can last anywhere from 15-45 minutes.\n\n-Each character has 4 rows of abilities with 6 abilities in each row. When you buy abilities in the match, you can have a maximum of 3 unique abilities in each row (only 3 out of the 6 for each row of abilities).\n\n-The game is 3v3. This is the only option, there is no 2v2 or 5v5 like in some other MOBAs.\n\n-You have to aim your abilities with your cursor (or controller), they do not auto hit on click (much like smite).\n\n-The prestige system is optional. If you prestige, you loose all of your abilities and have to earn them back again. Some players will love this feature and some will hate it.\n\nI hope that this review has been helpful, and has given you a better understanding of what the game is like. I love what this game used to be and it is still very good in some ways; however, until the matchmaking is fixed, dedicated servers are added, and the game is balanced more, I simply cannot recomend this game. If you find this game on sale for $2 or less then it cannot hurt to pick it up. I would love to see the player base go back up and the game to be restored to its past glory.\n\nPlease feel free to leave comments or questions in the section below, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.","July 1, 2014","false","906.6"," 49 of 74 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","49","74","0","5"

However, when I saw it on a Steam sale I thought I would give it another go.\n\nHaving grown up in the 80s I find similarities with the music, characters and art style that remind me of the cartoons back in the day. Basically this game is a parody of 80s cartoons and brings with it much nostalgia as a result.\n\nThe game is a 2D 3v3 MOBA and I think it is probably the best one I have seen, not that many exist to be honest. The characters and abilities are varied and there are several ways to interact with the maps to turn the tide of the battle. I have mainly played Bots at a difficulty I find a challenge  and have enjoyed the many games I have played, even when I lost.\n\nYou unlock characters and maps as you progress at quite a rapid rate. Then you get to access extra abilities. This encourages you to play more games at once. Against Bots they last 10-20 minutes, which is great if you just want a quick game.\n\nIt is a fun little game that will be enjoyed by all ages and you can easily increase the skill level if you want more of a challenge.\n\nThere are costumes to buy and an expansion pack with new characters. The latter is tempting me, but I will see if I can wait for the next sale...","September 11, 2015","true","5.0"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","34","48","0","1"

It uses a very rich and creative formula that supports a distinctive MOBA experience.\n\nThe basics of the game are very simple, every character class has two abilities, each assigned to a button of your choice, aside from the basic attack. Your objective, like in most games of this genre, is to destroy the enemy base, and to reach that base you need to get past turrets, which requires creep management and strategy. Killing other players and creeps awards you with Solar, the currency needed to purchase upgrades for your abilities. The gameplay is, therefore, very easy to learn and incredibly hard to master (which keeps things interesting).\n\nThe similarities with other MOBAs end there. Character classes differ vastly from each other, not only in the abilities they possess, but also in their complex movement traits (some are fast, some are slow, some can jump high, some can hover in the air, others can fly). There is an enourmous variety as each ability's effects and the possible upgrades for each, which can lead to a lot of different possible strategies for a single class.\n\nMap design is clever. Currently there are not a lot of them, but clearly each and every map available was well thought of to allow for resourceful use of its elements both offensively and defensively. The map selected for a match can have a very high influence in its outcome, as you may excel in a certain map with a certain class and play poorly in another.\n\nThe basic game options available are four: The quick match, which randomly selects players based on their League, the Practice mode, that allows you to practice with and against bots, Battle, which allows you invite friends to be your teammates, and Custom Game, which is available only for Starstorm DLC owners, and allows players to create a completely custom match, defining settings like starting solar, creep spawn rate, maximum number of bots allowed, and several other modifiers. Custom Games have two different game modes, aside from the classic mode (destroy the base): Team Deathmatch, which takes the bases away and the ultimate objective of the match itself is scoring kills, and Randomnauts, which is exactly like the classic mode, but each time a player spawns it gets a random awesomenaut with a random build (upgrades are randomly and automatically purchased as Solar is acquired).\n\nThe audio in this game is superb. Every map has a background music that is slightly different depending on the class you're playing and every character has a theme song, a killstreak song, and a lot of fine voice acting lines. The SFX is also very, very well done. There is a handful of custom announcers available for purchase, as well.\n\nCosmetically, this game features a lot of character skins (premium ones come with custom voice acting) which helps add visual variability to the experience, the only downside being the price (but if you like the game it is a nice way to support the developers!)\n\nThe downsides of this game, and veteran players will mostly agree with me, are the matchmaking, and the connection layer in general. The players are paired according to their League, which increases or decreases as you win or lose matches in a given season. That is already a problem, because your season's league ranking doesn't necessarily reflect your skills. Seasons are short and once one is over, you can often get skilled players mixed with beginners, for example. The matchmaking has a doubtful way of choosing the player who will host the match, what will many times result in undesirable lag (which can and will affect the match outcome). At times you may even experience a network-related crash or disconnection (sometimes when the host quits the match).\n\nMy general impression is that this game is a must-play, even if you do not like the genre. It is almost guaranteed that you will like it, and even if you don't like, it is certainly worth the try.","December 30, 2014","true","557.3"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","35","52","4","0"

Not caring about winning and game-breaking issues casual.\n\nI can handle losing just fine and I couldn't care less about ranking. Being out-played and out-maneuvered comes with any online game. You play until you get better.

Or the terrible matchmaking making you join a game where everyone has 300+ ping (yes you can set the game to find only local players but the player base is so small I've had that take 15+ minutes. And then the game is force-started because someone is too impatient).\n\nThere's issues involving lag even in local region games that have been around since game launch and continue to persist and will forever persist, because the game uses a p2p hosting model instead of a dedicated server.

This one would surely be one of them.\nBut since this is one of my most favourite games, I rather not hit the "Not recommended" cause that would make me feel bad. Let's say my review is a kind of warning for future players, as I will talk more about the disadvantages rather than the advantages.\n\nThis game, as the title already says is really, really Awesome, it has tons of potentials, in my eyes it beats Dota2 and even League of Legends (and I like the latter) just to mention the two most popular MOBAs which are kinda similar to Awesomenauts.\n\nSo the task is, you are in a 3v3 match, you with your two teammates have to defend your base on a battle arena which is also protected by 3 or 4 turrets, that's depending on the map. Both teams have 3-3 (or 4-4) turrets. There are various champions, characters, whichever you call them to choose from, and each and one of them has different, unique abilities. From the medic to the assassin, supports, tanks, you can find different classes, and even these little "types" have different selections. The background story is simple yet still enough for this game, the characters all have their own background stories and the design (even the most of the skins) are also amazing. So, everything is set up for a perfect game, what's wrong then?\n\nPretty much everything else. Sadly.\n\n1 . Let's start with the matchmaking. Catastrophy. Horrific. A complete disaster. The game has no dedicated servers, so you pretty much have to wait until the matchmaking finds players from your region (and this one is preferred, or else you have to deal with laggers, and even with this set up you will probably meet them), sometimes it takes like, 5 minutes or even more. And when you are finally in a game which has not started earlier (and will be a losing match as you will get dropped into the place of angry ragequitters), you will probably have to deal with people who have higher ranks than you. And here comes the second most horrible thing;\n\n2. The ranking system. I can't describe how it works, because I absolutely don't understand it. You can't choose to play or not play ranked matches like in LoL, you will be categorized into leagues, but the way you level up to higher leagues or get dropped back into the former seems to be really, really random. And if you get into higher leagues because out of your 20 matches you luckily won one, you have to deal with the bigger guys. And by bigger, I pretty much say guys with the highest ranks and prestige, becase those are the ones who I get mostly, even if I am in league 6, with prestige 1. I always, and no joke, always get enemies with max prestige, and league 3-4. Maybe even higher. I don't need to mention how do I end up.\n\n3. The last, and probably the worst thing in this game is the "community", if I can call this a community. I have met a few communities before, but this game definitely has the worse, pretty similar to LoL I'd say. Your teammates calling you noob if you die once, your enemies tapping the taunt button more than M1, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s everywhere, trolls, ragequitters who leave you alone with bots, and enemies still taunting you. During this 70 hours I have met like, 1 or 2 nice random helpful players in this game, seriously. And there is no kickvote or ban system either.\n\n4. I also want to mention how I disagree with the content what you have to pay for. Sure, a few skins to buy them, the devs need to eat something of course (no irony), but there are also characters what you can unlock only with using your debit card, pretty strong characters (I'd not call them p2w though) and instead of a few serious fixes or developing, the company seems to put all their efforts into the new skins and into some occasional bugfixes. Oh, and to nerf Voltar to be almost useless.\n\nAll in all what I can say about this game is that it is really addicting with its unique humour, gameplay and overall experience, but has so, so many backsides that it might not even be a benefit to play this game. Unless you have nerves made of ropes. I'd suggest the game for people who can be ignorant against trolls, can deal with stress easily, and like this genre.\n\n(Also I am sorry for my grammar errors and typos, my English is not the best, and my typing is even worse.)","February 2, 2015","true","96.4"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","25","37","5","2"

In the interest of trying to communicate its appeal, however, I will go over some of the many details that put it in a league of its own.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayEmPlays/recommended/204300/","JayEmPlays","JayEmPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JayEmPlays/","213 products in account","After two-three long years of Awesomenauts, I thought I might give you my full thoughts about this game, now that we are getting close to the end of the Starstorm DLC development and the new Matchmaking server.\n\nFirst of all, my feelings toward this game are mostly positive. I love the general gameplay style, it's like Smash Bros meeting MOBAs like Dota and LoL, 2D and stuff.\nMusic, oh boy, Sonic Picnic has really given their best with the game's soundtrack.\nVisuals, they're great, I love the 1980's cartoon style Ronimo has been going for, same goes for the characters and lore in general.\nRonimo keeps updating the game with more characters, visual and gameplay advancements, new features such as new bots you can play with, when not having players in game, new game modes in custom games, skins and announcers. It's the reason the game is still going on for it's 3rd year on Steam, has got PS4 release that is also updated from time to time, and Xbox One -version coming.\nCommunity involvement is great thing with this game, as I myself have made some sort of "career" on YouTube somewhat because of Awesomenauts. We've walked the path of YouTube together for these +2 years. And I thank both this game and it's developers with cooperation :) Also, the community of players might sometimes feel childish etc, but there are a lot of smart people who strive to keep Awesomenauts, well, awesome. We have had some great tournaments and other events, our suggestion for character voice lines, skin and/or character ideas are passed down to the game in one form or another, and in example, Replays have given us options to make more different kinds of gameplay videos to YouTube.\n\nOf course, this game has it's issues. Since Ronimo can't afford to rewrite the netcode for Awesomenauts to enable dedicated servers, players have to deal with P2P, which will cause problems if 1. Player/players have faulty connection and/or 2. players involved are from different countries. Of course you can limit the options your matchmaking queue goes for, but it's a bit flawed until Ronimo implements their new Matchmaking servers around the release of Overdrive expansion (which isn't required to use the matchmaking servers, mind you). Connection problems aren't fixed by that, but at least matchmaking will be more "fair" towards players of different skill levels and you are less likely to be put in a game against players from other side of the world.\nSpeaking of skill levels, new players might find problems to start the game if they skip beginner missions and jump right into the online games (which is not recommended). Skill level might vary even in the higher leagues of leaderboards, but there are cases that new players quit the game because they don't feel the need of commitment to learn the basics and advanced techniques of the game and it's characters.\nThen there's character balance. Some characters are already pretty balanced in a sense, but then there are one's that are doomed to be bad or too good. But, balancing acharacter isn't a walk on a sunshine, it's like stacking a house of cards. One slip and the whole house of cards might collapse, of course, then you have to start over again, but once you get it right, man, it feels satisfying. Even though you're missing couple of cards, which in this game are incoming characters and maps.\n\nBut, my likes, which are plenty, clearly overpower the dislikes towards this game, and over 2000 hours in the game, I say that I love this game. I believe that Ronimo can and will strive to make this game stand out and stay alive for a long time, and I'm willing to stay with Ronimo until the day Awesomenauts has to move to a higher plane of existence.\n\nFor about 10 euros (and hefty amount of sales/giveaways you can get this game from) this game is worth your time for at least those 10 hours. DLCs are mostly skins and announcers, and the Starstorm Expansion, but even without those you can get some solid hours in to this game. It's also great with friends, be it normal games or Custom games. With the upcoming matchmaking servers, Overdrive Expansion with three new characters, not to mention free character Ix the Interloper from the 2nd Design-a-naut contest and Starstorm station map AND character art updates for older characters, this game gets the love it deserves from the company who made it, and it should get the love it deserves from you, too.\n\nBuy it.

The characters are each unique in personality.\nHackers/cheaters are relatively rare.\nThe music by Sonic Picnic is exquisite. If you are going to buy anything from this, you should buy the soundtrack.\nUnfortunately, this is where the fun ends.\n\nMatchmaking is terrible, peer2peer technology which means that lag is abound. For some reason the matchmaker is still stuck in 1998 whereas it only offers you to search games by ever-reducing selection (worldwide, continent, local) instead of pairing you with others on the basis of latency/packetloss compatibilities and tolerance.\n\nMoreover, the pairing of opponents based upon rank is seemingly non-existent whereas you may face a team of extreme aces with a couple of complete novices for teammates and vice versa, or mixed and so on.\n\nAdditionally, the game allows late joins. You may be one such lucky 'winner' as to be selected to join a game in progress, for the past twenty minutes, whereas all the players on the team you got tossed onto have quit the game and the opponents been pummeling on bots and becoming superiorly strong for the entire time.\nYou may even rake in the jackpot and join a game that a player has quite precisely five seconds before the base is destroyed and the game is over with a defeat for you (which you WILL take a dive in ranking for).\n\nThink of many such fun small joyful defects the game is rife with.\nOh, and it is worth of mentioning to note that the community is chokeful with acidic terribly-behaved children (at least mentally). Which, of course, the developers pander to happily.\n\nTo top it all off, there is no semblence of balance. The disparity becoming fast evident and very wide in scale.\nWith some characters being exquisitely over the top whereas others are scrapping at the bottom. Some of them featuring extremely "cheesy" or "lame" easy methods of combining certain abilities/power-ups to either kill any opponent within mere seconds regardless of their strength/health/abilities or to escape out of any situation essentially becoming unkillable.\n\nSome of the strongest characters are also locked behind a DLC pay-wall, effectively turning the game somewhat onto "pay2win" situation.\n\nWatching plays as a spectator on youtube is also not very enjoyable, barring the game from any possible future as an e-sports entirely.","July 3, 2015","false","300.8"," 96 of 170 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","96","170","10","12"

These games have always been a non-go for me : gameplay too slow (point & click, no way to evade stuff, little skill involved), learning curve too high (you have to read plenty of guides before you can get a handle on what are the good builds, what to buy etc..), and their community usually just suck. Ragequitting, flaming, "competitive" players, you name it.\n\nAwesomenauts is the exception.\n\nEasy learning curve\nThis is what kept me playing during my first hours. I did not have to read guides, or to worry about my build - i was just having fun playing this little game. In a few hours only I had understood the basic mechanics of the game.\n\nVery fast gameplay\nJump, shoot, drop, drop, shoot, oh damn there's someone needing help !\nTake the jump pad, dash towards the enemies, thus saving your mate, and then drop down to jungle and escape. Woosh, you nearly died, but you just saved your mate.\n\n♥♥♥♥, in the mean time droids have pushed. Drop, clear bottom droids, take the jump pad.\nOk, your two buddies are right there in top lane, and you see the 3 enemies standing there. Time to initiate ! You dash, your mates follow, you prevent them from escaping by bodyblocking them while nado'ing.. One is about to espape, you are about to die, but your friend Nibbs just launched her Orb, teleports, and the guy is dead. It's a wipeout. Time to push !\n\nAnd that's basically what the entire game is like. You have no time to rest. You always have something to do, always on your nerves. The slightest mistake might turn the fate of the game.. But you keep playing, you keep pushing. Until victory (or defeat) is achieved.\n\nEasy to learn, and yet so hard to master\nAfter more than 600 hours in this game, I still did not master 100% of the game.\n\nEach one of the 23 characters has a completely different gameplay. That's 23 playstyles to master.  Out of these 23, I think I'm mastering 8 of them. I still have 15 characters to continue learning.. And that's what keeps me playing, even after 600 hours.\n\nEpic moments !\nBe it when you kill someone in air battle, or when you barely escape a gank and manage nevertheless to kill one of them, resulting in a wipeout (all 3 of the enemy team dead) because your team supported you - or when both of your team mates died, but all 3 enemies have low health, and you manage to take them all out..\n\nThese kind of moments are so rare in the recent games, that Awesomenauts is a perl just for this sake.\n\nThe cons\nThis game is not perfect though. (no game is)\nThe community still have a couple of weird people. The kind of people that are attracted by the "MOBA" and "F2P" labels. Flamers, ragequitters, ...\nMatchmaking is not great. But the next big update coming in March should solve this issue.\nPeer-to-peer system. You can get hit while you're not supposed to on your screen.\nFinal Words\nAlong with Rollcage and Freespace, this game is one of the 3 best games I have ever played in my life. I recommend it to anyone who likes 2D games. I got this game in a Humble Bundle, left it in my library, and only played it once a friend reviewed it on Steam..\n\nI only wish I had started playing this game sooner","February 20","true","897.2"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","18","27","0","0"

If you're a new player, this is like Dark Souls but with High Ranking players as the bosses and you dont have any equipment with only 1 game under your belt. Much like Quasso's review, the match making, as the game puts it, is completely "Zorked."\n\n"But you only have 10 hours under your belt." Yea, but that's 10 hours of facing players in the top 100 while I have what, 1-20 games under my belt. There was only ONE game where I was placed with people further down the list and even then they were still 1000 ranks above. I was REALLY hoping it was just because the game was trying to figure out where I am on the ranking list but even then after finding out where I placed I still fight the top 100 of thousands.\n\n"Get gud" Yea because I'm forced to choose 2 things with this game: Spend 100s of hours just to be decent and maybe shadow the higher rank players or just lose 20 games in a row. Winning isn't everything but I'll tell you what, it's not fun losing every game you enter.\n\nEven if I continue to play this game, the Community here will just call me out on doing poorly. "I'm new" means nothing to those elitist kids like come on.\n\nIt's such a huge shame when this game is fun to play but if I can't learn to play it or adapt to these top 100 players play styles then there's no point in me or others turning this game into a "chore." to get better at this game.\n\nUntil the ranking system is better I haft to agree with the top review. Fun as hell to play especially with friends, but the matchmaking is god aweful.\n\nBalancing	As to be expected, the DLC characters have beefier stats than the base characters. This is simply because if there was no true incentive to buy the DLC, then there would be no need to stray from the free characters you get in the first place.\n\nThis happens all the times in games with DLC characters such as League of Legends. However, League of Legends demand for a new character is often due to his/her new and unique playstyle rather than pure stats. You can still very much outplay some one with a DLC character but they have more leeway with making mistakes and their stats. However, even talking with some experienced players in the top 100, they say their stats are unbalanced but can still be overcome.\n\nThis goes back to the first issue however. If a more advanced players uses a DLC character, they have the advantage of the stats and skill over just skill itself as it should be.\n\nThis is a minor issue to be honest but an issue non the less.\n\nClient Side Hosting and its problems	Unlike a lot of other games, this game hosts games VIA Peer to Peer server hosting, or client to client hosting.\n\nA majority of my games are met with having 400-600 ping (On average, even connecting to someone in the UK from California, I'll have 80 ping at the most!!) and if the host is on the other team, his moves will register just fine while yours will have a delay. This makes skill shot characters almost useless. Some people as hosts can abuse this with something called Lag Switching: A simple program you can set up to purposely put a heavier load on your Modem, giving you higher latency.\n\nAlso on the rise recently, I have been in a few games that a host has forced others to disconnect through a hangup program or a DDP (Direct Distruption Program) that forces other IPs or connections to disconnect from them (The Host). Ironically, these are the games I have had the best ping with (24-50). I have reported both cases and one has resulted in a VAC ban so at least this problem is being taken care of... at a snail's pace.\n\nThis ONLY happens with a Client Side hosting system such as in this game. These hackers would haft to DDoS them which is more difficult to do if the game had its own servers.\n\n\nHopefully I'll play you again later Awesomenauts.","May 16","false","12.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","9"

It knew what it wanted to be- it was a little MOBA with a different perspective on the whole thing. Pre-Startstorm (Yes, I mean Starstorm) the game had its true character, with many mechanical differences setting it apart from other games in the genre. Picking which items would be in the shop before the battle was interesting in my opinion- okay, it might not have been a 'good' mechanic, but it gave the game character. And the level system? The level system... Why Ronimo, just why? We had a game that had something to set it out from the masses before from mechanical standpoint. Now we don't even have that. The level system means that a bad start always leads to a bad end- the enemy gets 1 level up from you for more than about 2 minutes and they'll get too far ahead- you won't be able to bounce back unless they choke HARD.\n\nAwesomenauts is different from a gameplay standpoint from many of the games in the genre, being 2D, but this is simply the game's shell. Ronimo decided to take the game's soul away a long time ago, and slowly the body has been deteriorating without it. By now, it is simply a husk, lifeless and souless. The matchmaking is broken- reguarly pitting prestige 10 people against those who haven't even unlocked every character yet. I can't tell if that's bad programming or just that Ronimo killed their game a while back, but in any case, right now, in its current state, I have to recommend you stay away from this game.\n\nRonimo?

A bit of dirt and grime on it, but a gem nonetheless. The dirt and grime could have been cleaned off, but update after update the dirt and grime kept building. There'd be something to help clean the gem off, and something to dump it in the mud. But with this recent patch, it is no longer a gem. Ronimo have tarnished it beyond belief with the ideals of aking the game faster, almost outright refusal to fix balence issues the community has been crying out for, and seemingly lack of listening.\n\nI have over 1000 hours on Awesomenauts in total. ~700 of which were earned on the Xbox 360. Today, the Xbox 360 version is for more different than the PC version. It was abandoned after only the first update having only two extra characters than the original six. It sits in immense unbalance and it was much more rage endusing than what the PC version was. It was a point of insanely unbalanced characters and upgrades, and the top dogs were extremely obvious, especialy with the small roster it had. I played it constantly becaasue despite it's unbalance it was a gem. It was one of my favorite games period. But after a while the unbalace got to me. The top dogs of the console community were the most imfamous people because they completely abused the unbalance.\n\nAfter some time of Awesomenauts being on the sidelines and my ignoring it, I aquired the PC version.  It was great, so much better than the console version, I loved it so much, regardless of being even barely able to run it due to my horrendus PC. I had regained interest of this gem and I played it constantly, racking up 100 hours in a relatively short time.\n\nBut then they dropped it in the mud. This most recent patch has ruined the game, dropping a pile of logs on the fire that was the game's unbalance. It already had broken haracters that, regardless of the communities outcry to fix them, Ronimo ignored them and allowed them to remain broken for the most part. Then they added the In Game XP System. This was added to try to make games faster when it could have been more accomplished by many other means. Reworking upgrades and characters, making different maps besides the 3 maps that can be played online. This new Xp system took most of the fun out of the game, removing challenge and fairness. It made it nearly impossible to win a game with a bad start. Before a team, or hell, even ONE player on a team, with enough skill, could make an amazing comeback. Now? The game is decided within the the first 3 minutes. If one team just gets a couple levels ahead of the other early on, they steamroll. They become a snowball of death and misery and it takes all enjoyment out of the game, and makes it nearly impossible to come back by increasing the team's flat health and damage every level they gain, making it harder, and harder, and harder to comeback. This was a terrible idea.\n\nAs of the current patch, this game is no longer a gem. It is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. This game was once great and could be again. Ronimo just needs to fix what the community has been wanting fixed. If Ronimo fixes the issues I mentioned here, I urge you to pruchase this game, but in it's current state, I can't say that this is a good game and that you should play it.\n\nThe only way the game is good at this time is when you have a large pack of friends and play custm games together. The online is ruined by unbalance and attempts to change the game for the "better". But as I said, if they fix the present issues, I could not urge you to get this game enough, but I recommend you avoid it at the current time.\n\n","February 20","false","283.1"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","1"

The game is simple, each team have to push against waves of human players or their AI sidekicks (if less player); whichever bunch gets through the other side first takes home the win. Turret situations, summon spots bring forth extra help, and concealed ways permit players to flank their enemies. Awesomenauts fabricates an intricate layer of system around a no frills 2D center, and this is the place attentive players will find brilliant strategies.\n\nEach character has a unique set of skills, consisting of a free-use weapon and two special actions. As the player acquires Solar, they can return to their base to heal and spend the Solar on various upgrades to these skill sets or core statistics such as movement speed and health. For each of four areas: the two special skills, their free weapon, and general statistics, the player can selected to buy up to three of six available improvements, with some improvements which can be bought multiple times with benefits stacked.\nAwesomenauts is like a mini version of Dota !","May 13, 2015","true","38.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

Several years after the 2013 Kickstarter there's a map called "Starstorm Pre-Alpha" with no graphic but misalligned lines, and nothing interesting on it except a couple of teleporters.\n\nNow, though, they've added an experience system which does nothing but make the game seem more "advanced" and put "+xp" in purple over everything you kill, without even saying how much you get. Just +xp. It slightly increases your stats, though, so all it does is lie and add unneccessary imbalance possibilities.\n\nThere's tons of unnecessary balance changes that make no sense, making many characters useless and others very good. And since the experience mechanic was shoehorned in, everything was changed to percentage incereases instead of flats, making you unsure on just how much you'll get without hovering over the tooltip, seeing it's current damage, and then doing some math in your head. There is no time for any of that.\n\nBut, if you like MOBAs that have two dlc packs, no balance, and unnecessary shoehorned in mechanics just to lie making the game seem more like other games, which are good, then this game is right for you.","February 5","false","126.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feederguy/recommended/204300/","feederguy","it's high noon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feederguy/","1128 products in account","The fun and beauty of Awesomenauts lies in it delivering the MOBA experience found in games such as DOTA, but at a far more casual and beginner-friendly level.\n\nJust as with DOTA, the idea of the game is to destory turrets across numerous "lanes" to get to the opponent team's boss structure. Autonomous creeps are spawned from each team that attack the other team's structures, with the player commanding a hero that grows more powerful as the game progresses. Unlike most traditional MOBAs which are in 3D, Awesomenauts takes on a simpler 2D form reminiscent of platformer games. Games typically span 20 minutes and pit teams of 3 Nauts against each other.\n\nInstead of over 80 heroes in DOTA, there is only a small pool of 10+ Nauts to choose from. There is also no need to delve into the nitty-gritty of what items to buy or what stats/skills to train - the skill tree of the Nauts is far more simple. Other elements such as warding, lasthitting, denying, creep pulling etc. are also left out.\n\nThat is not to say there is zero depth to the game. Individual player skill and teamwork remain of prime importance to ensure victory just as with any other MOBA. Some Nauts have a fairly high skill cap and various synergies which help add to the strategic element of the game - all this under a deceptively simple facade where each Naut only has two skills.\n\nThe artwork is crisp and colorful, with no disorienting clutter during teamfights. Other notable upsides to the game are its fairly large and active community (with at least 1000 players ingame at any moment, finding a game is easy) and a ranking system. There is no pay-to-win, with all heroes being unlockable and any additional purchases being cosmetic only.\n\nDownsides to this game would be that associated with almost any MOBA - balance issues. This is especially pertinent when the hero pool is small - overpowered Nauts make the game less fun for everyone else.\n\nAnother major problem is that the game automatically fills empty slots with bots, which typically do little other than feed the enemy gold. Furthermore, there is little disincentive for a player to leave a game if they are losing, which perpetuates the problem of *most* games being one-sided stomps against a full party of bots at the end.\n\nDespite this, Awesomenauts remains a fun game at heart, especially if you play it with friends.","June 2, 2013","true","49.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camaera/recommended/204300/","camaera","CAMaera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camaera/","171 products in account","In a MOBA, there are typically levels. You level up and your stats increase, and you usually gain a large amount of money. Now imagine that you're playing LoL, DOTA 2, whatever your choice MOBA is. Imagine that when you get a kill, your entire team gets a huge amount of EXP and money. More than you would get if you had the best possible CS(Creep Score) at that point in the game.\n\nThis is what Awesomenauts decided to do with the EXP system. Upon killing an enemy(which will happen before one team even reaches level 1),  the team's shared EXP shoots through the roof, giving ~1.5 levels. For this level up, the team gets a large amount of Solar(the game's currency, used to buy items), and their base stats increase, namely HP and Attack.\n\nBefore this EXP system, there was no way to get stronger but by purchasing items. This added a level of depth to the flow of the game, as leaving to buy items was a time-consuming process. You gambled everytime you decided to stay out after killing an enemy, chanced that you would still be strong enough to take on your enemy, who had just bought items. Leaving at the wrong time could cause your turrets or teammates to be decimated by the larger enemy force.\n\nBy playing your cards right, you could turn the entire game on it's head during these times, defeating foes as a team that you would usually lose to by yourself, or boldly attacking turrets head-on when no enemies were around. This, however, could make games a little longer. And 40 minutes might seem like a normal game of any other MOBA, but for Awesomenauts, that was loooooong, because typical games were 25 minutes, and that was with plenty of back-and-forth.\n\nThe creators of the game, however, wanted to make games shorter. It's an appealing concept, but Awesomenauts was already very, very fast-paced. I never noticed that 25 minutes had passed, because there was just so much to do, and the possibility of coming back after a team-clearing battle was entirely possible. Awesomenauts was a game that made you interested, and you wanted to be focused, because even if you messed up, even if your K/D was 0-10, you could still win, you could still be the underdog that came from nowhere with a sneaky play and stole the game.\n\nSome new characters(namely Rocco) ruined this aspect. You now had Ashe in the form of a bird, and he could hit you through turrets, from his own spawn. He could teleport back and fire an arrow to ward off or even kill enemies that were going after turrets. Coming back wasn't the most viable thing in the world now. But it was still entirely possible.\n\nAnd then they introduced the EXP system. At first, I was intrigued. Some characters were quite hard to get going at the start of a game, even if you got first blood. So I was hoping this would rectify that, and balance out some of the "late-blooming" characters.\n\nI was wrong. The EXP system changed the game from this mysterious, complex game of back-and-forth into a game where first blood was all that mattered. A game where one slip-up, a little bit of lag leading you to get killed meant that you lost the game for your team. The game was not forgiving anymore, bending to the way of skilled players who may have died once or twice in a game, but was now rigid, placing a wall between the team who didn't get first blood and any shot at victory.\n\nSome people might like this new system, it does turn the first 1-3 minutes of every game into a toss-up, and makes those >3 minutes really tense. But after someone gets a kill, it's just a matter of watching that team win over the next 5-10 minutes.\n\nSo, if you like games where one teammate or a single slip-up costs you the entire game, buy it.\n\nBut if you want a game where anyone can come back, the underdog can win, and the game is determined by not just skill in a single kill, but skill over an entire game, in strategy and observation?\n\nYou missed it. It's gone.\n\nAnd I'm sorry you missed it, because it was easily the best MOBA I've ever played. The community loved the game, and the game loved the community.\n\nI'm refunding this game because it's not the game I paid for, all that time ago. It's a 3-minute game, with a toxic community due to a new system that places blame squarely on an individual player for a loss.\n\nThanks for the good times, Awesomenauts. But I guess the best things never last.","February 6","false","123.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Besides your typical knowledge about characters, their specializations and skills, you will also need some platforming experience as well, especially that certain characters have different movement abilities than others (certain are even capable of flight). It's action-packed and fun, but very hard to grasp and often turns into an unreadable chaotic mess due to the sheer amount of stuff that is going on at the same time.\n\nGraphic-wise, the special effects look nice, and all the characters have their own general style, though they all are pretty cartoonish and sometimes a little cheesy. It does add a bit to their charm, however.\n\nThe music is, for the lack of better wording, awesome. Each character has their own musical theme (which also plays if you get a killstreak) and all of them are a good listen, especially that they cover a lot od different styles and genres, like Clunk's metal or Voltar's classical orchestra.\n\nSo, on the surface the game feels nice, but the problems begin piling up when you go play online.\n\nThe first thing is the horrible supposedly skill-based matchmaking. I say supposedly as it only operates on a league system, with each player being given a number, 1 being the highest, and 9 being the lowest in skill. The main two flaws are the fact that leagues reset every two months, so the first one or two weeks after the reset newbies are very likely to encounter skilled players who will absolutely stomp them to the ground, and the other is that the matchmaker has no problem teaming you up with a premade team consisting of Prestige 10 players (who reset and regained their levels a total of ten times) when you're new to the game, which, unless some kind of a miracle happens, will most likely result in a complete steamroll.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the balance changes are made on a constant basis and while this is good in general, it also makes most user-made guides outdated pretty fast, so you're effectively stuck with the general description of character's role and abilities, and maybe a friend's help when it comes to learning the game, and considering it's a MOBA platformer, it's not only pretty harsh at the start, but also very easy to lose against veterans.\n\nThe game does put up a certain "Difficulty" rating on each 'Naut, either Easy, Medium or Hard, but it's honestly far from correct. For example, it labels Coco as "Easy" even though she relies very heavily on mobility and correct use of her abilities instead of just whacking things in the head with your weapon, while at the same time calling Swiggins "Hard" despite his abilities being rather straightforward and generally easy to use.\n\nThere are also certain Starstorm-exclusive 'Nauts where I can barely stop myself from calling them "pay to win" (mostly looking at Nibbs), so I am going to use a more generally accepted term of "horribly skill-gated and not fun to play against unless you know the exact way to counter them".\n\nWhen it comes to the expansion itself, it kind of does not help my opinion about the developer when they already begin to collect preorders for the next expansion, Overdrive, when they didn't even release everything associated with the Starstorm expansion (namely its exclusive map). Generally speaking you should finish the content people already paid for before moving on to create content for a separate purchase, unless you want people to look at you a bit shadily. To the developer's credit, however, they do release some free updates for everyone every few months.\n\nOverall, this is a fun at its core, but very difficult to master and incredibly demotivating at start game. Personally, I just can't get myself into it big-time. Badly-designed matchmaker, a lot of things being far from obvious at first, and certain characters being just way too tricky to counter effectively while being generally easy to use if you're new to the game are some of the factors that kill it for me. It's not a bad game, just one that's ridiculously difficult to learn at start and where the high skill ceiling makes it pretty much impossible to play casually unless you restrict yourself to bot matches.\n\n@EDIT: Tried a match after the Overdrive came out. Matchmaker still matched me and two other newbies against high-prestige players. Also just after one game I can tell Jimmy is insanely cheap with "lemme ambush and charge you into my turret halfway across the field while you can't even escape" tactics. There was a beta test for the new 'Nauts before that so there's no way they didn't catch that earlier.\nIn other words, my opinion on the game went down drastically. The expansion packs resort to what feels like P2W tactics at this point, and the supposedly new matchmaker is still crap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rejera/recommended/204300/","rejera","Rejera","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rejera/","210 products in account","Is this game fun, Well yes. BUT there are somethings that need to change in order for this game to truely be a good game.\n\nPros.\nThe game perfectly captures the moba spirit, but in a fast paced action platformer. Don't like RTS style constant clicking? Think there's not enough action in Dota or league of legends? This game has it.\n\nVoice acting and soundtrack are great.\nartstyle is nice and fresh\n\nThe game IS fun.\n\nNegatives.\n\nThis game can not be competitive yet. There are numerous reasons why, but let's start off with the worst offenders.\n\n1. There is no strategy to picking a character. None. There isn't a draft, so you can't see what the other team is going to pick. It's like Blind pick in league of legends. There's a reason for that mode not being ranked. If the other team happens to pick a character that counters yours, you're screwed the entire game.\n\nI propose something like league of legends. Each team can ban 1 character, and they take turns picking their characters while the one they picked is shown to both teams. Until this is implemented, If you are looking for a serious competition, go look elsewhere.\n\n2. The Paywall.\nWhat Paywall? The expansion. I'm fine with them having an expansion. That isn't the issue. Here's the issue. Almost all of the expansion characters have a attack that passes through the turrets. Normally, you can use the turret as a shield to take some damage while you fight off the enemy team. A lot of the characters in the expansion have attacks that can go through said turret. nibbs, Penny, Ted McPain (in levels that have the turrets on top of the jungle area), sentry x58 has an attack that draws you in from behind the turret. You see where I'm going with this? Ok. So there are characters that can get you behind the turret. There must be one that can in the normal game too, right? Yeah, there is. One. Coco. So if you have the expansion, you can poke the heck out of anyone behind the turret, but if you just have the base game? Just pray there's a coco on your team or you're screwed because you can't touch them.\n\n3. Joining late games.\nThe game has bots take over after someone leaves. That's awesome and well needed in other mobas. You know what isn't awesome? Other players can then join the game and replace these bots. I've had numerous times where I'd join a game, only to find out all the turrets were gone for us and the whole team had rage quit so I'm the only one there. A garenteed lose. Gee, thanks. Unfortunately this happens WAY to often. You get screwed just for wanting to play the game! If people still want that feature, fine. Put a switch in there that you can click and say "I only want to join NEW games. NOT games in progress." This sucks.\n\n4. Disconnections. The game gives you a penalty for quiting the game. This is good. Unfortunately, You can't rejoin games that you have disconnected from. Internet goes down for a second? Congrats, you are now punished when you start another game.  Game crashes? Punished. Fair, right? You should be able to rejoin games that you we disconnected from. Simple as that.\n\nSummary:\nThis game is fun. I always have a good match or two when playing. But, because of these problems, I can't recommend this game. These issues need to be fixed before this game is good enough to recommend to anyone.","March 7, 2015","false","68.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","4"

While it might not be as competitive as other MOBAs (like Dota or LoL), it's a great game that's easy to learn but hard to master. Filled with unique and interesting characters, Awesomenauts has kept me playing for hours on end.\n\nPositives    Creative, innovative take on conventional MOBA-styled games.\nCharming, unique characters that all play differently.\nAmazing soundtrack and artstyle.\nResponsive controls.\nDevelopers are amazing, and work very hard to keep the game balanced and fun.\nEncourages team-based gameplay.\nReally fun for friends to play together.\nGreat community, with loads of artwork, mods and guides.\nA lot of replayability (Just look at how many hours I've played.)\nNegatives    No dedicated servers, so there's sometimes lag.\nMatchmaking a little unpredictable (but it is being worked on!)\nAllows players to leave mid-game without good consequence.\nCan be frustrating at times.\nConclusion\nAwesomenauts it's a really fun, action-packed game that encourages teamwork and strategy. It's a game you can tell was built with love and heart, from not just the developers, but also the community. Personally, I would (and have) recommend this to anyone who's just looking for a fun time!","September 7, 2015","true","865.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Essentially they made all of the characters much weaker, and added a XP system where everytime you get a kill on a player / creep / turret, you get XP to level up. Everytime you level up you're entire team gets a +4% to healh and +4% to DMG. So if a team gets a good start it's almost impossible to come back from. It's not fun for a long time player, and I'm sure it would be even worse for a new player. I would highly advise waiting until this is changed / fixed.","December 3, 2015","false","780.3"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","27","46","0","0"

It has all of the trappings you've come to expect from your dota clones: XP, gold, buying, mindless drones running in lanes, turrets, bases, and trash-talking players.  The characters are all unique and have really interesting designs.  I love how there's themes for each characters.  Every win, if you can manage to secure one, is accompanied by a chorus of singers belting out a short stinger of "The Awesomenats!" that doesn't get old.  Alas...\n\nThis game might have been fun to play when it was released when there were more players.  As it stands now, the player base has diminished and the only people playing are the diehards who have hundreds, if not thousands of hours in the game.  There are no room for newbies here, which unfortunately precludes me from truly enjoying the game.  I have received my fair share of insults and trash talk from both teammates and opponents alike.\n\nLike all "MOBA" games, the small team sizes (even smaller than the usual 5v5) puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the individual to perform.  Having a weak link on the team is a death sentence, but that may go without saying to those familiar with "MOBA" games.\n\nAt the time of writing, there is a single expansion pack out that contains 5 new characters with another expansion on the way.  Unable to play them myself, I cannot make a completely accurate judgment.  However, being subjected to enemy teams composed of these DLC characters, I find them extremely potent when compared to the vanilla characters.\n\nThe second expansion, which apparently required a Kickstarter, promises 5 additional characters, an extra map, and a replay system.  With a game that struggles to maintain 1000 concurrent players, it's probably too little too late.\n\nI cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone.  There are plenty of other games that are worth your time and attention.  This isn't one of them.","March 1","false","18.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

You are on a team of 3 people, let's just say that two of you guys are doing good, but one person on the team is doing bad, you will lose, because that team member that keeps dying, is giving the other team a bunch of levels and upgrades. This is probably one of the only team based multiplayer game that I know of where one team member can impact the other two team members that much. Not only that, this is the most unbalanced multiplayer competitive game that I have played.\n\nThere are certain characters that are just mismatches. What I mean by that is that some characters are just weak against other characters, kind of like Pokemon. If you want to win any matches at all, you have to use the overpowered characters, like the recent DLC characters.  Before DLC characters were implemented into the game, there were a few unfair, or overpowered characters, but after DLC characters, the game just became pay to win. Yes, you pay for DLC and you will win matches, guaranteed.\n\nI used to like this game because I thought it was unique, and it really stood out on Steam, however all of the updates that the developers have made to this game has changed it to DLC, Pay to win, unbalanced mess.

I've given these people money over and over again and instead of getting what I originally payed for they took it away and made into something else entirely. I'm not even angry any more, just upset, like what I thought was the unreasonable behavior of a loved one was just the early symptoms of terminal brain cancer.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis was a great game that provided hours of fun and entertainment, truly reminding me of Saturday mornings as a little kid. Emphasis on the was.\n\nThis game was easily my favorite MOBA that I ever encountered, until Ronimo fell for the trap of "listening" to the fans. The frequent hotfixes and character stat changes have left the game damn near unplayable, taking mains or other characters you enjoy playing as and completely changing how they feel, even completely changing skills/abilities.\n\nThe last straw for me was not even the unbalanced Starstorm characters (which I backed on Kickstarter, something I now regret entirely), but rather patch 2.10, which has effectively turned Voltar, the only straight up healer in the game and a solid contender for one of the best supports in any multiplayer game, into a useless squishy blob with no pushing capabilites, no speed, no maneuveribility, and most importantly, an ineffective medic. The one mechanic that was changed to improve him was his increase in DPS for his Drone ability, which works- for anything left completely alone or an afk player, because his drones will actively target everything on the map other than actual threats coming up on top of you.\n\nBuy this game on sale, it goes for 90% fairly often, but don't expect to be playing this game for more than a couple of weeks- the magic will wear off and you'll find yourself left with a mediocre game that doesn't know what it wants to be, and never will as a long as Ronimo keeps on addressing problems that the vocal few "fans" keep bringing up, instead of taking a good hard look at the product and figuring out what needs to change.","June 21, 2015","false","208.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

But if you want to play a moba where the devs pay attention to what the players want, how the game should be balanced, or I don't know, care. This is not the moba for you. With the only thing resembling a competititve scene being dominated by 99c, and the "Prestigious League 1 for the 250 best players" is a total joke. The game isn't hard, the queues and matchmaking are awful to put it lightly. Combine that with very few characters to play, let alone are viable. One of the 'draws' of the game is that it has a very low skill ceiling and a high skill floor, and is supposedly easy for new players to enjoy and play. Again, this is not true. The difference between a good team and a bad team is noticable immediately into the game, and has very little to keep the player playing. The unlock system is completely arbirtary. See, while other mobas like League or SMITE force you to play the game for a while to unlock the things you want, you get to choose what things you want. In Awesomenauts, you have no choice whatsoever about what you unlock. Are you a frog player? Do you see all of these fancy items and great builds that other frogs have? Do you want those items? Well you're going to have to play about 30-35 hours of the game before you can get to that point, oh and I should mention that you can unlock these things faster for winning games, which is near impossible with the disgustingly bad stock items. As for the matchmaking, it's total trash. The matchmaking servers matches you with player within 2 leagues above and below you. Let's take the average League 3 player, not outstandingly good, but still good enough to be about top 8000. You can get matches with anyone from League 5 (roughly top 20000) to League 1 (top 250). If the game can't find anyone within those 5 leagues you can be matched in, it will take literally anyone and put them in your game, for better or for worse. Now this wouldn't be an issue with the game, if it had draws to keep players playing (which it doesnt) achieving League 1 wouldn't be hard if it weren't for the outright broken matchmaking, and even then so few tournaments are held with so small prizes almost always dominated by the same 3 or 4 teams. The devs have absolutely no direction and little involvement with the community, the game is easy with little to no reward for being good, matchmaking and soloqueueing is cancerous beyond description, I haven't even touched on the DLC which for $10 awards players with 4 characters who are absolutely dominant in the current meta (if this game could even be considered as having a meta), the balance is constantly changing with every patch and the devs are putting time into things noone cares about, games are near impossible to win if you're on your backfoot in even the first 5 minutes, everything about this game is maddening to say the least. If you want a good F2P moba, go play Dota 2. If you want a moba thats easy to get into, go back to Call of Duty.","January 29, 2015","false","531.9"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","17","28","7","0"

Only normal mode can be played by queueing online\n- the playerbase isn’t very big, with around a thousand players online on average, this makes that lower skill player sometimes get matched up against more experienced players and that more experienced players get matched up with a team of a lower skill level\n- soloqueueing after the period of getting to know the game isn’t very enjoyable, so I recommend to buy a 3-pack with two other friends when this game is on sale, so you aren’t alone\n- getting friends into the game once you have a decent amount of hours (like me) might be tough, as your skill levels will be radically different (a solution to this is to make a second steam account, and use the family share option with your main account so your friends don’t end up in games where everyone outclasses them\n- the angry players, these are players who constantly rage at balance; teammates; the matchmaking system and most importantly you. These players are mostly rampant at the medium tier level of play, so don’t expect to encounter them too much when first picking up this game.\n\nAs I can’t think of any other points to discuss I will end the review here.\nI hope you, the reader, found this review helpful in your decision of whether or not to buy this game, or if you already own the game and you will now get a little less salty at people you don’t know for no real reason.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/204300/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nAwesomenauts is a 2D MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena), with a strong sense of progression, and a lot of different dynamics that can be taken into account. I don't really have anything negative to say about the game, read on if you want to know more specifics!\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Two sides are at war, choose your awesomenaut and ship out and defeat the other team! As you would expect from a game based completely on battling there isn't much to explain about the story, there is a nice opening cinematic that has a hilarious similar to a Power Rangers episode, but other than that the game is mostly an exchange of  going back and forward fighting indefinitely.\n\nGame Play: The controls are best explained while playing the game. the movement is ASDW, you can use W or space to jump, some characters have a double jump, some fly. You use both mouse buttons and the scroll lock click to use various abilities. The button configuration is very toned down, you're limited on what abilities you can use, and before you start the game you select the abilities you want to unlock as you play the game.\nOkay, now I should say something about the various characters, there are A LOT of characters which might compliment your play style. I tried them all while playing "offline practice mode", I found my favorite character and then intended to play as that character until I became very familiar with the game.\nAs you play through the game (even playing offline practice mode) you will received experience that will unlock new awesomenauts and abilities for your awesomenauts. This element in the game gives me a very strong sense of progression throughout the game. (coupled with getting a lot of easy-to-earn-achievements that I earned while playing offline! (Thank you for that Awesomenauts!)\nI keep talking about "offline practice mode", the reason I do is because I spent a lot of time playing in this mode before starting the game. When I first played this game I tried to play it with my friend, we were both equally noobish at what was going on, I didn't even know this was a MOBA! So naturally we got ourselves massacred. :( Left a bad taste in my mouth...\n...But! after I discovered offline practice mode, I learned on my own without looking up guides how I wanted to play the game. Naturally if I wanted to get better guides would help, but I like to think I'm a fairly competent gamer, playing offline let me try out various characters and strategies without dragging down my team. You can adjust the AI to make practice easier or more difficult depending on your confidence.\nA final note about playing through the game, you start the game out with "solar" or "coins", you collect more of these from killing various npc / players, as you collect more, you return to your base to purchase upgrades for your awesomenaut making him/her stronger. knowing which ones to upgrade and which ones to select take practice, guides, or strategy. Once again, if you want to actually learn the game, try out offline practice mode to see what I mean! :D\n\nAchievements: I got a bit ahead of myself earlier with a note about the achievements. They were mostly straightforward:  Win games, play games, taunt your enemy, go on a crazy killing spree, hoard up Solar (in-game currency) and then the rest are pretty much grind grind grind. Grind creep kills, grind turret kills, grind online game wins.\nMost of the simple achievements are simple, most of the grinding achievements you should just play the game to enjoy the game, let those grindy achievements happen if they happen. That is Atratzu's suggestion for this game's achievements.\n\nPrice: Awesomenauts costs $9.99, So far (08/16/14) I've played 5.7 hours. I've really enjoyed learning how the game works, but my "value system" dictates that I need to spend at least 9 hours in the game to make it worth-my-while. I definitely think this game has that type of replay-ability.\nAs always, I recommend buying games when they're on sale, or getting them in humble bundles, I was given this game as a gift from one of my friends (You know who you are).

First when I saw the upcoming xp system, I knew it was going to be bad. Most matches seemed pretty fair, sometimes when the other team got ahead of you in cash, you'd still be able to manage and even win. Now, whoever gets ahead first with exp and cash, will dominate, as if it wasn't hard enough to make a comeback before.\n\nI think the bringing of the xp system was a desperate move to get more players playing the game, to make it appeal to a wider audience. That brings me back to the begining of my review, the game's diminishing population and small community of active players. That said, personally I think the xp system is the final nail in the coffin. Probably won't ever return to this game. I think it is time for me to put this particular game to rest in my games library.","January 24","false","156.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegondorian/recommended/204300/","thegondorian","GondorianRanger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegondorian/","31 products in account","Well, I made a long, in-depth negative review for Awesomenauts a couple months ago after the horrible 2.13 patch but Ronimo fanboys kept downvoting it, so I decided to start fresh and make myself more clear and simple. Here's the bottom line: why would Ronimo spend months balancing and tweaking the xp system just to get on the balance level that 2.12 had already achieved? It doesn't make any sense, and the players never asked for some rushed, unbalanced system. If you're wondering why it's unbalanced, I guess I'll give you the example of my first match post-2.13. I was playing as my main, Gnaw, set up shop in the top lane of Aguillon, and started pushing with droids and weedlings. Along comes a Nibbs, and I chase her off easily enough. But then one of my teammates feeds them a couple times, giving them the xp they need. Suddenly the Nibbs attacks me again and I hold my ground, thinking I'm better. But with her extra level on me, she literally fire-breathed me for less than a second and I was dead. I quit the match, uninstalled, and never looked back. If you want you can look up even worse cases of the xp system, but that was my first 5 minutes. The matchmaking was also terrible, and because of 2.13 it was delayed long after it should've been released. Never mind that, they've also promised new maps which they have yet to deliver on. So while I once loved this game, it's taken a turn for the worse. Even if the devs somehow work a miracle and make the xp system playable, I still won't play it for the sole reason of the ingorant devs who don't care one bit about the players' needs. Was it worth the 99 cents I paid for it? Yes. Am I angry at the devs for ruining the game with an awful xp system nearly nobody approves of? Yes.","February 18","false","50.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/204300/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nAwesomenauts is a 2D MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena), with a strong sense of progression, and a lot of different dynamics that can be taken into account. I don't really have anything negative to say about the game, read on if you want to know more specifics!\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Two sides are at war, choose your awesomenaut and ship out and defeat the other team! As you would expect from a game based completely on battling there isn't much to explain about the story, there is a nice opening cinematic that has a hilarious similar to a Power Rangers episode, but other than that the game is mostly an exchange of  going back and forward fighting indefinitely.\n\nGame Play: The controls are best explained while playing the game. the movement is ASDW, you can use W or space to jump, some characters have a double jump, some fly. You use both mouse buttons and the scroll lock click to use various abilities. The button configuration is very toned down, you're limited on what abilities you can use, and before you start the game you select the abilities you want to unlock as you play the game.\nOkay, now I should say something about the various characters, there are A LOT of characters which might compliment your play style. I tried them all while playing "offline practice mode", I found my favorite character and then intended to play as that character until I became very familiar with the game.\nAs you play through the game (even playing offline practice mode) you will received experience that will unlock new awesomenauts and abilities for your awesomenauts. This element in the game gives me a very strong sense of progression throughout the game. (coupled with getting a lot of easy-to-earn-achievements that I earned while playing offline! (Thank you for that Awesomenauts!)\nI keep talking about "offline practice mode", the reason I do is because I spent a lot of time playing in this mode before starting the game. When I first played this game I tried to play it with my friend, we were both equally noobish at what was going on, I didn't even know this was a MOBA! So naturally we got ourselves massacred. :( Left a bad taste in my mouth...\n...But! after I discovered offline practice mode, I learned on my own without looking up guides how I wanted to play the game. Naturally if I wanted to get better guides would help, but I like to think I'm a fairly competent gamer, playing offline let me try out various characters and strategies without dragging down my team. You can adjust the AI to make practice easier or more difficult depending on your confidence.\nA final note about playing through the game, you start the game out with "solar" or "coins", you collect more of these from killing various npc / players, as you collect more, you return to your base to purchase upgrades for your awesomenaut making him/her stronger. knowing which ones to upgrade and which ones to select take practice, guides, or strategy. Once again, if you want to actually learn the game, try out offline practice mode to see what I mean! :D\n\nAchievements: I got a bit ahead of myself earlier with a note about the achievements. They were mostly straightforward:  Win games, play games, taunt your enemy, go on a crazy killing spree, hoard up Solar (in-game currency) and then the rest are pretty much grind grind grind. Grind creep kills, grind turret kills, grind online game wins.\nMost of the simple achievements are simple, most of the grinding achievements you should just play the game to enjoy the game, let those grindy achievements happen if they happen. That is Atratzu's suggestion for this game's achievements.\n\nPrice: Awesomenauts costs $9.99, So far (08/16/14) I've played 5.7 hours. I've really enjoyed learning how the game works, but my "value system" dictates that I need to spend at least 9 hours in the game to make it worth-my-while. I definitely think this game has that type of replay-ability.\nAs always, I recommend buying games when they're on sale, or getting them in humble bundles, I was given this game as a gift from one of my friends (You know who you are). And we haven't gotten around to playing together, but this game would really be fun to play with friends.\n\nConclusion: Coming into this review, I knew from the start that I didn't really have anything negative to say about the game. *IF* there was one thing I would like to have in the game that I didn't have, I would like to play offline practice with my friends over steam, but that doesn't take away from the game in any way.\nOnce again, story was "meh" but amusing, game play was "engaging different and fun", achievements were "okay", and the price was "fair".

Avoid!\n\nAs you may noticed, I spent ample of time in this game, coming back every so often to see what changed. I played until I was max level  / prestige to ensure I was certain how I felt about this game. The last few games I played cemented it. My conclusion: Nope. Not worth it.\n\nFirstly, as you may guess, it's a MOBA-type game on a 2D gaming plane. 2 bases, 2 lanes with a “jungle” somewhere. Thus it's normal there isn't a single player mode. Yes you can play vs bots and you can make them as hard as real people. But the main meat of this game is the multiplayer. You will unlock the 16 characters on 5 maps (4 of them are on a paid DLC)  Unlocking them all is just a matter of playing and acquiring solar, the in-game currency / experience. Gaining solar is easy as it's both in-match currency and experience out of it. Levels are quick and more often than not you will gain 2-4 levels per reasonably normal match. After unlocking characters and maps, you will unlock items to change how your skills are in-game. At 133 levels plus 10 prestige levels, it takes a long time to max out.\n\nThe characters themselves are cool  in and of themselves. Each has a backstory into how and why they joined the Awesomenauts and their own personality often reflected in the game. All of them spout off random memes and typical nerd references here and there. Some of the (purchasable) skins they have even refer to other games, movies and tv series. Pretty cool overall.\n\nGraphics, voice over and music are quite good. Several famous youtubers voiced some of the characters, adding a nice familiar touch for those that are fans of said youtubers. The music also does explain why I kept returning : achieving a rampage (3 kills without death) gives you a rampage background song of your character's theme. Only you hear this remixed song and it adds a nice touch of encouragement for your accomplishement. Should your team really steamroll the other, you are awarded with "You are awesome!" text and the intro music will start playing instead. Often I would find myself listening to such and such character's songs on youtube, Skolldir theme being a personal favorite of mine.\n\nNow for the bad : first the characters feel unbalanced. Some were nerfed to near uselessness and others never properly balanced and retain their unfair advantages. And don't expect patches to balance them... They come every 4-6 months. The reason why so long? MOAR SKINS DLC!  Enjoy seeing the same characters winning constantly.\n\nMatchmaking feels completely arbitrary : you often play against or with people that outclass the others (i.e. out of the "league" you play) which leads to steamrolled games. Of course one can explain this as the player base slowly moving on but still hard for new players to even start off. Quitting has no real penalty so players do it left and right. What penalties you ask? No win bonus on your next victory and a "loss of ranking". Read the first phrase of this paragraph if you don't understand how ironic it is.\n\nFor the player base, it's a mixed bag. Most of the games, the chat will be unused short of the GGs at the end. In rare occurrences, you might have a bit of a conversation and some laughs when all players chat up. In others, some "player" (I refuse to acknowledge someone that willingly abuses of a system in a game a player)  will decide that spamming all the voice commands is required to fully control the game. 3 out of 4 are team based and the last is a taunt to the opposing team. But said taunt can also be heard by the playing team thus adding more to the spam. As one person starts, others will also start and continue forth resulting into a spam-o-thon. Unfortunately, there are no squelching in this game. Hope you like hearing that audio spam! Oh wait quitting out of the match is still a viable solution. Thank goodness!\n\nAll in all,  don't. There are better games both within Steam and even out of it that can satisfy both a MOBA-type of gamers and platformer gamers without resorting to this one. This one looks nice but it's inner layers hide such frustrating flaws that ruin the overall coolness.\n\nFinal silly thoughs : I sometimes imagine this game as a Saturday morning cartoon. The settings does make it viable and will the menagerie of quirky characters...","February 24, 2015","false","363.7"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","20","34","0","0"

The new XP system has broken the game. I'm all for making moves to increase game speed, but this move makes games impossible or incredibly easy, depending on how the dice roll for you at match making. If you have a leaver and a bot fills in until another player can be found, you're out of luck. The other team will quickly overtake you in damage, even if you play flawlessly. Have a feeder? He WILL lose you the game, and there is nothing you can do.\n\nThe last game I played, I was 6-0, doing pretty well. I was completely maxed on upgrades. Unfortunately, I had a team member who fed a bit, and we started out with a bot for the first 5 minutes. Try as I might, no matter how many times I bested the other team and pushed them into a retreat, they would simply pick up a kill from one of my team mates and bide their time. Eventually, they rushed our base, and there was nothing I could do.\n\nI would have picked this game over any other MOBA before trying it with the new patch.

I love the characters, abilities, graphic style, and the flow of the fight especially in a team of friends, but some recent updates have marred the former image of Awesomenauts.\n\nFor players from the pre-XP system era, like myself, some are able to work past the changes but almost all of us dislike the system for a number of reasons. Notice though how I said "work." The shorter game span and snowballing was really not necessary since there already was a leveling system in place before (Solar currency and maxing items on a character).\n\nBut now that system is still in effect... with an additional layer of HP and damage % upgrades doled out instantly for player kills and droid/creep kills. There's no strategy involved with that; it's merely a grind to see who is a better farmer. Making this not only like "other MOBA games" but also causing players to play more selfishly, stealing health creeps for XP instead saving for a heal, or ignoring a push and focusing on kills.\n\nI still recommend this game because it's near and dear to me - but it has a steeper learning curve than it previously had without any real value added, unfortunately.","February 10","true","788.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Besides that the community that buys the game is quite toxic and there is no incentive into making it less so. The game has an interesting gameplay, even with the developers disregard and lack care  about the most important aspect of the game. Overall, a bad experience and neglected (but good) gameplay. After sinking 1000+ hours in the game and after each patch I feel less inclined to believe the promises of fixes, to believe the developers' honesty, or to even play the game.\n\nThis game is the perfect example, for me, of poor development. I'm sorry, but while I had fun in the beginning, now I just feel frustration, distrust and betrayal. This game is a sad excuse of a game, and I do not feel I'm overstating my case when I say so. I can't recover the time wasted or the money anymore, so I wrote this in hopes that other people do not fall for this trap.\n\nEDIT: After a month and a half I went back to see how the game was. In my opinion nothing significant changed. The characters continue to be unbalanced, the matchmaking got worse (!) and a lot of the needed fixes are still in need. As it has always been with this game, there are promises of fixes in the next patch (it is always the next patch). They still use the same trick: vain promises. I ask myself if they REALLY think they'll expand the player base like that... At least there is a new map. Maybe they think they can compete with DOTA... I think Ronimo needs to make another game. They are small, but they need fresh air in their minds. If they don't they won't be able to evolve; they'll be stuck with only this game forever, and I'm sure they do not want that.","March 8","false","103.0"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","2"

Why would I go through the trouble of paying for this game when I could play them?" Well if you have found yourself asking that I have plenty of reasons why Awesomenauts is far greater than any MOBA I have played before.\n\nTo begin with I find the community absolutely great. There is the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will scream "Lol you suck" in chat but apart from that I find that Awesomenauts attracts a great deal of funny and good sportsmanship players. I don't really have too many MOBA's I have played to compare communities with but I played one game of Dota and it had me being called a ♥♥♥♥ing noob and... yeah so I never played again. I'm not too sure if I just got unlucky but it didn't seem like a great community of people to be playing with. Everyone (well most) in Awesomenauts just want to have fun!\n\nThen there is the way the game looks detail wise. This may just be me but I find myself looking in wonder at all the detail the developers put into the game, no cartoon games should look this good. All the little things that I just can't help but really apreciate. How the background is animated, how in one of the maps you can see sunlight flaring through the trees. The way the water captures your characters reflection seems so awesome compared to other games I have played with water. Also something I really like about the character selection screen is how the characters animate and shine.\n\nRonimo has done an amazing job creating so many characters all with completely different attack skills and ways to help out your team. I often find that people will always complain in chat about how overpowered a character is and yet I have seen every character be played so well. It really matters on how you use a certain character however some have a huge variation to how you can use them. This gives it a ginormous strategy aspect to the game (as most MOBA's do).\n\nSo to sum it all up if you want to get that warm fuzzy feeling you get after killing someone in a video game try this game because every time I kill someone I feel like I have just gotten a cookie. And if you have given up on playing MOBA's because of how people treat you over the internet give this game a go, it will surprise you.","March 23, 2014","true","168.1"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","1"

The matchmaking has been broken since day one. Ive owned this game for roughly 3 years now. I used to play avidly now i play on and off with a good friend who plays all the time. My friend plays all the time because its become "their game" its what they do, do they enjoy it? No. Its like dropping 300 dollars in dota cosmetics. After you put all that time in why quit now?\n\nThe matchmaking in this game and the community itself is absolutely horrible. In no other game have i seen such a visible line the community. Either someone cares deeply about the game and is nice and interactive and fun to play with or chat. Or they are a toxic troll who will ruin your game. Whoever you get stuck with, totaly random.\n\nThe matchmaking itself is somthing ive seen no other game do and those games have been succesful for it. In awesomenauts its 3v3 when you start a match. Boom someone leaves your game. You have a bot now. "Oh like csgo so i can control it if i die." Well no you cant control it. I havent expereinced the bot AI recently but when i last had to play many-a matches with them they have the AI of a child from a turkey and a potato. Oh you just qued for a game? Lets put you in one thats already going on to replace a bot. This is awesomenauts. 9 times out of 10 you will be qued into a game that is already going on. "Who wants to start fresh from the beggining of a game? Not me." -Game Devs\n\nIf you own the game dont touch the dlc either. I bought the starstorm dlc in early acess for my friend and me wanting to help the game maybe get better. It didnt. The map they promise in the pack has come out A YEAR LATER. The heros also came out very slowly. You can critize me for buying in to early acess dlc but this is a game that had recieved quite the publicity and funding. Including the likes of the yogscast and totalbiscuit off the top of my head. You recieved maybe 3-4 heros and a map. I dont even know if the map is specific to dlc owners or dlc owners funded it. Theres a new dlc out with new heros. This game used to be great because you had a large hero pool to play from. Now its locking things behind a 10 dollar paywall.\n\nThe gameplay is alright down to its core. Its a 2d moba or Dota game. With different heros with differnet skill sets that are fairly customizeable, as you level up. Which is strange to lock undeniably better unlocks for different playstyles behind a leveling up system, which you then loose all these levels if you decide to prestige. Prestige is there idea of end game for people that have played it out enough. Personaly ive never enjoyed prestiging and loosing my progress. In COD you would loose your guns and gernades, etc and receive the basics agian. The same stands true for this and there truely are some undeniably better upgrades for heros later on.\n\nEdit: After reading a couple other reviews i forgot about the new system. In game team levels. A concept ripped straight from heros of the storm (a horrible game doing poorly) your team shares "xp" gotten from being around creeps that are dieing, this includes heros. Well if your team starts to fall behind, this level system gives the team more damage and health. If your behind look at you, you start loosing more and more, suddenly the levels are 5 to 9. The damage and health is minimal. Say 2% more each level. But why? What is the real purpose? If its so small why add it? And it doesnt even help the team thats behind in anyway it just makes it wose. And its already challenging enough to come back as it is.\n\nTLDR: Community bad. Matchmaking bad. Gameplay Ok/ DLC is overpriced and ruining the core game","May 4","false","203.4"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

The game used to be fantastic when it was first released to the PC, and the first few updates were great additions to the game. But the ones forever afterwards have only damaged the game further and further.\n\nMatchmaking is unfair. You will be paired with two new players against three complete veterans. The balance is unfair. There are so many characters in-game now, that the others cannot be balanced properly against each other anymore like they used to be. Comebacks are unfair. There is now an XP system, which means games are immediately decided from the very first few kills in the game.\n\nThe future doesn't look bright either. There is now pay-to-play-new-characters in the game. You won't know counters to those characters or how they work without using your money. The playerbase no longer budges on free weekends or discounts.\n\nThis game is not a casual drop-in drop-out game like it used to be advertised anymore.

Gameplay-wise it's a lot of fun. In fact, If you couldn't care less about ranked or climbing the ladder and just want to have a good time PvPing with friends in a game with all the MOBA elements then, by all means, go right ahead. But then, why not ditch the laning & jungling and grab any one of the 261 vastly superior Super Smash Bros. games. I honestly can't recommend this to anyone looking for a serious MOBA. Especially when it doesn't nail the 'massively online' bit.\n\nThe matchmaking system on ranked (the only mode that matters) is utter balls. The overall online experience is a laggy pile of feces 72% of the time due to the netcode and lack of dedicated servers, and is in desperate need of an overhaul! The TrueSkill rank system is the proverbial cherry on top of it all, ensuring that when you  do  lose because of either of the aforementioned (or both) you'll be severely punished for it. That being said, the game itself can be a ton of fun when played casually either in split-screen or privately with people in the same region.\n\nHere's an example of what a session of Awesomenauts is like at the very start of a new season: You solo queue and manage to roflstomp a few games and get placed in the Awesomantium league (league 1). A lag spike here and there, no biggie. You proceed to faceroll some more games, miraculously, without any major issues. Ranking-up a few more spots at a time. But then, inevitably, you get dropped into either:\n\nA) the end of a game that's mere seconds away from ending,\n5) one that's utterly one-sided with absolutely no chance of mounting a comeback,\n31) lagcity,\n9) a straight up instant disconnection as soon as you connect due to the host's dial-up Internet access,\nQ) All the above,\n\nresulting in your first loss and (here's the kicker) get set back anywhere from fifty to  HUNDREDS  upon  HUNDREDS  of ranks depending on how much lower the enemy team's players were rank-wise. DCing from a game with a big enough rank gap and you can even throw in a demotion to a league or two down. At this point, re-queueing and attempting to crawl your way back up is not an option. It's very likely that you'd just end up getting shafted again by any/all the above. Plus, the difference between points earned and lost is just simply impossible to offset anyway.\n\nQueueing with friends? Great! Attempting to reconnect back into your game can more often than not result in yet  another  <insert BS here>, which (you guessed it!) sets you back even further. Hours invested down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all in the span of seconds. A setback from which you have no hope of remedying for the remainder of that season (60 days).\n\nNeedless to say, this happens every.. single.. season...\n\nNow, surely you'd think the devs are aware and on top of the situation. Well, what do they have to say you ask? “Umm.. here's some more $5 skins!! :D”\n\nBeing a huge MOBA fan since the days of the original DotA and all the hero-based mods on Warcraft III (Hero Wars players where you at), I really loved Awesomenaut's unique 2D spin on the genre, along with its style and music. It's original af and a nice breath of fresh air in a stagnating genre. It really sets itself apart from the current “top” MOBAs like DotA2 and League of Legends which are just blatant knock offs and re-skins of all the mods that kicked off the genre (and that I played to death) and ultimately have nothing new to contribute. So, when I discovered Awesomenauts I overlooked the issues and really tried being patient with the devs in the hopes that they'd sort it all out and get the game out there in a big way. I supported them and even backed their Kickstarter. But, after having been on board for no less than ten seasons, and after countless posts on the forums by the community and their most dedicated players, Ronimo have, and indeed continue to, ignore these glaring issues and treat the game like a pos cash cow. They prioritize working on ♥♥♥♥ like an AI editor, a map editor, creating new skins, releasing different in-game announcers, redesigning the UI, and  talking  about the 5th map-- the fabled “Starstorm” map instead. That's when they're not busy further breaking the joke that the game's balance is. During their Kickstarter campaign, they managed to raise over $500,000 and there wasn't so much as a  single  attempt at addressing these issues.\n\nSo, unless you intend on playing this game with friends, either locally or in private matches online, spare yourself the buttdamage and skip it. Your cash is better spent elsewhere, if at all- there are much,  much  better  free  alternatives out there made by devs that actually give half a ♥♥♥♥ (*cough* Heroes of the Storm *cough*).\n\nGGs Ronimo!

DLC characters are more powerful than base characters.\nFor example, Yoolip as a mid-range stun-silence-do damage-snare skill. Clunk (a base character) has a skill that do less damage, had to buy the snare upgrade and is close-range. Yes, riskier and closer. That's so balanced.\nIt costs 8€. Yes, we are in 2016 and you have to pay a whole "expansion" that contains 3 characters... and only that. That's less content than the previous "expansion" which costs 7€ but has overpowered characters and a map (we waited 2 years for the map, 2 years). I will not list all the balance problems but when you have beta at each character release and you are not capable to see a problem like that, it is unacceptable.\n\nThe matchmaking is worse than a cigaret is for the health. It is expected that an update will change that... it is expected since the dawn of time. The league system is obsolete since it doesn't reflect the real skill of the player, it reflects his victories. Premades have a HUGE advantage even in the ranking.\n\nThey add skins each 2 weeks (exageration here) but they can't do a map in 2 years (that's not an exageration). Howerer, they did another game for the WiiU (a lost console from 2012 with only Mario games - it's a joke, there is ZombiU-) in the mean time.

This one is OK for gameplay and fun, but when it comes to the community, it is absolutely horrible. There are people who purposely de-league themselves so they can play on lower league games and pretty much guarantee themselves wins. It is nealy impossible to get anywhere unless you absolutely pour hours upon hours into this game because you want to get better. Chances are, you might not get any better because you're fighting people who are highly advanced in skill level in a low skill-level game. You will not believe how many times you will go up a league, only to immediately drop one because you fought against ex-league 2s or bottom-line 1s. I can never seem to get above rank 8. I reach rank 7, and the next match, I lose and am de-leagued again.\n\nPros? Fun gameplay, graphics are cartoony and nice, the controls are rather smooth, and it makes for a good action platform-jumping, run-n-gun MOBA.\n\nCons? You won't get anywhere with the cheap community it has.. People are not ashamed to admit that they purposely de-league themselves to play lower ranked games.

It isn’t as complex or competitive as many other MOBAs out there. This is a good thing for anyone who wants to play some PVP without having to deal with an overly complicated game and an overly angry playerbase.\n\nThe game plays out in matches on small 2D arena-like maps.  At the start of each match, the players can choose from several Awesomenauts (read: heroes) to play as, each with their own different abilities.  Each match takes about a half hour or so, as two teams push with “creeps” to destroy towers and the enemy base. Sound familiar? So it plays like a traditional MOBA, but in 2D.\n\nThe combination of the distinctiveness of 2D MOBA combat and the well-designed abilities for the different Awesomenauts creates a pretty enjoyable gameplay experience. It is fun to play around with the different character combinations to see what fun you can have with the unique gameplay. Also, there is a pretty decent playerbase and the developers have consistently been updating the game and creating new content, so it appears to have a stable heartbeat.\n\nAwesomenauts would be a good game to consider if you are someone who is interested in playing a PVP game for fun and don’t want to deal with the hostility of the community of other MOBAs. The ranking system does its best to keep everyone around where they should win 50% of the time. But that doesn’t stop some people from believing they should be winning every single match; luckily they’re the minority in this game. Due to the simplicity of the mechanics and the lighthearted nature of the game, the community tends to be a little less unnecessarily competitive than in other games.\n\nEDIT: As of the start of the year 2016, it has been a while since I have played this. The developers have continued to support the game with updates. I cannot speak about the current state of certain aspects of the game which may have changed since I have last played, but I believe what I have said here still holds true to the core game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","260.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Or welcome to commentaries with criticism. Thanks\n------------------------\nOkay, its my 4 review for this game, first 2 was positive, then ronimo broke few things and its changed to negative. So...\n\nObliviosly its sidescrolling MOBA. If you dont like dota (me too), but fan of action platformers - its may be your cup of tea. But 1st - few things you must know about it:\n\nPros:\n- Graphics. Its rlly stylish 2d game with lots of EXPLOSIONS (not like in broforce, but anyways :D). Every naut has its own design (also few different skins, you can buy (changes only visuals), if you dont like default one), two different types of each skins (for blue and red teams), other things looks cool too.\n- Sound. Every naut has its own voice, sfxes and ost. Lone will pew-pew-pew, derpl - mew-mew-mew :D\n- Action. Its actually one of mostly action games I've ever played. If you think "yay, its casual moba with only 2 skills and 2 moves! I ll beat them all easy!" - you wont be right. Its WONT works after 6 league and you needs to use your hands and brains to win. Sadly, you wont win, using these things only, cuz of...\n\nCons:\n- Lags. At 1st - its p2p game (like dota). But its netcode sux and matchmaking searching too. For example - you cant set "maximum ping to search" - only regions. Second thing is none cares about your settings - you can set "same region only", but if you will be host - latinos with 600ms will connect to you anyways.\n- Disbalance. Second thing, why lot of players left. Some nauts are easier to play, some harder... Balance, for me = simple formula "skills+build". But some nauts requires 0 skills to play and win as them. For example - Ayla. I seen lots of Aylas, who feeds until mid game, then got enough solar to buy all they need and starts to kill everyone, cuz mid-game ayla = very fast + life stealing + deals over 9k dmg/s by self-aoe skill, sized as 1/3 of screen.\n- Matchmaking. I said about lags, but its not only problem. Situations, when you have 2 league 8 guys in your team vs 3 league 4 guys in opposite arent rare. Also none cares about rating, so - you may be on 3k+ vs guy with 500 rate in other team. Also - you cant uncheck connection to started matches, so - your butt will burn 2 much, when you ll connect to matches on last seconds of them.\n- Premades. Thing, you will meet in league 4+. Guys, who plays with skype/teamspeak - there are almost no ways to ♥♥♥♥ them with randoms.\n- Splitscreens. Opposite side of teamwork - guys, who plays with splitscreen. If you have them in your team, you can insta-leave - this game is almost unplayable with controller and splitscreen players will care only about their mates irl, so - no teamwork too.\n\nI also could say about adv-like messages every 1 min on full window, if you plays multiplayer with bots, warping guys and 2.5 cheaters, but I wont. This game is fun for first 100 hours. Then you will drop it or play with pain in your butt. Sadly ronimo doesnt care about balance, servers and better matchmaking, so - I, for example, ll finish all achievements (7 left) and then drop it, like 70% of community.\n\n------------\n\nUPD 03 Dec:\nNew update is terrible. In fact - Ronimo did things, nobody asked for - broke exists system with new unbalanced XP (right now you can insta-leave, if someone in your team died at least once, cuz its almost impossible to win vs higher lvl team. Bonuses for leveling are extremely high and its very fast) and turned balance to more horrorible one (simply killed all nauts with "safe" style). Also, new UI looks like drawn by someone, who never played video games before.\n\nAfter years of trying, Ronimo did it - Im moved this game to "trash" folder into my library.\n\nRIP Awesomenauts","November 16, 2015","false","471.4"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","23","41","2","13"

Each character has their own unique set of skills and abilities. Each character excells in one way or another. For example, Ayla (the psychotic little alien girl) can create a rage bubble around her which damages enemies nearby while healing her. On the other hand, Derpl Zork (the dumber-than-plankton heir to one of the biggest fortunes in the galexy) can transform his walking desk/secretary/death machine into a turret which can lay down a lot of firepower, including nukes.\n\n\nThe games themselves are quick and fun, although the ranking system is imperfect due to a playerbase not large enough to support the higher rank players.","January 6, 2014","true","97.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

There has never been a game similar to this one.\n\n\n\nYes, it follows the basic MOBA formula of creeps/towers/"heroes"/loadout builds/base, but past that everything changes.\nMechanically speaking, the game uses a 2D platforming free-side-scrolling approach. You move using the keyboard, and aim/attack using your mouse. Controllers can be used as well, if that's more your style.\n\nThere are 4 main maps, each with an entirely different layout. Generally, 2 lanes exist, though most maps have open areas and choke-points.\n\nThe "heroes" (nauts) are incredibly different from each other, in terms of abilities and playstyle. There's a chameleon assassin that goes invisible, a russian monkey that flies using a jetpack, a squid that anchors you in place, an overweight viking that hurls you into the air, an all-eating creature that spawns stationary minions, a floating brain that controls a swarm of drones, etc. for a total of 16 nauts, plus an additional 5 in the still growing expansion (the expansion marked a first step towards a continuous development effort, which I mention further ahead, and is not in any way pay-to-win). Each naut has its own learning curve. This makes the game spectacularly varied, as not only are the nauts unique from each other, the 3 naut teams mean there are a huge number of possible combinations, which in turn mean a huge number of approaches to a single match. Not to mention that many nauts can steer their own style in very diverse directions depending on which items they go for in their build.\n\nLast, but not least, the game is fun. As the intro makes quite clear, the underlying design theme surrounding the game is not fantasy or sci-fi, but instead a sort of nostalgic-childhood-saturday-morning-cartoon-fun.\nCompetitive? Yes. But also a game in which you can kill a flying monkey by having a fat viking throw an exploding gnome at its face.\n\nIt is also essential to point out that the developers are still very much working on the game. Yes, it was released back in 2012, but it has evolved immensely throughout the past three years. As you will find if you snoop around the game's website, the developers, who frequently post in the forums, intend to keep working and adding features to the game, while polishing and improving the ones already present. This is a project with long-term goals, and the players are having a blast watching the game grow and having their feedback taken seriously. (this is not early access in any way)\n\nAll in all, a very fun game, with a great community, a unique design, and surprising strategic and tactical complexity.\n\n\nGrab it. Play it. Love it.\n\n\ntl;dr: fun, unique, surprisingly complex","June 23, 2015","true","166.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

Just a few issues here and there, and one gamebreaker.\nPROS:\n- Large character selection (especially if you own all of the DLCs)\n- Matches can last fairly long\nCONS:\n- Matchmaking. Nobody plays the game anymore (not since a few months after Yogscast reviewed it), so you get matched with gold ranked players when you just play the game casually.\n- Hosting. Not sure why they don't have dedicated servers for this, but it causes real issues with lag, disconnects, etc.\n- Along the same lines, DISCONNECTS. No matter what I do, more than 50% of the time I spend in a game is spent in the "Reconnecting" state. This is a large issue on its own, but it gets worse. When in the "Reconnecting" state, YOU CAN STILL TAKE DAMAGE. This has caused my ranking to drop tens of thousands (used to be ranked in the 30,000s, now im in the 50,000s after 3 games.)\n- RONIMO. No matter what you do, what the issue is, anything, Ronimo doesn't care. There have been many complaints about many things, and none of them have been acknowledged by Ronimo, meaning they haven't been fixed.\n\nIf you can get past these issues, its truly a fun game (I know from experience, before my disconnecting issue as well as before the matchmaking unbalanced issue). If you never had these issues, you're one of the lucky ones. Hope you get lucky, cause otherwise, this game ain't worth $0.01, let alone $10. Any review from someone who has more than 100 hours in this game, because those are the kinds of people who no life this game and play "competetive," which shouldn't even be an aspect of this game, as it's not so much competetive as it is raging all the time.","January 19, 2015","false","25.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

But I will also admit I was bad at it. Really bad. The game has a bit of a learning curve. But now, I like it. I wouldn't quite say I love it, but I'd say it's worth the $10.. even though I got it for 99 cents. :D\n\nIt's basically a base/tower defense game with 2D cartoon aliens.\nI think there's like 20 different characters now, and that's exactly what they all are, different. Each and every character is unique. There are no 2 characters where you think "Hmm, this one is kinda like that one" They all look different, and they all have their own special abilities. Pick up solar(games currency) or gain it by killing, and you get to upgrade those abilities.\nIt definately helps to either read up on all the characters abilities, or have an experienced friend to play with you. What you don't know, kills you... Over and over and over.\nOverall, it's really a good game. I only have one problem with it. Leon. Leon makes me sad. No matter what character I am, no matter how upgraded I am, he finds me, pops out of nowhere, and out-DPMs me no matter what I do. Of all the deaths I have in the game, I'd say 90% are Leon related.\n\nGet the game, it's worth it. Not sure? Wait until it goes on sale. But before you make your judgement on whether or not you like it, play every character. That's the secret, you have to find the character that you like and do okay with, then continue to learn and progress from there. Don't just try 1 character and say you hate it, because that's what I did. Learn from my mistakes.\n\nP.S.

I recently started playing League of Legends and am enjoying it. But Awesomenauts is something else. It's a MOBA, yes. There are turrets, and minions and you level up over the course of a game. But the way it blends side-scrolling action shooting into the mix really makes it something more.\n\nIf you've been turned off by LoL or DOTA by the large number of items, jargon and steep learning curve, this game sucessfully removes all of that while still retaining a nice level of depth. The lower number of playable characters makes it so that it's easier to learn them all, though they really play very differently from one another. There is a level of strategy that starts as soon as character selection and building your team.\n\nBattles are a lot of fun, and end up being decided more on your skill than your knowledge of the mechanics. While there are interesting combos to perform, and mechanics to master, skill remains the determining factor. There is a leveling system, but you seldom feel at a disadvantage for being a lower level.\n\nThat being said, the transition from the traditional MOBA stage to a 2D environment is not perfect. The skirmishes often get chaotic quickly, and it can become difficult to see and understand what's going on. Having your character always remain in the center of the screen is helpful, but the visual style can still remain very busy.\n\nThere has been some critisism that some characters are only available through paid DLC. These cahracters are not too powerful to ruin the game in the slightest. It is a decent way to get funding to expand the game. It in no way ruins the experience if you don't decide to pay.\n\nThe player base is a lot friendlier than most MOBAs, though there are still some guys who sour the experience.\n\nThe best way to play the game (like any game, in my opinion) is with friends, preferably with voice chat. Then it becomes a truly fun game to play with people of all skill levels. In playing with a friend for their first time ever, we were sitll able to have a fun time and play competitively against other teams. Plus being well-coordinated as a team really gives an advantage.\n\nIt's a good enough game that I possibly will gift copies to friends next time it goes on a big sale just so they can enjoy it as well.

Along with quite a bit of humour thrown in there.  This would seem like a quite ideal time sink if you want to play between 15+ minutes to whenever really.\n\nIt is however dragged down quite a lot with it's peer to peer and ranking system... as some games are literally unplayable due to the lag. For example: One character has the ability to make a forward dash, and become immune to damage for a split second. This can be used to counter other characters abilites, such as nukes, mines or even direct hits if you trigger it right. So in other terms: Something that required timing and skill. With the latency, skill doesn't matter. As you can stand next to a mine, just out of reach. Dash clean through it, end up out of reach, then 1-2 seconds later die, because "you touche a mine, we totes swear.". This lag also can cause no-clips, teleportation or a very common thing: making a blatant miss to hit, whether you dodged it, or are way out of reach. Because you either were in range according to the other player, or you were stuck outside for the others in a "loading" state. I don't know much about programming, but it feels like... having a system that checked "where is character x at 15:42:6 in the game? Back in their base healing? Where did character y's nuke hit at 15:42:6? at the other side of the map? When then it missed." instead of  the current "Hey y, did you hit on your screen? Well then, you died x. Kktnxbye!" So yeah, could definately see some improvements in that sytstem.\n\nOtherwise, it is somewhat balanced game. Mechanic wise, they really ought to fix the recovery issues though. The currency loss on death is just pointless, and only is a punishment on a penalty. Only really promoting hostility towards teammates, and making it literally impossible for certain players to catch up, or get a fair chance. As their enemies will have x2-x4 their health, deal about tripple damage, and have plenty more sustain and support. Sorta encouraging "bullying", as a team can get a huge advantage by picking out a player in the opposite team, and solely focusing all effort on killing them. As then it's basically a 3v2 game, with one team just being way better than the other. Because they have all the currency. It's not helped that "try-hards" or the professional players are in the same bracket. I know this is due to limited amount of players. Especially at certain times. But it utterly ruins the game if you have a casual intent, and run into a maximum cheese, on teamspeak cordinated game, where their team is soelly build to win within 5 mintues, along with making it literally impossible to for your team to do anything about it, as if you even get close to your turret, you die. It doesn't help that cheap, "I win" button tactics exist with certain characer combinations.\n\nThat said, the game is only somewhat balanced as said. As you really have a "rock, papper, scissor" system for their characters at times. As some games you can just start, and tell from just looking at what characters both teams have, and conclude that "yeah, we lost/won". As regardless of skill, (unless it's waaay much difference, or unless lag is in your favour) those matches will play out like expected. As there's nothing you can do.\n\nI know most games got imbalance or issues in one way or another. But Awesomenauts could really do with some sort of handicap, or balancing thing. Along with some better way of dealing with the hosting and PtP. As of now, it's really annoying to see a character use an ability towards you, you clearly dodge it, and then you die, becuse it hit you where you were 1-2 seconds ago. Or when you pick up healing, get the +hp, then die, because according to the other person, you haden't healed for them yet, so their damage was fatal on their side, so the game orders your character to die anyway. This is especially not helped by that many people are either gloating, or rude about this. Always claiming it's "skill" when it's positive to them, but suddenly when it's negative for them, it's hax, luck or lag. Becase you know, what's hypocrisy?\n\nKnow it's mayhaps been a bit seemingly negative view. But I do really like the game. It just has some glaring issues that could do with being addressed. Also wouldn't hurt to impliment the "Official, unofficial, gg qualifications" as an actual thing. I know some are against it, but overall, it promotes a fun/good game, and demotes cheap tactics. For those that don't know of it: It's basically that everyone gets at least one kill, one death, and one turret down for both sides. While it can be a bit tricky to pull of "authentically". I'd want to suggest making it an archivement to have like, 50-100 games like that, that might could have negative effects... so I can't suggest a good fix to encourage it. But so far, the only good, and really great matches have had these statistics. That, and no gloaters xD Those that had lag in them, at least had the people acknowledge it.\n\nBut yeah, overall, good game. But comes with a lot of issues.","September 24, 2014","true","149.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Along with quite a bit of humour thrown in there.  This would seem like a quite ideal time sink if you want to play between 15+ minutes to whenever really.\n\nIt is however dragged down quite a lot with it's peer to peer and ranking system... as some games are literally unplayable due to the lag. For example: One character has the ability to make a forward dash, and become immune to damage for a split second. This can be used to counter other characters abilites, such as nukes, mines or even direct hits if you trigger it right. So in other terms: Something that required timing and skill. With the latency, skill doesn't matter. As you can stand next to a mine, just out of reach. Dash clean through it, end up out of reach, then 1-2 seconds later die, because "you touche a mine, we totes swear.". This lag also can cause no-clips, teleportation or a very common thing: making a blatant miss to hit, whether you dodged it, or are way out of reach. Because you either were in range according to the other player, or you were stuck outside for the others in a "loading" state. I don't know much about programming, but it feels like... having a system that checked "where is character x at 15:42:6 in the game? Back in their base healing? Where did character y's nuke hit at 15:42:6? at the other side of the map? When then it missed." instead of  the current "Hey y, did you hit on your screen? Well then, you died x. Kktnxbye!" So yeah, could definately see some improvements in that sytstem.\n\nOtherwise, it is somewhat balanced game. Mechanic wise, they really ought to fix the recovery issues though. The currency loss on death is just pointless, and only is a punishment on a penalty. Only really promoting hostility towards teammates, and making it literally impossible for certain players to catch up, or get a fair chance. As their enemies will have x2-x4 their health, deal about tripple damage, and have plenty more sustain and support. Sorta encouraging "bullying", as a team can get a huge advantage by picking out a player in the opposite team, and solely focusing all effort on killing them. As then it's basically a 3v2 game, with one team just being way better than the other. Because they have all the currency. It's not helped that "try-hards" or the professional players are in the same bracket. I know this is due to limited amount of players. Especially at certain times. But it utterly ruins the game if you have a casual intent, and run into a maximum cheese, on teamspeak cordinated game, where their team is soelly build to win within 5 mintues, along with making it literally impossible to for your team to do anything about it, as if you even get close to your turret, you die. It doesn't help that cheap, "I win" button tactics exist with certain characer combinations.\n\nThat said, the game is only somewhat balanced as said. As you really have a "rock, papper, scissor" system for their characters at times. As some games you can just start, and tell from just looking at what characters both teams have, and conclude that "yeah, we lost/won". As regardless of skill, (unless it's waaay much difference, or unless lag is in your favour) those matches will play out like expected. As there's nothing you can do.\n\nI know most games got imbalance or issues in one way or another. But Awesomenauts could really do with some sort of handicap, or balancing thing. Along with some better way of dealing with the hosting and PtP. As of now, it's really annoying to see a character use an ability towards you, you clearly dodge it, and then you die, becuse it hit you where you were 1-2 seconds ago. Or when you pick up healing, get the +hp, then die, because according to the other person, you haden't healed for them yet, so their damage was fatal on their side, so the game orders your character to die anyway. This is especially not helped by that many people are either gloating, or rude about this. Always claiming it's "skill" when it's positive to them, but suddenly when it's negative for them, it's hax, luck or lag. Becase you know, what's hypocrisy?\n\nKnow it's mayhaps been a bit seemingly negative view. But I do really like the game. It just has some glaring issues that could do with being addressed. Also wouldn't hurt to impliment the "Official, unofficial, gg qualifications" as an actual thing. I know some are against it, but overall, it promotes a fun/good game, and demotes cheap tactics. For those that don't know of it: It's basically that everyone gets at least one kill, one death, and one turret down for both sides. While it can be a bit tricky to pull of "authentically". I'd want to suggest making it an archivement to have like, 50-100 games like that, that might could have negative effects... so I can't suggest a good fix to encourage it. But so far, the only good, and really great matches have had these statistics. That, and no gloaters xD Those that had lag in them, at least had the people acknowledge it.\n\nBut yeah, overall, good game. But comes with a lot of issues.","September 24, 2014","true","149.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Play against bots by yourself, go online against other people or even call in your friends to take on bots, strangers or other friends.  It gets better though!  You can splitscreen the game between yourself and two friends locally.  Twelve different characters (more if you get the Starstorm) and counting, lots of fun maps to play and different ways to build your character.\n\nNow you probably ask, what's different about this than LoL?  For starters, this game is entirely in 2D.  Second off, it's a platformer.  Your ability to run around, jump and navigate plays a lot in this game.  Third, I have played LoL and there's something that Awesomenauts does that LoL hasn't to my knowledge.  Each character has their own theme song and if you can get on a killing spree (3 kills) the character theme song starts playing for you immediately during the game.  What's that?  Didn't know the game had actual music?  Well it does, and guess what?  If you have the know how, you can change the music to whatever you want if you don't like the default tracks.\n\nShopping in this game is much easier as well.  No need to buy fifty varieties of an item as the game progresses, you can choose your characters loadout before you enter the match and buy whatever upgrade you want when you get the money.  One other thing about this game is the fact you don't need to enter a match from the very start, if there is a spot open, you can join a game already in progress.  So what are you waiting for?

Being a pretty enthusiastic videogame consumer, this title seemed to sink into the background for me even when it appeared on the front page after an update. The thing that tripped me up was my conception of what actually constitutes a a "MOBA" game.\n\nLateley people seem to think of MOBA games as stemming from some starcraft or warcraft mod with a tedious learning curve, an awful playerbase, and very slow-paced strategic combat.\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE.\n\nAwesomenauts is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena which pits two teams of three agains one another. Each player may choose a character from an evolving list of "Nauts" catering to their own unique playstyle. Throughout the match, players are able to purchase upgrades for their characters moveset. Upgrade by killing enemy "creeps" (enemy AI units which give gold, aka 'Solar') and kill the ever-loving crap out of the enemy team.\n\nAs opposed to a conventional MOBA like DoTa 2, there is no long farming phases, the shop system is easily understood, the mechanics are fast and tight direct controls, as opposed to clicking for movement, and the upgrade combinations provide the reletively easy-to-learn movesets with a huge bag of varied playstyles for each character.\n\nThe action in any given match is literally nonstop from the moment you rocket down in your jetpod. Immediately the teams rush at one another trying to get an early kill for a leg up early on, and everyone brawls making risky chase attempts and desparate retaliations. With every trip to the shop the scales get tipped, and it becomes very easy for a team to go from underdog to victor if teamwork is utilized.\n\nAs for the features of the game, there are several that set this game apart from an others I've played\n\nLocal Co-op is always a big thing for me. In my opinion, gaming is about  experiencing cool events and challenges as a social event involving more than one person. The fact that I can play this game on the couch -conveniently, even- with my roommate who has never even touched the typical MOBA game is really cool!\n\nThe Art Style and character concepts are so totally unique, I can't say I've come across anything quite like it. This makes for a fresh new continuity with lots to discover and master!\n\nAll I can advise for those on the edge about purchasing Awesomenauts is to throw out your conception of an Isometric, slow, boring, grind-fest MOBA and imagine a gale-speed battle of force, reflexes and wits. Awesomenauts is truly the ultimate test of platforming, fighting, and skill.","June 26, 2014","true","339.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A anemy has been killed. A anemy has been killed." If you are too noob to play real MOBAs, then this game is for you. 11/10 great gameplay.\n\nI had been eyeing this game for a long while, and finally decided to get it during the Winter 2014 sale for myself and a couple of friends. I have been thoroughly impressed and satisfied by Awesomenauts.\n\nIf you like 2D, platformer-style combat, multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, 3-versus-3 combat, and a great character selection, then you will really enjoy this game. I STRONGLY recommend this game for anyone interested in diving into the MOBA genre, as it a great starter to begin your education. The game supports local multiplayer, and I plan to play this with my gf to give her a lighter introduction.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in the different character models, levels, and skill animations is very well-done. I was very impressed with the music - each character has their own unique theme song that plays during the loading screen and for a short time if you manage to get a decent killing spree going (I am pretty sure it plays for everyone in the game, but I am not 100% certain). The character taunts, sound assets, and announcer dialogue is good, however, whenever an enemy dies it really sounds like the announcer is saying: "A anemy has been killed," and I find this very annoying - especially when he clearly says "An ally has been killed." This is most likely a personal experience though, and not a big deal. Each different level offers a different enough layout that your play strategy can change significantly, and this is a huge plus for the game.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with, however, understanding how each character works may take a bit of practice and time. I strongly suggest you use a controller to play, but the keyboard+mouse combo is sufficient as well. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with MOBA games. Although the tutorial is fairly lengthy - you must do a tutorial, play a bot match, and kill an opponent (bot or real player) in order to unlock your full account (ranks, leaderboards, etc). I approve of this design because it will get new players to the genre better oriented to the unique playstyle, however, it can be very annoying for MOBA veterans (honestly, a single bot match would have sufficed).\n\nDuring gameplay, the goal is to destroy the opponent's drill core, which is located near the opposite end of the map. To reach the core, you must destroy gun towers that block your path. These towers, however, are very powerful against Awesomenauts, so you must wait for your periodically-spawning minions to soak up the damage while you attack. The maps have 2 "lanes," or routes that minions travel through (compared to the typical 3-lane design in most 3D MOBAs). This fits with MOBAS that have a 2v2 or 3v3 match variant, which usually compensate by having only 2 lanes to defend/attack. When you destroy a gun tower, a special, stronger minion will spawn for you and follow the lane where the destroyed tower used to be, allowing you to push (attack) more aggressively.\n\nWhen you spawn, you will take a drop pod from your ship down toward the battlefield. During this interesting segment, you can collect "solar" (Awesomenaut currency) along the way. The pattern of solar placement differs by map, but seems to be consistent, so you can memorize the patterns per map. Solar is dropped when enemies are killed, and "last hitting" (delivering the death blow) will cause you to automatically pick up any dropped solar. When an Awesomenaut is killed, the killer gets a large amount of solar (70 if memory servers correctly), while all allies get 30 solar. Dying will cause you to lose a small amount of solar.\n\nThere is no real "jungling" option, which is nice because it does not add that complication to this mostly introductory title to the MOBA genre. There is usually a separate portion on each map where neutral minions walk around, and killing them will grant you a quick, small health restoration and a bit of solar. Visiting this area regularly to keep your health up will ensure that you can sustain your lane, allowing you to stay there to continue farming solar. In Awesomenauts, you will not want to return to base to heal unless you have enough solar to buy a new upgrade.\n\nThe different characters have unique movement - specifically, jump - styles. For example, one character can hover, another can triple jump, and another can fly/hover. You start off with your basic attack, which will be either ranged or melee-based. At the store, you can upgrade your basic attack, as well as skills relevant to your character - like increased health, movement speed, health regeneration, etc. You can also unlock 2 more usable abilities (on the controller, unlocking all abilities will give you an X, Y, and B attack {or square, triangle, circle for you non-microsoft users - like me}). You can only select 3 upgrades per skill, and you initially have 4 upgrades to select from per skill.\n\nAs you gain account experience (given post-match; more xp is given if you win, naturally), you will unlock more characters to use, as well as more possible upgrades to use. I especially like this design-choice, because it allows people to familiarize themselves with a smaller pool of upgrades before providing them with too many - it also helps people get used to how each character is supposed to be played. The lack of items in this game is good because it allows new players to only have to worry about skills and upgrades. Again, Awesomenauts is a great introductory game to the MOBA genre.\n\nOverall, the game plays very, very well and should be played by anyone interested in the MOBA genre. You will not be disappointed.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 13, 2015","true","24.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cilliswillis/recommended/204300/","cilliswillis","de_fault","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cilliswillis/","227 products in account","My opinionated breakdown review of: Awesomenauts\nGameplay: Awesomenauts is a MOBA set in the future where there is an ongoing war between the Ones and the Zeroes. In order to bring the war to a conclusion, mercenaries called "Awesomenauts" have been hired to help aid the two factions. The main objective is to destroy the other team's solar drill. (solar being a precious liquid metal) You will have to go through turrents  and droids blocking your path, as with typical MOBA fashion, but this game does something different. It is set on a 2D plane. This adds another dimension to skill shots and abilities. I would describe it as a run and gun MOBA, and combat plays like so. As you complete objectives, you will gain solar, which you will ironically spend on upgrades to get an edge over the other team. Your base will constantly spew droids to help you push and destroy the turrents so you can eventually make it to the base and destoroy the drill. There are a wide range of characters to choose from, even without its paid expansion.\nThey all add a nice variety of dual abilities and keep combat fresh. Besides some balancing issues with characters, the most strategic will always prevail. If you happen to die, you get to enjoy the very fun respawn system. You will blast from some sort of ship and fly through a field of solar, and crash land onto the planet where you will resume play. I have noticed this game tends to get more chaotic than most MOBAs, especially with all six players in one spot, it gets difficult to see what you are doing. Besides many minor gripes, the game works well and is one of the most enjoyable and frustrating games I have ever played.\n\nArt: The game is in 2D and the characters and enviroments are animated nicely.Teams are easy to recognize with their simple blue and red color scheme. Each animation is easy to recognize and it helps you determine what you should do to defend against a certain attack, besides characters being unique in looks, you can also buy skin packs which will give your "Awesomenauts" a newly themed costume. The effects of characters are nicely done as well, it is hard to look at an effect and not know what it does. Other than characters having exclusive animations (looking up and down) any gripes with the art would be purely subjective.\n\nMusic/Sound: As soon as you start the game, it has a very enjoyable Saturday morning cartoon intro with a catchy theme song, after that the main menu music is very outerspace and fits the game perfectly. Music in game starts after you land your rocket which adds a special kick that helps get you back in game. Gameplay has a playlist of great tunes that add to the comedic battle them. Speaking of comedy, this game is full of one liners, it is not unusual to get taunted about how smelly you are or how fat your mother is. Each character has a voice that fits them well, and helps add to their profile. The game's soundtrack is also availiable for purchase.\n\nEntertainment: If you enjoy a simple, but competitive multiplayer game, you will have many hours of fun. Me and my friend constantly play this game together and have good and bad times. I cannot come up with a situation where you will get tired of this game. The updates are frequent and exciting enough and the community is a small, but very loyal and active playerbase. This game runs on the community, as they help fund updates and expansions.\n\nScore: Besides network and balancing issues (which will probably be fixed) the game is enjoyable on all fronts. Simple but complex gameplay, simple but fluent art style, and simple but groovy music, it doesn't do too much wrong, but almost does everything right.\n\n4/5\nThank you for reading.","September 18, 2014","true","86.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You start out with a limited selection of ‘Nauts, but unlocking the other ones is done rather quickly.\nEventually, you’ll have a selection of 15 heroes to choose from (19 if you also purchased “Starstorm”) each with 2 special skills and a regular attack. Further levelling up of your profile will unlock special features for your skills, like lower cooldowns or larger range. So people who have played longer will have a wider variety of features in their skills.\nAwesomenauts also doesn’t have a steep learning curve like other MOBA games, so it’s fairly easy to jump into the game and get playing. However, it’s still varied enough to not grow stale quickly and the skill ceiling is high enough to keep you playing and trying to improve.","September 26, 2014","true","50.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Then 'nauts is the charming MOBA for you. Don't get me wrong, it has a LOT of depth and teamwork plays a huge part, but unlike in other MOBAs it's possible to play this game in a more casual manner, it's much more pick-up-and-play and has a more reasonable learning curve than other MOBAs on the market.\n\nThis charming 2D 80's-cartoon style MOBA has the approchability to make it your first MOBA, and the complexity to keep you coming back.\n\nPositives:\n- Fairly freuent updates which introduce new characters and many other cool things\n- Good selection of mostly balanced varied characters\n- Good build variety, no two players will play a character absolutely identically\n- Charming visuals and interesting map design and hazards\n- Catchy soundtrack\n- Simply fun with friends\n- Prestige system and achievement gives you more reasons to keep playing\n\nNegatives:\n- Developers often ignore what the players want in terms of character changes\n- No dedicated servers, pier-to-pier means some people with not so good internet connection may experience lag\n- Lack of maps. Not a huge problem, 4 maps is fine but having a couple more thrown into the mix would be fun. I know they're working on a big one now, but still more would be nice\n- Clunk","February 16, 2015","true","052.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","0"

Its 3 v 3 so that makes it alot of harder to control the map. Of course are there Minions, towers and a shop :). Just like LoL DotA 2. But its not easy to get in the game, it takes alot of skills to master, since this is a 2D moba. You'll need a different play style cause the maps are not big. No jungles. So this is big change.\nThe multiplayer is decent, cause there is Lag and someone can leave the server and join again and pick another character (no punish. And there's one thing that annoys me alot is the DLC. You have to pay REAL money for 'Nauts', skins. Like if i play online i see no one with a skin. And Yes i bought the Starstorm dlc, i think thats the best DLC they made. Cause there are new characters AI options and more! And yes the controller works really good on this game actually had no problems with the controller. Splitscreens is actually well done :).\nThe game is really fun!\nIf you are going to buy this game i recommend you to buy the Starstorm DLC for the extra 'nauts' and Options.\nAnd yes there are AI options if you buy Starstorm. Cause the AI is not the best in this game without it. Not alot of maps.\nRating: 8,5/10 donuts.\nNice price, nice game","September 7, 2014","true","23.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I wasn't interested in playing this game whatsoever after trying it on release, as everything seemed extremely unbalanced.  Although the mechanics and ideas behind most of the characters were interesting, there were only a few characters.  This caused the OP characters to be really, really OP.  There wasn't a ranking system yet, so very skilled players would be mixed in with brand new players, making gameplay frustrating for those just entering into Awesomenauts PvP.\n\nThey have refined this game into a jewel.  As a long time MOBA player (I have played Smite and LoL extensively, and sampled DOTA, Newearth, and a few others), this MOBA holds a special place in my heart.  The fact that you can modify the base skills to do different things is really a joy - it makes it so that you can tailor your favorite character to counter whatever team you are playing against.  Although the same can be accomplished with items in other MOBAs, the way they approach items in Awesomenauts makes the choices easy and good for a casual, enjoyable experience.  The community seems very welcoming, and the UI is clean and modern.  I love the way the profiles are set up, and am always interested in checking up on my own stats.  The side scrolling aspect will at first pose a challenge for other long time MOBA players, but the new perspective is easily mastered and adds another dimension to gameplay.\n\nThe variety of maps and the different "traps" and features of each is really awesome.  The fact that your spawn timer mostly consists of flying to earth in a rocket ship while picking up solar is badass, and makes staying engaged in the game easy and fun.  I'd definitely suggest this game to anyone looking to pick up a simple, fun MOBA - there's something for both new players looking to learn the ropes of MOBAS, and experienced players looking to just have a bit of relaxing fun.\n\nI look forward to playing this game for a long time to come, and purchasing the expansions when I get the chance.\n","January 16","true","35.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It is somehow casual while being competitive, using it's bright and silly graphics to keep a light tone to it. It is incredibly fun, and the most replayable game I have ever played. Each team having 3 players makes for a great time with 2 of your friends. However, this can also be a source of irritation for solo players, as teams with communication have a giant advantage. This can turn into a bigger problem as the Awesomenauts community is very small, making it impossible to match pre-made teams with solely other pre-mades. As a result of this, many players are turned away from the game early on, especially due to poor matchmaking at some less busy times of day. Through all of this, I urge everyone to try this game and to not give up during the first few matches. The fun only increases with your experience.\n\n9/10","July 19, 2014","true","786.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There is a lot of fun in this game due to the 2D side-scrolling gameplay, which I find very interesting for a MOBA game back in 2012, and the fun characters including new ones (most of which is free) that roll out overtime. The maps can be challenging as cetain characters can take advantage of it. For example, when Ayla's Rage can damage driods under the area of top turrents (which I find BS sometimes) at Ribbit IV. Sentry's Black Hole Sun applies too as this ability can drag and hold players when placed under them despite some form of ground inbetween the players and the hole. Another thing I like is that matches are pretty fast compared to popular MOBAs like League of Legends, DOTA 2, etc. You don't have to spend almost an hour on ONE match. In Awesomenauts, the average match is about 15-20 minutes with the longest I've experienced is about 40 minutes (this is before the XP system).\n\nBut as I outweigh the pros and cons of this game, I find that the cons are slightly higher than the pros, especially with the new XP system. As some people mention it before, the purpose of the XP is to make matches go faster by creating a snowball effect. Any kills, whether it is creeps, driods, or other players, will raise their team level. On paper, the idea is great since in the past, there were some matches that drag out too long. As for execution, this is debatable. People who win a lot with this system will likely say there's little to no problems with it. People who lose a lot with this system will likely say the XP system is broken and unplayable. Personably, as someone who used to win a lot of games before, I can agree to the fact that this can be a problem. The XP system requires to have little to no mistakes when playing because every kill is exp points for the other team. Pair this up with the WONDERFUL matchmaking, those claims that this is unplayable may have some truth in it. The old system makes you work hard to gain a victory. The new system is on drugs as anybody, no matter what rank/league you are in, can simply win if one team is screwing up. It's subjective to how everyone feels about the XP system, but everyone can agree that this can be frustrating when you are paired up with team members who are either new to the game, new to the character they are playing as, or has no sense of teamwork or coordination. And honestly, I suffered way too much with that.\n\nOther things to note is that there are no ranked matches, there is no surrender option, and there are matchmaking issues. For ranked matches, I don't understand why this does not exist since we have leagues/tiers, ranked points, and such. I want to play with experienced people without the need to go over to community and organize games. Not all of us has the time to go over to the fourms and ask if people wany to play. For me, I play it like a lot of multiplayer games: hit the matchmaking button and hope the team you are in is actually good. For surrenders, why isn't this a thing? If a game is going very bad to the point where you and your teammates cannot do anything but feed the enemy team, why can't we be given the option to surrender instead waiting for the enemy team to destroy almost every turrent and finally destroy the base. This happens way too often even though I tried to carry my team. I think we can prevent a good amount of people ragequiting and going AFK instead of waiting for the match to be over. If time is the issue (like people wanting to surrender less than five minutes in the game), then set the limit to activate surrunder at the 8-10 minute mark. For these two issues, it has been almost four years and Ronimo still haven't resolved this, or rather walked around it. Lastly on the AMAZING matchmaking, we can all agree that we had experienced being with bad teammates against very good players or being placed into a match where the team you are in has only one turrent left a handful of times. I understand that Ronimo is trying their best, especially since they are just indie developers, but why not just give us the option to choose a game instead of the matchmaking be random. Why not give us the option to prevent us from joining mid to late games randomly? This is infuriating because I have experienced this crap for so long.\n\nIt is also note that you lose more rank points if you leave a game versus losing a game (for those of you who care about your rank). While this encourages people to stay in their match and finish it (or wait till you lose), any disconnect is considered a leave. To be clear, leaving a game means losing half the experience points towards your league and unlockable skills (especially if you prestige) when you win a match. It may seem like an annoyance, but this is a warning for people who is tempted to leave a match just to find a game you can win in.\n\nI know this is a very long review, but this is a game I have put so much time in since its original release, and only to feel like being stepped on due to these problems. And the thing is, I want this game to succeed. This game has a lot of potential to be a unique MOBA game that is diferent than the typical and popular MOBA games out there. If anything, I want to say that Awesomenauts is my favorite MOBA, but I can't. The game had undergone a lot of changes, for better or worse, over the years, and while it is not as bad as most people who didn't recommend this game says it is, this game still need a lot of tuning, epecially ever since the new XP system. I know the Overdrive expansion is coming soon with it promising better matchmaking. But as it stands right now, be very, very wary when considering to buy this game along with the Starstorm expansion. Wait for a sale if anything.\n\nTL;DR: The game is mixed IMO due to frustrating issues, both common and personal, that has not been resolved or has been walked around. Wait for a sale.","January 19","false","408.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Firstly, I'm quite excited about the new Starstorm Map. Let's see what the Devs cooked up for us. Secondly, I have the impression that the almighty Matchmaking got both, better and worse. Why both you might ask?\n\nWell, 'better' because I have the impression skill levels among teams are not so damn skewed anymore. Seems more even. I have to admit I am enjoying a lot more matches recently. Also, I noticed an increase in crazy comebacks. Boy, did we wreck that one team last night after our base got down to one bar of HP :)\nActually, I am close to changing this review into "Thumbs up".\n\nBUT (Don't be discouraged by the long text below, stay with me here):\n\n'Worse' has gotten the amount of RQs (Rage Quitters). Understandably so. You (not me of course ^^) join a match, 15 minutes in against a "premade team", 3 turrets down. Why waste time on that, right? Just leave, or go afk or feed, it usually won't matter. You'll lose anyway, get your ranking decreased etc. This is the stuff Rage is made of. Don't get me wrong, I've been there, done that. But that just seems weird. Somebody RQs, he gets punished. Then you take his place. Whether you RQ or stay, it is very likely that you also get punished and lose ranking anyway. And the infinte loop of RQ - late join - RQ continues. And now it gets even worse: Imagine, if you so will, the following: You and your team harmonize, you dominate or simply put: YOU PWN YOUR ENEMIES. Now, somebody decides to RQ, is temporarily replaced by a bot, then by another players. Good so far. BUT: remember that "late-join" bonus? Yeah, it's insane. Now lets continue that train of thought: One RQ: no problem. Two: meh, I can handle it. Three or more (and believe me it's more common than you might think): YOU WILL PROBABLY LOSE. All of a sudden, all the late-joiners accumulate a MASSIVE amount of bonusses. Seriosuly, its not even funny. They will simply out-bonus you. Even if you dominated earlier, RQs result in a massive shift in resources. And that ♥♥♥♥ is simply broken.\n\nShort version of the above: RQs beget RQs, leading to Bonus town, USA.\n\nMinor stuff I'd also like to nag about:\n\nPremade vs. solo : C'mon devs, still? At least show me that I am playing againt pres.\nLag: pew pew .......................................death\n\nDon't get me wrong here, I like this game (got a couple of in-game hours). But would I recommend it to new players? Probably only to those who are willing to live with minor and major flaws. Then, go ahead, grab the game and hop in, it is fun. If you are prone to anger? Look elsewhere.\n\n\nHave a good day, everybody.","October 29, 2014","false","004.2"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","2"

Take a basic 2D platformer like Booster Trooper and turn it into a 3 vs 3 all out battle to destroy your opponents base, fighting through turrets along the way. I found the game content to be lacking in both character abilities and map selection--there are only 4 different maps, all identically laid out. All the characters have similar abilities which means they are all pretty evenly matched, but many of the abilities seem pretty useless. There are also unlockable abilities as you pursue the slow experience grind.\n\nMatches last about 10-15 minutes and they are typically pretty lopsided, but occasionally you end up in an intense stalemate. The drop-in / drop-out support is excellent making it very quick and easy to find a game.\n\nWhen they say "Saturday morning is back" they aren't kidding--it's very cartoony, giving it a nostalgic appeal for those who grew up in the 80s.

Awesomenauts offers a unique variety of characters, all with their own unique play style. I don't like comparing games, but after getting about 30 hours in on Awesomenauts, I played a game called "Smite" a similar game with a 3D art style, Awesomenauts was FAR superior over that game, by having a long and growing list of unique characters with unique abilities. Awesomenauts will offer hours of fun, and unique combat along with a lot of strategizing. Being a highly competitive game, you will be matched with competitive people.  But like I said, with strategizing, and smart gameplay you will be able to win.  And if not you will learn from the superior players, and grow your knowledge of the game -- You aren't just automatically good at this game, practice is required.

And while it certainly has it's problems, such as various glitches which the devs are working on fixing at this very moment and a few balance problems, this game is well worth looking in to.\n\nMuch like any other Moba-style games, or competitive games for that matter, Awesomenauts is very difficult to master.  I personally have thrown 1000+ hours into the game and I'm still not that great.  However unlike quite a few games out there which I will not name, it is very easy to get into the game and have a fantastic time.\n\nRather than spending the first fifteen or so minutes doing nothing but killing the creep waves and maybe some minor poke, it is completely possible to engage in a team fight within the first few minutes of a match, keeping it exciting for everyone participating.\n\nIf I were to rate Awesomenauts, I would give it a 7/10.  The score should be higher, however there are some outstanding issues which I just cannot pass over, such as a Peer to Peer connection system which quite often matches you against players with insane ping levels, or the fact that certain characters can't make jumps that other characters can.  However it is still an immense amount of fun and I have found that after 1000+ hours I'm still not bored of the game, do check it out!","March 22, 2013","true","545.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

However, this game doesn't play like your DOTA 2's or your LoL's. It infuses 2D platforming (similar to Megaman games if you need a reference) and the aspects of a competitive MOBA into a 3v3 team fighting game.  While not needlessly complicated as say Dota 2, Awesomenauts draws in that same teamwork and building up your hero feeling all while giving you very direct control of your character. (You can even play with a controller, which is super great for living room PC's)\n\nIt's not a mindless action game, as how you work together with other and how you build up your hero will determine outcomes. (Sometimes the comebacks are nuts!) Ronimo game pours an incredible amount of love into this game and this shows off in every aspect - from the artstyle, the flavor text, the menus, the sound effects and oh god the music. Sonic Picnic's themes for every hero (and even cool remix's when you're doing great at the game) are nothing short of fantastic.

The 2 main ones are the connection problems from player to player and the penalty for leaving a game. Starting with the connction problems, even playing a custom game with friends, the connection cut out on a signal that we have no problemwith in any other game and it is much worse online. This takes me into the second problem, the penalty for "leaving a game". THis is a great feature to stop people from rage quitting or purposely trying to screw over teammates, but the problm is you also get the penalty for when you lose connection to a host, which makes you leave the game even if you don't want to. There have been games where i have gone 7/0 but lost connction so i got the penalty. Now I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like something i would urposely leave. Overall, even with these problems i still reccomend the game and give it a 7/10.

I supported the kickstarter Starstorm campaign also. It's just fantastic for a MOBA/PLATFORM/TURRET DFENCE game. Although that is what people call it I would ignore that description and say it's a multiplayer platform game. It reminds me of playing Smash Bros Mele many years ago on the gamecube. There is a learning curve, but it can be worked through. I'm league 3 now and it is challenging against other players, the main thing is to work as a team, even if the are strangers, knowing where you should be and where to defend or when to push is the key to winning. There's 4 levels (one more to come in the dlc), there's so many characters I've lost count. Each character has a jump/mele or shoot attack, and then two specials. Each can be upgraded to give either more damage or slowing effects etc. You can only pick three upgrades for each skill so you do have to think about it, although usually you'll find you stick to the same pattern that works for you. You have the light characters and heavy support types, something for everyones play style. The only criticisim is the matchmaking can sometimes be unfair, and put you against a team of three people, and are in higher league so the game ends quickly. The developers are however patching the matchmaking soon apparently.... They are very good and do live streams to reveal the patchs and what to be expected. I think this is a great game and no 'paywall' the dlc's that you buy are purely cosmetic, but I like to support the game so I do buy a lot of them (steam sales, get them for pennies). Anyway, I could go on but you should really just get the game now! Also go to their homepage and buy it via humble bundle you save a few penny and support them directly.","January 28, 2015","true","892.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has many characters to choose from and each character is unique in it's own way with plenty of moves that can make your character different from another person's. This game can closely be related to Super Smash Bros in a way. I would recommend this game for playing with your friends as it is quite fun. Only downside is, Awesomenauts have very poor dedicated servers and almost every game will have lag. For example, I already got back to my base where they can't kill me but I suddenly take damage and die from robot 0.o. Also, if you have poor internet (Under 300KB per second) I would really tell you to stay away. If you have slow internet you just end up frozen in the game letting the enemy kill you while you can do nothing about it.","June 20, 2014","true","162.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a blast.\n\nAwesomenauts is a 2D sidescrolling Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) in which you and your team of two other colourful galactic battlers (the nauts) have to destroy the opposing team's drill. Between the start of the game, launched into battle from outer space to destroying the enemy base, it is a hectic, fast-paced, shout-inducing, high-five encouraging fight to the death, where all matter of technological, biological, and even psychic abilities are utilized.\n\nAll these characters and abilities have been neatly balanced. The levelling system makes it very easy to learn, and the humor, gameplay and plain fun will quickly draw you in.\n\nThis is by far my favourite online game bar none.

Bad grammar/writing. Should buy. Not convinced? Do research. And for crying out loud, the DLC characters are not over powered, they just require less skill to be good at.\n\nTL;DR\nAwesomenauts is a fantastic game, and worth a try.  Most of the reviews from 1,000+ hour guys that are bad are probably because they are salty about a nerf or the game "isn't like it used to be".  If something seems unfair, it's probably lack of knowledge or  lack of teamwork. (there are still moments that are unfair, but that usually isn't because of the game)\nA lot of the reviews complain about high ping having an advantage, but from my experience it can be either. Some matches  the high ping player just can't be touched, and other matches the lowest ping player is impossible to dodge, but most matches it's all just fine.\n\nLike any MOBA, most of the bad reviews from high hour players is probably from salt because their favorite character was nerfed, or the game, "Just isn't the same anymore".\n\nI've rarely noticed being put into matches against people that are way better than me, but it usually comes down to the other team working as a team (not as well as a premade. There is quite a noticeable difference) while my team is doing whatever they want instead of working together. However, when a new season starts, you might run into the issue of super good players for a few days, but it is usually fine the rest of the season.\n\nMOBA community so there is that toxic "YOU GUYS SUCK I QUIT, NOOBS PLEASE KILL SELF." guy in about 25% of matches (he's the guy that runs into a 3v1 and then complains about his team sucking when everyone else is pushing a turret), but I usually encounter friendly people.  A lot of people I've come across are willing to teach people how to be better.\n\nI will say that some moments can  be unfair, but I haven't played a multiplayer game in my life that is 100% fair 100% of the time.  There will definitely be moments where you will say, "Dang, if we had this character on our team, this character on the other team wouldn't be 11-0 right now." but that encourages you to think of a solution with what you have.  There are some strategies that seem ridiculously broken at first, but if you can convince your team to work together, those strategies (from what I've encountered) will not hold up.\n\nAwesomenauts is a fantastic game and is my favorite MOBA.  I don't know if it has something to do with my childhood growing up with platformers, and my interest in strategy games, but I have a blast even when I go 0-6 on a day (I still rage, but I still have fun).  It has its flaws, some of which have existed for too long without cause, but like with life: If you focus on all the bad, you'll never have time to see the good and you'll end up in despair (except in this case missing out on a great game).","May 11, 2015","true","485.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't know if it has something to do with my childhood growing up with platformers, and my interest in strategy games, but I have a blast even when I go 0-6 on a day (I still rage, but I still have fun).  It has its flaws, some of which have existed for too long without cause, but like with life: If you focus on all the bad, you'll never have time to see the good and you'll end up in despair (except in this case missing out on a great game).","May 11, 2015","true","485.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

High skilled players just create new accounts because they don't want to actually play with a challenge. With no way to report them you just have to sit there and deal with it.\nTheir system of dealing with players leaving is also broken as hell. They try to replace missing players with bots which just gives the enemy free kills because the AI on bots suck and the enemy team gets extra solar (money) allowing them to be even more fed.\n\nThen you have the problem with collision where on certain maps you have characters that take up the entire walkway so you get two enemies one on each side and you are automatically dead.\n\nThis game is NOT finished.

That destroys a competitive Game, focus on Skins, that doesn't destroys the Gameplay. Its just unfair to pay real Money so that you are ALLOWED to play Nauts that are in this game.\n\n- Map Balance. Some Maps like the ''jungle'' Map are good balanced, with many Creeps to restore your health, and bosses to fight against to earn more money. But Maps like the Space Stations are unbalanced as hell, because once you hold the middle, where the only creeps are, you get constant health while the enemy team has to go back to base.\n- Gameplay Balance. AGAIN the Balance. If you got 3 people who are good at this game, just push 1 lane, and to 90% you always win. The turrets should be MUCH stronger and shouldn't have a consistent life bar. So its basically just [hit, run away, hit again, run away] until the turret is down plus, there are no servers. Peer2Peer and you get killed behind turrets. Great.\nAlso, the ranking system is not existing. You, with 5 hours get easily connected to people with 2000 hours. So the ranks are making no sense at all.\n\n- And the biggest problem of all: The base. Once all turrets are down, i guarantee you to 99% you will lose this game.\nThe nauts can attack the base, while droids can spawn without problems, helping them. YOUR droids cant do anything, because they all spawn infront of the base, so theres almost NO chance to turn the game around, because you don't have turrets anymore. People just hit the base until it has 1-10% of life, then they just wait for you to push, and they go alone in there and finish it. That is certainly damn stupid and you can easily destroy the base, without ANY chance of pushing back. The base should regenerate itself and should have a little undestroyable turret. That would make it MUCH harder to attack the base without Mercy.\n\nAnd of course the Community: You ever played COD, LoL or any other Multiplayer Game? Yes?\nWell forget all of it. NO community in the world is as worse, as the Awesomenauts Community.\nPeople play 1-10 destroy the base and write ''eZ noobs''\nYou barely lost a game because a teammate disconnects? ''Deinstall game you f.aggot''\nYou died because an enemy has the perfect counter naut for you? ''Learn how to play m.otherf.ucker''\nYou died because an enemy is lagging around and you cant hit him? ''You are so bad, eZ''\nYou destroyed the enemy base? ''LoL you guys suck eZ''\nYou destroyed a turret? ''Play fair you noob''\n\nIf Ronimo would work more on the gameplay, instead of putting new buyable annoying nauts in the game, it would actually be REALLY good.\n\nBut until then, we just have to wait.\n7/10. Would recommend, if you can ignore the community.","March 11","true","262.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Addictive gameplay, easy to pick up and understand straight away.\nOne of the only problems I can think of right now is the MATCHMAKING. Most people are complaining about this (as well as the xp system) but the matchmaking deserves the most attention. Being matched with someone who is A LOT better than you is not fun. And the skill range is rather large, so the matchmaking has to be at least a little better for the full experience.\nStill a great game, and an awesome multiplayer experience if you get some friends on it with you.","October 10, 2014","true","572.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The bots are terrible. They have no common sense and will leave you with the enemy team for no apparent reason. Not to mention, there are times where a bot will just go to an isolated place and stay there for moments at a time. The in-game upgrade unlock system is wonky, the community is awful, and the character packs are too expensive.\n\nThe pros: Fun gameplay and original characters. Not all characters seem to be balanced, as some feel a lot weaker than others, and some feel a lot stronger.

The sidescroller aspect to a MOBA is one I hadn't considered before and it really works well. Learning the game is a much easier task than in other MOBAs and the character builds are varied but simple enough that newbies can get them quickly without having to look them up. Games usually take anywhere from 1/6-1/4 the time a match of DOTA2 would take. The music is excellent and ridiculous, which perfectly sets the tone for the environments, characters, and pace of the game. Awe of the fun factor can, unfortunately, turn into frustration after several days of gameplay. The meta game is very unbalanced at the moment which is not a huge problem for most MOBAs considering the large roster of choices most have. Awesomenauts doesn't have that luxury and it becomes an issue when at least 5 of the characters aren't worth playing at higher levels. The game clearly needs fairly constant tweaking as with most MOBAs but it's a great way to pass the time and to take a break from work.","March 14","true","21.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Only every second match I try to play online our league 5-7 team gets matched against league 2-3 opponents, which results in us getting completely steamrolled. We can beat bots easily, have fun playing against each other, but we cannot seem to improve enough to close this huge skillgap.\n\nThis makes every online match a gamble: will we get matched against (roughly) equally capable opponents? Or will the teams be so badly matched one of the sides gets inevitably steamrolled?\n\nIf the second happens, prepare for a 10-20 minute waiting/suffering simulator where every strategy you try and every time you slip up even the slightest is immediately punished by much more experienced opponents who slowly make their way towards your base.

Addictive gameplay, easy to pick up and understand straight away.\nOne of the only problems I can think of right now is the MATCHMAKING. Most people are complaining about this (as well as the xp system) but the matchmaking deserves the most attention. Being matched with someone who is A LOT better than you is not fun. And the skill range is rather large, so the matchmaking has to be at least a little better for the full experience.\nStill a great game, and an awesome multiplayer experience if you get some friends on it with you.","October 10, 2014","true","572.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a cross between a Platformer and a Moba. Two of my favourite genres.\nThe characters feel unique and the in-game music is fantastic. You can never get tired of the killing spree music.\n\nCompared to other Mobas this feels easier and more fun to pick up. The item builds are more straightforward, so I never felt the need to look up any guides or anything. If anything figuring stuff out on my own has made me a better player.\nThis is a bit more twitch reflex, fast paced Moba.\n\nOne valid concern is that the game is peer to peer and doesn't have a central server and lattency is not uncommon. This will be addressed in part in the new matchmaking. In my own experience this has never been a major factor in my over all experience.\n\nAlso as any other moba, people are pretty childish and will not hesitate to waste their energy to insult you. If you feel affercted by toxicity, there is an option to desable the chat altogether.\n\nRonimo is in my experience a very transparent company and has continued to improve the game through years. Sometimes it means they make a big change and it might upset some people, but overall they have continued to improve and support the game.\n\nTo address, some complains towards Overdrive update. A lot of people have complained about Ronimo not having released the new map yet. In they're stream Ronimo explained that it will be released with a new updates, a long with a new matchmaking system and a new free Naut for everybody owning the base game. I actually think it is a good thing to get things sooner rather than later. I think the majority of complaints are due to lack of information.\n\nI would recommend anyone who enjoys Moba or Platformer genre to give this game a try.","March 21","true","406.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every character has their own catchy theme that plays during killstreaks and character selection, and they all have unique personalities and gimmicks.  When Lonestar throws dynamite, Yuri fires his laser, etc., there's this audiovisually satisfying WEIGHT to the actions that's hard to put into words.\n\nFrom an aesthetic standpoint, this game has few contenders.\n\nNow, onto the bad.  For all of its cartoonish charm, Awesomenauts suffers from a broken matchmaking system and painfully-unbalanced characters.  The buy-in DLC characters have ridiculous abilities that can lock down an entire game with minimal effort, and it's not uncommon to see competitive teams placed in matchmaking against rank 9 newbies.  Add in the fact that the ladder actively punishes players for losing teambased matches (rather than, say, poor game-to-game performance), and you have a frustrating ladder that only benefits organized play.  Maybe I'm just "salty," or perhaps I've just been unlucky.  Regardless, that's my experience.\n\n4/10","December 24, 2015","false","164.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's side-scroller shooter.  It may look like a basic game at first but it's very addictive.  You play play on a team of 3 vs 3.  Each character has a special ability and all characters can level up.  As you level up you unlock more weapons and abilities.  All charaters have a basic attack but the special attacks are the ones that help you win the battle and help you decide which character is your favorite.  Once you get real good at a character it gets easier and more fun.  The object of the game is to destroy the other team's base.  Each team has turrents that guard the base.  You must take out the turrents and attack the base.  There's unlimited respawn but as the match progresses the respawn time gets longer.  This game can be played online or single player.  Single player is practice mode but still counts toward your character upgrades.","May 15, 2014","true","20.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In fact, I despise them. This one however has become one of my favourite games within a short amount of time. Awesomenauts is easy to get into. It combines mobo and 2d platforming elements to offer a unique and fun experience. It's not a terribly complicated game and you generally will know what you are supposed to do. The cartoonish style, quirky characters, fantastic soundtrack and fast paced gameplay quickly won me over and invited me to spend over 150 hours of my life on it and I don't intend to stop there. One thing that surprised me was the community. Most people I played with were pretty chill and just having fun. The matches are competitive without being taken too seriously and you generally won't get cussed out for making mistakes. Of course there are still unpleasant players and people who quit when things look bleak for their team but those aren't as common as I expected and quitters often get replaced by other players shortly after they leave. That's one thing I quite like about this game. You are not necessarily screwed if a team mate ragequits (or simply has to leave early). When a player joins a game in progress he gets compensated with an amount of solar (the in-game currency you use to buy upgrades with) that is dependant on how high leveled the players in the match are. So it's definitely possible for a new player to show up and contribute to the team, maybe even turn the game in your favor.\n\nOverall I'm quite fond of Awesomenauts and recommend it to pretty much anyone except maybe people who prefer singleplayer and don't enjoy online play. The bots in this game aren't particularly clever and only can pick 4 of the currently 16 characters, meaning you'll exhaust your offline options soon. Everyone else however, give Awesomenauts a shot! Even if you dislike mobas this game might just entertain you. Especially with friends it becomes a blast.","December 22, 2013","true","146.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now that patch 2.13 is here, Awesomenauts has a negative review.\n\nThe main reason patch 2.13 is so awful is because it changes the game in a way that is not for the better. Before patch 2.13 games were won with teamwork, communication, strategy, and strategy. It was a completely legitimate strategy to farm creeps and not focus on kills if the other team is passive. Just out push the lane. Patch 2.13 changed all of that with the XP system. Because the XP system is about leveling up the whole team, the early game is no longer about pushing and out farming the opposition, it is now about early game team composition and trying to get kills before the other team kills you. Most of the games I have lost in this patch have been games where my team did not get the first kill.\n\nEarly kills are more important now than ever before. They boost maximum health and maximum damage. Before patch 2.13, the other team could get kills but not all was lost, because you still had the same amount of health as they did, and you still did the same damage per skill based on their upgrades and your upgrades. Patch 2.13 tore away with those ideas because now the team has 1) more solar and 2) more health/base damage. This all leads to a snowball effect. The other team has even a less chance of winning against that team than before. If a player has a teammate that is not as strong of a player, the team is pretty much doomed.\n\nThe snowball effect doesn't give players a reason to stay in the game either. There is still no penalty for leaving a game and players really don't have a reason to stay once the other team is a couple levels + above them. I've seen people feed and ragequit more than I have ever before.\n\nPlease rethink the XP system. Don't just make this game free to play because of a decreased flow of players.","January 2","false","113.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

There are some awesome nauts (see what I did there) too, like rocco, I really like him because even when you just spawned you can throw that gigantic arrow in their direction;\n\nThird reason: AWESOME skins; well I know most of people, when they first buy a game that contains buyable, they think they will never buy not even one, but then they start seeing those cool skins they did, for example I'l give you a list of 10 skins that I like: Sun Wukong Skree, Jotunn Skolldir, Leon Legionnaire, Expendable Clunk, Cybertronic Rocco, Cosmic Captain Ksenia, Pimpy G., Shaolin Ayla, Specimen X-58 and Voltar Bonaparte. They all have beautiful artworks and you should by some, they look cool.\n\nFourth Reason:  Neat maps with different mechanics, like The Ribbit IV, with lots of place to hide in the middle area of the map, or Sorona, a map with a gigantic worm, that is hidden, then when you press a button its mouth kills everything that is close to it.\n\nFifth Reason: IT'S AWESOME\n\nNow, like all game, there are Cons:\n\nThe Matchmaking sucks, you will probably play against a team which everyone is max prestige and you team there are less than 50 hours.\n\nLag everywhere: there will always be someone lagging and reconecting.\n\nReconecting: most of the time you'll start reconecting you're gonna stand still and take damage from whatever is attacking you, it's HORRIBLE, you'll get VERY MAD when that happens.\n\nSame way, with all those cons, it's still a very fun game and very awesome to play with friends and do combos, so have fun playing!\n\n","February 15","true","417.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

You'll keep all the characters you unlocked but all the sidegrades for them get relocked.\n\n-The music in this game is amazing and fits the theme perfectly. Theres special music for each character.\n\nCons:\n-Although earlier I said balancing seems awesome the more you play, its absolutely crazy when you start out! Things'll be doing what seems like an insane amount of damage! You'll be screaming for nerfs (Probably)!\n\n-The community. There are some AMAZING people in the Awesomenauts community but thats like 3/10 people. Then maybe 5/10 people are batshit crazy and get angry super easily, troll, and basically take a dump on the sanctity of the game. 2/10 people though, are pretty apathetic to the whole thing. Silent mutes, the lot of them.\n\n-No dedicated servers. The servers use steam, so if steam crashes you wont be able to play. They're working on it.\n\n-Lag. A whole lot. You can minimize the lag by setting the matchmaking search to NOT worldwide, and then it becomes not too bad. Its usually not crazy rubberbanding or melee attacks hitting from across the map, just things like "I was behind that turret!" or "No way she has that much range!" or "THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!!11!11!".\n\n-Requires teamwork. Some games (If you soloQ) you will get absolutely demolished by the enemy premade team, OR your team will just blow.\n\n-You have to put around 10-30 minutes per game, depending on whether its a total stomp or both teams are evenly matched.\n\nAwesomenauts is an awesome take on the MOBA genre (IMO) and should be enjoyed by everyone. If you think you might maybe enjoy Awesomenauts a tiny little bit, you should probably buy it. Its only $10.99 Candian, so if you have the money to buy this, you should. Remember to never rage, its just a game.\n\nNOTE: Its amazing fun to play solo, but a team makes this much more fun.","June 8, 2013","true","075.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","6"

You'll keep all the characters you unlocked but all the sidegrades for them get relocked.\n\n-The music in this game is amazing and fits the theme perfectly. Theres special music for each character.\n\nCons:\n-Although earlier I said balancing seems awesome the more you play, its absolutely crazy when you start out! Things'll be doing what seems like an insane amount of damage! You'll be screaming for nerfs (Probably)!\n\n-The community. There are some AMAZING people in the Awesomenauts community but thats like 3/10 people. Then maybe 5/10 people are batshit crazy and get angry super easily, troll, and basically take a dump on the sanctity of the game. 2/10 people though, are pretty apathetic to the whole thing. Silent mutes, the lot of them.\n\n-No dedicated servers. The servers use steam, so if steam crashes you wont be able to play. They're working on it.\n\n-Lag. A whole lot. You can minimize the lag by setting the matchmaking search to NOT worldwide, and then it becomes not too bad. Its usually not crazy rubberbanding or melee attacks hitting from across the map, just things like "I was behind that turret!" or "No way she has that much range!" or "THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!!11!11!".\n\n-Requires teamwork. Some games (If you soloQ) you will get absolutely demolished by the enemy premade team, OR your team will just blow.\n\n-You have to put around 10-30 minutes per game, depending on whether its a total stomp or both teams are evenly matched.\n\nAwesomenauts is an awesome take on the MOBA genre (IMO) and should be enjoyed by everyone. If you think you might maybe enjoy Awesomenauts a tiny little bit, you should probably buy it. Its only $10.99 Candian, so if you have the money to buy this, you should. Remember to never rage, its just a game.\n\nNOTE: Its amazing fun to play solo, but a team makes this much more fun.","June 8, 2013","true","075.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","6"

There are some awesome nauts (see what I did there) too, like rocco, I really like him because even when you just spawned you can throw that gigantic arrow in their direction;\n\nThird reason: AWESOME skins; well I know most of people, when they first buy a game that contains buyable, they think they will never buy not even one, but then they start seeing those cool skins they did, for example I'l give you a list of 10 skins that I like: Sun Wukong Skree, Jotunn Skolldir, Leon Legionnaire, Expendable Clunk, Cybertronic Rocco, Cosmic Captain Ksenia, Pimpy G., Shaolin Ayla, Specimen X-58 and Voltar Bonaparte. They all have beautiful artworks and you should by some, they look cool.\n\nFourth Reason:  Neat maps with different mechanics, like The Ribbit IV, with lots of place to hide in the middle area of the map, or Sorona, a map with a gigantic worm, that is hidden, then when you press a button its mouth kills everything that is close to it.\n\nFifth Reason: IT'S AWESOME\n\nNow, like all game, there are Cons:\n\nThe Matchmaking sucks, you will probably play against a team which everyone is max prestige and you team there are less than 50 hours.\n\nLag everywhere: there will always be someone lagging and reconecting.\n\nReconecting: most of the time you'll start reconecting you're gonna stand still and take damage from whatever is attacking you, it's HORRIBLE, you'll get VERY MAD when that happens.\n\nSame way, with all those cons, it's still a very fun game and very awesome to play with friends and do combos, so have fun playing!\n\n","February 15","true","417.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It was a bit of fun and a slightly different concept. Online games were good as long as the lag wasn't too bad. They kept adding new characters which made it interesting.\n\nRecently I started playing it again after not playing for some time. I have to say the game seems incredibly imbalanced now, which is really frustrating. It does not make for a good experience. There are more characters to play, which is a positive, but there are also too many changes from the original version that make some characters really weak compared to others such that it is an imbalanced game.\nAdditionally, you don't know what characters the other team will play in an online match; so if you happen to end up playing against a team with a tank and a healer, you're virtually doomed (and cannot counter by choosing a healer or tank for your own team in advance).\n\nOverall it's a bit of a fun game, but just recently the imbalanced aspects have really gotten to me that I have lost enjoyment in it. It's a fun game, but I have to say: be prepared for easy deaths.","October 1, 2015","false","138.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

This game had me hooked. It was a fast paced action packed MOBA based on quick twitch, quick thinking, and skill. It had a huge emphasis on brawling. Recently, things have now changed the balance that is mostly focused on pushing.  You are going to consistently see the same 5 characters spamming push oriented builds everytime. The second you try to engage in a fight, they immediately run. They will use their skills to push you back Then there are also insane CC's and burst abilities that aren't balanced correctly.

However, unlike most moba games, there is little to do with builds, item buying and order of things and more with pure skill and with just having two lanes at most, it's hard not to play as a part of the team even when you are "lone wolfing".\nI do wish ronimo did more maintenance on the game rather than just keep giving new characters, there are a lot of performance, server and matchmaking issues that need to be resolved. The fact that there is no pre-game lobby is also quite annoying and again makes careful strategising, preparation and team work pointless as most people go for carry characters rather than support making almost 70% of matches with random people have a whole team of lone wolfs.\nSimplicity of this game will draw in more people into more competitive scene of DOTA and LOL as most people do not get overwhelmed by the amount of things, items, characters, strategies they need to learn but instead learn basics of moba games and prepare for those bigger ones.\nToxicity in awesomenauts still exists like in all other competitive games, but most of the times it's either trolling or easy to ignore as it is so hard to play this game and not be somewhat helpful. No one will be yelling at you for playing support and not placing wards, or not staying on your lane, or not joining in on a gank. You will however get flak for feeding and going afk, but if you do you probably deserve it :D\nAll in all the game is not without its problems, technical and mechanical, but because it's easy to learn, easy to jump into (as if you dc you get replaced by bots until someone takes up your space), you will get a guaranteed kill or 10 every game almost which gives you massive amounts of satisfaction. Big fights happen constantly, always keeping you on your toes and not making you feel like you are just a gear in a mechanism for the first 10 minutes like in games like DOTA - farm creeps, get to tower, retreat, farm creeps, get to tower... In conclusion the game has colourful graphics, great voice acting from some of the biggest youtube celebrities  and fluid controls (wouldn't recommend playing using controller though)","December 21, 2013","true","152.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Dont get me wrong this game is fun...... for the first hour than youu realise all the unbalncing and the absolutely terrible community. the game play is a basic shooter team game where teams of 3v3 duke it out until 1 of their bases are dead. this is hampered by characters being unbalanced. characters liek ayla, genji,and skree ruin the game entirely with their completelyy over powered builds that absoultly dominate any character. the maps also are crud because players can camp behind their turret and become virtually unkillable with exceptions being aoe attacks which dont comewithe very character mind you. Finally, character you get in teh begining like clunk or froggy g get absolutly replaced by characters like derpl zork and vinnie and spike.\nThe community is absolut trash as well. They are stubbern and never listen to any type of suggestione ven though this is a team based game and instead think they can rush an entire team and in the end die. The game is also barren with only 1 not even full game playing at a time (different time zones differ). Finally, the horrible ui is such a pain to work with sucha s having the settings out of game and having chat so odd to use such as having button delays, and voice being absolutly useless. The last thing i was saving was the mos stupidest decision ever. The quit button has a timer. What the heck why would i need time to decide if i want to quit I think i pressed it because i wanted to A. quit the game B. QUIT THE GAD DANG GAME. This is a terrible decision.

Funny/comical game. In-game quotes and lines are well-made and just by playing a couple of different characters like for example Leon Chameleon with his serious but still funny lines and then playing Froggy G and hearing him talk about "your mama" makes you very statisfied.\n\n2. Ranking system not too advanced, and works quite well. The ranking system is easy to understand from 1-9 and basicaly anyone in the world would understand it by just looking at it.\n\n- Cons -\n1. Not very fun without friends.

I was fairly interested in MOBAs but couldn't get into them because of their extremely discouraging learning curves and skill floors and such. There was no easily-accessible version of Dota.\n\nThen Ronimo Games, a Dutch indie game developer comes in, the same people that brought you Swords and Soldiers (and are currently working on the sequel).\n\nThey had a great concept - take the traditional Dota or League of Legends formula and put it into a form more easily digested by a common gamer, with polished 2D graphics, fast-paced and fun gameplay, taking the concept of "easy to learn, hard to master" to a pretty high level.\nIt went from six vastly different characters with two abilities each (and a unique auto-attack) with distinct playstyles and even their own music themes, three maps with heavy emphasis on platforming to...\nWell, read more.\n\n\nI'll be honest though - at first I was merely lurking the game, following the news and occassionally popping in to test a new character or something, but never really paying more attention to it until the summer of 2013, I believe. Since then I've been a huge fan of the game, cheering at every new addition and firmly established myself as the "lord of hype" in the community (even though I was never the greatest at actually playing the game).\n\nAt some point thogh, things started to go wrong...Very wrong in my eyes.\nAnd currently, they stand more or less like this:\n\nYou have a total of 20 (as of this review the 21st is on the way) characters, each having two special abilities, an auto-attack and a platforming mechanic ie. jumps (which can vary from single jumps to double jumps to quad jumps to flight to everything in-between). Said abilities can be upgraded with a plethora of items that boost their stats or open up new ways to play the game.\n\nSounds good on paper, right?\n...What if I told you that 4 (soon to be 5) of those characters are DLC-exclusive (thankfully they're bought in a single package instead of seperately like most other games would do it), and about ~8 of those characters are actually fun and strong at any given times - and it only continues to get worse with every patch. Every single character is weaker to varying degrees compared to where they used to be. For someone who has seen most of them in their glory it really feels frustrating when you no longer feel like you can do anything on your own when your teammates are dragging you down...\n\n...On that note, the game's matchmaking is sketchy at best.\nAssuming it doesn't take you half an hour to even find a full match (the game has about 800 active players and the matches are 3v3, as opposed to the traditional 5v5), chances are one team is going to consist of people who have triple or even quadruple digits worth of gametime and experience, and will often be put alongside players who are still trying to grasp the game's most basic concepts. There is supposed to be a "league" system at work here (where you have 9 leagues, 1 being the top, 9 being the lowest) where players are supposed to fight other players of similar skill level but due to the ever-shrinking playerbase it's becoming and more difficult for that to happen.\n\nNetcode can also be pretty bad. Because the community is so small, it's spread out fairly thin across the globe (mostly concentrated in western&middle Europe and North America), you will often be facing players from the other side of the world, which when combined with the game's suboptimal peer-to-peer (as opposed to a host-client server, not that it would solve all that much, despite what would are saying) networking, it turns the fast-paced game of precision into a glorified lottery...\n\n...That even if you win at, you get no rewards in the end.\n\nRemember what I said about the items/upgrades that every character has access to? About a third of those will be locked at the beginning, but you can gradually unlock them through winning matches, and when you unlock all of them, you can choose to prestige, which will reset your level (while keeping all characters unlocked) forcing you to go through the same grind again.\nAnd what do you get in return?\n\nA shiny badge. Woo, big damn deal.\nYou can also opt in to do it 9 more times, for a total of 10 prestige ranks.\n...And that's about all you can do when you're not yelling at your oh-so brilliant teammates.\nOr you could just never do that in the first place because people can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in and out of the game and will try to find all the weirdest reasons to flame you in and out of the game. Then again, same goes for basically every MOBA in existence.\n\nThere's simply little reason to keep coming back if you find the main gamemode that is "destroy towers and then the core to win" - once you reach the lategame, you realize that there's nothing to do.\n\n...You can buy extra to buy some skins! Some of them are actually fairly nice but the price of some of them might be debatable at times.\n...You can play custom games for a while with friends until you realize that they aren't really that amazing either.\n...You can show off your pro skills on the global leaderboards (which are absolutely not in any way, shape or form broken in that regard /s) or in tournaments (or you can't, because chances are you're gonna be wiped out clean by the top teams and probably also be trashed while they're at it. The competitive "scene" is small, toxic and generally not worth your time.)\n\n\nThe soundtrack is really good though - every character comes with a unique song (and a remixed version as a killing spree reward!), it's a great thing to listen to in and out of the game, although that thing is the most subjective part of the game.\nI like it a lot and I hope you do too.\n\n\n...\nAll in all, for a ten-dollar game that goes on sale every other week or so, it's fairly good, but as time goes on it's becoming more and more difficult for me to genuinely reccomend it. I can't guarantee that everyone will get the same bang for their buck as I did.","January 28, 2015","false","314.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","6"

However, since the recent updates, the game has been declining significantly and abandon universal rules found in many MOBA video games (such as individual XP rates). Now, however, the entire team is punished for the poor performance of a single teammate. Before the shared XP system, I would go on 10-0 win-streak, but I'll be fortunate enough to win 1 out of 10 games (my teammates love running into mass suicide), as I'll explain below.\n\nI've had several games where me and my partner would be doing excellent and 3 or more levels above the opposition. All of a sudden, someone joins and runs into enemy fire like a 10-year old COD player with an overpowered heavy machine gun. Needlessly to say, it causes me the game everytime. Regardless of how much I try, there's always one weaker player on my team that throws an already unbalanced skill-matching system off course.\n\nMaybe I'm not as skilled as I believed, but I find it hard to believe my skills are as terrible as a low-level bot when I placed in rank 1-2 and even matched up with those on top of the leaderboard. Now, I'm stuck at the bottom unless I'm fortunate enough to run into some rather experienced players instead of some fresh naunts straight out of the tutorial.","March 7","false","147.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Funny/comical game. In-game quotes and lines are well-made and just by playing a couple of different characters like for example Leon Chameleon with his serious but still funny lines and then playing Froggy G and hearing him talk about "your mama" makes you very statisfied.\n\n2. Ranking system not too advanced, and works quite well. The ranking system is easy to understand from 1-9 and basicaly anyone in the world would understand it by just looking at it.\n\n- Cons -\n1. Not very fun without friends.

When the teams are balanced (which when you have a good connection, it is not uncommon) you can have a lot of fun, and it gets very competitive but usually still light-hearted.\nHowever. Lag can make it almost unplayable, with enemy abilitys hitting you out of no-where and you dying after you clearly got out, and this happens more often than it should. The game does not have a very large player base, so it struggles to match you up, and you will often join games half way through because someone rage quit.\n\nIn conclusion, if you get annoyed quickly with bad matchmaking, this game probably isn't for you. However if you can soldier through the bad games, this game  is definitely worth it.","January 1, 2014","true","518.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It could be great but as it stands the matchmaking is THE WORST, and there's no single player mode.  The learning curve is really high, plan on getting destroyed as a newbie.  Once you get experienced you will get dominated by premades, lose games that you should win because people constantly leave/latejoin, get harassed by the toxic playerbase, and get disconnected from P2P matchmaking as you are about to win.  Oh, and players get a buff when they join late.  This game could be amazing but Ronimo just keeps cranking out DLC to fatten their pockets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wertyxl/recommended/204300/","Wertyxl","Wertyxl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wertyxl/","15 products in account","Each character has a variety of abilities, all of which can be customized by purchasing items with Solar (gold) earned from killing opponents and accomplishing objectives. Said items allow for a great deal of flexibility in creating a specific build for your character. Even a single ability can vary greatly depending on the applied upgrades. Leon's stealth ability, for example, cloaks him and leaves behind a clone. Without upgrades, the clone serves only as a distraction to confuse enemies. With some investment, the clone can walk, attack and even explode upon death, effectively turning the harmless clone into a death-dealing, turret-diving nuisance.\n\nEvery character enjoys this level of on-the-fly customization – enough of it to keep the action going without getting confusing or requiring a study-guide just to keep track of your build. Unlocking new items is half the fun of Awesomenauts, opening up new possibilities (like the aforementioned exploding clone) as persistent experience is gained across every match. With locked upgrades clearly visible during character selection, it doesn't take long before you start pining for the perfect build – I need Lonestar's final dynamite upgrade – and playing matches to earn them is addictive.\n\n\n\nMatches themselves are frantic, the screen often filled with A.I. controlled droids and a mass of characters. Learning when (and whom) to attack is key, as is taking advantage of your team's composition. It's a good idea to pair Voltar (the healer) with Clunk, for example. Voltar can make it nearly impossible to kill Clunk, while Clunk can keep Voltar protected, making them a force to be reckoned with as they march across the map. While there are only three maps available, each is unique and offers special features of its own, from additional droid spawners to gold-dropping mini-bosses. My personal favorite is a sandworm that can be triggered to instantly kill anyone foolish enough to cross its pit – the catch being that said pit is littered with free gold for those quick enough to get it.\n\n\n\n\nAs in other MOBAs, duels often break out on key points of the map, each character vying for the best position and using skills to their advantage, pushing foes toward turrets or freezing them in place for a few free hits. I never tire of whittling down an opponent and watching him run, only to be reeled back in by Leon's tongue and summarily executed. It's thrilling every single time. And, just to make the other team aware of that fact, there's a built-in taunt function (or a "help me" function, if you're on the wrong side of this equation).\n\nPlaying with friends is a seamless affair, online or off, allowing almost any mix of local and online players to join the fray. Bots take over unfilled slots, and they are automatically replaced once a human player is found. Human players are definitely preferable, as I found the bots to be predictable and rather easily defeated. I didn't come across any glaring balance issues, though it's worth noting that any such issues will assuredly be found quickly once the game is available to the public.\n\nAwesomenauts does more than simply adapt a successful formula, it does so with humor and panache. It has taken a genre typically dripping with grim fantasy and turned it playfully on its ear. Even without the delightful presentation, the simple fact that developer Ronimo Games has effectively fused a MOBA with the trappings of a 2D action title is laudable on its own. Give it your money, and it will give you its love. You can probably hang on to your cheese though.","June 3, 2015","true","862.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Even though this game is fun at times, its cons are major. Matchmaking is terrible,  game is still very unbalanced( still better than before ), and most upgrades are useless. don't bother buying health upgrades at early level, that is completely unnecessary as you barely gain any percentage if you play as a non tank. scoop was tanky back in the day or you could play him as hybrid tank with burst. now he is both tanky and deals hella damage at higher levels. ted mcpains aerial call can take out half hp pretty much on every character at beginning of the game.\n\nOne of it's major cons however, is the collision boxes on almost eveything. This just makes the game very uncompetitive. Trying to dodge Scoop's hammer is useless becuase there is a %50 chance it will hit you regardless if you dodge or not, as long as you are close to it. Froggy's dash has a pretty big hitbox too, so dodging that is pointless. Leon's tongue has to be the glitchiest ability in the game. After you catch somebody with your tongue, regardless of  the latency, it will always take a second or two after grab to pull them in. Also the collision box  on that is terrible too. Penny's damage is satisfied, but holy ♥♥♥♥ her knockback is unbareable. To top it off, there is also a bigger chance it will hit you regardless if you are even close enough for her to hit you or not.\n\nI want a refund on all my skins","December 4, 2015","false","257.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

First there’s the lag. Because there are no dedicated servers, you can very easily manipulate your ping for in game advantage. I have a ping of 100 with only awesomenauts open, but when I open chrome and listen to music off YouTube, my ping jumps to around 300. Many players will manipulate their ping off and on throughout a match, changing it for when they need it. It doesn’t matter why the lag occurs, all that matters is that it destroys the gaming experience.\n\nSecond, the game has a broken late join and abandoning system. Leaving a match incurs a penalty in the games leader board system, and you don’t gain as much experience from the next match. This has never discouraged anyone from ragequitting. If a match is not full (3v3) the game will hot seat someone in wherever they are needed. While that seems great, it’s a completely ineffective system of preventing people from leaving and an unbalancing effect of late joins. Almost every match I have ever played in this game has had at least one disconnect. When a new player joins, they get the average amount of ingame money (solar) to buy upgrades, so even if you’re stomping the other team they will join in with as much as the winning team. When a new person joins in with as much solar as you, they get the chance to build their upgrades around your team, while you have already picked your general build. I have played a good number of games where the other team is losing badly so they all ragequit, only to be replaced by a full team of new players who all have as much solar as us, as well as the advantage of being able to build to counter our players, while we’re all set up for a different match entirely. Furthermore, if you’re the host of match, you can force everyone in match to quit by shutting off your internet. This happens almost every time the host is doing badly. And yes, you lose “league points” when the host forces you to disconnect. You may even join a game that a player has quit seconds before the base is destroyed and the game is over with a defeat for you (which you will lose ranking for).\n\nThe developers of this game are truly evil. You can purchase skins for the game, which are overpriced. Most games charge more than a dollar for skins, because they’re incredibly easy to design and they don’t change game play. Most of Ronimo’s skins are between 2.99 and 7.99.  Two skins are as much as the game was originally. A pack of skins is 15 dollars, which is 5 dollars more then the game. That is simply not ok. They also came out with an expansion for the game almost two years ago, for around 7 dollars. It unlocked (at the time) one character. Now it provides more characters, and they’re by far the  best characters in the game. However they sit behind a pay wall for almost the same price as the original game. This is disheartening to consumer, but forgivable if the game was balanced and had dedicated servers. But the final piece of the pie is that the expansion was crowd funded. They crowd funded an expansion, that when released only included one character.  They said quote “We want to take Awesomenauts to the next level, with characters, features, a new map, and more! Join us to make this happen!” Many of these features are yet to arrive. 7,496 backers pledged $345,835 to help bring this project to life. That’s more money than many people make in 5 years of work. For an expansion. Of a game that already came out. The expansion added features that should have been free and come with updates.\n\nI don’t recommend this game, and I loathe myself for giving it 400+ hours, and even writing review.","July 27, 2015","false","367.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","1"

If ur one of those gamers that cant afford GOOD internet do not buy this game! YOU will get pinned with the worst connection host's. And YOU will eventually disconnect. Unless you live somewhat NEAR the game host or have an "AWE" stunning connection you will not enjoy the constant ANNOYING "reconnect" sign above ur character that will eventually lead to ur RAGE.\n\n2. I think its absurd how there could be over 1k players online and still wait 4 damm minutes to join a match only to be met with cheap bots. According to Devs the matchmaking system searches in a "WIDE" range, HAHAHA what a load of bull$@#%, and guess whats worst? when the amazing gods of awesomenauts finally connect you to a "DECENT match" ull receive a wonderful greeting by heart-breaking host connection. In unwanting occasions the game will drop you in a near-ended match, its ur fortune or misfortune to join the winning or the losing team (say ur farewells to the league you were currently holding)\n\nIt's a shame to see such a spectacular game being hold back by some FIXABLE problems.

If not read on! Awesomenaut is a 2D Action Rpgish game (Or in other words a 2D MOBA game which is based on strategy) that can statify a competitive or casual gamer with certain circumstances for competitive gamers. It mainly focuses on team based play and it is quite in depth in that respect. Now for the good things about the game.\n\nThe Good:\n\nAwesomenauts is a fun game with a satisfying amount of characters each with their own role. They're colorful and have a very nice art style not used much anymore. The game has variety with several maps to play on and many builds to make your character fit your play style. In the introduction I mentioned teamwork, now let me expand upon that. The teamwork in this game is very intriquet with player's varying playstyles, characters, builds, and several other variables. It is very rewarding if difficult at times and I've won rounds with a disadvantage just because of teamwork. Overall a good experience, but not without some drawbacks.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nAt certain updates of the game it has been terribly unbalanced with characters clearly better than others and certain builds and team compositions dominating. Some characters did way too much burst damage or sometimes had too much healing power. Even now there are some character and build items not even used or barely ever seen. Also some characters are just bland and gimmiky, I don't end up playing a good lot of them because of that. Along with some wonky hit boxes certain updates can make the game super frustrating, but don't give up on this game just yet.\n\nOverall:\n\nDespite all the bad I personally think the good out weighs it, also the fact that there isn't another game I can think of quite like this one. I wouldn't hesitate on buying this game if you plan on playing with friends. Balance doesn't mean much if you have a laugh with your friends and use some teamwork. If you're not playing this game with your friends AND you want to play it competitively I'd strongly reccomend you wait for the game to go on sale so you can get a friend a copy. In the end a solid if off balance kind of game, but if you like the concept and balance isn't your top priority pick it up!","December 14, 2013","true","223.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I’ve recommended it to pretty much all of my friends at this point. Most of them bought the game immediately after giving it a try.\nSo here’s a quick list of things I like and dislike in Awesomenauts.\n\nThings I like:\n-	Easy to learn\n-	Regular patches\n-	Many characters with unique play-styles\n-	Less serious than other ‘MOBA’ games\n-	Funny character voices and well suited soundtrack\n-	Big fun with friends\n-	Split screen functionality\n-	You can turn a game around at almost any point in the game\n-	It’s cheap, even without a sale\n\nThings I dislike:\n-	Lag issues spoil the fun from time to time\n-	Patches and new characters can bring some imbalance (gets patched out most of the time though)\n-	AI is too good or too bad depending on the character (sometimes better than the player that left, turning the game upside down)\n-	Unfair matchups are not uncommon (especially with premade teams from different leagues)\n\nConclusion:\nThe folks at Ronimo did a really good job at adapting the MOBA genre to work as a 2D platformer. They’ve created a game that really made it to the top of the list of my favorite games of all time (and that’s saying something, I’ve played A LOT of games). I’d recommend this to pretty much anyone.","December 7, 2014","true","245.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Requiring more twitch skill than last-hitting ability or proper build order, this is a game in two worlds.\n\nThe art style is cartoony, specifically designed to invoke the feelings of old saturday morning cartoons like Ren & Stimpy or Tom & Jerry. Slapstick humor is certainly prevalent all around and many of the character's lines are referrential; they even have a few big name internet celebrities doing character voices (TB, Jess Cox, dodger, and Myndflame are the ones i know of). Overall the game is fairly pretty with interesting variations between the maps.\n\nThe game is very easy to get into as you level up incredibly quickly and early on most people don't know what they're doing, so you won't need anything but some good ol' Mario skill and common sense to get started, though i do reccommend playing practice mode first.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and responsive, though it could be a teeny bit quicker on the uptake. There is a drastic problem though; the game De-syncs ALL THE TIME. I have had numerous games where I was kicked due to severe lag and sync problems due to low ping. EDIT: the game is hosted peer-to-peer. Do not play without serious antivirus software and firewalls or you could possibly get hacked. The game also has no games lobby of any sort, automatically searching for a game to get you in. This exacerbates the low-ping problem as you have no idea how god the host of the game is, and it's very reluctant to switch hosts. This problem will get you unfair kills and unfairly killed time and time again. Ronimo, if I have any reccomendation, fix this issue BEFORE releasing starstorm fully. However, if you can get past that, there's a surprising amount of depth to the game. Each character plays very differently despite having only 2 abilities and a special jump. The characters all also have their own items, and you get to customize which items are available to buy at the shop, which is where a great deal of the non-twitch skill comes in. Setting up proper builds is daunting, so i suggest taking an online build to begin with, then working on your own from the principles you see there.\n\nEDIT:\nA lot of people hav e complaints about the community in the game. For me and my under 20 hours at low levels, I have seen a few complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and one feeder, but overall people are quiet and react as you'd expect a normal person to; upset when losing (but not blaming the team except for the feeder, who was literally doing nothing so i don't blame him.), happy when winning (but only a few ♥♥♥♥♥ who spam the taunt button or act all superior when they win at league 9 [of 9]) and talking to the team only to ask for help defending a turret or something. I give it a community toxicity rating (with 1 being friendly and helpful while 10 being DOTA 2 or the youtube comments section.) of 6. More bad than good, but acceptable if you're patient and level-headed.\n\nOverall, the game is funny, can be challenging, has great depth, but at the same time still feels like a beta test sometimes. As for starstorm, I don't have it and am reluctant to pay money for extra characters in any game, despite it being a pretty cheap character pack. One final thing; this is a paid game with microtransactions. On the other hand, it's only cosmetic (unless you count starstorm which also has an extra map coming and AI editor) so you decide if that's fair.\n\nIf you like platformers and competitive games and don't mind a bit of glitchiness and don't have a problem with the fact that if you want totalbiscuit Vinne you've gotta shell out extra real cash, The game comes recommended. I play it a ton and have enjoyed my time immensely. Using Nerdcubed's 1-3 rating system; I give awesomenauts a 2. This is without a doubt not a shining recommendation; the game has a laundry list of problems some of which can be fixed while others are the result of the good ol' internet community. I personally picked it up for 99 cents but I wouldn't have paid much more for it. Certainly not 10 dollars.","June 29, 2014","true","167.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may possible that a "proper" online character with "proper" items may not be able to be obtain without spending more money. For instance, the "best" heroes and items may only be available for those who pay more... those who then will crush those who pay less. I may be wrong, cause I'm not that far in the game (and if I'm not wrong, I will change my mind on the game).\n\nA last note, and not the least, this is like dota2: this is not for casual gamers.

You have tanks, pushers, healers, harassers, and so on so every kind of player will find at least one character they will like.\n\nEssentially, it's a 2D MOBA (think Dota and League of Legends) with a heavy emphasis on casual play, as well as co-op.\n\nThe game is far from dead and is reasonably active, but most of the people playing it now have been at it for quite some time. So if you're new and you're going to play this at an odd time (like the middle of the night), matchmaking could place you in a very one-sided game. Though that should change for at least a week or two after a sale, when there's an influx of new players to balance out matchmaking.\n\nIf you see this on sale, BUY IT. I guarantee you'll have a blast, especially if you're playing with friends. I'm personally picking up the Starstorm when it's next on sale.","December 14, 2014","true","44.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend this game because you don't need to have to aim like a FPS, all you have to do is utulise each characters unique abilities to defeat the enemy team and earn cool upgrades! :D Again you will not regret purchasing this game and is even better when playing with a friend! (beware this game can be rage educing if you just cant take losing or if you are a "rage gamer" ) So this game is not a waste of your money and I would highly recommend it to anyone else who is curious about it.","August 6, 2014","true","46.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrismas95/recommended/204300/","Chrismas95","Chrismas95","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrismas95/","405 products in account","Awesomenauts is a 2D MOBA (like League of Legends or DOTA 2, where you have to destroy turrets and a base) that focuses heavily on platforming (for escaping and attacking). There's a wide range of characters (with more being added) and each character has the choice of upgrades they can buy in-game, opening up plenty of builds to try out. And unlike other MOBAs, there's little to no learning curve. As you play more, you level up, unlocking more characters and upgrades. Even though only being able to start with three characters seems limiting, it makes it easy to jump in without having to do character/mechanic research (the short tutorial is enough) or be intimidated by choices. I'd say the only bad thing about this game is the fact that there are limited maps (four at the moment), but they're varied enough that I often don't think about it.\nOverall, it's a MOBA that isn't too complicated but still fun to play, appealing to both casual and hardcore gamers of the genre alike. I'd buy it if you're interested in the genre but too afraid to devote yourself to learning it. And if you're a familiar, you'll feel right at home while still having different characters and mechanics to learn.","December 30, 2012","true","525.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I really like the fact that you can upgrade throughout the game and such instead of just being "here are your powers for this person". The controls are very well done and I enjoy the aesthetics of the game. It is a good game to just pick up and play with friends against bots or people. Games don't last long at all and you get a great amount of xp so the leveling is pretty fast.\nI do feel there like there still is a lot of balancing issues, but for the most part it is a fantastic game.\nThe only thing that I didn't really like because of just my opinion, is the fact that when you play against people online, if they quit out someone else can join in and take their place. But that's because I am a traditionalist to where, you set up the lobby and if someone leaves they are replaced by bots for the rest of the game.\n9/10","July 23, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In short - it's a funny enjoyable 2D 3vs3 moba. I started playing out of curiosity and because the game was on top of my games list:) It is a moba with 20ish (or less) different characters with its unique abilities each. Each hero has 4 tier abilites - one passive, one for default weapon, one for first magic and one for second magic ability. Each ability has 6 or 7 upgrade; you start with only 4 and then lvl up to unlock the others but you can only use 3 upgrade out of them all per ability. At the beginning you have only 3 heroes and unlock the others through time; the better you play the faster you unlock them all - i unlocked them all by 3rd hour or something like that. Heroes are specific and cool, some harder to play than others but in general i would say they are quite balanced. It's the team composition that matters the most. Some people are deflected of the game by its cartoonish look but I dont mind that. The biggest feature for me was that even if you die more than the other, soon you will unlock all your abilities - because you use currency (solar) for unlocking abilities unlike other moba games where by less money you have less items or crappy items. Here by less money you just unlock all your tiers a few minutes slower which is not bad, so they balanced the game quite nice and fair. It's the skills and team composition that wins the game in the long run and that is amazing. I managed to overturn a few of the games completely even if i had all my towers/turrets down. My biggest remark goes to sometimes laggy performance and variable ping. All in all - a good decent game to try out for a few hours and get addicted:)","September 5, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
