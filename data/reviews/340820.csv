"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenTomator/recommended/340820/","GreenTomator","GreenTomato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenTomator/","1598 products in account","This is an Edited review, after a patch to the game I have changed it from "not recommended" to "recommended" I will leave the old review in the bottom and label it as such.\n\nNew Review:\nI gave the game a hard time as you can read in the bottom, and my language was a little jarring, but the developers were very professional about it. Commented on the review and made changes to the game (I will not take credit for being the sole driving force behind the changes, but as a user who reviewed the game I feel like my comments as well as other user's comments were heard and taken into consideration when patching the game. So props to the Devs, I'm sure the community appreciates that)\n\nSo I will address the negative things that I pointed out originally and how they've changed.\n- There is display customization now\n- The little cut scenes in every part of the game now can be skipped by pressing "Shift"\n- Hard mode does not have an excessive number of save points, it is suitably hard.\n- The flashes and things are still there, but can now be skipped if you so choose.\n- The Soundtrack to the game has been changed, and it's much better.\n\nThose were all the negative things that bothered me in the game originally, so now that they were fixed, I can focus more on the things that I did like in the game; Like the controls, the responsiveness, the art style, and the puzzle progression.\n\nI definitely like this game after the patch, it was a big improvement in my opinion, and I really appreciate the patience the Developers showed when reading my negative review, and their response to the comments steam users had about the game.\n\nThe game now deserves a 7.5/10  and the developer's attitute towards their product and consumers is a 10/10.\n\n\n******Old Review********\nPros.\n- This game is cute, I like the art, I like the baddies, the environment, the general look of the game and all charming but completely pointless critters all over the place.\n- The controls are easy, and the game is simple enough to pick up.\n- The puzzles are easy.\n- Has steam trading cards.\n\nCons.\n- Not enough customization when it comes to display, controls, sound etc.\n- There's a lot, and I do mean a lot of annoying little things in the game, like those loading screens you can't skip, every time you go into a dungeon or whatever where the camera is slowly running over the room. It's fine once in a while, but you have to watch it every time you're restarting the place because you died or whatever.\nAnd that annoying little purple thing that accompanies you everywhere is extremely annoying, but it's admitted to it, so I suppose it's ok...\n- The Devs were too afraid the game would get tough so they placed save points every 3 inches.\n- The unnecessary lights and visual assaults you get during the game, like flashing screens, random stars. could give you a headache, whether you are prone to seizures or not, it will affect you.\n- The music, and I cannot stress this enough, the music is so annoying it is enough to drive anyone up the wall if they listen to it long enough. It's as if it was purposefully made that way, there is no way anyone thought that soundtrack fits the visuals or would be liked by anyone.\n- And last but not least; price tag, when you place this game next to other steam games for 13$, it should blush crimson then run off and hide.\n\nFinal score: 5/10 I'd give it much higher if some of the annoying things in the game were removed, it would have gotten an easy 7.5. I do not recommend this game, especially not at 13$, that's a ridiculous price.","May 29, 2015","true","1.1"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","9"

It exemplifies the open world puzzle-platformer style game and integrates in a very cheerful graphics style. The core of the gameplay is exploring around the world and collecting items whether to open doors, complete quests, or return the stability of the world. Many of the items require puzzles to be solved, some of which are manuvering a block to the exit of a little maze, some of which involved the physical objects in the rooms, and others that require decyphering of clues left around. There is a lot of platforming (as should be expected in a platformer), some of which takes a good many tries. The game reminded me of Fez (another game I loved) but with puzzles that were actually possible to solve without guides. Another benefit of the the game is that the dev is extremely friendly and responds quickly, fixing issues and making changes to the game.\n\nThere were a few minor things that took away from the experience though. I had some issues starting up the game, and with the game slowing under certain circumtances (these issues were quickly addressed by the dev). Occasionally I would jump near the edge of a block and it wouldn't render the jump, so the controls weren't entirely tight. However, if you enjoy the puzzle-platforming genre do yourself a favor and pick this one up. You'll enjoy it.","September 5, 2015","true","13.5"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","15","24","3","0"

Can't find a given item? Just take a stroll in another section of the world, then come back later with a fresh idea, or maybe a new power-up and there you have it. Which isn't to say it's always easy, because the difficulty of the platforming ramps up in the latter sections, as well as in a bonus mini-game.\n\nNot everything is pefect, of course. The common downside of being done all by a single jack-of-all-trades developer is that it's a bit rough around the edges. But the end product is what matters, and it's a very satisfying adventure. All in all, the game is a gem in the rough for fans of exploration-based puzzle platformers.","July 30, 2015","true","6.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

However, that's because I played the game a lot more in beta than before it got on Steam. With that cleared up... I'll go with a simple pro/con method.\n\nPros:\n- Very large game, you'll honestly be busy and entertained for hours as there will always be something new to  explore.\n- Graphically pleasing. The game looks gorgeous everywhere and you'll see plenty of smaller elements that you don't usually see is games such as small animals in their own environment. These don't affect gameplay, but they're really nice to see once you've noticed them.\n- The puzzles are innovative and challenging, which will keep you on your toes if you're into brain-work (I am).\n- The game has three levels of difficulty: normal, hard and rage mode. I've played through--not beaten--all of them and they're rather balanced and give you what you'd expect for their difficulty level. On normal hte game isn't too easy or too difficult, just as it should be.\n\nCons:\n- Joy2Key. I'm used to setting up Joy2Key for games that don't support joysticks, however this shouldn't have been packaged with the game if the game doesn't natively support joy functionality. However, this shouldn't be opening on the game's startup.\n- Resolutions. My native resolution isn't supported, close but not quite, which isn't entirely an issue since I play in windowed mode.\n\nMy overall score is 8/10. I highly recommend this game. If you don't like things like Joy2Key you can always disable it.","August 12, 2015","true","0.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","6"

Not to mention the controls are very simple and easy to use.\nThe average playthrough for a new person playing this game is about 15 hours so you'll have plenty to enjoy this game.\nIf anything, the puzzles are indeed amazing. These puzzles trick your mind, all of them are very good, and some even trick your mind into thinking you don't know the answer, yet it's right in front of you and you don't realize it.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nMusic: 8/10\nGraphics: 10/10\n\nFinal score; 8.5/10. In terms of comparing Yelaxot however to the majority of other new indies, this excels in being 10/10. I enjoyed this game and if you want to play a REALLY unique Indie game, I recommend Yelaxot. You'll have fun.\n\nNote; Even though it says 0.2 hours have been played I've beaten it before from Desura, so please do not be confused.\n\nOh by the way, to the people who saying the double jump isn't working, it's the same as in the majority of any other platformers, including Super Mario Bros. If you fall off a ledge then you only have 1 jump. If you jump off the ledge then jump again you'll have two. It works the same in the popular game SSBB4, if you go off the ledge then you'll only have one jump.","January 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","12","24","0","0"

No JoyToKey is a fine piece of software I'm sure, but this arrangement strikes me as rather lazy honestly.\n\nWorse it doesn't seem work for me.\n\nBehind the JoyToKey window, and a browser window that J2K opened to it's own homepage (really?)
