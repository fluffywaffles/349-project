The problem is that after about an hour, the game plateaus. You're doing the same things over and over again, and there's no end game or advancement past a certain point.\n\nSo why did I log three hours, making it impossible to get a refund for the game?\n\nBecause I stupidly kept going for two hours trying to see if eventually anything would change, only to discover after three hours that nothing did. The years progressed, but the tasks (drag canvas here, drag painter there) never varied or progressed in any meaningful way. I maxed out a few painters, then they died and the process started over again maxing out their most skillful apprentices. Repeat ad nauseum. I made it up to the late 1500s before throwing in the towel.\n\nThe housing decoration might be something to work towards, but all the housing stuff has stats, so if you want to max your stats you'll just end up with the same room pattern repeated over and over with some different furniture. Similarly, the furniture has stats, so there's little point in buying anything but the nicest stuff, unless you're some kind of gaming masochist.\n\nI guess the main problem is that there is no meaningful progression in this game. It's got one, maybe two hours of decent playtime in it before the repetition becomes too dull and tedious to continue. (Two hours is pretty generous, I think.)\n\nThe art style is gorgeous, and it's fun to see the little pixel masterpieces, but they vanish quickly. A gallery of paintings you've unlocked over various playthroughs would be a great way to showcase all the work that went into those little pixel gems and give the overarching gameplay some purpose. Even just making it possible to buy blank canvases to make paintings purely for decoration rather than at a patron's request would be nice. Then you could hang your favorite masterpieces in your guild home. Just *something* to add value to the game's price tag, which is a bit high for the current content.\n\nI hope that the game might be improved upon in future updates. I don't know if it will, but it would certainly be worth revisiting in the future if the dev is active and updates are planned.","September 1, 2015","false","3.4"," 291 of 325 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","291","325","3","10"

Playing and installing it was easy and simple, it runs on almost nothing. Before playing it I knew nothing of the flash games and beta builds, I bought it on the art relationship alone. I'm not a real big gamer.\n\nThe game is probably not worth the price it is pushing now, I would dump it into the under $5 category. After about two hours I had pretty much capped out the usability of the game and it just turns into a repetitive task exercise of 1) resting the artist 2) taking an order 3) placing an artist  on a travel roster/canvas slot. There is really not much to it, on maxing out your artists or training new ones.\n\nHowever, the game does use actual art movements and terms and features potential pupils all the way up through the 1620s. The pixel paintings depict actual works of art from the time period and are very on point. Decorations are limited but they're really the only goal you shoot for. I was attached to my first few artists when they died, but after that it becomes less fun and more of a drag. I'll probably play this every now and again but it was definitely not worth the price I paid. New features should of been added for Steam like relationships or allowing your artists to do other tasks that actually affect the core gameplay outside the monotone cycle.","September 5, 2015","false","6.4"," 123 of 172 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","123","172","5","0"

I'd like to see it move at a slightly slower pace over a shorter time period, some more personality in the painters, and some higher stakes for the decisions you make. Once you learn the mechanics it's very easy to have a stable of 4-5 painters at 100 skill (and a full back-burner of apprentices to fill the ranks) churning through everything that comes their way, and money ceases to be a problem. The random events don't add much challenge or offer any interesting choices, and I never saw much reason to take on grand works, since you don't lose prestige for turning them down. Here are some things I think could turn this into a great game:\n\n- Slow the pace a bit\n- Make great works higher stakes (lose prestige when you turn them down, but gain a lot when you complete them)\n- More interactivity between painters (rivalries or conflicting personalities?)\n- Make events more interesting (opportunity to gain lots of prestige / money at great risk, rival houses trying to poach your painters, painting in a certain style becomes ridiculously lucrative or punishing, etc.)\n- Greater quantity and more diverse items\n- Copies of prestige items should grant diminishing returns (beacuse a house chock-a-block with statues looks silly)","November 6, 2015","false","9.6"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","0"

There are a few random events in game that add aspects of uncertainy; illnesses can spread, homosexual guild members might be attacked or, you might be asked to pay of a gambling debt or two.\n\nThese random events can be fairly impactful during the beginning of the game, but once you have a larger guild the minor events become negligible, as you'll have enough florins and people to quickly hire and retrain new master artists.\n\nHowever, after you've added your third/forth building and have 100+ prestige the game doesn't offer much else, at 100 prestige it seems you've hit the max level of rich customers and going over that is just to provide a buffer from prestige loss if you have all your artists out on a larger project.\n\nAll in all its a neat little casual game.

Right now, it feels like a really well polished Beta game, with all the trimings but lacking that last bounty of extra content and final features.\n\nThe game tries (and succeeds) to be like the 'Tycoon' games of yore, but whereas those got harder and deeper as the game went on, this just stays the same. There's no extra challenge, all you can do is expand your guild for the sake of expanding, and have more adorable characters just because you can.\n\nThe furniture is a nice touch but there's not nearly enough of it, and it'd be nice for the whole 'homosexual' mechanic to have something beyond just the random chance of a death penatly. Maybe other artists could become each others' romantic muses or the like? Leading to increased stats but higher risk of being found out?\n\nRight now, the fundaments of this game are brilliant, but it didn't have nearly enough content to keep me going for more than a few hours. If the developers make more challenge and cosmetic features (as they seem to be doing) then this really will be a first-rate game! As it stands I still recommend it to people, believing that more content is to come! :D","September 8, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

That is until I started playing Painters Guild, an adorable and addictive Business simulator. You will go from rags to much nicer rags as you begin to expand your colorful empire. Hiring new painters, expanding your shop, and decorating it with all sorts of useful items. The real fun for me in the game is getting the right painters for the right jobs, as taste change and customers demand a style. This is not only tricky but challenging if you only have certain kinds of painters. On top of all that Painters guild is a game that constantly keeps you busy, you won't sit idly by and watch them paint. You must manage your paints, endurance, bills, and most importantly the mastery of your painters skills. Each painter requires training and dedication to see them reach their full potential.

I assume most of the "I'm bored" games tend to be min-maxer power gamers usually.\nMe, I'm a very casual gamer who, if lucky, gets in about 2-3 hours a week of gaming a week ("life" is busy! ;) ).\n\nSo for me it's perfect (so far). The concept is simple, and fun. I don't find it that easy (but as I said, I'm no uber-gamer!). I love how after a while your guys die off, I really felt the first few deaths. Then it was a bit of a struggle to keep up, which is fine for me.\n\nYES, I do see, and agree, that there needs to be more content at some point. Perhaps new/diff furniture which combine different attributes. For example, a bed that makes you heal from being sick much quicker, but you also lose skill point (so you have to choose what's more important!), or different traits (master paint mixer? Dr. skill so sleeping next to a sick person heals them quicker, etc etc...)\n\nI think there ought to be things like factions. So some of the random events could be something along the lines of:\n\nFaction X needs a donation, but if you do, you'll lose favor with faction y which might cause them to raid your shop and disrupt/destroy paintings you're currently working on.\n\nFun stuff like that which require a choice vs consequence decision.\n\nAnyway, great work, I'm glad I paid for it and support you guys, but I do see how things can be better even though I love it so far.\n:)","September 7, 2015","true","8.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am having so much fun with this game. The core mechanics of a management game work very well and will make sure you're always on the edge of your seat and careful.

If you can get it at a lowered price it's worth it, given that you like games in that spectrum at all of course.\nFor such a small game in retro pixel graphic style it's rather complex. You can change the look of your painters to your liking with a dresser, you can decorate & furnish the rooms which increases the comfort for the painters, improves their skilling options & elevates the prestige of the guild, which then attracts richer clients. The painters you hire have a quite complex personality as well, there are two traits, both painting related which make the painter either faster painting, quicker skilling, healthier, easier to get into trouble & prison, painting more beautifully or changing quicker the initial painting style ... Besides of painting at the easels painters can also work outside the guild on murals, which pays better but is strenous enough to even kill your painters. There are three options to hire new painters, from cheapest & immediately arriving to most expensive & requiring some time for the painter to arrive & you're also able to hire some of the greatest painters of that time like Leonardo daVinci & Michelangelo Buonarotti. You hire the painters at a very young age, often as teenagers, after having some training at the guild they go on a journey, come back & skill further, can become a master painter, become even more skilled, age, get gray hair, become ill & die. In that respect it is quite a depressing game, the time is flowing, the masters which you trained & nurtured over the in game years are just gone one day & your guild is left without them & may not be able to provide paintings anymore of similiar quality, unpaid apprentices may even leave the guild & you will be left with the remaining handful of journeymen.\n\nI noticed only one bug so far. Sometimes the easel with the painting gets stuck somewhere, making all clicks irresponsive. Though i was able to come out of that bug without loosing the progress, it's still unnerving.\n\nOverall highly recommended.","May 16","true","48.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I'm a big fan of management games and simulators. This one looked pretty cool, so I went for it.\n\nAfter playing for 4½ hours, I've seen everything this game has to offer.\n\nIt's not a big game, or a complex game, and there isn't much depth to it..\n\nHonestly, spending 4½ hours with it might be longer than you'd want to. The systems get very repetitive, and I have a hard time putting a finger on what made me keep playing.\n\nI guess it's very soothing. The soundtrack is very nice, the artstyle is cool, and I like the way the paintings look in the 8-bit artstyle.\n\nSpending 8-10€ on it now is probably too much for you. You probably won't get more than 3 hours out of it before you get seriously bored, but it's a cool idea, and it's almost well executed. I just wish there were more things to do in the game.\n\nAs it is, you just assign painters to painting that you get hired to do. Then you train them, and make paint for the paintings... You just swap the painters around and you do an ungodly amount of clicking and dragging.\n\n\nI sound negative, but all in all, i don't really regret buying it. I enjoyed my time, but I'd recommend not buying it at full price. €5 seems about right, and that's when you don't consider that you could get games like Tomb Raider and The Witcher 2 for less on sale...\n\nBut like I said, the concept is cool, and the music is actually really really good. It's just a shame that it is as shallow as it is.\n\nSo yeah. €5 or less? sure, why not, if you need to burn a few hours (and I really do mean a few..)","September 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yet I cant recommend it.\n\nThe game itself is pretty shallow, grindy and the end absolutle unsatisfying. You just play until you reach 1620 and then ... "here is your highscore you can stop playing now... or go on ... we dont care".\n\nThe game itself is pretty shallow as well. You just organize your painters meaning 99% of the time you will simply be rotating them from the sofa/bed to the paintings or to the current training items. The idea of training your painters in different styles and "go with fashion" is interesting enough, only that this mechanic does not work. It takes a painter way to long to change his style and it does not give you that much of a benefit (20% more gold). In the time it takes to change the painting style he could have finished 2-3 paintings and thus earning way more gold than the current style bonus... especially as this changes often faster than the painter can learn new styles.\n\nOther than that there is next to no decision makeing on your part. Furniture? Buy the best your money allows. Painters? Train to 100 skill and swap them between paintings and sofas. Great works (like painting a cathedral) are a nice idea but the mechanic is utterly broken as well. Why? Those works have a top payout of 250 gold and can take 3-6 of your painters away for up to 1 in game year. As a comparison. A single painting worked on for 3 months with 2 painters will net you the nearly same ammount of gold. And the reputation hits you take for turning away customers while doing a great work is not even nearly compensated by the reputation gained from doing the great work.\n\nSo in the end the game has some interesting concepts but they all suffer from unbalanced (not broken) mechanics that simply makes those concepts unfun to engage with because they actively punish the player for engaging.\n\nThe most effective way of playing is to only spend time and effort on finishing paintings and training painters.\n\nI spend 8 hours with the game and that will probably all the time of my life I spend playing it.\n\nIs that worth the 9,99€ asked price? Hell no. I couldnt even recommend getting this at a 50% sale. There is just to litle fun to be had here. There is no strategy no clever thinking required, all there is to do is grind grind grind until you reach a boring highscore message.\n\nSorry guys. The only thing nice to say I have for this game, is that it´s got a nice atmosphere.

By Game Year 1520, I had established a successful guild with 9 solid painters (the maximum allowed). The "hard," flavorful part of the game was over at that point. For the next 100 years, it was autopilot as the game offered no new challenges, no new rewards, and it drastically reduced the number of historical events mentioned.\n\nUnlike other management games (Grand Prix Story, Game Dev Tycoon, etc.), there doesn't seem to be any replay value. The different bonuses for the different cities are not very impactful after about a half hour of play. Nothing unlocks after a playthrough. The game doesn't offer different paths to explore. There really aren't any decisions or choices to make.\n\nThe one part of the game I did not explore was hiring the famous artists that we know today such as Botticelli or Rafael. I have no reason to believe, however, that hiring them open new stories. I suspect that they are simply excellent painters – and I had too many of those.","September 4, 2015","false","12.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The options menu is very simplistic, with only the option of full screen or windows mode.  This game walks a fine line in it's methodology of progression. It is entertaining to a point, but once you hit that plateau then it becomes repetitive nonsense with heavy taxation on your resources. If this game is on sale, I would recommend it, but because this game has no true feeling of becoming a legendary artist, only the continuous climb and burden of ownership, management or taxation on your character, there is no feeling of relief or pride in your accomplishment.\n\nIt is a time management game, where you accept contracts to create paintings, and have to manage rest for your character, keeping your supplies stocked, and the prestige of your studio. Prestige is the means to lure in higher paying clients- improved by putting out higher quality work, and finishing contracts, as well as improving your home base. You have the capability to hire more people, who have various strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe game is very management oriented, where you build and expand a base, utilize your hired units to ensure growth of the company, and attract higher quality clients that will pay more. In between 30-60 minutes of play, you will reach a plateau in the game, where there are is nothing else to unlock, no more variables that occur. As you build your base larger, the tasks become repetitive. It's a click and drag mentality, the same tasks over and over again.\n\nThere is an occasional special project, such as a cathedral, but I've found that the time it takes to complete this task and the numberof people it takes can be more detrimental to your business than not. Most times it's easier to focus on the painting and building aspect rather than focusing on the prestige or special projects.\n\nAs you grow larger and become more engulfed into the world, and your prestige  gets higher, you will attract customers with specific requests. This can be potentially disastrous, as it takes years for your characters to get to master status in any one style of artwork and your painters do die throughout the game. If you can't handle the continuous instream, you can end up watching everything you've worked so hard for crumble rapidly in front of you. Artistically this might fall right into the story of an artist, but gameplay wise it doesn't work, for you art does not live on.\n\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","October 1, 2015","false","3.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Also as time progressed the style trend changed, plus you'd have to train young artists and raise older ones to masters, and seeing younger ones surpassed masters is always cool thing, the pace gets fasters as requests keep coming, so this game isn't really shallow with just draw-rest-die cycle.\nEven so, it's a game about 'painters', what'd you expect more from it?\n\nI feel the game is a bit easier since update and as devs mentioned at launch they made the game for historical accracy in terms of stories and difficulty, wish later updates could add another difficulty option as devs were going for.","September 9, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A traditional painting themed game is unique thats for sure... but the content is not as much as it could be... if the devs start updating with new content this would be an outstanding game. the sim and managment mechanics are fun as heck and the game mechanics for this genre are simple yet geniously well crafted. the engine could do with some tweeking and upgrading though... good game for its price and definitely worth a shot.","June 4","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It kinda did\n\nIt wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but since it was made by one person, it's pretty good. There's a couple of bugs that they know about, for example, you can't name your character or guild while being in fullscreen mode, which is a silly little bug that isn't that bad and I haven't come across any other bugs, yet they haven't updated this game even with bug fixes since September 2015.\n\nIt doesn't look like they will be updating this anymore, but with it's current state, I think it should be in Early Access on steam, and also think that the price tag is perfect for it.\n\nBrilliant game, but I wish they would updating it a bit.\n\nIf you want to see gameplay, check out my YouTube channel with the link below!
