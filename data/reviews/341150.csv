Your main melee units can't be controlled.  They just swing randomly at the nearest dude, which is almost always not who you want them to attack.  Your units can only move in straight lines, so attempting to get more than one guy on the same target is a chore.  Your units permanently die, which is kind of neat, but you don't have any method of healing them, so its really up to the random number generator instead of any sort of tactical play that determines if you preserve your guys.  The maps have random areas where you simply can't walk, for no apparent reason, that is very difficult to notice, so your flanking maneuvers are further frustrated by magical impassive terrain.\n\nAlso, the writing is bad and plot flimsy.  The graphics are about twenty years out of date, which I knew going into the game, but still disappointing.  The background noise often sounds like someone chewing for some reason, which is kind of gross to listen to on a 10 second repeat loop.\n\nI've requested a refund.  It's not worth the $4.","October 11, 2015","false","2.0"," 66 of 90 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","66","90","3","3"

It's no match for an experienced strategist, but makes the game fairly enjoyable.\n- Your units gather XP which allows you to improve them.\n- Heroes can also find and equip items to improve their stats\n- The developer is very active on the forums, and will spend time fixing any bugs that are found.\n- As the name suggests, the campaigns are from the perspective of the evil factions.\n- Completing both campaigns takes around 30 hours in total.\n\nCons:\n- The weak point of the game is really the graphics, as can be seen in the screenshots.  However, it is an indie developer, and the game is around $10.  It's no worse than those 8-bit games that are becoming so popular again.\n- The writing can sometimes be a bit amateur-ish.  But the overall story are fairly interesting (if generic fantasy stuff).\n- MP is currently only via connect by IP (although the developer is working on changing that!)","April 4, 2015","true","28.6"," 41 of 59 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","41","59","4","0"

He buffed giant spiders and nerfed Remove Chaos Magic.\n\nThe GoodThe best thing about the game is, (without abusing summoners) it's challenging enough without making you sick. In fact, with the right tactics you can beat a battle with 0 casualty. Luck factors do exist, but can be solved with a few SLs. I've done both campaigns I've not lost one single unit yet (except for Goblin Kamikazes and summoned creatures).\n\nThe BadThe game is amazing aside from a few minor grammatical mistakes that sometimes annoy me, even though my English is really orcish. Me no anglais!\nBattles are well desined and **CAN BE** challenging...\nIf you choose not to use summoners (devil campaign). After I've had Remove Chaos Magic perk for all my four summoners, all I need to do is keep summoning friends... no, fiends.\nOrc campaign is comparatively harder, but clever use of Goblin Catchers can easily turn the table.\nSome creatures seem rather useless. I mean, who would use Giant Spider when Kara gets Berserker for free?\nCampaigns are relatively short. In less than 14 hours I beat both campaigns with every possible choice.\n\nThe UglyGraphics? But for a game of such fun, who needs next-gen graphics?\n\nAll in all, your game is on the right path. I think. -- not Raphael\nNo, it's not only that, it's amazing. It worth every penny of it and the dev is very responsive and friendly.

You must choose carefully when and where to move units on the battlefield and try to keep them grouped together to be sucessful.  The enemy AI is quick to pick off that lone wolf in your army marching ahead of the crowd.  No leading the way with mages and archers unless of course you WANT them to die.  The mages are the most fun to play with all the different spells they offer but you dont want to get them anywhere near the front lines.  You will be forced to shield them with cheap melee units as most battles will have enemies comming from different directions.  Oh and the AI knows this, they will come after your frail units and even knows to move its ranged units away from the front lines.  The AI is competent in this game and will offer you a challenge.\n\nGraphicly this game is not going to blow you away, but its not supposed to.  Its uses overhead 2D graphics system, which is pretty much the only downside to the game.  Its just a bit bland in that department and you can see that pretty easily from the screenshots. The game shines elsewhere and it shows in its balance and depth of strategy.\n\nThe sound effects and voice acting are basic, but the music is pretty darn good.\n\nThere are two campains with a dozen or so missions each.  The story is fairly long delivered via text between battles.\nYour units (if they survive battles) can gain experience and level up or upgrade.  If they do die you can hire new units between battles.  This type of game isnt for everyone but true strategy fans will certainly have plenty to sink their teeth into.","March 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","34","53","4","0"

This game is heavily story driven You have a choice of two campaigns with two different roles you can assume. There is a lot of text in between the battles.  The text gives meaning to what you are doing next. It's not the best looking game, but the writing fills in the gaps that aren't there visually. That being said, the tactics side of the game is pretty strong. The men that survive the battles gets stronger and are better suited for the battles ahead. It lacks some polish that a big studio would have had, but there's some meat there. if you enjoy tactics that are heavily story driven, you can't over look this.","April 1","true","3.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

It has some RPG elements and a unifying story for each campaign, along with the occasional text adventure-like choice to make. The battle system is strong and well balanced. The game is not hex-based and allows for free movement. It takes a bit to get used to how you can effectively use melee units to block access to your ranged/spellcaster units, but once you get the hang of it, it is a thing of beauty.\n\nAs a single-player game I found it a bit short; I finished the campaign in about 15 hours on Normal. I would have liked to see more content; I enjoyed each aspect of the game (the battles, the ongoing campaign, text choices, unit recruitment and development, building up my heroes with items and such) but felt that I really wanted to see more of each. The concept and elements came together well, but I was left wanting more. I bought it on a Steam sale and was very pleasantly surprised with it. Enough so that I went back and purchased the first AoF (which is being updated along with AoF2) at full price.\n\nAnother reason I feel that this game is worth purchasing is the dedication of the developers. Upon posting in the hardly-used steam discussion group about a problem with the game, I was contacted within hours about my issue. The lead developer had a patch up on Steam to address my issue within an hour of getting further information from me. He then sent me an extra copy of the game to give to a friend for my trouble. They clearly are dedicated to constantly improving the game and making players happy. That kind of customer service is rare in this industry.","May 7","true","14.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

First off, the game is clunky and doesn't look great.  The story, while well-written, is a wall of text and the tutorial is barely there causing me some early confusion (I didn't realize my soldiers had the Beserk trait and automatically spend their action to attack nearby enemies). Finally, the game is old-school random that can be frustrating (An early battle has 2 enemy groups that should weaken one another before facing you. But due to bad luck one steamrolled the other and then crush me.)\n\nBut despite the complaints I am having alot fun. The hex-less battles create some really cool tactical thinking. Positioning matters both to protect your troops and leave room for them to manuever past one another. The AI can be a jerk because it will  circle around and target your weak troops if possible. This becomes more important because surviving troops can gain levels and you'll want to keep everyone alive.\n\nIf you can get past the flaws, there's a really good game here.","April 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","18","32","6","0"

Aside from that AoF2 is a more well rounded game for several reasons. Firstly, you have choices at various points that break up the pure linearity of the first game and this makes the player feel more active in the story. I was a little disappointed to see that the nice background artwork from the first game was replaced by digitised images but this really doesn't detract from the game in any way other than some minor aesthetics. I assume this is purely down to production cost and time constraints. Units are more balanced and interesting and the two new campaigns offer both very different story and subtle but important changes to gameplay. As before the game is fun to play and certainly nothing has been lost that would be sorely missed. Overall the improvements don't make a radically different game but they add up enough to have changed my review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. Once again this does not mean The Undead King isn't worth the time of the right person - just that in my opinion this is the better of the two games and I, therefore, recommend it to anyone who likes turn based strategy.\n\n*edit* recent updates have improved the game further.","January 6","true","11.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They are active in the steam forums and answer questions and listen to your recommandations and critics. Now you have even the chance to give them input, what you would like to see in Age of Fear 3.\n\nAbout the game itself:\nThe fights are challenging and sometimes quite hard if you play on Experienced- or Master-Difficulty. Even experienced turn-based players should try and easiest mode first, because some of the mechanics need some experience to really understand them or at least very good reading of the tutorial informations given. Keeping your units alive is probably the most important about this game, to evolve them in the way you wish them to be. Also you should keep an eye on wich units get the exp, to speed up leveling of specific units.\n\nYes, the story is textwalled, but I enjoyed to read those and I liked how the storyline evolved, at least the one I played through so far. There are even slight possibilities to chose wich arc of story line you wish to follow. If they even could change the ending, I can't tell so far, but I don't think so. But they offer you different battles and items and perhaps even special units.\n\nIf you play, you should be aware, some of those fights you have to lose. So if an opponent looks far stronger than you, don't get frustrated and give up. Your loss has to be then probably and offers perhaps some new units, you couldn't get your hands on otherwise.\n\nAnd yes, the graphics aren't the best of the best, but they aren't the important stuff. The combat is important and the AI is well programmed and lets you suffer, if you don't plan your actions well. So if you like a challenging old school game support these indies.\n\nP. S.: And no, you don't really play only evil ones. Yes, you can play an orcish story line (wich I can't argue about much so far) and a demon story line, but the demon is far from pure evil but selfish and manipulative for sure. ;)","April 11, 2015","true","17.5"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","12","26","3","0"

I have to admit that I was looking for a game that would run on this machine and still catch my attention. To start of with: I found it in this product.\n\nWhat I DO like about the game:\n+Interesting and mostly balanced units\n+Allows to win with a variety of strategies\n+Unconventional missions (games that you can not win ;-) )\n+Leveling units is highly motivating\n+Well-written story including some interactive choices\n+Last but not least: graphics are functional and allow to play the game on low-performance systems\n\nWhat I DO NOT like about the game:\n-Just three words: TOO LITTLE CONTENT\n-> I finished the first campaign in under 5 hours, and think the next one will not take much longer. Considering the fact that this is an indie game, and taking into account that the graphics are very basic, I just EXPECT more content. So I really urge the devs to release more maps for free (custom maps? 3rd campaign? Map builder so we can see some fan-made content in the future?).\n\nPutting it all in a nutshell:\nI enjoy the game a lot, but the limited content is a real drawback.

Set in a fantasy realm (Who would have guessed given the title), it is a rather classical experience of recruiting/evolving your units on a seperate screen and sending them into fight after fight. Think of the Tactics Ogre series or FF Tactics. Between the fights there are usually two pages of story which sometimes features minor decisions.\n\nWhile the story is absolutely allright, it is far from being innovative. The decisions usually mean that you have to choose between "picking an optional fight for reward" or "moving on". Still, it adds some fluff to the campaign.\n\nThe main feature of the game is the connection of tactic combat and evolving your units. Here the game holds up well, allowing different tactics to succeed, although those that do not put your units at risk (summons!) tend to be a lot easier than the more direct approaches.\n\nThe game is based on Java, which led to some stuttering on my PC in big fights, but I never encountered any bugs. While the backgrounds are quite boring, most of the units are nicely designed and the effects of spells are absolutely adequate.\n\nSo, all in all, I can absolutely recommend this game.  In a sale für 2,50€ it is definitely worth every cent.\nI consider the regular price to be a bit too high, as the two campaigns are a bit short. But then again, some AAA-titles offer less and charge 50€, so it is up to you. Besides, you support a very active team of indie developers with your money. The designer is very close to the community, answering every thread and asking for opinions all day long. There are also regulary updates, often twice per week which add new ideas.","November 29, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","3"

I love upgrading troops, trying to keep them alive on the battlefield, and working the same scenario multiple times to get my tactics just right. I am not particularly put off by lack of animation, sound, or character driven story. I was very excited to try out new units and evole current ones.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat number generator is broken. I can't tell you how many 90% attacks I missed, though I can tell you that I missed enough to stop playing the game. Any percentage over 50% seems to actually have a hit percentage 20% lower than advertised. I started calculating my hit percentages by reducing anything over 50% by 20% to find what % I actually might hit.\n\nI get it, someone statistically might really miss the first ten 90% chances to hit. But I feel I played enough to get a real feel for the RNG and it is not right. The concept of 1HP/hit with stronger attacks simply translating to greater hit percentages is not my first choice of hit solutions, but I am willing to work with it for the chance to experience upgraded units and build my strategic force as long as I feel the RNG is fair. I feel like I have a handicap, however, every time I initiate an atttack over 50%. (playing as Orcs, btw)\n\nI have to step away from the game for now, but I intend to try the game again in a few weeks or a month or two. I hope my "luck" or the RNG changes and I can enjoy this game.
