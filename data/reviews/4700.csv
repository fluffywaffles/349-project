"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeersXII/recommended/4700/","VeersXII","Veers XII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeersXII/","135 products in account","So I dug this game out of my library and have been playing it a lot recently.\n\nStarted up a game as England because why not.\n\nI take over Whales and what's left of England. Then I start my war with Scotland. It goes as well as can be expected they have two cities I have...lots. It ends pretty fast. However just before Great Britan becomes unified I am excommunicated from the church. No matter William the Fatty dies soon enough and I am back in. I then set out on my duty like any good Catholic Lord does and Chritianize this land I have taken.\n\nEverything is going well. Our cities are growing in England, and on mainland Europe we managed to take over Brittany and Belgium and Holland. With this new base of man power I believe it is time to bring the word of Christ to the lands of the heretics in the east!\n\nHowever just as I am about ready to go on the Crusade, France decides I am too threatening to them and declares war on me. No matter English dreams can wait, we will just have to take over this damned country first.\n\nThe war progresses quickly. France is overwhelmed by the veteran soldiers of the English army, mostly consisting of militia, but they are English Militia so they get the job done.\n\nWe take over Western France and push farther into French homeland, we even take Paris. Just when the war seems to be wrapping up the French call in the Milanese to help them. I never liked Milan and it never surprises me when they declare war. Soon enough the English standard is flying over Metz and Dijon and all that is left is Marseille and Milan's Italian holdings, they will fall soon enough.\n\nHowever on my march to South France I accidentally declare war on Portugal when they came to the aid of France in a battle. It is only small little Portugal and their Iberian holdings will be great for bringing the Sign Of The Cross to the Moors....someday.\n\nBut alas. It seems England became to big for its breeches. The Not-Holy-Nor-Roman-And-Certainly-Not-An-Empire Holy Roman Empire declares war. UGH. This is going to take much longer than expected. And to make matters worse it seems at some point I was removed from the Church.  I only notice because apparently a Crusade was called On Toulouse, which I own.\n\nWhether I am now the Anti-Christ or not I was still English and I wasn't about to let some European trash walk into my realm and take it. So I fortify my holdings and wait for the coming storm of armies. In quick succession France, Milan, HRE, Portugal, Hungry and Spain join the Crusade. Not good.\n\nHaving lost a king and a large handful of family members in the war so far I needed to be careful. So instead of invading their lands I let them come to me. Quick enough three armies are outside my stronghold outbumering me 2:3 (I had reinforced with an army made of entire cavalry).\n\nFirst up is Spain. I let them wait outside and build up siege equipment. Then they attack. It is over before it starts, since apparently Spaniards are made up of weak soldiers who don't even know how to hold a spear properly. Defeating them with minimal losses I turn my gase to the next foe, Hungry.\n\nThey put up a better fight than the Spanish but they too are not match for English bravery, and are soon defeated and sent home to Eastern Europe to have their silly fights with the Poles and Rus'.\n\nThe last army to face is the Germans. However I am seriously lacking in soldiers defending Toulouse and have to attack with my Cavalry army. Though at the start of the battle my general warns me that their army is made up of many spears, they have studied me well and it seems that only they will put up a good fight, it truly is time for brave hearts and brave deeds.\n\nEngland has the high ground on the battlefield and we swarm over them like a hoard of.....well angry English. The battle is over disappointingly fast. Their army is in retreat, it seems that even their emperor came to the battle but he too flees from the field like a woman. Our Light Cavalry, those dashing fellows they, catch up to him before he knows what happens and is my prisoner.\n\nI demand a ransom but he "claims" he doesn't have the money something about the international jewery shafting his economy. Nonsense. If he can't pay with his Florins then he will pay WITH HIS HEAD!\n\nMaybe executing the German Emperor wasn't the best idea but no matter, there is still a war to be won. I defeat the French, Portugese, and Milanese Crusading Armies in time and even branch out into Iberia and across the Rhine. Somewhat expectedly the Pope dies and a new one is elected, not much of a surprise he is Italian, and he hates me. But I still have dreams of one day reclaiming the Holy Land in the Name of Our Lord and Savior. So I send an assassin to kill the Pope. The first one fails but the next one doesn't and the Pope dies soon enough.\n\nDisappointingly the next one is German, well that can't be so he dies as well. The next is Polish. Well I don't have any problems with Poland so he can live, for now. He even allows me to return to the Church, I think things might be turning around. But when I go to defend my homeland against...someone it is all a blur by now, I am excomunicated again, what a disappointment I had high hopes for this new Pope but it seems he will go the same route as the last.\n\nHowever my greatest assassin, Christopher the Christian Killer fails me, not only does he fail me he gets himself killed and I am now at war with all of Christendom. With my last King dying from "mysterious causes", and most of my armies heavily wounded from the continuing war, I retreat. Pulling my forces back across all of France seeing all that I had fought so hard to make. Metz, my most recent conquest gone like an instant. Toulouse that I had held out against all odds when I was deemed "An Enemy Of The Faith". Antwerp, where strong soldiers had held out against constant German invasions for over two decades, indeed to was a hard pain to swallow but it had to be done, with the peasantry in open revolt by home from being removed from the Church for so long. I always knew the people would betray me given the chance. So the great armies of victorious England headed home back to farming, waiting, watching for the time when we could once again sail across the Channel and bring the word of Christ to the heathen.","August 21, 2015","true","87.5"," 1,223 of 1,270 people (96%) found this review helpful 886 people found this review funny","96","223","1","886","66"

You picked an empire to control and used diplomacy, force, and cunning to grow. You manage armies, cities, and special units (spys/diplomats) in order to conquor Europe and surrounding areas.\n\nWhat Medieval II: Total War did was took Rome: Total War and made it even better. With the same mechanics and the addition of converting cities to forts and vice-versa the gameplay becomes even better. New units, new Factions, and a new map gave this series a well deserved title.\n\nI myself consider Medieval II: Total War to be the best game in the entire Total War franchise because instead of dumbing down the game (which is becoming rampant in the game industry) they took what they had and improved upon it instead.\n\nI recommend you buy this game if you are an intelligent person who enjoys to plan things out and act upon them with patience and coordination.\n\nThanks for reading.","December 20, 2015","true","61.6"," 224 of 228 people (98%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","98","224","228","13","12"

Stainless Steel and some other unit expansion mods adds some hundreds more.\n\nGraphics are getting old and the good ol' AI is not that splendid. Not even with mods - but this game along with it's older brother in arms Rome Total War got things right on some things that CA persistently cannot reproduce anymore: pure fun, paper rock scissors -type of strategy that enables exciting and interesting meta-campaigns. (who cares about official campaign goals - these games are always more or less open ended).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/783478/recommended/4700/","783478","xDagger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/783478/","14 products in account","TL;DR\nAn overall excellent game that I would highly recommend to anyone.\n\nNow, for the detail. First, I'd like to say that I have played this game for far longer than my steam hours. I played the gold edition disk for about 3 years before adding it to steam. I'd estimate I have something in the 600 realm of hours, 700 if you include steam time.\n\nOn to the actual game. This game is a fantastic and educational experience about the middle ages. Even though some of it is innacurate 95% is correct, and you will most likely learn at least a few things you didn't know. To start with you have the option of 5 different factions, and by destroying other factions you unlock them as playayable. (orrrrrrr, you could just go into the files and change it so you can play as all of them straight away :)\n\nThe campaign map is a well designed and easy to look at part of the overall game, with a clear layout so that you can tell what is going on instantly. The controls and design for building and recruiting are made easy also, and the advisors are helpful to new players. (though annoying for more experienced ones) and you can get involved straight away.\n\nNow for the best part. The battles are an overall incredible experience where you can lead an army into various types of battles; from raiding and capturing a castle to a field war of skill. As you play more, you can win fought out battles that you normally would not be able to or if the odds are stacked against you, and you become a true commander and build your empire.\n\nThe DLC (Kingdoms pack) is actually a very worthwhile DLC, bringing in 4 new campaigns packed with new factions, units and maps, however I would not recommend playing these until you have at least got the hang of the main campaign, as these are far more in depth and you will get more out of them after obtaining a basic level of experience.\n\nTo conclude, this masterpiece is my personal favourite in the series and I'd strongly recommend you play this over any other Total War title. If you are considering it, buy it. If it goes on sale, even better. Buy it as a gift. I'm sure someone will love it.","January 6","true","139.6"," 90 of 91 people (99%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","99","90","91","12","0"

I was not that happy with the game until I learned how to effectively charge knights. In Rome Total War you simply double clicked on what you wanted dead. In Medieval ll  you have to keep your formation in line before attacking. This is accomplished be judging the ground between you and the enemy unit you want to decimate.  When you are at a run with your knights and they are formed up in line hit the attack order (Double click).  Hitting them head on is a must (unless they are pike men then hit them from the back) spearmen don't stand a chance when a formed charge hits them. The diplomacy in  this game is involved and steeped in history. The different agents can help you do things like cement alliances with marriage or steal money from other nations with merchants.  The pope has impact on your decisions when you are a catholic nation. The crusades are very fun and a good mini quest which will help you groom princes to become better kings. The family tree adds a personnel touch which makes you actually care about your generals. The availability of mods also makes this a great game for instance if you get tired of the same old game then you can download something like Stainless steel mod which overhauls the entire game.","November 25, 2013","true","270.4"," 84 of 86 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","84","86","0","3"

What Rome: Total War does, Medieval 2: Total War does better. The first thing  I would like to talk about are the graphics. They have tremendously been enhanced from Rome: Total War, and you don't need much of an upgrade if at all to play this game! Shining plate, and mail armor. A great amount of new units, and weapons. Even improved animations! Unlike Rome: Total War, many of the combat animations of the units have been synced with the enemies attacks and deaths as well. No longer is it a slash at the air and instantly killing the enemy, now it's a fluid stab to the ground that makes you feel like they are actually fighting. One of the features I found quite neat are the types of armor your unit has for their armor rating. Now your unit gets the look of their armor rating! If you have bronze, it is usually padded armor, silver is half-plate (Or mail, depending in unit type), and Gold is full plate (If your unit can be upgraded to gold)! Their weapons however, do not change, or at least I have not seen a difference. Combat is also quite different than Rome: total war. Your units take a second to actually respond to a command which makes more sense to me, and it is also much slower. The campaign map is nearly the same as Rome: Total War except it has some minor changes. Overall, if you like strategy games this is a must have in your library.\n\nToo long didn't read: Feature improvements, better animations, slower combat, new types of armor.

It is a sequel to the previous games, Rome: Total War. This time the game is set on medieval era.\n\nMedieval II: Total War retain many elements of gameplay from Rome: Total War with many enhancement such as the improved religion system and world events like the Christian Crusade or the Islamic Jihad. As a Christian Kingdom you can answer the call of The Pope the conquer the land considered infedel by them. Settlement are now divided into 2 type, a castle and a city. Settlement can be converted between.\n\nGraphics of Medieval II: Total War are improved in many ways from the previous game. Each soldier has a varying number of elements to him, such as arms, legs, body armour, shield heraldry, and so forth. Each element has a varying number of styles. Arrow and fire arrow effects feels more alive. Blood effects has also been introduced, but without gore effects.\n\nMedieval II: Total War is a great sequel of Total War series. Medieval era especially the Crusade era is one of many interesting setting in Total War. With improved graphics, the performance of the game still great, the game runs very optimized.

The mix of battles, diplomacy, family traits and strategy AI create a truly realistic and immersive game that offers an infinate number of choices to your next move, although the turn-based elements often feel oversimplified. It does have a solid real time combat foundation, but the AI is either really good or really bad depending on the difficulty setting. There is no middle ground. If you are new to real time strategy games, this one has a pretty steep learning curve. Even seasoned players may feel overwhelmed.\nOne campaign can take days, even months of play time. However, sometimes the game can become a bit taxing to less motivated players (not that I'm complaining) and the AI during battles can often glitch. Whilst these glitches are mostly minor, they nevertheless break your immerson in the game and can be quite annoying when your soldiers glitch about instead of doing as they're told. Despite all its weaknesses, Med 2 is still a briliantly crafted game, its strategy mixed in with impressive graphics and cinematic music will keep you wound up in the Medieval age for thousands of hours.\n\nIt's one of CA's best (Total War) games. It beats Empire, it beats Napoleon (which was rather a pile of garbage so that wasn't hard) and it beats Shogun2. I still like Medieval 2 better than anything that came after it.","February 25, 2015","true","182.1"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","32","33","2","2"

I was wrong...\n\nIt took me a few weeks to learns how to play, which is fine by me because I like my games to have a little bit of depth to them and this was my first total war (which is bittersweet, because that's like being a virgin and having sex with a pornstar, only to have the rest of your experiences wanting). Anyways, I loaded up the game and started a new campaign as Scotland on very hard difficulty. I managed to conquer the British Isles in the name of Mel Gibson, which was good because my economy was sky rocketing. After a few years in game I had built up five full stacked armies of knights, armoured footmen, and archers. It was time to invade Normandy to liberate France from the HRE. I studied Allied WWII invasion plans for a while before I actually comitted to my attack. So I declared war on the factions inhabiting the Italian penisula and invaded mainland Europe on two fronts. Whilst I was fighting battle after battle, I got Russia to ally with me and attack the countries to the east of HRE. After a while, Russia and I completely obliterated the mainland. However, Russia wanted more land. A few turns later Russia declared war on me and we fought tooth and nail to secure our newly conquered lands. Russia was winning for a while, but then everything changed when the Mongols attack. We were both weak from fighting a mock WWII so the Mongols just steamrolled Russia. I tried to ally with the mighty Khan, but he refused me. In my weakened state, the factions of Iberia declared war on me and invaded the British Isles while the Mogols savaged my holdings in the mainland. Despite my best effort, Spain, Portugal, and the Mongols defeated my glorious empire. In the end, I failed my people, my God, and most importantly Mel Gibson.\n\n11/10 would fight a medieval WWII again.","July 4, 2015","true","406.9"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","87","39","45","38","0"

It's just as competent in battle as Attila's (the most recent TW title) is, and does well in the campaign, too.\n\nThe tactical (battle) part of the game has aged incredibly well, all things considered. The combat mechanics are robust, and abilities are important (though a bit 'busy' in terms of interface, and fire-at-will is not always enabled by default on units that are meant to only fight at range). The asymetry in rosters means that combat can really vary a good deal, yet the balance feels just right.\n\nThe strategic (campaign) part of the game aged less well. It's certainly playable, and it, too, feels balanced yet complex, but I'd be lying if I said the user-interface was all that good. As campaign UI goes, it's somewhat cluttered IMO, though I'd argue it's probably better than N:TW's was.\n\nIn technical stuff, it's really, really stable, something that inexplicably was not the case in Empire and N:TW... in those games, I seemed to get sound glitches on the campaign screen, crash during battles, and so forth pretty much every campaign, forcing constant saving to be ready. Here, though, the game never seems to glitch up or break down.\n\nIn artistic stuff, the game does quite well. For the era it was made in, the unit cards are good, and the unit models are surprisingly detailed when you zoom all the way in. The music is great, too. And the voice-over is, as always, the one mixed-bag (aside from the campaign UI, which was mentioned above). Voice-over work is terrible for units, but acceptable for in-game advisor and narration of pre-battle stuff (in historical battles, etc.).\n\nOverall, is it worth it for $20.00? Well, without mods I could see arguements that $20.00 is too high... but bear in mind how long the game has existed and how many people made mods for it, and it becomes evident that there will be plenty of mods to wade through and try.\n\nSo, I marginally recommend it. A decade ago, I'd say to pick it up in a heart-beat... today, it's still just as good, but should really be a bit cheaper given that you will want to get the Kingdoms expansion as well and, hey, it's a pretty old title now (both it and the ex-pack).\n\nOn sale, though, it's a no-brainer: pick it up.","January 3","true","13.4"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","0"

This is partially due to my love of the time period, partially due to my previous obsession with the original Medieval: Total War (if they added that to Steam, I'd snap it up in a heartbeat), but largely because it managed to find the perfect balance between complexity and simplicity when it comes to campaign options - a balance which later entries in the series have tried to reproduce but often fall to one side or the other in attempting.\n\nLike all Total War games, Medieval II features a turn-based strategy map where the player manages their armies and cities, and a real-time tactical battlefield where they play out combat against opponents' armies. Medieval II covers the medieval period of Europe (and includes northern Africa and portions of the Middle East), allowing your faction to attempt to conquer the entirety of the western world of the time.\n\nIt's fantastic and an enormous timesink. The graphics hold up surprisingly well for a game that was almost released a decade ago, in large part because the spectacle is so based on the massive numbers in the armies instead of incredible detail on the individual units.\n\nMedieval II is a wonderful game, and I heartily recommend it to any strategy fans.","February 20, 2014","true","3.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

It's a good game that has some very obvious flaws. Flaws that are amusing in their own ways and can be fixed with some good mods if they bother you. For those who don't know it, The Total War series has essentially two different games in it. The tactical battles, which are great and on nearly all the screenshots - Letting you be a commander of your army and lead your men to victory. And secondly a strategic campaign in which you manage your nation and try to take over the world(In a short time if you go for the game's objectives, but it's a game- your objective is having fun). The weak spot in all of this is the AI. The AI is, to put it lightly, comparable to an inbred dog with downs. While some parts such as the tactical battles don't show it as much and has the AI do decent at tactics, the diplomacy and campaign AI can't figure out what's going on and seems to exist purely as something to facilitate interesting tactical battles.\n\nBut enough about the AI, it's still a good game that can show you the slow, interesting change from medieval warfare to guns and cannons, and lets you use it all in your battles to conquer the world. Along with this you will possibly end up exploring the new world, dealing with the mongols and crusading. In the end, you can be sure that plenty of things will happen to keep you interested and there will be plenty of places to conquer. Mechanics such as religion, your faction's family tree, and actually having to pay attention to your finances mean you will be busy with your empire's details without forcing you to micromanage it all. Though that is an option if you want to\n\nAll in all, it's pretty good. Decent graphics, good gameplay, and a big campaign to keep you busy. It's not the best Total War game out there, but it's trying its best!","May 25, 2015","true","79.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","7"

Gameplay is easy, and simple, with little experience in other TW games needed, though it does help to have a knowledge of TW games in general when playing *any* Total War game. Diplomacy is greatly improved, giving   the feture of seeing what the proposal's strength is(a HUGE plus, when compared to Empire's rather un-responsive AI Diplo), and the Campaign Map is of excellent quality(obviously not Rome II quality, as i is some years older, but still very good, and very detailed) Battles are great, with a good UI allowing full control of the battlefield, and immersive maps that truly do the game justice. Again, the graphics here are great, and very detailed in the city/castle making. Another big plus is the inclusion of the Family Tree, later removed, which is great for viewing whom is within an ever growing family, and who should be king(a great plus over having to kill off the un-desired heir in the previous Medieval: Total War XD).\nI cant give this game enough positive reviews, and have yet to come across anytihg negative.\n10/10 for me, well worth the purchase.

It is a combination of turn-based camping and real time battles.\n\nMedieval 2 TW is a great game for every fan of the medieval time period and for every fan of a good strategy game.\nThe Grand camping is great fun as in every Total War game, but when it comes to real time battles, Medieval 2 stands out.\n\nPlayer can set his own custom battles, where he can choose variety of factions to play. Custom battles can be ground battles or sieges of villages, towns, castles, forts etc. I find custom battles really epic and fun to watch. Watching artillery breaking down walls and killing loads of men is just great fun.\n\nAnother great thing in this game is multiplayer. You can play coop camping with your buddy or join/host a loby and play some epic battles/sieges with up to 8 players.\n\nWith M2TW Kingdons, you get 4 new DLCs and they come with their own campings, factions and units. Every DLC brings a new time period so you can experience the whole Middle Age from Crusades to finding America.\n\nAnd now, drums please......\n\nThe MODS. Oh, yes... Good mods are what TW games are known for. There is a great modding community for this game. Mods like Westeros Total War, Elder Scrolls Total War, Third Age Total War etc. make a whole new game out of Medieval 2. My favourite mod is Third Age Total War which adds 2 new campings (Third Age Camping and The Fellowship Camping). This mod changes all the faction in the game with factions from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books. There are Orcs of Misty Mountain, Mordor, Gundabad, Gondor, Rohan, Elves, Dwarves... Every faction has it's own units (yes, there are orcs, trolls, even Sauron, Balrog and  other iconic characters from the Middle Earth) and every unit looks like it came from the LotR movies.\nA good number of these mods can be played online!\n\nMY CONCLUSION\n\nIf you like medieval time period, if you like knights and epic battles, hell even if you just like Lord of the Rings, get this game (with Kingdoms DLC if you want to mod it!).\nYou can get this game for 1-5 dollars on sites like ♥♥♥♥♥ and it is definitely worth it's full price!

Only this time it takes place during the Medieval period.\n\nYou run historical empires during this period as your object like all total war games is to rule over the land. Unlike in Rome: Total War where missions are everything and you have to complete these in order to ascend to the top. This loosen's those restraints and allows you to govern over your lands without the need to do an objective every five minutes. The new SPQR is the Roman Catholic Church. Pay your dues to the church within this game and the Pope will appericate you a lot and thereby will allow some things from you within good reason.\n\nThe UI for both battle and strategy is a lot more better and a lot more direct than Rome:Total War. The game also provides another detailed tutorial for first timers so you won't have any headaches when your play hours on this game is done.\n\nIf you want a more updated version of Rome: Total War then buy this today!

Much better than the first one. I love the middle ages units (we need a Fantasy Total War game). There are only two things I dislike about this game: 1. The Pope always intervenes so you cannot wipe anyone out. 2. The Mongols are way too tough.\n\nI still like the game. You can build up your cities, recruit troops and fight the battles on the battlefield where you can control all of the troops, and it is a cool empire building game. Europe, however, is getting really boring to me to fight in. Unlike Shogun the original Total War, it seems that the AI troops do not always run and hide when vastly outnumbered.\n\nAnyway, Medieval II is a little older but a really decent game.","October 15, 2015","true","57.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aidenpons/recommended/4700/","aidenpons","aidenpons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aidenpons/","12 products in account","Okay guys - brace yourselves! Long review incoming!\n*explosions*\n\nThis game is exactly the sort of game I've been wanting. It sits in my library of Best Three Games: Medieval II: Total War, Age of Empires II (not the HD edition, that's a buggy mess), and Freedom Planet. :P\n(Grand Strategy, RTS, and.... platformer? What's this nutter up to! :P)\n\nIt's a fantastic blend of turn-based strategy and real-time strategy.\n\nThe whole Total War series is good, but Medieval II is extremely cheap. When on sale (and we all know how common those are!) you can get the game for $10 and the Kingdoms expansion for $5. Unlike later TW games, the Kingdoms expansion is a really really good DLC, adding FOUR WHOLE NEW CAMPIAGNS. Much better than one petty "culture pack." :P\n\nIf you don't know what Total War is, the screenshots & vidoes don't really do the game justice. Simply because there's SO MUCH to the game.\nBasically:\n\nOn the campaign map, which in the main campaign goes from England to Russia to Egypt, you control things in a turn-based way. You make your moves, then another faction makes theirs, then another, etc. Because the game has about 20 factions for the Grand Campaign running it on a slow computer will be a bore. :P\nHowever, when you are attacked you don't fight in a turn-based way. Rather, you fight the battle in realtime. Whether you win or lose, your results are transferred to the main map. If you can't be bothered fighting (e.g. 10:1 odds or naval battles - in Med 2 you can't manually fight naval battles but it doesn't matter since navies are a side point), there is an autoresolve.\n\n\nThere's spies, assassins, diplomats, merchants, wololos- er, priests which you can all use to further your objectives. Want to blitzkrieg? Open the gates with a spy. Can't be bothered killing a faction? Kill all their generals with assassins and rejoice in the Faction Destroyed notification. Send your Catholic Priests off to Egypt and laugh as either a) they cause Cairo to riot due to unrest or don't laugh because b) they all got assassinated.\n\nDon't fancy medieval times? Don't like the Pope? No problem - you can either assassinate the Pope and wait until you get gunpowder units for those, or you can browse the vast section of mods.\nGenerally, mods are fairly easy to install and not too buggy.\n\nMedieval II also is the host of the most functional Lord of the Rings mod: Third Age Total War. It also has two subsets to that: Divide and Conquer, which stuffs the map full of factions / settlements, and Massive Overhaul Submod, which again expands... well, everything.\n\nAnd apparently there's "Hyrule Total War," a mod, which is apparently Zelda.\nFor some silly reason there's a Rome 1 mod for Med 2, despite the fact that Rome 1 is cheaper (get it on sale for $4 :P).\n\nAnd there's also the four expansion campaigns which you can play to your desire.\n\n\nMultiplayer is rather fun, though custom battles (in which you fight opponents out of the blue and the campaign map is utterly ignored) have the problem of no ranking - you can find yourself fighting battles with somebody who you can steamroll because his cavalry never charges, only walk, or find yourself fighting battles with somebody who can steamroll YOU. :P\nThere's also Play By Email games, which are for the campaign map. It's time-consuming (and difficult, partly 'cause timezones) to fight battles actually against the other human player - it is possible, just difficult - and hence most games just use autoresolve. Nevertheless, it's a fun feature which shouldn't be ignored.\n\n\nThe great thing about it is that no matter what skill level you are, you will be able to play & enjoy the game. Complete newb? Set difficulty to Easy and you'll never be fully conquered if you're vaguely competent. Veteran? Put the difficulty up and laugh as you steamroll the AI that took you 300 turns to do when you started.\nMind you, the difficulty settings are misleading. The same AI is used - all that happens is that as you go up the difficulty, they get combat bonuses, free money, and free public order. Normal tends to give the most balanced game (not because their Peasants are suddenly deadly, but because the AI leaves cities with even less garrison than usual).\nFurthermore, the more you play the more you'll realise the game has a surprising level of detail that isn't immediately visible.\nGenerals (and Agents, but Generals are more noticeable) have a system that I heard described as "RPG-like;" fight the French 10 times with one general and voila, he gets the trait "Hates the French:+2 command when fighting the French." An assassin missed your general? He might get paranoid and thus decrease how likely he is to die from assassination. Keep on executing prisoners with one general? Enemies will rout & run away quicker. Leave a general in a city doing nothing? He might lose loyalty.\n\nThe economic system is simply masterful. Creating farms? Population growth goes up. Building roads? Trade income goes up, not just for your settlement but for the settlements it's trading with. Building a Market in a city in the middle of nowhere? Surprise surprise, your trade income went up by +6 (most units cost 300-800). Got gold nearby? Watch your mining profit soar.\nMind you, people who are new to the game can just build things that make them money and not bother about it. More experience players can see how much money it will make them and wonder if it's worth doing.\n\n\n\nThis game isn't for everybody. People who like to run around with guns blazing, die, respawn, have 10s of shooting, die, respawn, etc etc etc will not enjoy this game. But as for me, it's the best thing since Windows XP came out.\n\nIt is also the only game that I can play and feel tired - not physically tired, but mentally fatigued. You can play the game with little thought at all, but you'll progress slowly. The more attention you put in, the quicker your WORLD CONQUEST begins.\n\nStill not convinced? Go get Rome Total War for $4 next Steam sale, see if you like the way it plays, and if you want to spend $12 (on sale) for five whole campaigns (plus a bucketload of complete mods, not some petty statistics change) go for it.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/4760/\n\n(Note: Later Total War games are extremely expensive in comparison, so go get Rome 1 & Med II)","January 31","true","524.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","10","10","3","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrockyqo/recommended/4700/","sirrockyqo","Sirrockyqo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrockyqo/","98 products in account","Once upon a time, I had carved out a worthy empire in northern Germany, and Scandanavia, and was steadily working up to a war againist the HRE, until they finally struck and began to attack. By then, I was having horrible money issues, due to poor upkeep, and an insane abundance of generals. I had an army far superior to the HRE's but they had immense numbers, I carved my way through atleast 3 armies before my own was reduced to less than a hundred and I was forced to retreat. But, with no cash to rebuild a defence I decided it was time to leave behind the dozen generals and the deadly enemy I had made for a much more peaceful living. My ally, Venice gladly traded Tripoli to me for all my cities. In no time, I was able to stablize myself with just 2 generals, all the rest died in a horrible accident with the English navy. However, I had no room to expand and was forced to battle Sicily. It was suprisingly easy after I had taken Tunis. But the Mongols had begun to capture every city they could. They wanted Tripoli too, so I easily gave it to them, their navies and armies scared me. But before I left, I renamed the city to Mongoliassholia. Now, in Tunis I built up my economy and made up enough money to get 3 Carracks to sail me to Sicily and Sardinia, which I easily conquered as the Sicilians somehow lost their entire forces defending Tunis. After much conquering, I had Corsica, Florence too, and was well on my way to finish off Sicily off east. When Portugal, and Milan decided I was in the way of their expansion. By then Germany, Egypt, and the Turks had been destroyed. Scotland reduced to Ireland, the Netherlands, and a city in the Baltics somehow. Portugal had made Spain and the Moors into vassals. Russia had been reduced to their original size, by the Timurids. The Mongols stretched out from Tripoli, to the Ukraine. Venice, once a power thanks to me had been too stretched out, and France, had managed to move all the way out to Poland, and Hungary, and were steadily taking out the rest of Venice in Europe, and eagerly awaiting to finish the ones off in Scandanavia. They wouldn't attack me though, we were in good standing. Now, as my eagar axemen, and sword-bearers are ready to invade Bologna, the Mongols come knocking again, and the max turns are reached.

But when put beside it's predecessors, it's also a very small game. I am not talking about size here, or even the scope of the game but more it's advancement over the previous installment. It's that same question you always have to ask yourself every time a franchise you enjoy comes out with a new installment.\n\nShould I get the new one or just replay the old one? In the case of Medieval II the answer is, you might as well go play another campaign in Rome.\n\nWhile Medieval by itself is a great game that promises hours of entertainment it doesn't really do anything that you couldn't already do in Rome. Most of the new features are minor in nature or simply cosmetic the lack of advancement is instantly noticeable when you realize that Medieval even managed to bring over a few bugs from Rome that were never quite fixed.\n\nFor the newcomers to the series, Medieval II Total War is a mix between a real time strategy game and a turn based grand strategy game. The turn based aspect focuses mainly on empire management, improving your cities, raising and moving armies and conducting diplomacy with other factions. This area has traditionally been the weak spot of Total War games and Medieval makes no changes there. The system is clunky and bugged, the AI is completely worthless and the diplomacy might as well not have been included. Anything the grand strategy aspect of Total War tries to do has already been done a thousand times better in pretty much every other grand strategy game.\n\nBut then again, you don't buy a Total War game for the cerebral strategy. You buy it for the guts and glory of the the real time battles where armies clash and legion perish all for the hope of victory and while the satisfaction you get from a successful maneuver is still present so is the complete lack of any sort of intelligence on the part of your opponents. As with all other Total War games, the AI is incapable of doing anything beyond the classic attack move with no concern for formation, flanking or skirmishing leading to almost every battle being a cakewalk unless you are terribly outnumbered.\n\nGraphically the series still impress although the uniformity with your units is beginning to show, the sounds work well enough that you are never taken out of the action and the soundtrack is acceptable most of the time.\n\nAll in all Medieval II is a good and fun game that you can spend hundreds of hours in easily. Should you buy it still comes down to that same question however. If you have never played a Total War game I would always recommend you get the newest in the series. Medieval II is still an advancement over Rome, albeit a very minor one. If you already own Rome however then there is little new for you here and you would probably be better off saving your money for further down the line when another installment in the series comes along with a more profound leap in mechanics and technology.","June 1, 2013","true","289.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I say probably, because $20 is a little pricey, but if its on sale for $10 or under get it! It is a great strategy game with two main modes. The campaign map is like an overall strategy game where you try to conquer the world, and the tactical battles are individual battles where you control an army. Although the graphics are outdated, the strategy in this game is priceless. Played a game as Portugal, and first killed Spain. Then fought and made peace with France, then went south and killed the Moors, then kept going east and killed sicily, kept going and am currently about to kill Egypt. I also conquered Rome from Sicily and returned it to the pope, who became my bestie for all of 2 turns until he died.

On a secondary level it's a diplomacy game, requiring careful decision making regarding allies and opponents as well as currying favour with the powers that be i.e. the Papacy and thirdly it still blends in the faster paced action of the tactical battles that allows one to actively witness and control sieges and battle upon the open field.\nAs an older game the graphics are poor but not terrible, due to the usually zoomed out perspective, that doesn't show up poor unit models. It's challenging and has only the barest introduction for new players, requiring learning through trial and error, (which is more effective), and has a UI that contains as little or as much detail as you like, depending on how far through the menus you progress, something newer games tend to try to oversimplify and thus lack detail.\n\nMedieval 2: TW is more than likely going to be around for a long time yet, with it's continuing active player base, and it is that more than any review online that speaks for the quality of this game.","December 5, 2015","true","23.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

It shows it's age a little when standing next to the newer games in the series, but is still fun to play. Medieval 2 is set in the latter half of the middle ages, between 1080 and the 1500's. Medieval 2, only allows you to play as 5 Factions when you first start out. All of these factions were the historically powerful factions of the age. Defeating additional factions unlocks them for play up to 17 different playable factions in total through campaign mode.\n\nA mixture of real-time tactics and strategy, as well as turn-based gameplay, exploration and expansion, Medieval 2 is fun to play, but is starting to show it's age a little. I suppose we are getting spoiled in 2015 with games that have realistic looking characters; However, it is still fun and would be recommended to anyone who enjoys the Total War series.","June 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Loads of good mods out there, that either tweak this or that, or improve or expand this or that, not to mention a slew of total convesion mods that take the game to a different era or genre entirely. Just finished making a map pack with 15 new vanilla MP maps that draw locations off the campaign map, so only the host needs the files & anyone can join without downloading anything.

Now before i begin i will say that i have played many games of this category. for instance there is nearly all the total war titles and europa univeralis 4, hearts of iron 3. So i am not unfamiliar with this (and for those who are you will find it is VERY easy to get into). Pretty much everything about this game is perfect i mean the gameplay when you command your troops in battle is so immersive and spotless it is hard to find a complaint. Not to mention this game is weirdly more advanced and realistic compared to later total war game, like empire total war and napoleon or even the newest rome 2.\n\n\nI mean you actually have to have your diplomats move and not just be lazy and click a button and open up the diplomatic menu. Not to mention the soldiers actually act like people! now if you haven't noticed the troops from shogun 2 and rome 2 DESPERATLEY need to take notes from this MASTERPIECE of a game. the troops in Medieval 2 move so fluently it is unreal, in rome 2 they feel like bricks with legs, shogun 2 (and empire and napoleon) are slightly better with this which adds to my earlier topic of how earlier games are better than the new ones. empire and napoleon makes more sense with how they soldiers move though because of the timeline, shogun 2 kinda does because it does have a couple gun regiments. but rome 2 i have no idea.\n\n\nAnd another thing is that Medieval 2 is not arcady like rome 2 and empire napoleon and shogun 2. in rome 2 there is a timer in the fortress in a siege so if you just have one dude step in that stupid circle you will win in 2min it is crazy, now i know there is one in Medieval 2 but considering it is in they WAY back of the fortress it is not even there. another thing is the maps are very different and unique and are just generally much better than what i've seen in rome 2. (by the way if you are wondering why i am comparing so much to rome 2 it is because it is the newest game of the total war series and this just goes to show that pretty graphics can only take you so far, because that is all rome 2 is to me)\n\n\nAlso the gameplay in the battles in Medieval 2 are so much more stratigic and are just generally perfect in everyway possible, unlike rome 2. Now the whole point of the total war games is to have an easy political view game and a very complicated and stratigic battling system in between. THAT IS WHAT A TOTAL WAR GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. (which is why Medieval 2 is so amazing) in rome 2 the battling system is so horride and awful it makes me want to puke, and the diplomatic gameplay just.....i can't even describe my disgust with that, in Medieval 2 it is just so perfect and amazing that my only explanation for how good it is, is probably that a god crafted Medival 2.\n\n\nNow i could go on and on about how Medieval 2 is the best total war game i've played. Like the music is so amazing and inspiring and immersive. Medieval 2 also is SUPER IMMERSIVE AND PERFECT IN NEARLY EVERY WAY POSSIBLE! now i could talk for the rest of my life on how good this game is, but i am pretty sure that whoever read this long probably got the idea already, so yeah Medieval 2 is 10/10 in my book","November 26, 2014","true","32.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Upon first inspection, this game may seem to be a generic "KNIGHTS FIGHTING LOLOL" game, but this is not the case. If you take a moment to view the individual soldiers, you'll notice the great attention to detail. For one, it is well-known that during battles, men would oftentimes sit still, battle-ready, and stare at eachother. After several seconds, they would begin punching eachother whilst holding spears, swords, etc. opting to wield the weapons for show, as everyone knows they are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnother amazing detail is the Mongol invasion. Now, the first thing everyone pictures when they think of Mongols, are their crippling weakness of wooden stakes. But there's no possible way a game made in the same year Kobe Bryant scored his career-high 81 points in his victory against the Toronto Raptors, could possibly achieve such a feat, right? Wrong. I was leading the Kingdom of England in a desperate war against the dastardly Mongolian invaders, when they began sieging one of my beloved cities. I was unable to retrieve reinforcements, so I was forced to use a few units of Retinue Longbowmen to halt their advance. I used one unit of them to plant stakes in front of the gate, hoping that it may cause the ingenius AI to use caution. Once the gate was broken down, I couldn't believe my eyes. It looked like a page torn straight from a history book. The Mongol riders had charged into the dozen or so wooden stakes, and suffered such heavy losses that I was able to gain a Heroic Victory. After I'd finished weeping at the beauty of this event, I was forced to turn off my computer, as if I continued I feared I may actually have believed that I was a heroic general, whom saved the grand city of Hamburg from the terrifying eastern invaders.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is fantastic, and I would very much like Medieval III: Total War. Maybe they could even add the great Siege of Angers, where the two belligerents stared at eachother for days, and the French won the first, and only, battle by dehydration. Or maybe I am too excitable. pls ca","January 18, 2015","true","237.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/recommended/4700/","totalwargamer","Sleep deprived shift worker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totalwargamer/","88 products in account","Medieval II: Total War\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Nice music soundtrack which fits the Medieval theme of the game.\n+ Great unit variety, with swordsmen, spearmen, archers, cavalry and siege engines like trebuchets and catapults available to use.\n+ Many buildings to construct in your towns or castles, such as farms, roads, churches, leather tanneries and so on, each providing different benefits to your kingdom.\n+ Dated graphics but they are still acceptable. Units like templar knights are quite colourful.\n+ A really cool religious system. Catholic countries in Europe have a reputation among the Pope which can be improved through completing religious missions or building churches. The higher your reputation the more sway you have with the holy leader, so you can order crusades in Muslim lands for honour and glory. If you play as an Islamic faction, you can order jihads lol.\n+ Decent map size extending across Europe and the Middle East.\n+ Expansion packs are huge and offer even more gameplay.\n+ Command thousands of troops on screen at once in epic battles.\n+ Nice mix of agents on the campaign map, each with different purposes. Priests can convert regions to your religion and denounce witches or heretics, but if they are unsuccessful, could turn to a life of heresy themselves. Assassins are another key unit, skilled in the art of killing enemy generals or family members. Then there's merchants, which can capitalise on trade goods across the world map and send the profits back to your kingdom, but foreign merchants may try to drive you out of business! Diplomats are fairly self explanatory and royal princesses can visit other kingdoms to find a husband, while also acting as a diplomat too.\n+ Hundreds of hours of gameplay here.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Unit animations on the battlefield aren't very good. They're difficult to see and not that interesting. Later installments of the Total War series improved this.\n- Diplomacy is virtually useless, allies are unreliable and will attack for literally no reason, your relationship with them does not impact the likelihood of whether they will attack you. This is a major problem with the game, mods don't seem to fix anything (I've tried multiple ones.)\n- This game has constant warfare due to the broken diplomacy system. You never do get a break from conquering other kingdoms. Anyone who has played a total war game before knows that it can be quite overwhelming, tiresome and boring fighting turn after turn. It's nice to build your empire in peace sometimes. You don't really get that opportunity in Medieval II: Total War.\n- Overpowered Mongol hordes that appear during the late-game can be very irritating. For some unknown reason, Creative Assembly (the developers) like to throw a curve ball at the players in almost every single total war title they release. Total War: Shogun 2 had realm divide, where every Japanese faction declared war on you after you became too powerful, Total War: Rome II had civil wars, where massive armies spawn in your territory to take over. Medieval II: Total War has....the Mongols. All I can say is good luck and be prepared for when they arrive.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\nEven though Medieval II: Total War is an old game which struggles with diplomacy and realism, it has a lot of fun features and micro-management which the more modern total war games seem to neglect. The use of priests to remove witches and heretics, the inquisition trialling your family's characters for blasphemy, the crusades, merchants who fight over resources  - this is all good, interesting gameplay on top of the real time battles. It's an excellent if not exhausting game, due to the AI's constant affinity for wanting to attack you.","February 13, 2014","true","99.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","3"

It will drive you crazy.\nFor the love of God, if you have a busy schedule (exams, things to be done at home etc) do not even look at this page.","March 26, 2015","true","268.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

Within less than an hour, all of my expectations were met. Medieval 2 has a fairly straight forward learning curve, and is very forgiving to those who are new to the game. With both skirmishes and a grand campaign, there is plenty to do, with many different factions to choose from, each with their own unique units and specialties. With a fantastic engine and good graphics, the game feels very realistic. The campaign is very deep, with many different agents and battles, making you come up with new strategy's every time you play. Beating the campaign unlocks the rest of the factions to play as, with you only starting with five. Overall I would rate this game as an 8/10, as there are some minor bugs.","January 17, 2014","true","480.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This latter piece of the puzzle matters because some of the community dating back to when the game originallly released went to a lot of trouble to make mods, such as Stainless Steel and the total conversion for Lord of the Rings: Third Age.\n\nFor me, the charm of Medieval 2 though is really centered around the game itself, the time period is so well suited for the style of game play that CA makes with the turn based stragegy map combined with the real time tactical battles that the result is just endless amounts of fantastic game play.\n\nThis and Shogun 2 are for me the two best games CA has ever created.

After playing Medieval 2, Rome, Empire, and Rome 2, I can safely say that Medieval is still my favorite in the series. Yes, the later iterations ARE prettier. This game was released in 2006 after all. However, in my opinion, you can't beat the game engine they used. The Warscape engine that is utilized by the newer games (empire onwards) has taken a loooooong time to reach the same level of melee combat satisfaction that I got from M2. Sure, there are no fancy one v one animations. BUT, those animations also wrecked havoc with how many battles played out. I don't think I ever saw two soldiers gang up on one soldier in any game other than M2 and Rome 1. Battles are played out more by training stats, upgrades, and tactics vs. a boat ton of special abilities and badas* animations. I know there are plenty of people who won't agree, but it's just my experience.\n\nThe biggest reason why I always come back to this game is the modding community. I had the game running on a virtual version of windows on my mac (years before the mac version was released) JUST so I could play Third Age Total War. Not to mention all the unit mods, engine and animation tweaks, etc. This is still probably the most mod friendy total war game out there. I spent dozens of hours over the last 8-9 years compiling units and tweaks to get my game just right, enduring hundreds of coding errors and game re-installs. Little by little (and somehow without taking over my life) Medieval 2 became a near-perfect game. And this is a guy with little to no mod creation or coding experience whatsoever.\n\nAll in all, it's a wonderful game that won't be surpassed until they potentialy do a new Total War in the Medieval setting. It's perfectly fine without mods, but if you're like me and discovered just how awesome the modding community is, it's the best Total War game to mod in my opinion.","February 9","true","190.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Medieval II: Total War is a great game both for its setting, factions, and great campaign elements that really drive the game. The only problem I have with this game is its incredibly wonky camera (the worst of any Total War game i've played). Its so difficult to do battles in the campaign I resort to autoresolving most of the time. This isn't game breaking but it definitely keeps me from playing the battles all too often.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/4700/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nMedieval II: Total War is a Medieval strategy game developed by The Creative Assembly and released 2006. Medieval II: Total War is full of country-micromanaging with strong emphasis on historical context, strategies, and battle planning.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: There is a Campaign where the player takes on the role of the selected nation, and develops said nation militarily and economically. The story is generally trying to follow historically accurate events, foes, allies, and important key leaders.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520673039\n\nGameplay: There are two game modes in Medieval II: Total war (or in this genre of Strategy game in general): Battle Mode, when it's opposing armies clashing against each other. The other mode requiring just as much skill as battle strategy (probably requiring more) is World Mode, where you navigate the map, edit city construction, politics, religion,  army movement, and much more.\nThere's a lot to learn going into Medieval II: Total War, if you haven't played any of the previous franchise games. (Which I hadn't; this was my personal first Total War game) The game starts out with a tutorial campaign explaining basic combat concepts to battle warfare and gives the player a rudimentary introduction to camera movement, and unit controls. While the tutorial is effective at helping you learn, there is far more information to learn about the franchise inner workings, and for that: your best friend is the in game advisers (I like to think of them as my F1 key).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520673058\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for Medieval II: Total War. There are historical battles that you can try your hand at, and in my opinion winning a historical battle that is usually lost, is a huge achievement.\n\nPrice: Medieval II: Total war is priced at $19.99, most strategy games eat up time like it's nobodies business, I personally like to spend an hour for every dollar I spend and Medieval II: Total War will do just that, and then some.\n(Personal note: I do feel the need to thank the person who bought Medieval II: Total war for me as a gift many years ago. Thanks Golag, maybe someday I'll finally beat you in it.)\n\nConclusion: Story: Emphasis on Historical facts and events (Very cool). Gameplay: Difficult to learn if you haven't played any other Total War games. Achievements: None, however there is no lack in difficulty. Price: Fair, almost all strategy games are worth their weight in game hours played.\nI recommend this game to Gamers who enjoy either History and/or strategy games. Generally it takes a fair amount of time to learn how a strategy game works, after you learn the mechanics then the game goes faster and it's very easy to get sucked into it.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520673031\n\nDLC\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 22, 2015:\nDLC review link added.","September 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Having played over 100 hours and only completing one faction out of 17 playable factions for campaign.\nEven if you don't want to start a campaign they have custom battles that you can make the rules for or even historical battle in which you reenact famous battles fought during this time period. There is so much replayability and each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses such as England has really good longbowmen but lack in good cavalry compaired to other factions. So if you are looking for a great strategy game that will keep you busy for multiple hours at a time and are intrested in Medieval  history then Medieval 2 Total war is the game for you!","June 29, 2014","true","166.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can compose armies of many unit types of the time period, and each one has an information card telling you about that unit and a description of their historical use. You can play as 5-ish factions initially, though you can unlock more.\n\nJust like Civ4/5, while on the overmap you can upgrade cities/castles and engage in trade/sabotage/war/diplomacy with other nations, only you can't build new cities, only take over others, though you can repurpose them to Towns(Money Makers) or make them into a Castle(Troop Maker), though both can make money or troops, their respective ones do it better.\n\nFor those who have played Rome: Total War, Medieval is extremely similar, except during a different time period. There are improvements, such as improvements and supporting modern resolutions without mods.\n\nSpeaking of mods. there are two very good ones, called "The Elder Scrolls: Total War", which let's you play in the Elder Scrolls world with all their empires and factions. And also "The Third Age: Total War", which let's you play in The Lord of the Rings world, in GREAT detail, and is rated one of the best mods for Medieval II: Total War, and is currently(March 5th, 2015) ranked #1 on ModDB.\n\nI greatly recommend this to any Total War or RTS fan.","March 5, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And in addition, it is my favorite strategy game. The only RTS game that I can think of that is better, would be C&C Generals, but EA never made a second one!!!\nBack to medieval, for a bit of an outdated game it still looks amazing, and it runs flawlessly, highest settings, even on my computer which only has 2 lousy GB of RAM. They campaign is fun, and it feels more in-depth, and more "wholesome" than the newer TW games like ROME 2. Just little things that you'll notice throughout the game that'll  make it just SO much more fun. The kingdoms expansion is even better!!! 90% of my logged game time is just the brittania campaign. I can't get enough of this game, I spend hours on end glued to my screen witnessing my armies conquer, and my "light" Ostmen slaughtering heavy Scottish Nobleman like they were pigs. And unlike ROME 2 where in melee combat, infantry just gets into a giant clusterf@#k and it takes forever for one side to win, melee combat in this game is so much better, each soldier in a unit has their own little fight and they're pals may jump in and help em out with a quick axe-to-the-head. I can go on and on about how amazing this game is, but then you'd be reading this for hours. Just buy the game. And see how amazing it is for yourselves.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/4700/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Following up the highly popular Rome, Medieval II is, perhaps not surprisingly, very similar to its immediate predecessor. Anyone who has played Rome can look at Medieval II and see essentially the same gameplay with a few added bits. Thankfully those added bits improve the core game enough that Medieval II stands on its own, managing to escape Rome's shadow... a bit.\n\nThere are some silly issues that are often found in TW games: The AI is bad. Bad in the "I am suicidal with my generals" sort of way. At least they can actually fight battles competently enough, since this series has always (until Fall of the Samurai, perhaps) been at its best with swords, bows, and catapults. You do get the beginnings of the "pike and shot" era in this game, but really the focus is on the lovely middle ages.\n\nAs for the good bits, the Grand Campaign is, well, grand. A big map that can be made even bigger with mods, plenty of events that sometimes herald the arrival of new factions (ze Mongols!), and lots of fun with religion and crusades and burning  heretics. You have to unlock the rest of the factions by playing one of the starter nations (England, France, Spain, etc), but once you do there is plenty of replay value to be found here.\n\nAnd, of course, there are mods. Plenty for Medieval II, though the real gems require its Kingdoms expansion.\n\nSo, if you want to lead big armies in the middle ages and charge around Europe setting stuff on fire, this game is plenty good for that. It's similarity to Rome might lead some players to get bored a little faster, but they can just get mods and play something fresh. Also get the Kingdoms expansion so you can delve into some of the best mods ever made.","June 26, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game in particular has to be the best one out of the Total War series.\n\nLike in all Total War games, Medieval II has different factions. There are 22 total factions in this game in general, but in the single player mode, you'll have to unlock them. Each faction has its different advantages and disadvantages. The possible worst faction I think (debatable) are either the Moors or the Scots. The best possible faction I think are the Timurids. Who wouldn't go wrong with the Timurids? They have elephant artilleries with MISSILES on them, proving highly effective against the offending team. The Timurids are VERY great with defensive strategies, but the ammunition supply is pretty low. But, it's the best faction.\n\nThis game is definitely worth getting. Along with Medieval II, you should get the Kingdoms expansion pack. It gives you more missions and more factions. Get. It. It is worth every cent in your junk drawer.\n\n8.9/10, 89%","November 26, 2013","true","6.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'd say that it has a very high mass of building's that can be built leaving endless hours of fun. And if you are the Historical type they have multiple challenging Historical battles. This game also supports multiplayer which I found quite fun. Though like every game it has it's share of bugs and it's bad sides. The lack of update's and fixes to the game were rarely seen. (Seige does need abit of help.) You may encounter a bug or two at most but the rest of the game makes up for that factor. Lastly this game share's many cinematics from spy's infiltraiting areas to assassin's assassinating the Pope himself. I myself found these quite interesting and satisfing to watch. When it comes down to it I at most give this game a 8½ out of 10 This game was an amazing experience but it shares it's bugs and it's disadvantages (such as Horsemen bug and them sometimes not holding down their lances) But all in all a good game definitely worth the buy and play through.","July 2, 2015","true","126.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I don't have an hour total, but I can assure you I spent a good two or three years putting about as much time into this as I did my full time job.\n\nProbably the last really well thought out Total War game, and one of the least buggy. There is no stupidly awkward city management system (Empire), most of the factions are reasonably well balanced (with the exception of the Italian States, who are crushingly overpowered in a player's hands - still better than pretty well all the other total war games out there), and things move at a pace that doesn't feel to relaxed or too rushed (shogun, napolean).\n\nIt's not a masterpiece by any means, but now that I revisit them, I don't think any of the Total War games really are. It is a pretty fun game though, and certainly worth getting if you've are looking to get into the series.\n\nEdit: When I say "the least buggy", I'm just refering to the Steam versions. Rome:TW on CD, from like a decade ago, remains stable as a ♥♥♥♥ing rock resting on the surface of a giant steel cube with the gravitational pull of a black hole. There is also a 6 billion ton weight sitting on top of the rock. I've been told the Steam version doesn't work that well, but haven't had to try it despite having lost my Rome CD recently, because Rome is from an era where devs depended on human decency and CD codes as DRM.","November 2, 2014","true","41.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Things was peaceful, all I did was conquering nearby barbarian cities, so did all my other neighbors. Suddenly Venice attacks me. Some few battles and the lines are at a stalemate. Milan attacks me and they ally with Venice. Milan is excommunicated by the Pope for attacking me. Pope declares crusade against Cairo. My heir joins a crusade and marches down through East Europe, through the holy lands and after nearly 10 years he arrives and conquers Cairo just before Poland reaches there. Pope loves me. I then conquer Alexandria so that I can create a Mediterranean fleet so that my Heir Henry the Crusader can come back to his father before he dies of old age.\n\nPope dies of old age. Archbishop of Milan is voted as Pope. Milan is not anymore excommunicated and is now loved by Pope. Papal state declares war against me and allies with Milan and Venice. My emperor dies in Bologna. Bologna is just after conquered by Papal state with the Pope himself in the army. Suddenly there is no secure land to land my new Emperor Henry the Crusader. Pope starts a new crusade. Again it is against Cairo, only this time it's under my control... 2 years after a Jihad is started, also against Cairo. My hatred for the newly vided Pope is great. I use more years and create an even bigger fleet so that the venetian fleet can't outmatch it. I then send Emperor Henry the Crusader and his crusader army (the ones that conquered Cairo and Alexandria). Because of little troops after my emperor left Alexandria, it rebels and all surviving troops are sent to Cairo. Some years after Emperor Henry the Crusader lands outside of Rome and attacks the Pope himself. Emperor Henry the Crusader kills the Pope with his crusader army.\n\n11/10 Best game ever <3","November 30, 2014","true","54.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(I was a wrathful ruler) The religion concept is very neat as well. The crusades and jihads are the most interesting thing with that. I was venice and I got the popes favor by Crusading Cairo, Alexandria, and Jerusalem. This is very great whether new or an all time total war fan. There is definite replayability, as every faction has different attributes. The only thing I am not fond of is trading, its as simple as moving your merchant over the resource. But overall, the game is pretty good. 9/10","November 29, 2014","true","85.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well worth the money, well worth getting the Kingdoms DLC with it, just adds more to do really. Honestly, I would say this is the best out of the Total War series. I like the feature of being able to put units under AI command, have the AI take control of an army during a battle, though the AI is bad, it is still a handy feature if you want to witness giant battles. It is a shame they didn't include it in the later games. I love being able to buid up armies and attack huge castles with mighty siege equipment, it is just awesome.\n\nThe game lacks some things, but it is old. There can be stressful moments, where the AI acts like a complete idiot, you cannot position your troops where you want to position them, some slight issues, but the game is still awesome and playable. Has some great mods out there for it, so you can go and experience them too.\n\nHighly recommend it.","July 25, 2014","true","50.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looks a bit dated now after some of the more recent Total War series, but this is an extremely interesting time period for warfare. The game suffers a bit on the campaign map by being a bit too ambitious; there are a bit too many merchants, priests, spies, assassins, princesses to move around. But the real-time battles can be simply glorious, and the historical accuracy make the experience ultimately fulfilling. If you're patient, the Grand Campaign can be a true strategic adventure.\nBe warned! This game has a third-party launcher that has a bug and it may need to be killed from the task-manager under "processes" most times that you play. There may also be a problem with the Kingdoms DLC, so check the forums first!

While Crusader Kings II can't really be topped in terms of depth and the sheer amount of intricacy on offer, at the time of its release Medieval II offered players a chance at some cunning diplomacy using spies, priests and even princesses to influence the enemy factions, in addition to an updated battle engine.\n\nDefinitely worth picking up, especially if you're curious about the more recent Total War games and want a slightly less complex entry into the military strategy world.","November 30, 2013","true","189.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Examples of this are the soundtrack, character traits, the art direction taken in map / unit textures and character / building portraits, to poltical intrigues, religious importance, plagues, brutal warfare etc.\n\nOn a gameplay level, the game is very solid. During battles, independent units, and whole armies move very smoothly and it is not frutrating to get your men into position. While in the grand campaign, the interface responsible for managing your armies and kingdom is layed out intelligently while being very easy to learn, yet still has a complexity in options that keeps the grand campaign very interesting. The grand campaign interface is also not cluttered, and also had an artist(s) handiwork, as it is very pleasing to look at. The only thing that is not perfect is possibly the AI, sometimes the AI is not very intelligent, however, it never fails to offer a strong fight, and is still very solid, works smoothly, and can offer a challenge.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a medieval experience in a game, that is fun, immersive, and has a lot of replay value.","June 11, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Camping in the same spot till I go for them, then again the game douse has its up sides such as double walls and many gatehouses.

It looks a bit dated now after some of the more recent Total War series, but this is an extremely interesting time period for warfare. The game suffers a bit on the campaign map by being a bit too ambitious; there are a bit too many merchants, priests, spies, assassins, princesses to move around. But the real-time battles can be simply glorious, and the historical accuracy make the experience ultimately fulfilling. If you're patient, the Grand Campaign can be a true strategic adventure.\nBe warned! This game has a third-party launcher that has a bug and it may need to be killed from the task-manager under "processes" most times that you play. There may also be a problem with the Kingdoms DLC, so check the forums first!

It's the game that got me back into strategy games after a long hiatus, and that introduced me to what is now one of my favorite game series ever.\n\nBut will you like it?\n\nWell, let's start from the beginning.\n\nMedieval II is a combination turn-based and real-time tactics strategy game that takes place in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. You can play as one of 17 different factions in the campaign mode (plus four others in skirmishes) that have a wide variety of playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses. As 450 years go by, the Old World is thrown into chaos- or Total War, as the narrator would say- as it endures Crusades and Jihads, rebellion and betrayal, infighting among the Christian nations, two monstrous hordes from the East, and that terrible calamity known as the Black Death, all while the slow wheel of time turns and technology continues to advance from the simple spear to the crossbow to the terrible might of gunpowder. The Kingdoms expansion essentially adds four entirely new games, with campaigns in more localized areas of the normal TW map with over a dozen new factions to play from, in scenarios that all present very different challenges.\n\nYou will spend half of your time on the grand campaign map, a sort of political overworld where you manage the large affairs of your empire and move about your units. Here is where alliances are made and broken, provinces are developed, units are recruited, money is managed, and the dark tasks of espionage and assassination are undertaken. While a battle might change the course of a war, this is where you make sure that you have every chance of winning it in the first place.\n\nBut most people play Total War for the battles. With the capacity to have thousands of units on the field at any given time, they're as much spectacle as strategy, as the ordered chaos of the battlefield threatens to overwhelm even the greatest captains. With a rich unit roster and a wide array of special abilities, your armies will be versatile and able to employ any number of tactics, from slowly whittling enemy numbers down with a stream of arrow fire to forming a defensive circle to protect your captain to employing a devastating hammer and anvil strike with your cavalry to launching diseased cow carcasses at their generals. Morale, terrain, weather, and energy levels all play important roles in how well your soldiers will be able to fight, and how well you will be able to govern the events of the battle.\n\nWhile there are some common strategies that can be undertaken for any nation or situation, no two campaigns or battles are the same, as the game can and will throw out surprises for you that you'll have to think quickly about to overcome. You may think you're doing well as France, fighting off England and preparing to make an invasion of the isles, when suddenly those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Portugal declare war on you and blockade all of your provinces, forcing you to stretch yourself out along two fronts. And while you may be able to overcome this obstacle, His Holiness the Pope probably won't take kindly to your conquests against your Catholic brethren, and may excommunicate you. All eventualities need to be prepared for in Total War if you want to survive.\n\nWhile this game is nearly a decade old, it still has a sizable and dedicated community of players to turn to if you want to fight a battle, try out a mod, or just get some friendly advice on how to deal with the Timurids. And as one of the easiest TW games to modify, it also has one of the best mod communities you'll be able to find, with an active base of players uploading and supporting their mods to this day. I highly recommend Stainless Steel, an expanded version of the base game with more provinces, factions, and units, and better AI, and also Third Age, a total conversion mod for Lord of the Rings that in my humble opinion is arguably the best TW game ever created, despite being a mod. If those two don't suit you, I'm sure you can find others that will.\n\nAs for performance, the game still runs fine almost a decade after release, and still looks great. I can start a battle with 5,000 troops on the field and have little to no lag on my less than stellar computer. The score is also one of the finest I've had the pleasure of listening to in any game, and fits it very well.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go get the game! Europe won't conquer itself!","April 12, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/recommended/4700/","TekDragon","TekDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/","485 products in account","My personal favorite in the Total War series. Medieval 2 gains a lot by being set in a time and place that is more or less easily recognizable to westerners.\n\nAssuming you start the game as the default English or French, you'll be mostly battling accross Europe with late game forays into northern Africa, western Russia, and the Middle East. Your units will, for the most part, also be familiar and easily understood. Even a casual student of medieval European history will understand why charging a spear wall with calvary is a bad idea, or why you don't use tight formations to advance into arrow or catapult fire. The game's medieval atmosphere is further boosted by a provocative musical score, accurate sound effects, and nation-themed voice dialogue.\n\nGamplay in Medieval II, like any Total War game, is dividied between the strategic global campaign map and tactical maps where battles are played out.\n\nThe strategic gameplay is solid, and players will be required to juggle tax income, religion, unrest, noble desires, and public health with the logistical demands of supporting your armies between battles. While the game lacks the research tech tree introduced in Empire, technology pacing is present through city building. As you build and upgrade your stables, archery ranges, and barracks you'll gain access to new troop types while smithies, jousting fields, and swordsmen guilds will enhance the equipment and quality of troops.\n\nTactical gameplay is fantastic with players having strong control over formations, positioning, and abilities. Complexity is added in with morale and stamina mechanics, both of which are easily understood and implemented in a way that makes sense.\n\nThe few faults that do exist in the tactical gameplay only emerge when directly comparing the game to more recent Total Wars, like Shogun 2 or Rome 2. Combat and unit cohesion in Medieval 2 can feel more rigid and unresponsive than its successors, but never enough to seriously impede gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n","September 2, 2013","true","36.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are plenty of options as to how you want to raise your kingdom to be the greatest of all time. WIll your king be an honourable man, one who releases all his prisoners? Or a dreadful man, whose subjects follow him not out of loyalty, but fear? Will you cement a lasting alliance with the kingdom on your borders by marrying off your young princess to their prince, or will you slaughter them, burning their towns and villages and killing all their lords? Although the game lacks extreme political intrigue, there is enough there to keep you playing for a loong time. You can use covert ops (such as assassins and spies) to eliminate the lords and ladies of the enemy, weakening their forces before you ride in, killing everyone. There is so much to do in this game, and the RTS combat is fantastic. True strategy is necessary to win on the field of battle. A competent commander will triumph over the greatest of odds if his enemies blunder about like fools. There is also a great deal of diversity throughout the units for each faction. And, despite how old this game is, I assure you, the multiplayer community is very much alive and well.

Examples of this are the soundtrack, character traits, the art direction taken in map / unit textures and character / building portraits, to poltical intrigues, religious importance, plagues, brutal warfare etc.\n\nOn a gameplay level, the game is very solid. During battles, independent units, and whole armies move very smoothly and it is not frutrating to get your men into position. While in the grand campaign, the interface responsible for managing your armies and kingdom is layed out intelligently while being very easy to learn, yet still has a complexity in options that keeps the grand campaign very interesting. The grand campaign interface is also not cluttered, and also had an artist(s) handiwork, as it is very pleasing to look at. The only thing that is not perfect is possibly the AI, sometimes the AI is not very intelligent, however, it never fails to offer a strong fight, and is still very solid, works smoothly, and can offer a challenge.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a medieval experience in a game, that is fun, immersive, and has a lot of replay value.","June 11, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070443142/recommended/4700/","76561198070443142","Phobos","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070443142/","170 products in account","Ever since I played M2:TW about 6 years ago, I fell in love with it and I still play it to date (hit nearly 500 hours on steam).\n\nStarting off:\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nBeing an old game, don't expect any supreme graphics. Pretty much, there are about 7 different unit models in a unit, but it doesn't ruin the diversity. The campaign maps are well drawn (maybe a couple more cities would be good, but it doesn't ruin the experience), giving you the impression that you actually fight in Europe and Middle East. Keep in mind that you have to tune your graphics approprietly (bless auto-optimization for that) or else the game might crash since we are talking about battles that involve THOUSANDS of soldiers, not dozens. The battle maps are well-designed, ranging from Scottish, snowy highlands to the hot deserts of the Holy Lands.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10\n\nIf you are new to Medieval 2, you will have little knowledge on how tactics and strategies will save your army. The game offers you the chance to build your armies based on your playstyle and plan your path to victory yourself. However, once you become a veteran, you will notice that the AI is pretty easy to beat, even in the Very High difficulty. That may make your gaming experience a bit dull. In the campaign, you can pretty much do whatever you want. Securing alliances with marriage? Check. Converting people to your religion in order to ensure peace? Check. Spy other leaders, generals and cities? Check. Assassinating those who are out of reach? Check. You really are the leader of a medieval European faction and you can do whatever you want to achieve unity, prosperity and victory.\n\nSound: 10/10\n\nThe soundtrack is dreamy. There are different tracks when you march, when the battle begins, when you start winning etc. Not only that, the soundtrack is divided based to the region you wage war, what faction you are in, the time of year etc. The music immerses you to the game and adds to the atmosphere of either the campaign map or the battle you are about to wage. The unit voice actors are terrific, with each unit having a different accent depending its origins. Not much to say here, simply search out the music and you will see what I'm talking about yourselves.\n\nStory: 10/10\n\nYour faction, your crown, your rules. You can do whatever you want. The Pope calls for a Crusade? You have every right to refuse. From time to time, several missions will pop-up, either from the Pope, the Council of Nobles etc. But they merely guide you, not dictate the course of your history. If I had 1 gold for every Crusade I tossed aside, I would be reach enough to but the whole Europe. Go out there and conquer any land you want. However, in order to win the campaign, certain rules apply, eg holding 45 cities, Paris, Dublin etc.\n\nOverall: 9.1/10\n\nOn the downside, being an old game it utilised GameSpy for multiplayer combat, but after the Gamespy servers, and company in general, were shut down, its multiplayer is nearly non-existent. I believe only LAN battles are possible nowadays. The outdated graphics migh be annoying, but we are talking about a 2005 game here.\n\nWARNING: I HAVE TO WARN YOU ABOUT SOMETHING AS WELL\n\nThe steam launcher for Medieval 2 has some buggy issues. The launcher opens before the game and instead of closing, it's still running as you play and even after you are finished and close Medieval. In order to solve it, open task manager, click tasks/process and end the Launcher.exe task. Then you are good to go.\n\nTL;DR I reccomend this game with closed eyes. Being a fan of the TW series and after playing all of the games, I crown Medieval as King of the series. Definitely worth buying.","April 8, 2014","true","267.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The middle age setting is amazing and the graphics hold up pretty well for how old it is now. Nothing beats slaughtering thousands of enemies using English Longbowmen or Venetian Heavy infantry, the battles are just so large and require knowledge of tactics. One thing that anoys me is the enemy campaign AI and the diplomacy, the AI doesn't raise balanced armies and is usually just lots of the same unit type. The differences that set apart all of the factions really make a difference when playing, for exapmle using the English you want to be building armies that are focused on using Longbowmen but other factions don't have that option.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TMono/recommended/4700/","TMono","TMonoLight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TMono/","11 products in account","Medieval II: Total War has to be my current favorite of the Total War series. I'll get the bad parts out of the way first...\n\nIssuing commands to units can sometimes be clunky, such as cavalry not pursuing broken enemies or simply dancing around them without actually killing or capturing any, or only a minor percentage of soldiers actually complying with your order to march, run or charge. Moving troops through settlements can be irritating as well as they often decide against using a straight path leading to the centre because it's slightly more narrow than the normal pathways.\n\nThe AI in the campaign also behaves with very little forward thinking, even on the hardest difficulty, being more than willing to break off an alliance and trade rights for the sake of attacking a settlement that is lightly defended, or to blockade an empty port for some extra money, oblivious to the outcome of their actions. Diplomacy can be irritating in later turns, especially against enemy factions, even when they are completely outmatched they will stubbornly refuse a ceasefire even at the cost of total defeat, all because of a war that started with a minor battle over some trivial port or minor town. The chivalry/ dread levels are only of real use for role play, if you're just going for world domination it's completely pointless. Finally the agents skills don't appear to be as relevant to successful missions as they should be, I myself have experienced a surprisingly high number of failed acquisitions, spy infiltrations, etc despite the chance of success being at 95%\n\nSo what do I actually LIKE about this game? For one. the time period. Western Europe is struggling to recover from the fall of Western Rome, the surviving Eastern Empire struggles to reclaim it's losses while fending off the strength of the Turks, the Reconquista in Iberia, the Crusades to reclaim the lands that saw the birth of Christianity and so much more.\n\nUnit types still follow patterns of weaknesses/ strengths similar to the system in Rome TW but has been adapted to fit medieval warfare very well. Knights, while they are of a high quality, are not overpowered super-soldiers and in the early campaign their costly upkeep makes them a less appealing choice. I also really admire how weapon and armour upgrades are actually visible on the soldiers now. While weapon upgrades are limited to bronze and armours varying from Gold to non-existent, it adds more realism to the situation. The type of armour also varies depending on the type of unit - Light or Heavy.\n\nThe campaign, while irritating at times, does have some feeling of authenticity to it. The AI behaves in a way that leaves you wondering "what are you thinking?" which matches the unpredictable nature of any human, often acting in a way that leaves outsiders confused at their motivations or goals. Diplomacy can be tricky as even establishing trade with a faction, for example France, can lead to a rival of that faction becoming hostile toward you. If you want to play this game diplomatically then I wish you luck because politics in this campaign are very delicate and complicated right from the get go. The campaign continues to flow forward with new developments always happening, new technologies from Asia to learn and master, new locations to go to and discover, new enemies to face or evade and the constant concerns of managing your country to adapt and survive an ever changing world.\nThen there's the inclusion of settlement types - cultural and military hubs. Instead of building armies inside your own cities you now focus the military in castles while cities are used for finance, religion and more cultural acitivities. Managing which territories will house a castle/ city puts a new twist into the campaign in terms of growing your own faction, espionage and war in general. I.e. Taking enemy castles weakens their military but frees up their economy, taking enemy cities weakens their economy but leaves their military more intact.\n\nTo sum up, this game has my favorite campaign of the series thus far and battles, while not my favorite, can still be entertaining and still presents the same amount of challenge of previous installments. I would rate this game 8/10 very good, not perfect but I would recommend it for any fan of of the series and any fan of turn based strategy.","July 4, 2015","true","261.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did play this game for many hours(it reset after deleting the game due to mod problems) and don't believe adding another review will help an older and known game as such.  However, I do write this review in hopes to provide a small aid to communities that are trying to revert Total War series to what it was.  I love Rome II and liked Attila.  The graphcis, battles and the settings were all to my likings.  However, they seem to lack so much compared to Medieval II.  The campaign in Medieval II are so much more dramatic and rich with random events that all together weave a great story.  The Crusade and the Pope, Jihad, and Americas made the campaign much more interesting than just alliance wars.  I can sit here and list all the features that I like better than the newer games.  The newers games do have impressive visuals and smoother combat, as Medieval units sometimes seem completely mindless of the battle.  As far as the advantage of the newer games go, that is it.  Overall, Medieval II has much more culture varieties, random happenings to keep the faction instable, and more events to drive the campaign and make it feel fresh even after several turns.  When the next historical Total War comes out, I believe it should model itself more like Medieval II than the newer games.","December 27, 2015","true","79.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign map is turn based, but all battles are fought in real time.  when this game came out it was cutting edge and the battles were jaw dropping, they still look allright in 2015 but are far from stunning.  if it is on sale and you prefer the medieval setting then this is the totatl war for you, otherwise maybe get shogun.","April 24, 2015","true","70.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll sum it up in one word. Mods. Without all the beautiful mods, that have been created by an amazing community, I wouldn't have loved this game as much as I currently do. Without the mods it is still an amazing game. One of the best, if not the best current Total War. Amazing cavalry charge, beautiful arrow stagger, and even those awesome armor upgrades. If you want to start playing Total War then I urge you to buy this game.\n\nDoes it have it's cons? Yes, yes it does. There are many bugs and glitches. I've encountered a few crashes, and since this an older game be ready for lag if you try to have the graphics and unit sizes to the highest setting. There have been a couple bugs that annoy the ever-living crap outta me. Such as during Sieges, you try to run your archers off the walls but half of them stay there. If you try to set them up behind the wall they were just on, prepare for stupid unit Ai. They form up against the buildings or something stupid like that.\n\nEven with the oldness, the bugs, the crashes. I still give this game a 10/10 because of the amazing mods it has.\n\nThird Age: Total War\nElder Scrolls: Total War\nCall of Warhammer: Total War\nPlanetary War: Total War\n\nJust to name the four I use. So buy it, buy Kingdoms with it. Then go on to download all the mods. If you don't then get excommunicated scrub.","January 4","true","318.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has some issues now in terms of poor wide screen support and stuff like difficulty of mod installing for steam version, but its still a great and addictive game. Over the years communnity around it made it only better with lots of amazing mods like LotR themed Third Age:Total War and Warhammer fantasy themed Age Of Warhammer:Total War(which is btw without doubt is one of the reasons we get Warhammer:Total War now). I played hundreds of hours of this game and never got tired of it, and I could tell you hell of a lot of stories what happened within it in that time, but it would take too long. So just know that like any good game, this one allows you to come up with stories of your own while having a great time playing and enjoying most of its aspects.","January 12","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a most definite 4 thumbs up! If you love strategy and have always wanted to test your skills then here is the PERFECT game for you! There's so many campaigns and each one for each faction is differernt in its own way. Also, each faction has a few perks that none of the others have; for instamce: English, Longbowmen; French, Courageous Knights; HRE (Holy Roman Empire), has average everything; so on and so forth. There's so many different factions that if I wrote down all their strengths and weaknesses it would take me about an hour to do so! And even on the lowest graphics setting it still doesn't look half bad. It also has historical battles like Agincourt, Hastings, I think it has Stamford Bridge but not for sure. Please don't hesitate to buy it because of the price its well worth it! (in fact, i bought it for $5 while it was on sale :D) I hope to see you on guys!\nPlease play this game guys you'd love it especially if you download the Kingdoms DLC whick isn't needed or anything but it adds a lot more campaigns to be played.\n\nAlso, this game alerts you to events that are happening in the world (like the Black Plague or the Mongolian invasion). Thus forcing you to respond to the changes in your environment by either building more defensive structures and training more troops in one area or maneuvering soldiers to another position.

I can't say the game is incredibly hard to play, because it isn't, it's easy to learn. But the game is hard to master...\n\nThe base game is a little broken, for instance im playing as the Holy Roman Empire right now and i'm being invaded on all sides. I got poland, venice, millan, and france all attacking me, yet im alive because i win the battles (but my economy is taking a toll for the worse).\nBut if this is bugging you, you want a total war game where it's more realistic? Get the 'Stainless Steal' mod that improves the core game to be more realistic and hard. Essentially making the game a tonne better.\n\nbut i'm not really all for that, but i do lord of the rings. The lord of the rings mod allowed me to  take back moria and kill balrog as the drawves, there were so many dead drawves... 	 but it also allowed me to get a good feel of lotr as it has everything that the books have and the movies missed (though based on the movies visually).\n\nBut alot of people want to get the new total war warhammer game, but you probably have heard (or you haven't whatever) of the "Rage of the dark gods" which is so indepth that you have chaos drawves, orks, drawves, vampire counts, empire, all the different chaos gods, kislev, beast men and more. So you have a free mods that's probably more indepth than the new game comming out.\n\nSo in the end, if you want a medievil tw game then get it, you want a realistic tw medevil game then get Stainless steal mod when you get it, you want a lord of the rings strategy game then get this and the mod, you want to get total war warhammer then get it.\n\nDo mind that the mods require kingdoms, which is a dlc that adds (i think) 5 new campaigns that are each build on the base game (they include NEW campaigns, not just factions like in rome2/atilla)","March 19","true","115.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/assimulo/recommended/4700/","assimulo","Assimulo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/assimulo/","30 products in account","Medieval 2: Total War is one of the best games from the Total War series. The game itself is really in-depth, and the strategy is so immersive and complex. Even the campaign map has hidden strategies for managing the diplomacy of your kingdom, which makes the seemingly uncalled for attacks from neighboring nations look a lot less random. The battlefields and units are designed very well and the whole game looks very polished. Battle strategies can be somewhat complex, but once you get the hang of them you will feel like a 5 star general. Not to mention the fact that you can even modify the game to play as the papal states, which has influence over most European factions. I haven't tried any big mods for this game yet, but I've heard about many of them, so it's nice to know that there are options out there in the unlikely event that I ever get bored with the main game. If you're looking to buy anything on Steam, this is a game you should seriously consider adding to your library.

This game is a most definite 4 thumbs up! If you love strategy and have always wanted to test your skills then here is the PERFECT game for you! There's so many campaigns and each one for each faction is differernt in its own way. Also, each faction has a few perks that none of the others have; for instamce: English, Longbowmen; French, Courageous Knights; HRE (Holy Roman Empire), has average everything; so on and so forth. There's so many different factions that if I wrote down all their strengths and weaknesses it would take me about an hour to do so! And even on the lowest graphics setting it still doesn't look half bad. It also has historical battles like Agincourt, Hastings, I think it has Stamford Bridge but not for sure. Please don't hesitate to buy it because of the price its well worth it! (in fact, i bought it for $5 while it was on sale :D) I hope to see you on guys!\nPlease play this game guys you'd love it especially if you download the Kingdoms DLC whick isn't needed or anything but it adds a lot more campaigns to be played.\n\nAlso, this game alerts you to events that are happening in the world (like the Black Plague or the Mongolian invasion). Thus forcing you to respond to the changes in your environment by either building more defensive structures and training more troops in one area or maneuvering soldiers to another position.

It has some issues now in terms of poor wide screen support and stuff like difficulty of mod installing for steam version, but its still a great and addictive game. Over the years communnity around it made it only better with lots of amazing mods like LotR themed Third Age:Total War and Warhammer fantasy themed Age Of Warhammer:Total War(which is btw without doubt is one of the reasons we get Warhammer:Total War now). I played hundreds of hours of this game and never got tired of it, and I could tell you hell of a lot of stories what happened within it in that time, but it would take too long.

It has some issues now in terms of poor wide screen support and stuff like difficulty of mod installing for steam version, but its still a great and addictive game. Over the years communnity around it made it only better with lots of amazing mods like LotR themed Third Age:Total War and Warhammer fantasy themed Age Of Warhammer:Total War(which is btw without doubt is one of the reasons we get Warhammer:Total War now). I played hundreds of hours of this game and never got tired of it, and I could tell you hell of a lot of stories what happened within it in that time, but it would take too long. So just know that like any good game, this one allows you to come up with stories of your own while having a great time playing and enjoying most of its aspects.","January 12","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before I had the steam version I logged 600 hours on this game, and that was WITHOUT mods. The major strength is that you can pretty much play the campaigns any way you want with minimal interference from the "story" , unlike Napoleon, R2, and Attila. You create your own history instead of being pushed into following actual history.\n\nThe AI might be a bit dumb and it has its fair sure of bugs and glitches, but there's no DLC.\n\nSupposedly the latest steam version doesn't let you use certain mods, hasn't been an issue for me. I'd recommend two mods that I always use: Retrofit (takes kindoms features into the M2 grand campaign) and Crimson Tide (lots more blood and dirt).","November 2, 2015","true","82.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are perfectly acceptable and game runs flawlessly. It has a lot of great additions and cool features like Princess', Priests etc. The campaign is very gripping and more challenging than most of the TW titles partly because of the size of the other factions. I really like the upgrading and recruiting system of Medieval 2 as unlike other TW games, you cant have the best soldiers in every settlement and often dont have a perfect army, so it forces you to thing and plan around your weaknesses. The soundtrack is also very good, it loads super fast and is a blast to play. I much prefer this game to Rome 2 and im convinced Medieval 2 is a close rival with Rome 1 to be the best TW game ever!!!!!\n\nGot to be rated a 5/5 or 9/10 - I defenitely recommend this game for peoples who like TW, or the Medieval period.

And it is worth purchasing because it is a phenomenal RTS game and a great addition to the Total War series. The graphics have aged a bit but the game still looks good. Multiplayer is fun but the single-player campaign is what takes the cake. A huge map with many factions to choose from initially, later each defeated nation is unlocked as playable in the campaign. The gameplay is divided into 3 parts just like in RTW - cities management, sea battles and land battles. The management is great but the land battles are what makes this a classic. Most of the units, even siege engines, are nicely done and serve a purpose. The fighting is tactical and fair, although sometimes rather difficult. The AI still has some problems but usually just minor issues. On top of all this are the mods, the INCREDIBLE mods. There are so many it would be hard to write all the good ones but MY personal favourites are Stainless Steel, Europa Babarorum 2 & Third Age Total War. This game is worth your money if you like RTS games and is a great successor to RTW!","January 14, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have spent a lot of time conquering the French, The Holy Roman Empire and Spain as England. Although I have yet to have an army of Dismounted English Knights, or Armoured Swordsmen legitimatly, I have only got up to a few of each in an army. There are countless mods for this game, making it even better. My favorites are Rage of Dark Gods, which takes place in the Warhammer universe. Another is Third Age, a Lord of the Rings mod. They are both great mods. I have spent countless hours on this game. Even though it says '99 Hours Played.' Thats a lie. I have played 200 hours easily in this game. Even when you have no internet, this game CAN be played. One of my go to games if we have no internet. Some Pros and Cons\nPros:\n- You get to have your own army\n- You are a king of an empire, many to choose from\n- Not laggy at all, even with a good computer\n- Very challenging, I consider this a good thing\n- Historical Characters in game\n- Historical Battles you can play\n- You get to play in custom battles, with OP(Over Powered) units.\n- 5 types of mods w/ Kingdoms expansion. (As of now, I think it comes just with base game.) Base Game, Americas, Crusades, Brittania, and Teutonic.\nCons:\n- Bad Graphics (Im a texture kinda guy.)\n- Tends to bug out sometimes, its an old game.\n- Other Kingdoms may have an advantage over you in early game depending on their Pros and Cons (Says when you got to pick a kingdom)\n\nOverall, this game is really good. I love it so much, it would definetly recommend you get it right away.

Objectively speaking there is an undeniable quantity of value in this game, before I downloaded mods I had about 200 hours. The vanilla version of this game is excellent. I could even play the campaign mode of the vanilla version after playing the campaign mode of these mods. Battles in this game are the best it will ever be and with multiple medieval eras from early to high to late where you have musket men and cannons. I could have an army of Mongolian cavalry fight an army of French pikemen and musket men. Possibilities in the battles are endless! Also, battles require tactical positioning, flanking, planning and using your brain in general. If you don’t like to use your brain, than don’t buy this game. If you do, however, you will find very interesting and creative ways to defeat your enemies. When to attack the enemy or hold position and send spearmen to the front, when you should retreat or hold fast. There is just so much fun to have in battles.\nThe Campaign mode has no story, like every other Total War game, based on the situation of your nation and other nations, plans and ambitions, you make your own story. Be the king of England and defeat the French once and for all, forge an empire of 2 land masses. Play as Byzantium and retake lost lands and lost lands of the Roman empire. When it comes to recruitment and construction it is balanced. Recruitment pools determine how many units you can recruit per turn and how long you must wait until you can recruit another one of the same unit. This prevents large and massive armies of heavy infantry running all over the place. Diplomacy feels real as in the medieval times there were no phones to call other leaders. Countries had to send a diplomat and wait for a response. Diplomacy is not as in depth as it could be, but this game is focused around war and military. Keep that in mind when you play the campaign mode. Trade, alliances, embargos, vassals, military access, the basics are all there. Events happen in the campaign mode throughout such as the Mongolian invasion, the discovery of gunpowder and the new world, and yes, this game includes the plague.\nOverall, unless you are too stupid to use your brain in coordination and deep thought, you will enjoy this game and get your money’s worth without a doubt. Even at full retail price I would still find my money’s worth. Go buy it on sale if you are still sceptical, I did it, too.\nI give this game a full 10/10!","December 16, 2015","true","324.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The game keep the original "taste" of the old ones. I played Napoleon: Total War and Rome 2, and i have to say that MTW2 looks much better in some parts. The battles are more "bloody" than the new ones. Also, Rome 2, looks unfinished and is poorly optimized (some stupid people say that Rome 2 the best Total War ever hahaha). I was "lucky" to play the 4 days trial. Many lag. Battles are clunky and the units looks like plastic T_T.\n\nAnyway, MT2 it still be amazing game with that graphics (2006). I played with some graphic mods for enjoy it with my powerful PC. I will not think it more, and buy this AWASOME RTS game :)\n\nI give this game 9 / 10\n\n","October 2, 2014","true","18.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you are a fan of strategy and you didn't play this,you miss on a lot.\n\nEven if this is a pretty old game as of this review,it still feels relevant.I love almost everything about it.\n\nIt has everything you would want from a medieval strategy game.You are the ruler of your country.You can amass armies and take cities and destroy empires or you can settle down and build your economy.\n\nThe RTS(Real Time Strategy) part of it is really well done.It feels so good to control huge armies and move them across the battlefield.The game has archers,cavalry,heavy infantry,siege weapons and a lot more units that you can combine and create a formidable force.\n\nThe TBS(Turn Based Strategy) part of it is also rewarding and fun.It handles religion and trading pretty well but I feel like the diplomacy is lacking.The AI is pretty good but it feels like everyone is your enemy even if you are allied to them.At the first chance they will backstab you,that is a flaw in my opinion.You can choose to either fight your battles or auto-resolve them.Auto-resolving them is pretty good and it won't screw you over if you do now have the time to fight your battles.\n\nThis game has a lot of very good mods which enhance the game in every possible way so if you find the game appealing without the mods you'll enjoy it even more with the mods.\n\n\n\n","January 12, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
