There's no good online (yeah, wtf Team17), no steamworks matchmaking, I don't remember seeing a direct IP connection so I guess you will have to use Hamachi and similar software to play with friends without lag, because there's just this UK Wormnet master server where I was unable to join a single damn match and there's no people whatsoever, "the perfect online gaming experience"?! yeah sure. Did I mention the game crashed 3 times in 20 minutes? what the hell? and there are people having compatibility and optimization issues as well in the forums. I heard people having FPS problems as well, so yeah, another strike.\n\nDon't bother buying this, don't even think of it, is a copy-paste of the original game with no improvement aside from the 1080p gameplay, all it's features could be achieved with a free mod for t he original game. If you are wondering why I don't have this in my library anymore, it's because I asked for a refund, you should do the same. Developers should learn how to do a proper "remastered", don't give them your money so they can undestand that and stop releasing lazy games like this.\n\nIf you want a true 2D Worms experience, buy Armageddon.","July 16, 2015","false","0.4"," 643 of 688 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","643","688","11","19"

The reason for the masses of bad reviews is because Team 17's idea of "Remastered" is far from the truth of what a remastered version of a game should be. As a seasoned fan of the Worms series ever since the Amiga days, it really pains me to click "Not Recommended" on this review...\n\nWorms World Party Remastered, it's essentially exactly the same as the original, but with 1080p In-game Graphics (this does not include the in-game menus unfortunately) and 60 FPS gameplay, both of which have been a part of Worms Armageddon for a long time now, so ultimately it's nothing new, and seeming as how they're almost exactly the same game, it feels very much like we have been cheated paying £10.00 for something that isn't new and far from actually being remastered.\n\nWorms World Party itself does offer a handful of features and content that were never included in Worms Armageddon, the Wormpot options for example make for a ton of unique options to give the gameplay a litlte more variety, it also has more missions and a co-op online mode, but aside from that, Worms Armageddon is easily still the superior game due-to the fact that it has recieved constant updates for many, many years after it's release.\n\nWhat I expected to get from Worms World Party Remastered was the second coming of a Worms Armageddon so to speak, the entire game being completely remastered, updated and with a new layer of polish to compensate for todays standards, but most of the updated and awesome features included in Worms Armageddon were not included in Worms World Party Remastered, what we were left with was nothing more than an option to use some remastered sound effects as opposed to the classic ones. I am thankful that the new sounds are fully optional instead of being forced down your throat though as it just doesn't feel the same without the classics.\n\nRight now, this needs a lot of work to justify it's price tag and the title of "Remastered", online play doesn't even work properly as of the moment without some pain-staking workarounds (see the 'Guides' section on the Community Hub), the frame rate can sometimes be incredibly choppy and the fact that Team 17 didn't think to include the updates that Worms Armageddon received just baffles me...\nJust before this was released, they delayed it's release a little longer after discovering a bug that they wanted to fix first, which shows Team 17 care about their products, they always have done and I salute them for that, but re-releasing a game that hit shelves over a decade ago when Worms Armageddon is already available and vastly superior is just something that I can't support.\n\nI am hoping that this game gets the patches that it deserves and truly needs to live up to what we all hoped it would be, but until that happens, I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this to anybody else, I even told my brothers to steer well clear of this game and stick with Worms Armageddon instead, and I give the same advice to all of you. Don't pay for an inferior product when there is a better and very similar option available instead.","July 18, 2015","false","22.5"," 306 of 318 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","306","318","5","3"

One of the best games I have ever played.\n- You have Wormpot options. Enable blood, x2 damage etc.. Something Worms Armageddon never had.\n\nCons:\n- Menus are 640x480\n- No Windowed Mode (If you have double or more screen your mouse can easily go to the other screens while you are playing)\n- Almost impossible to play online. Even Armageddon have 60-100 online players in their lobbies. WWPR have max 10 players. (Same like other Worms games - I am looking at you 3D Worms games - unable to play online because of lack of players)\n- Even you find enough people to play. You need to struggle like 15 to 90 minutes open ports, change your net settings etc to host a decent game. Even at Worms Armageddon you can easily host a game with hostingbuddy but not at wwpr.\n- Some voices are wrong, missing.\n\nIf you have Worms Armageddon or Worms World Party do not buy that game. If you dont have well I think Worms Armageddon is still better. At least you can able to play online...

I didn't see a keyboard rebinding menu at all in the options, only a button that opens a screen displaying gamepad controls. The keyboard controls were awkward because I had to use the jump button before I could even move at all, and the keybinds were not displayed for me anywhere.\n\nI am severly disappointed with the quality of this game and I hope that they take the criticism recieved on board.

The only changes applied is the 1080p option, and adding "Remastered" to the title's name. You might be dissapointed about this game. You might feel like "Oh  boy, WWP! What a nostalgic game, I can't wait to play it!" And unfortunately you have became, or will become something like "Well, this is even worse than the original WWP lol."\n\nWell if you want to get the retro Worms experience you were looking for, I suggest you to refund this game and buy Worms Armageddon instead. You may thinking "Why? Worms Armageddon is prequel of Worms World Party. Probably it's even worse." Well guess what? It's far better game than you can imagine. It's the perfect online gaming expreince Team17 talking about. Well though, funny thing is Team17 didn't do much to improve, the superiorities of WA are there thanks to it's fanbase and 2 coder (Deadcode and Cybershadow) hired by Team17 from community to make patches.\n\nWell you might be wondering why should I refund WWPR, and get WA instead? What are those superior features of WA? You may think I'll just wait a bit for WWPR to get his patches etc. Well, don't wait! Everything you are waiting for is in Worms Armageddon!\n\nLet me count some, for example bigger sized map support, you can play on maps with any size, you can play on any png-8 bit maps in WA. Also replay recording. You can watch played games exactly how they happened. And replay files are ridicilously small, such as between 100kb-500 kb. And there are very active community, with over 50 new game modes. There are active leagues working with replay sharing, if you win a game, you send your replay as a proof for your victory. And you can watch every replay of any game whenever you want. There are over 200k games played on leagues so far! And it's still active. For example, the recent games page of the most active league, TUS:\nhttp://tus-wa.com/leagues/recent-games/\n\nAbout new game modes I previously mentioned. For example, you remember the famous ninja rope right? Imagine racing on a map with it, it's called Rope Race in WA. An example video of a Rope Race:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=wXJpLQldlJ4\n\nWell, do you want to know what other spectacular features the game has? Check this video on wormtube, to understand why Worms Armageddon is so superior to Worms World Party Remastered:\nhttp://wormtube.worms2d.info/81/wa_beta_showdown\n\nYou might be thinking is this a Worms Armageddon promotion or WWP Remastered review? Well the reason why I talked about WA is, WA became a such game with only 2 people and the fanbase. And Team17, after all those years, with all the resources they had, they can't even come up with a better game. That's why this game is so bad and that's why I lost my respect against Team17. And I want people to have the game they deserve, Worms Armageddon.","July 17, 2015","false","0.6"," 77 of 91 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","77","91","0","4"

It could be because of my graphics drivers but I don't have this issue with other games.\nThe mouse cursor still tracks like it is on a 4:3 screen so moving up and down is normal but left and right movements of the cursor are just too fast.\n\nI have 3 screens and WWP was playing in the centre screen.\nNow the game menu runs in psudeo full screen which caused some issues.\nWhen you move the mouse to the left or right of the game window you actually scroll on to the other screens that arent used in the game. You try to move the cursor back to the game screen and it sometimes blocks the cursor leaving it on the unused screen.\nI had to move the cursor back and forth a few times and it eventually went back to the game screen. N.B. because the left and right scroll is accelerated due to the 4:3 stretch you can get the cursor to the middle screen but I actually had the cursor go from my left screen, past the WWP screen in the middle, and to my right screen because the cursor was so fast in the game screen.\n\nStarting a game is just like it used to be on the original WWP but the stretched menus just don't look nice.\n\nOnce in a game it played just like it used to.\nThe updated sounds were nice but just didn't match the graphics.\nThe graphics are the same as the original WWP and the old soundbanks just fit better.\nMoving the cursor off the screen isn't a problem during a game since moving the mouse will just move the camera or weapon selection cursor.\n\nThe game defaulted to my 2560x1440 graphics but the game didn't run like it was 60FPS.\nIt was a bit choppy and just seemed dated.\nI quit the match changed the graphics to 1680x1050.\nI loaded a match and it was smooth but still looked the same as WWP back in the day.\nI quit WWP completely and saw that because I changed the game resolution to a lower resolution than my 2560x1440 desktop it had shifted all of my cursors that were on the lower part of the desktop up higher!\nLuckily I have DesktopOK running so I can just restore the icons to their original positions easily but this is just rediculous.\n\nThis game was a rushed port, which is odd since they had delays, and I recommend only die hard Worms fans purchase it.\n\nI didn't try online play and only had a quick few test solo games and it plays ok in lower resolutions but the implimentation of the game seems like it's still designed for Windows 95/98 or XP.\n\nOne other issue that I encountered was loading the game.\nIf you load the game and in the part with the developer Team 17 and Tick Tock names appear you click on a different screen the game screen will minimize but you can't restore it.\nAlt-Tab doesn't show the game is running and I had to kill W2.exe with task manager to quit and then I reloaded the game.\n\nThere's just too many issues with the game and I think it should have been redesigned for Windows 7/8/10 not just ported like this.\n\nTeam 17 please release some major patches to fix everything that is broken so we can enjoy this game on our new computers without these issues.","July 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 51 of 59 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","51","59","0","1"

I do not consider myself a negative or toxic person, but this "remastered" version is bringing out the worst part of me.\n\nMe and my mates have been playing Worms World Party on LAN for ages now. We've used the original version, and that have been troublesome and exhausting at times. But more often than not we managed to pull through all the nonsense and actually have fun. We were very happy to see that Team 17 was going to release a remastered version and put it on Steam. We really didn't care much about the updated graphics, we just wanted to enjoy this little gem over the internet.\n\nSo why am I fuming? Why am I not recommending this game?\n\nWell for starters, they really didn't remaster anything. It's so called 1080 - 60 FPS, but that is simply not true. It's a blatant ♥♥♥♥ing lie. Whenever you blow something up (and that is the ♥♥♥♥ING PURPOSE OF THE GAME), the whole screen freezes and the game drops BELOW 1 fps. And keep in mind this game is older than ♥♥♥♥. And this happens for everyone in all game modes. Have Team 17 ever heard about testing? How the ♥♥♥♥ can a bug like that be able to survive to the launch? Are everyone at Team 17 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?\n\nI must admit I was a bit disappointed about that. But you know what, for me it is not game breaking. You can still enjoy a nice round of fun Worms with your friends even if the FPS is terrible. So why am I still not going to recommend this game?\n\nBecause you can not play over the internet. Well you can sometimes. A few times. But mostly you can't. Wormnet is really unstable, or it is something else with the game that is really unstable. Team 17 doesn't know. Team 17 doesn't care. Team 17 can suck my hairy testicles. And it really doesn't make any sense as to when or why you can or can't play the game online.\n\nI'm gonna round this review off with a friendly tip for whoever is in charge of remastering things at Team 17. When you remaster stuff, please make sure it works, please make sure the game does not get WORSE than the original game. Because when people buy a remastered version of a game they already own, and the remastered version eats donkeyass compared to the original game, people are going to be upset. And the bugs and problems with the remastered version are not exactly very well hidden and only affects very few people.

(not that there's many people to compete with...)\n\nthis game doesn't utilize any of the features added to Worms Armageddon over the past 14 years. not that it really matters because it would have been a wasted effort anyway. this release was dead on arrival and will never revive.\n\nthe new sound effects are taken from some of the latest Worms games, they are not exactly new. most of them fit well enough, but it is good that they are optional. the implied "Full Controller Support" is just a lie, as there is no way to remap any of the buttons. unless you have a xbox controller, you are better off just using software like joy2key. not sure why anyone would want to play this game with a controller anyway.\n\n"Imagine taking the perfect online gaming experience"; as far as Worms go, that's Worms Armageddon. it is updated and maintained by people who actually care about the game. team17 do not even know what made armageddon so great and keep on releasing inferior and unnecessary additions to the franchise. this release in particular is a cheap cash grab pandering to nostalgia, for the people who are not aware that WA exists and has been taken care of.\n\nwhat should have been done instead is a DLC (and a free update for owners of the original WWP) for Worms Armageddon that migrates all original Worms World Party content to the better version of the engine. when (if ever, hopefully) WWP exclusive content becomes usable in WA, all iterations of WWP will become fully obsolete.","July 26, 2015","false","11.2"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","34","41","2","0"

Maybe it wasn't clear for some people previously, so I'll try again to make them understand better about my opinion on this game:\n\nAs a Worms Ultimate Mayhem player, I was curious about this WWPR and I purchased it to find out if it's a good Worms. The thing is, I couldn't have gone far enough. Why? Probably not because of the game itself, which seems quite feature-rich and fun for some players here. I requested (and obtained) a refund because of the so-called remastering we've been promised. I think it is just some kind of emulation of the old game, with some tweaks to ensure it works on the latest Windows:\n\n1-Menus and UI (in Menus) aren't upscaled, they are stuck to default resolution from back then when the game was released for the first time;\n2-There's no Windowed mode (I guess it wasn't available in the first release either, but for a remaster, we could have expected to see such a "basic" feature available on day one);\n3-Alt+Tab should be avoided with this game (I was stuck once, unable to do anything with the mouse, I had to open the task manager and kill the game, hurray...);\n4-The 1080p/60 fps combo: 1080p only during a match, and framerate usually drops to 50 and below.\n\nSelling a game with such a price for such a lazy emulation is quite steep...\n\nYou'd better keep playing at your current Worms titles than buying this one.","July 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","8"

However, this still doesn't remove the annoyance factor and occasional issues caused by the low resolution menu.\n\n**Original Review**\nI've spent countless hours playing the original version of Worms World Party on the Sega Dreamcast. When I saw the announcement that this was coming in a "remastered" version to PC I could not have been more excited.\n\nUnfortunately, this game did not deliver like I thought it would on Day 1. As many others have noted, the menu screen is at a very low resolution. With Team17 touting 1080p and 60FPS, one would think that they would deliver this "standard" throughout every aspect of the game.\n\nAll I can say is this... If you are interested in this game, just give it some more time for Team17 to fix some of the Day 1 issues. However, with the "trend" in gaming of companies delivering broken products on Day 1, I am not happy that Team17 fell into this trap as well.\n\nA bit of a PSA to game companies: Please delay your game if you know it is not ready for release yet. You have a greater chance of losing fans if you release broken product than if you were to delay the game and have a proper release.","July 16, 2015","false","1.4"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","34","43","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/270910/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Worms World Party Remastered is a re-release of the 2001 smash hit, Worms World Party. This game was released in July 2015.  The remastered edition has proven to not be as popular as the predecessors with only 6000 people picking this game up from Steam.\n\nThe gameplay of Worms World Party Remastered is essentially the same as the original game. Absolutely everything is the same. The huge selection of weapons in your worm’s arsenal makes a return; the classics are still here such as bazookas and grenades, along with some of the newer weapons such as exploding sheep, homing pigeons and napalm strikes. The game has a single player mode, online multiplayer, and local multiplayer. I only played a couple of matches in the single player mode against the AI, but this proved to be a difficult matter, simply because the AI in this game totally knows how to control their weapons more than me, and can take the wind and other elements into consideration, meaning you'll probably get beaten.\n\nThat being said, the multiplayer is where you'll get the most fun out of Worms as you should well know if you played the other games in the series. The online play is broken though, I tried playing and it is a convoluted mess. You have to put in IP addresses of servers, ports, everything that shouldn't be needed to be done in a remastered version of the game - when I finally managed to get it all set up, there was two people playing...two people in the multiplayer side of this game. There was no point me trying to get into the game as they were just sat in their own two separate lobbies themselves.  Where I had the most enjoyment and gameplay was in the local multiplayer playing with my partner.\n\nBefore you start a match, you get to create your own team of worms, giving your team a name, then naming all of your individual worms - next you can give your team a style of voice, with a large selection of accents to just from, customize your worms grave stones, and your teams flag. Finally you also get to choose your teams "victory" music which plays when you win a match.  The hot potatoes style gameplay of passing the controller between each other works just fine, as we were both laughing at each other's failings on their turns. One matched slowly turned into eight or nine matches, it became very competitive at times too.\n\nThe graphics in Worms World Party Remastered didn't really get a massive revamp over the previous games; the resolution did get upped to 1080p though, which is a nice plus to see. The UI is clean and easy to navigate around. The audio in Worms’s games is always fascinating to me. The cute little worm voices which act as a sort of commentator to your turns all have a comical value attached to their lines. All of the weapons have an over the top sound effect with them too. The holy hand grenade is just beautiful\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPryqNLXV7E\n\nWorms is always a pick and play sort of game, I had played the previous game so I knew what to do, but my partner who had never played a worms game before was easily able to pick up the controls after a turn or two of playing, don't tell her I said this, but she actually got quite good and managed to beat me more times than I am happy to admit! If you feel that you want a little extra challenge in the game though, you can give one team more worms than the other one, giving you a handicap situation.\n\nEvery single match in worms has a randomly generated world. You'll never fight on the same map more than once. The worlds which the game creates can sometimes give one team an unfair advantage, such as hiding a couple of worms in a remote location with no hope of them either doing anything remotely for a few turns, but this also means they can't get hurt for a few turns.  Along with the randomly generated terrain, there are also a number of weapon crate drops which happen at random points too; these crates hold the more rarer and powerful weapons such as nuclear tests and air strikes for example. On top of these weapon crates, you'll also find utility crates which hold more useful tools such as blowtorches, parachutes, teleports and many more of the more random items in the arsenal.\n\nWorms World Party Remastered does not have an end to the amount of content you can get out of it. You could literally play this game for hours on end and not get bored of it. We have only been playing the game for three hours now and see no reason for us wanting to stop anytime soon. This is definitely a game to keep installed for when you want to have a couple of games with your friends on the local multiplayer mode.\n\nEven though Worms World Party Remastered is supposedly the better version of the World Party game, it still had technical problems. Firstly, the game will refuse to run if your screens resolution is anything higher than 1080p. I had to lower my settings to this from 4k in Windows before I could even get past the main menu screen. The technical jargon that you need to do for any sort of online multiplayer should not be present in a remastered game. The game is on Steam so it should just run off the Steams network multiplayer options. Be warned, when playing online too; your external IP address is clearly shown for everyone to see... The only other small issue is that the menus also don't show in 1080, they are in 640 by 480. Whilst this isn’t a massive problem, the game shouldn’t really be advertising itself for being completely 1080. The game also works very well with the Steam controller as well as the regular Xbox pad.\n\nWorms World Party Remastered is definitely a game I will recommend, purely because it works on newer operating systems without you having to download patches and mods. I will say that you should only be looking at picking this game up if you plan on playing it locally with friends. The single player is not worth it, and the online multiplayer is non-existent now once you manage to get past the strange setup. Playing this game with friends will bring plenty of exciting times and tons of fun for a very little price of £10, 99.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Yes.\n\nShould you buy this game? No.\n\nWorms World Party is at it's core, the great 2D Worms game that we have all come to love over the years. It is Worms at it's greatest.\n\nHowever, this game is being sold under false pretenses. Instead of having the title 'Worms World Party Remastered', it should actually be called 'Worms World Party Steam Edition'. Team 17 have taken Worms World Party and done as little work as possible in order to get it working with modern computers and modern monitors.\n\nThe standout improvements to the game are 1080p support, and controller support. The problem is that these are about the only major improvements to this nearly 15 year old game and even those improvements come with caveats. For instance, the 1080p support is only when in game. The main menus have not been improved from the 15 year old game and are extremely low resolution. Controller support feels a bit tacked on as things like scrolling and positioning don't work as well as they should.\n\nIt is quite obvious that this is just a port of the original game as many of the limitations of the original are still present. Probably the most egregious of these issues is the way multiplayer is handled. More specifically hosting of multiplayer games. You can't install the game then go straight into hosting multiplayer games. In order to host a game you first need to go into your router and set up port forwarding. You then need to edit the registry and finally you need to enter your WAN IP address into the game. This is unacceptable.\n\nThe hosting issue alone has nearly killed the community for this game dead. I have seen the ridiculous situation where there were 10 people in a lobby all wanting to play a multiplayer game but none of them could host a game so no one could play. I ended up writing a Steam guide to try and help people get around this problem.\n\nIt is this hosting problem which I think has led to the multiplayer being pretty much dead. The game has only been out for a week and the average player count is 9.5 players per hour (http://steamcharts.com/app/270910). This number is also made up of people playing single player as well. Good luck trying to find a multiplayer game.\n\nThen there is the menus. They look like they are presented in 640x480 resolution and they look dated design wise as well. When in game the resolution is 1080p but the weapon select screen is not scaled properly so is very small and makes it difficult to see what the icons are.\n\nThose are the major issues but there are quite a few other little niggles.\n\nThis game is not a remaster. It is a quick cash grab. The original game has had a minimal amount of work done to it to make it compatible with modern computers and that is about it.\n\nWe have been complaining to Team 17 on the forums and the Team 17 rep told us he would have a plan of action to present to us in order to improve the game by the end of the week. The end of the week has come and gone with no word from the rep.\n\nI believe it is pretty unlikely that the game will ever be improved as there is no financial incentive for Team 17 to do so. The game is dead on arrival.\n\nBasically I would say to any potential buyers, don't do it. Don't support Team 17 who have taken the good will of their fans for granted for too long. This is a quick cash grab and the game has no future. Don't waste your money or time on this.","July 26, 2015","false","17.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

Oh, and it's got "Remastered" tacked on as a buzzword, since the menus are still locked to 480p and the game doesn't scale well at all, plus it looks exactly the same as the original release.  No, telling us the resolution is unlocked does NOT count as a "remaster."\n\nThere's no proper way to view the arsenal, because as I mentioned before, the mouse crosses the screen at 32x speed and is accelerated/post-processed to the point of unusability.  Combine that with the fact that it's about two cm on screen, and it's unusable.  Just use the arrow keys, right?  NOPE.

Because of that I was with some doubts if I could get the game or not without fearing of having to ask for a refund. In the end I ended getting this as a gift and I decided to have a look if what people were saying is true. In the startup I did have two issues: the title screen and menu was a bit small with the clouds dragging on the black frame around it. Once I reached the Options screen, the screen went completely black, impossible to see anything. I had to open the task manager of Windows to exit the program. However, once I restarted the game those issues were gone. Since then I tested the game for several hours and I found NO issues anymore. Quick Match, Training, Missions, Deathmatch, Options and Online matches were working 100%. I dunno if I was either lucky or the developers launched patches in the meantime but by my experience with this port I can safely tell people that they can buy with trust.\n\nAs for the review, this is a sequel of the best Worms title up to date, Worms Armageddon, using the same game engine. This sequel not only counts with the most positive features of Armageddon but it includes many novelties like Wormapedia, Team Battlefields, Wormpot for random match rules, new missions and a MUCH more complete training campaign, allowing both unnexperienced and experienced players to learn the possibilities and tricks of the game and improve their skills.\n\nThe remastered version counts with new sound effects (that are optional to use or not) and a graphically improved menu.\n\nAs a personal suggestion, I would like to see the game supporting in future higher resolutions than just Full HD: Armageddon is capable of this.\n\nTo keep it short, Worms World Party is an obligatory title to Worms fans to expand even further from the Armageddon universe and to fans of fun and cartoony strategy games. 100% recommended!\n\n","May 24","true","20.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am dead serious when I say that my old PS1 version of this game ran smoother. Seriously, this is the fastest I have ever had the hype train derail completely.\n\nI can't make the game run fullscreen at 1920 x 1080p. For some reason, there's some letterboxing going on and the aspect ratio looks more like 21:9.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=538793258 <--- This is the only aspect I can play the game at. The dynamic zoom seems to be broken, at least for me.\n\nAttempting to change the screen resolution or render quality softlocks the game. Always a sign of quality.\n\nNo AA-settings ensures that all the edges look like crap. Come on, it's 2015, this shouldn't be this hard. I swear the game looks so much better when I force AA through my graphics card settings.\n\nAnother sad part is the criminal lack of game modes in the multiplayer game menu. There's no "for fun" mode with all weapons. And I mean ALL. Don't hide away the concrete donkey, guys. I remember my PS1 version having a metric butt-ton of pre-defined weaponsets and half of them seem to be missing.\n\nThe interface for the terrain generator/pre-made backdrops is abysmal. Worms Armageddon / Worms 2 has a better one. In a HD remake, I expect to have a proper preview instead of the gallery thumbnail.\n\nThe game seems to abandon all settings you toggle. I tried to turn off the remastered audio, but the game clearly didn't agree with me and checked the box right back like I had offended it dearly.\n\n\nFont rendering is also screwed. Team17, if you want to include an ümlaut Ü in your game, pick a font that supports it. It is jarring as all hell to see a letter rendered in Arial just sit there, being taller and blockier than any other text.\n\nTL;DR the boxed copy I got fourteen years ago that was bundled with a shockwave-based installer somehow manages to run better than the remaster.\n\nEDIT: No Low Gravity mode. Is this the same game that I used to play daily in the past??","October 20, 2015","false","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

As many have said, and I will say again, there is nothing to support the idea that it's a remaster. I mean, Team 17 could have just as easily not used that word, and release it in a smilar state to Worms Amageddon, and I think everyone might have taken kinder to it. This is could be considered false advertisement, and with good reason. If it's not what it claims, then people will call you out on it.\n\nThat being said, the good points I can make about the game are that..well, it's the WWP game, unchanged, and maybe, it's a good thing. Aside from the naff effects, which you can thankfully turn off. That..seems to be it, really.\n\nLike I said, I can't give it a full reccomendation, since it's not 'remastered' anymore than just slapping a patch on it.  If you don't have it already in any form, you might consider getting it. If you do, then it's a little pointless, since you can get the same thing using mods already. If T17 dropped the word, and just stated that it's a new patch for Steam, then maybe, they might have a chance. Right now?

Especially since the original disc-version I own doesn’t seem to even run on Windows 7 anymore...\n\nSo while I techinically wouldn't call it a "remastered" game, it is still the same old fun game that I can remember.","July 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","16","37","0","0"

It's the best Worms game ever made, and, after years of terrible Worms games and 3D, it has aged remarkably well. Running without issues on Windows 10.\n\nIt's getting alot of justified criticism due to the word 'Remastered'--it shouldn't be called a remaster, rather a 'Steam edition'. It is false advertising. This is because the game has  is still in the original resolution outside the gameplay, and not much has actually been 'remastered', apart from the gameplay, which is in 1080p and a solid 60fps. It's the same game with more resolution options tacked on and Steamworks support.\nHowever, why would this matter? Of all the games, a 2D Worms game is the last one that needs to be in 1080p and 60fps. There are also new audio and sound effects, which, as a fan of the original release in 2001, I really appreciate.\n\nThis is the same game that shipped in 2001, with 1080p gameplay and new audio. However, despite the false advertising, I'm still inclined to give this a positive review. This is because this is a working version of Worms World Party for modern operating systems--the old 2001 'Sold Out' version, which I still own a physical copy of, no longer works with Windows 7, nevermind Windows 10 which I recently upgraded to. I have been longing to play Worms World Party again for many years, so I am thrilled to be able to do that again.\n\nSo in short, if you don't care about the false advertising and, like me, just want to play LAN or Local games of Worms World Party for nostalgic value or fun, pick it up. It was my first Worms game, and has always been my favourite, due to the amount of fond memories I have of it :)","July 30, 2015","true","19.3"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

Team17 seem to have misunderstood a bit what "remastering" actually is, meaning that this is only a "remaster" in a very loose sense. However, there is no denying that whilst it hasn't undergone any radical changes, the result is that this is still the same Worms World Party we know and love, for the same price as Worms Armageddon on Steam, and arguably offering a superior experience due to the new "WormPot" modes and the added controller support, which is surprisingly well-implemented.Originally, ther menus were rendered in 640x480, but with a new update, the menus have now been vastly improved with much nicer graphics and fon, not that the menus actually looked any worse with the old resolution. As for the "remastered" sound effects, I really quite like them, they sound a lot nicer than WWP's original sound effects, and if you turn them off you've basically just got the original Worms World Party.","August 22, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

However, there are some things you'll wish to consider:\nThis is still Worms world Party, so if you already own this game, you're not gaining a lot by buying this version. all you get is native 1080p in the matches and some fancy new sound effects.\n\nAbout these soundeffects: I'm very gratefull that Team17 gives you the option whether to use these new effects, or stick with the classic set. While I respect the effort they put into the new  effects, they just sound too overdone for my taste.\n\nIf you have Worms Armageddon, there's a few different consideration. WWPR, just like the original WWP, added the Wormpot feature: 3 slots where you can set additional rules/features. such as red blood graphics or earthquakes between each turn. Be advised, however, that hosting from behind a router is less easily setup compared to W:A. WWP doesn't have the Hostbuddy system. So if you want to host, you'll have to portforward (there's a guide on here already which worked for me)\n\nPerformance: NO, WWPR does not yet perform at the promised 60fps for me (I get 40 to 50 with R9-270x). For me, even if this doesn't end up being fixed, the gameplay is smooth enough and there's no need to worry about it. So if this is your only fear about buying this game, I would suggest you just try it. Either it works and you'll have one hell of a blast, or you can easily get a refund from steam.","July 18, 2015","true","5.1"," 15 of 45 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","15","45","2","1"

PLZ READ BOTTOM. THE FIRST PART WAS MY POINT OF VIEW IN THE FIRST MINUTES OF THE GAME AND IT CHANGED DRASTICALY AFTER A FEW HOURS\n\nDont buy this game if you are expecting huge improvements in the previows non-remastered title. This, like i know you can guess from the title is a remaster of a game. ITS NOT A DIFFERENT GAME.  It plays like the old one, feels like the old one and overall is the old one. Remastering isnt about changing the game its about adding some more litlle things to make it more enjoyable. Team 17 added, like they said themselfs:\n"Shiny 1080p graphics with 60 fps"\n"Enhanced weapon sound effects"\n"Cloud Saves"\n"Full Controller Support"\n"Steam Leaderboards"\n"Steam Achievements"\n\nBesides this things dont expect other improvments to the game. it doesnt have them. The game is amazing and super fun and its currently my favorite worms game of the franchise. It feels a litlle bit cluncky when playing online and i think that feature should be improved but overall if you are interested in anything other than the online experience you should definitely check this out.\n\nEdit1: After some more hours into the game i finally understood where all the bad reviews where coming from. The main problem is definitely in the online version. The menus are very old and outdated and its hard to create an half decent room to play in. The only availble server is the one that was created in 2001 in the UK. THERE ARE NO MORE SERVERS!!!\n-Controller is not fully supported because still lacks stuff in many ways. expecially when traveling between menus. It still need a keybard for almost everything.\n-A lot of sound related bugs are found when playing the game very frequently.\n-Yeah it has achievments but 12 achivments or nothing is almost the same thing.\n-I honestly am never going to use steamleadboards because the online sucks soo much im only gonna play it from time to time.\n\nVeredict: is basicaly the same worms world party game with no improvments at all. Or at least i really can´t see why they call it a remaster. I still recommend it and its a good game but i honestly wasnt expecting it to be soo outdated. We are in 2015 not in 2001 Team17!!!

It's not worth the price I payed even though I got it on offer. It is an old game what was good for its time, but time has moved on and so should TEAM17! Why give us this junk, if an older game is remastered, it should have improvements other than sound and video quality!","May 28","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no zoom or scaling options. Can't choose lower resolutions than 720p because they're either not 16:9, so get boxed of and stay just as small, or simply aren't supported.\n\nHave had to resort to the massively inferior Worms Revolution.","May 31","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

It's fairly solid now, very enjoyable to replay this classic with a controller and have the menus and everything else set in 1080p. Wouldn't buy it for more than $5 though since multiplayer is dead and a few of the classic sound banks were removed due to everyone obsessing about being politically correct these days... A shame on that aspect really.","June 5","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
