"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beretta9mm/recommended/336210/","beretta9mm","Beretta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beretta9mm/","746 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA fantastic start for this early access title, still Pre/Early Alpha and already has some entertaining features and gameplay, The car handling is a little stiff at the moment and its lacking more in-depth modes, such as Campaign or fully fleshed out multiplayer, Considering this was made by one man, its come a long way in a short time, with no help from Kickstarter (or any fundraising) and made solely by one person.\n\nA bit on AI, On certain game modes they certainly get the job done, such as Bank Heist where you'll find cops swarming the bank and will kill you rather quickly, In the Vigilante mode (more on that below) the cops will attack you well enough but seem to ignore the biker gangs that attack.\n\nBelow I'll summarize each game mode then a quick bullet point for +/-/Neutral below that for the game overall.\n\nBank Heist Mode\n\nI wish that you started in a planning mode or similar (like Payday) but currently you start in the bank as cops start to pour in (set after the heist itself), I'm positive this is just to give the player an idea of what the game mode will become, once the game is fully complete,\n\nYou have to escape the cops to complete it, You have three AI controlled partners that help fend off police, I jumped in a nearby SWAT van but unfortunately my AI team didn't follow (again its Early Access).\n\nVigilante Mode\n\nMy favourite mode so far, You play as a vigilante (A regular citizen that takes law into their own hands), You begin at your hideout where you can use money earned by taking down local gangs to buy weapons and new vehicles (plus drugs + tools but they were grayed out at this time),\n\nYou also have to avoid the cops as they will attack you on sight (vigilantes can look just like any criminal with a gun in reality), I'm really looking forward to this being built upon, I feel it has HUGE potential.\n\nGang Wars Mode\n\nMy favourite in terms of unique gameplay but seems to be the least complete, You choose a gang (one of three but can only pick the one for now) and control them via a RTS style gameplay or directly in third person, and slowly have to expand your territory while taking it from the other two gangs,\n\nYou buy weapons and vehicles with cash stolen from civilians. I found it hard to select more than one gang member and the other enemy gangs didn't seem to come after my territory (most likely a bug, again its Early Access), and I could't work out how to command the units in anything other than third person mode (could be me as I said)\n\nMultiplayer\n\nAt the current stage multiplayer is similar to vigilante but with other players and only some roaming gang members (that don't seem to attack), You can choose from a vast array of character models and the buying of weapons and vehicles work the same as Vigilante mode,\n\nAt the moment multiplayer is very bare bones and I would recommend the offline modes for now (can't stress this enough, its Early Access and made by ONE man.)\n\nGraphics\n\nThe character models and city are fantastically well created, with good animations and textures, The city has a day and night cycle with a large selection of weather effects (You can choose the starting time and weather on all the game modes as well)  Snow, rain, fog, wet, clear just to name the current weathers, really made the city change atmosphere. Some ambient occlusion and sharpening effects seemed to be slightly too high (white blur around some edges).\n\nSound\n\nOverall sound effects are pretty good, crowds or people shout when there is gunfire or if you bump into them, Cops bark their usual lines ("Freeze!", etc), Weapon sounds seem high quality and vehicle sounds seem to be acceptable.\n\nGeneral\n\nCrowds or people come alive when any nearby fighting begins, shouting and running in all directions, Cops come charging to intercept you when civilians start to panic, interesting comic book like speech bubbles appears above talking characters, and Metal Gear Solid type exclamation marks above their heads to show they are reacting to nearby events.\n\nJust Death shows great promise and with a committed developer,  I see it going a long way, It's roughly 66% complete and has only just entered Early Access, considering this was made by one man, it's an incredible feat.\n\nIf you're looking for a feature complete game full of content, look elsewhere but if you want to support a dedicated and community driven Dev and help the game become great, £10.99/$14.99 is a good price.\n\n\nSummary\n\nPositive\n\n+ Good Graphics\n+ Good quality sound effects\n+ Reasonable game modes (for pre-alpha)\n+ Great FPS (over 100 when I was playing)\n+ Committed Developer\n+ Reactive crowds\n\nNeutral\n\n= Multiplayer is acceptable\n= Chat works in multiplayer\n\nNegative\n\n- Some graphical anomalies\n- Needs much more content (Its Early Access however and made by one man!!)\n- Clunky car controls\n- AI inconsistencies\n- No Tutorial","February 24","true","0.4"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","36","61","5","8"

It's still in alpha, but with the help of the community, this will be done in a year, definately. Right now it's playable, so, unless you want to wait for a really functional game, pass this. Otherwise, uy a copy and join in on this community, I'm sure it'll be great soon.","February 24","true","0.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","15","26","2","0"

He mentions this game will have a year left in early access and has much more features to be added. If you would like to support the development i defidently recommend buying it!","February 24","true","1.2"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","16","28","2","0"

I played about 2-3 hrs so far and just wanted to get a quick review up for those looking to purchase. I will come back when I have played more to update.\n\nThe game is being made by one person so thats something you should keep in mind when making your decision to buy. I really think this game will be a blast once more features and game modes added. I can see multiplayer being the main attraction once there are more players. Right now its in full early access mode, which is all the things you would expect from a game in that state. I really think the price should be lowered a little while in early access because I dont see many people taking a chance with the price being what it is.\n\nAnyway I am looking forward to spending more time playing and seeing what it has in store for us. The developer is a really good guy and has put his all into it. I dont think it will ever be anything like gta 5 but come on, what games are?","February 25","true","0.1"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","18","32","2","0"

The developer stated that it's completed at 66% and it will take at least 12 months to finish developing it.\n\nGRAPHICSAt its current state, the Video Options menu doesn't work, and you are forced to change the .cfg file to set your resolution. And while the game actually looks pretty decently (especially the weather effects), there are severe performance issues and multiple but small bugs and weird things such as police officers constantly running somewhere, the lack of drivers in the vehicles and really wonky shooting animations.\n\nGAMEPLAYThere are three game modes available: Vigilante, Bank Heist and Gang Wars.\nIn Vigilante you go around the city to kill members of rival gangs. You can buy new weapons and vehicles with the money that you get from the dead corpses.\nIn Bank Heist you are part of a four-men team who just robbed a bank and must fight back waves of cops in order to get to the escape van.\nIn Gang Wars you play as three members of three criminal organisations and you conquer different districts of the city by killing every enemy in the area.\nThe shooting is very wonky and it's very hard to kill an enemy, so the best thing to do is to hit them with a car. Surprisingly, the driving feels very good, but not every person you hit with it dies, nor do you break lampposts or fire hydrants, and nor do the vehicles break or blow up if you shoot at them or crash them in the wall. You also gain XP by killing cops, civilians and thugs, and you level up, even though it doesn't change or improve anything.\nHonestly, the game is actually enjoyable, and I can't wait for there to be more content in the near future. It manages to give you enough content to satisfy you as a customer, while also promising some nifty new features.\n\nCHALLENGEYou die really easily and it is never clear how much health you have left. Also, Bank Heist is really hard to beat, and it isn't all that balanced right now, while Vigilante is really easy if you kill the thugs with a car. Also, the cops usually don't follow you when you start shooting at them.\n\nSOUNDThe sound design is fine, but all of the dialogue from the civilians and the rain effects are really annoying, and it also lacks any music.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere will be a lot more content, and the current game modes (as well as a multiplayer component and randomly-generated cities) will keep you engaged for quite some time.\n\nOverall, this is a good and promising start for a one-man developed game. Fans of open-world crime games will really like it.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 6.5\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 6\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 3\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","February 27","true","0.7"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","20","36","3","4"

I'd rather you get the game now and wait a few months. Like Gettysburg: Armored Warfare don't listen to reviews. (I have played the game on Paradox.)\n\nI'm not going to go into detail because the game is in Early access and there is not much to play at this moment in time. I will add your character feels very squshy. Other than that the game is solid, Meaning I haven't seen any bugs whatsoever. All I'm saying is buy the game while it's cheap then come back to it. Hell get a refund if you don't like it. I bought it to support the Developer.\n\nRemember if there is something you don't like about the game please, go to the forums. dgreen is always looking for ideas and his update schedule is Maybe once a week or once every two weeks for this year.\n\nIf you have a feature make a post. Don't be shy :)","February 24","true","0.4"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","25","46","4","1"

My last one sucked and this game deserves a better review.\n\nThis title has so much for an early access game. There are 3 gamemodes with also an open sandbox mode. I've been only playing the sandbox mode but i'm not dissapointed at all. From my 0.9 hours playing (so far) expect to get 3-6 people to a server. But remember this, THIS GAME CAME OUT TWO DAYS AGO. I hope to see servers filled up with other players duking it out in little wars by the time the game finishes development.\nThis game has so much potential and i'm ready to see what the developer has in store for us. Get this game now, don't wait 3-4 months to get this game because i promise you, you'll want to see this game develop into something great. I really enjoy this game but some concerns i have is that the aim feature is a little wonky and in my personal opinion, i don't think there's enough npc's in the sandbox mode (probably add civilians?) other than that, this is a really good game.\n\nDid i forget to mention this game is made by a single developer?\n\n","February 25","true","1.0"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","13","23","2","2"

Not sure if it's even EA ready.. Although it's nice the developer wants help and advice on his game, the price is a bit steep for what the game actually presents content wise right now. Should consider getting more help for a game of the scope he seems to want to get it too.\n\nCould be promising some day though, I can see the potential, just don't know if it'll ever get there.\n\nHe's got something going with the procedurally generated cities, and what he has accomplished by himself is a big feat.\n\nAt this time I can't recommend the game at the price its at and what is offered in the game. You die very quickly, the bullet spread is too high, cars steering is way off, can't deposit money to buy better weapons as far as I know, since trying earlier today. Pretty much all there is to do right now is run around , kill a couple people, then die. Like I said , with the description of the devs game modes, the game does have potential and hopefully can be reached especially if be plans on doing it all by himself. But that price point is a bit steep right now to justify getting it.","February 28","false","0.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","1"

However, this game is so addicting. Online play is so much fun. I love the system of killing for cash and xp to level. Not to mention after every session, one player is deemed the winner, so it gives an obvious incentive to be top dog. I would recommend this game to any true gamer that is wanting something more than your typical 1st/3rd person shooter. kudos danny!","February 26","true","2.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"
