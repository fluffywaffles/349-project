"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/recommended/375770/","spodamayn","spoderman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/","4650 products in account","Quantum Conscience is a sci-fi VN with an interesting "mind-read" gimmick. Fortunately, the gimmick works pretty well because it's so intertwined with the main story and endings that you have no choice but to use it frequently if you want to fully experience the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the gimmick isn't fleshed out enough so what seems so cool about it at first can lead to frustrations that you can't avoid.\n\nThere are consequences for mind-reading too little, or too much and the game doesn't notify you of when there are new "thoughts" that you can read. You have to keep checking on the Void stream (the mind-read interface) to make sure you don't miss anything. However, the game does indicate when your mind-reading (or lack there of) has consequences via use of symbols on screen. These symbols didn't make much sense to me, and the tutorial vaguely explains them. I got the gist of it, but I feel like they could've been implemented in a better way.\n\nThe writing is fairly decent and kept my interest throughout the game (enough to achieve two endings), and the character art is passable but neither good or bad. The dreariness in the gray tones used for the characters makes the game seem more lifeless than it should be. I don't know if it was designed like that to set the mood for the atmosphere or if the omission of color was due to laziness. The background art is TERRIBLE, sometimes I can't tell if the dev was intentionally trying to be as abstract as possible, or they scribbled and called it a day.\n\nThere are multiple romance scenarios that you can persue in the game, but they're short lasting and don't have much depth. Since the character art isn't very appealing, it was one of the main factors in making me dislike the romance options.\n\nI actually passed on this game initially because at first glance the art is rather bad. However, I suggest giving the game (or demo) a try because the mind-reading gimmick and story are both rather unique, and these types of VNs are lacking on Steam. The price offsets the main cons that I encountered with the game, so it's about as fair as you can expect.","November 21, 2015","true","15.2"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

Rather than selecting choices from a menu, you decide when and how often to make use of an interesting mechanic in which the main character can read the minds of those around him.  What he/she learns or doesn't learn dictates how he reacts to different situations.  It's a nice change from the usual modus operandi of visual novels.\n\nThe story's themes are rather existential and interesting, framed in a somewhat typical science fiction setting.  The art is rather hit or miss, with some of it being really beautiful and other aspects being rather poor.  Personally, I was a little creeped out by the way smiles were drawn on the characters.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent entry into the visual novel genre.  Somewhat short, but with excellent replay value.  I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good story and is intrigued by the concept of personal mental privacy.","June 15, 2015","true","4.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

The setting was very dystopian and the story provides enough length and intrigue to keep you reading until the end.\n\nThis isn't your typical visual novel which I really appreciate. It's extremely long and provides you with hours of content and some unique features. It took me 6 hours to complete the story, and I wasn't disappointed! My only complaints are that the music can get quite monotonous and I got ending #3 which didn't come with an achievement so that sucks.\n\nThe interesting element to this game is "The Void". Essentially, you use the void to read other people’s minds and gather enough secrets and intelligence to determine the outcome. Although there aren't many actual choices; if you decide not to read someone's thoughts the story will go in an entirely different direction.\n\nWorth the full $5!\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

You were in a position of power on your planet; abducted and enlightened. You're given an assignment to infiltrate and undermine what was once your home, something no greenhorn has ever been / should ever be asked to do so soon after training. Things go amiss, your past comes back to confront you, you struggle with your sort of in-between position, doubly so considering you've just been imbued with the power to read minds. The Void Stream I mention throughout the review is the way to access this power. You can choose to use it (altering outcomes) or not (accepting what will be).\n\n\nVery awesome story / game.\nThe only reason I quit playing was to complain about the one (or two) issues:\n\n\nThe notifications shouldn't have disappeared as quickly during the Void Stream tutorial; I didn't quite catch what each symbol meant.\n\nI really wish there was some sort of feedback as to when the Void Stream is updated.\nAt this point, I'm basically checking it after each line of dialogue (hence why it's taken me an hour to get to the point I'm at).\nI got what I think was the "Mixed" notification and became upset that, of the small handfull of times I opted to NOT check the Void Stream, one of them apparently included some new information.\nIf the Void Stream button flashed ever-so-subtly when something new is added, or a unique tone sounded, or SOMETHING occurred, I doubt I would find any issue with the game (as I can always go back and get a screenshot of each of the three Notification descriptions).\nI appreciate that the Void Stream adds some sort of interaction on the player's part beyond clicking to advance the story, but, again, the total ignorance of the player as to when to check the Void Stream (as there aren't always clues from the dia-/monlogues that a new thought has occurred) will either lead the player to checking it after every line (which becomes very annoying) or just not caring at all / only checking when it's obvious something has been added (missing out on some story... which makes up the entirety of the game).\n\nI'm very eager to keep playing / reading, and recommend this game to all... er I would. As it is, I can only recommend it to those who have a good deal of patience, since the Void Stream is somewhat of a burden with how it's handled in the game.\n\n10/10 for content\n6.5/10 because of Void Stream","August 14, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The choices you make and the ending you receive all depend on when and how often you press it. This is a really cool idea because unlike other visual novels where you can just immediately go back if you make a bad choice, in this game you have to think more carefully about when you press the button as information you may find out accidently can really affect future events and your relationship with the other characters. The story and the mystery are both complex and enjoyable which is really important as the game defintely leans more towards being a kinetic novel. The art is quite good especially the cgs and the characters are all very different and interesting.\n\nIn regard to the more disappointing sides of the game, the lack of choices while a unique idea can be really frustrating at times. I ended up on two different romantic paths on the same playthrough when I wasn't attempting to romance either character. The lack of choices also takes away the feel of danger during some of the more intense scenes and makes the game less replayable, at least in my opinion.\n\nAll in all though, I would recommend this game as I really enjoyed the complex story and for the price I think it's worth it.","August 18, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/375770/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","A decent visual novel with an interesting story and interesting approach to decision-making. Instead of decision branching paths like most VNs, the mind-reading mechanic and the ways you use it serve as the basis for plot divergence. The game remains fairly linear up to the end, however, and the ending is only a little different depending on your actions, despite all the endings going off in different directions. There are some subplots you can trigger or miss depending on your mind-read choices and there's some romance options that feel kind of shoehorned in. And there's really not a lot of freedom in the endings, you'll almost certainly get stuck with one of them unless you fulfill the specific conditions necessary, regardless of how you play the rest of the game. The game is fairly short, too, only around 2 hours for my first playthrough and less for subsequent ones. It's a pretty decent game overall, I feel, but I was never really wowed by it. The art sometimes can look a little off, as well; creepy smiles abound, and one of the female characters looks just waaay too masculine. For the price I'd say this is a fair enough pick for a VN if you're looking for some decent cheap ones, but no high recommendation here.","August 12, 2015","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I HATE USELESS PROTAGONISTS. It's obvious this game has one.\n\n2. Clashing backgrounds, it pains my eyes.\n\n3. Void stream System looks good - ON PAPER. It's a button at the top of the screen where you can click and read other people's mind and interact with the void. This system is not fleshed out. It's merely interesting because there wasn't the usual dialogue system.\n\n4. No dialogues and choice trees. Just the VSS. The only choice you can make is how many times you enter the void stream screen to read a character's mind. You either use it a lot or barely at all.\n\n5. It's frustrating enough to use the system and what makes it worse is to read the same texts over and over again just to build up the counter.\n\n6. Game takes about 3 hours to complete per ending. Its replay value largely depends on your opinion on the Void Stream System. To some, it may be an interesting and refreshing new way of playing a game of such genre. It sucks for me though. *Check out the demo version first, if you're okay with the VSS, consider buying it.* I didn't exactly like it, I'm just replaying it for the sake of achievements.\n\n7. The inadequacies of the game and the USELESSNESS of the main character is simply jarring without dialogue options and choices.\n\n8. Too predicatable due to the lack of choices.\n\n\nThe GOOD:\n1. On the romantic front, this game is good. Not going to spoil it for you.\n\n2. Consider purchasing the OST to support the developer. As far as the music is concerned, it's solid.\n\n3. Woods has amazing talent, clearly seen in her novels. There were scenes where ideas come together so perfectly you can see what she has planned for the game.\n\n4. No bugs or glitches.\n\n5. Sprites used have a wide range of expressions and emotions, defined and clear.\n\n6. Very cute reactions.\n\nOverall, the game would be a 4/10 for me. You play as a USELESS (sorry, I can't emphasise this more) protagonist, going through a heavy plot and using an annoying game mechanic, It simply gets on your nerves. Quantum Conscience would have been a good game if not for its execution. If I want to enjoy the story, I'll read a book. If I want to listen to the music, I'll simply buy the soundtrack.

For starters, I guess as a service to the gaming industry, it's technically not a game.  It's like one of those Japanese visual novels where you click through a bit of dialogue then make a few choices to move the story along.

Oh no, that would be an improvement.

Arguably the lowest quality literature imaginable.\n\nGraphics settings are pointless and lacking, but that's fine because seeing the godawful artwork in high def could have caused blindness.\n\nThis may be an attempt by the CIA to weaponise indy shovelware.","January 30","false","8.8"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","1","10","2","0"
