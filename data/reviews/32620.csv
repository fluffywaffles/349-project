Damage is somewhat more realistic than CoD, but still errs in the opposite way: a single hit to even non vital organs usually kills instantly, and for that reason semi-automatic fire is usually best, despite there being little recoil to the weapons. Magazines are discarded when reloading, so don't try to do "tactical retention reloads".\n\nHighest standard resolution is 800x600, but that can be editted as shown in the link below.\n\nhttp://pub2.bravenet.com/faq/show.php?usernum=126000073&catid=1010","October 5, 2014","true","0.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/32620/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Back in 90s a FPS genre on PC was born, most of titles being fast-paced arcadeish shooters, with fast movement and maze levels where you hunt for keys to the door to get to the exit, games of pure fun. Most of them were being compared to Doom and Quake and after few years people started to grow tired of arcade fun and wanted something else in FPS genre. Thus comes darker age of realistical shooters, with Novalogic releasing their first Delta Force in 1998, fitting into this trend.\n\nTechnically, it's old game that was pretty much released as-is. Steam overlay will not work. The maximum resolution you will get is 800x600. Full-screen didn't seem to work properly, at least there was the window-top being seen, covering part of HUD. And then game sometimes randomly freezes at the later missions.\nAlso I am not sure if it's Steam version's fault or what, but here you can't place anything. The object just will not spawn. Thus it makes Satchel Charges and Claymore Mines unusable. Oh well, they probably weren't useful and there is no target that can be destroyed only with them. Stuff blows up from just shooting bullets at it just fine, so game-breaking bug averted.\n\nAs for multiplayer, it's most likely dead. I barely see any servers. Only ever saw 2 players playing. And when I tried to join the empty server, it just froze at the black screen. No idea how to fix it, but it's most likely not worth it anyway. Or at least I hope that cooperative with friend will work. But not getting any team deathmatch of 8 or more players that people were praising back then. So take it as a single-player game.\n\nSo, the plot of this game is about being Bravo team of Delta Force, who fights terrorists and handles objectives for sake of killing more terrorists. And you will do it for 40 missions spread over 5 campaigns. Where your plan usually goes like this: Bravo Team, who is you, who is one-man army, comes straight and snipes everything and miracliously survives, while Alpha and Charlie team, 2 soldiers each, die quickly by trying to flank the enemy. Or actually don't die quickly and instead manages to distract them, as they both are trying to hit each other through the wall. Or kill some.\n\nAnyway, this game tries to be realistical outside areas shooter. Which means that now you have a huge huge fields of ground, with barely any buildings in them, with you being able to walk up most of the hills. Because navigating mazes would be too hard for kids.\nAnd so you fight realistical enemies, that are just soldiers or snipers. With you and them dieing from a single shot. Thus it's more about who shoots first. While you also have to look over the pixeled hills over the distance, trying to find a small chunk of pixel so you could snipe it. Or mistaking enemy for a tree top. Anyway, you just move slowly, trying to find a pixel and then snipe it. Because maneuvering from enemy attacks, learning each type of enemy in older-school FPS was too hard for kids.\n\nAnd well, it's not exactly tactical either. You don't really have tactical grenades of any kind. Nor can you command your forces. You just come in and snipe everybody. Even rare stealth missions are easier done in direct approach. You can select gear or use default one for current missions. But selection is very little and the most effective one will be your default assault rifle with grenade launcher. Though most of them are good, so it makes no difference. Just use whatever missions gives. Unless it gives SMG with silencer in mission where you have to snipe. Like, always. And yea, no tactics, not much choice, good enough for kids.\n\nBut hey, at least game has difficulty. Which makes it hardcore and tactical for some people, I guess. Since you die in a single bullet. So you just move slowly and snipe more. And then die because somebody came over the hill you wasn't looking. Not exactly exciting, knowing that there wasn't much I could do. Kinda have to be lucky too. But hey, at least now people for who it was the first ever FPS get to whine how everything nowdays has no charm, dumbed down for casuals and such. Because those people grew up. And so did games.\nThat and difficulty balance in uneven. Hardest ones were first missions of final campaign and that's because mission waypoints lead you through path surrounded by all soldiers. So you have to misbehave commander ideas and do it yourself, sniping from far away slowly. Which teaches us an important lesson about how real Delta Force survives. I guess.\n\nGame however has two curious things: AI and voxel engine.\n\nAI is awesome because it's so broken. Okay, not awesome, just dumb. Aside from teammates not being effective, you also may meet a case where enemy or teammate gets stuck in a building, running straight into wall and refusing to maneuver. Even better is when they try to shoot right through the hill. Some enemies are weird in this. Like, they can notice you, but by being way too low compared to you, they will be shooting the ground. After a while of not seeing you, they forget you, thus not turning around to where you are. So you can sneak behind them and see some still shooting ground for some reason. Should I say that in this game of reaction the sound is important, so sometimes you will be stopping and try to figure out where enemies are trying to shoot you from. Only to find out that they are inside buildings, shooting at the wall.\n\nVoxel engine is truly awesome and great idea for such game! Average computer wasn't strong enough for huge spaces in 1998 and in this game you really don't want any kind of visible distance limit. Thus it uses voxels for terrain, somehow making it look more real and allow computers to render over kilometer of it.\nGraphics do hovewer have some ugly polygonal models. Rendered is a bit weird of them, they can get distored around camera edges even worse than PS1 hardware does. And animation of knife is ridiculous. Just cut somebody by pulling knife to yourself.\nAt least having scope on the side of screen in a circle is pretty nice idea.\n\nNope, there is music only for menu. Sad.\n\nBut hey, what most people praised was multiplayer. And I never got to check it out and it's too late now. Maybe that's what it was truly loved for, not single-player. But since it's dead, well, yea. Left with this silly single.\n\nTo be honest, at times it's fun to play this casual pixel-hunting point-n-click sniping adventure, just to relax and kill stuff. But really, this one aged badly, a bit too primitive and there are better options nowdays.","September 18, 2015","false","13.9"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","3","14","2","0"

If you truly want some Delta Force, I recommend you go with Black Hawk down and later games which don't seem so out of date and obsolete.

The enemies work very robotically, unceasingly staring in the last direction you were seen or shot your gun at until the same happens again, regardless of how far you were or what was between you and the foe with the only exceptions being silenced weapons and the knife, but those never pay off since the entire enemy force is permanently alerted if one sees you.\n\nThere are many different mission objectives, but they largely play out the same, practically forcing you to eliminate everyone to complete each mission.\n\nStability is an issue that I presume comes from its age, but I only encountered about 5 crashes throughout my playthrough. These problems include occasional framerate drops out of nowhere, random screen flickering, a game-breaking freeze mid-mission or the game crashing with an error message at the start of a mission.\n\nIf you have nostalgic memories of this game that you wish to relive (like yours truly), then it might be worth buying this game. I honestly can't say whether or not I'd recommend this instead of another game, but I can definitely say you absolutely should not buy this if you have hopes of playing multiplayer, because I'm 95% certain there are some to no servers and even less players.","April 5, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of fun and not too difficult. (Vs. the old Ghost recon games where once you step into view of the enemy, you're going to die if you don't have your squadmates act as cannon fodder.)\n\nYour typical mission: Follow the waypoints, shoot all the bad guys. Don't get killed yourself. Congratulations, mission successful. "You defeated the bad guys. You're making the world a safer place! Also, intel recovered during this mission has lead to the whereabouts of badder bad guys!" Enter: the next mission.\n\n\nPROS:\n-Open world combat\n-Customizable controls\n-Realistic Military weapons with alt fire modes for primary weapons (M4 + M203, MP5SD, M249 SAW, M40A1 Sniper, Barrett .50 Cal Sniper, Colt .45 Pistol, .22 Suppressed Pistol)\n-Customizable loadout (to an extent - I wish they would let you choose 2 primary guns instead of one gun and one explosive weapon or double ammo)\n-Options for tweaking missions/difficulty (Player HP, Enemy HP, Enemy AI, Powerups, Radar)\n-runs on windows 7 64bit\n-shooting bad guys (stick pixel figures)\n\nCONS:\n-max 1024x768 resolution\n-low res textures, low poly models, low quality animations.
