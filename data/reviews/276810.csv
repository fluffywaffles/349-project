It's still kinda sad there's no neutral variant.\n\nThe game has a solid foundation, and nails the atmosphere / Design a Warhammer Game like this should have. Also, to the Developers Credit, the game has gotten very far from the days back when it was just a Tutorial and some skirmishing (I bought it a long time ago in Early Access). The Warbands are varied, and developing characters and building your Warband is interesting. I wanted to get this stuff out of the way first, beefore I go into the bad traits.\n\nWhat holds Mordheim back massively in my opinion, and the main reason I cant reccomend it, is the sheer number of rough edges and weird design decisions, a lot of them taken not long before release. Let's start with the major ones:\n\nThe Difficulty. A lot of people say the game is hard, unforgiving, challenging. In truth, it just has a steep learning curve, before turning into a failry easy game with some major random spikes in difficulty. Let's not mince words, the AI is stupid. Really, really stupid. This by itself would not be an issue, it's incredibly hard to design even a half decent AI for a system like this. The problem is the way the Dev's are trying to compensate for it. The game basically works with a handicap system. Enemy Ai Warbands will ALLWAYS be superior to yours. More hp, higher Stats etc. The Difficulty of a mission decides how high the difference in strength will be. So in Normal they are just a bit stronger, while in Deadly you are clearly fighting a superior foe, who will absolutely ruin your day in a fair fight.\n\nWhile this sounds unwinnable on paper, in practice, it's actually childishly easy to just set up fight at chokepoints, in buildings or just on Elevation, and then slowly drop the enemy one by one. As your Warband raises in Level, this becomes progressively easier, since your Guys actually become more and more decent at the specific thing you build them for. While the AI stays it's usual, dumb self. You will reach a point where everything but Brutal or Deadly seems like a waste of time. And even those are, as I said, just slightly harder as long as you play it safe.\n\nIn short, the game will seem hard at first. Unfair even. But as soon as you get even a basic grasp of the mechanics, the AI and building your guys, it falls apart and becomes almost too easy.\n\nThat is until you get hit by the RNG of course. There are quite a few mechanics implemented solely for the purpose of ruining your day, showering the AI with even more advantages, and reinforcing the "Hardcore" feeling the game likes so much.\nFirstly, there are ambushes. There is a chance (10% last I checked) on taking each mission, that you get an ambush Event. Basically the one doing the ambushing starts out with all his guys in a offensive Stance (Ambush for Melee, Overwatch for Ranged), while the one that got ambushed get's quite a few penalties (Less chance to hit, for example). As if that wasnt enough, the Deyploment is usualy set up in a way where the ambushers are set up very near or outright next to their enemies.\nIt's completely possible, if your Warband is not built for high Initative, to get ambushed by a highspeed Skaven Warband and loose 1-3 guy before you even get to act ONCE.\n\nThere is no strategy to this. There is no way for you to properly react to it when you get ambushed, beyond praying to Nuffle that you'll get lucky in that first turn. On the other hand, getting to ambush the AI basically means a free win, which feels cheap and unsatisfying.\n\nThen we have Demons. To give the game credit, they do not appear in early game and only on Brutal or above. But they add another, unnecessary, easily abused factor to the game. They are very strong. Having a ton of hp, a lot of attacks, and high damage. They usually home in on the first guy they see. So usually, it's actually fairly easy to wait for the AI to just run into them and then enjoy your free win. Ironically, they cannot climb. So just hiding up in a building and waiting until the victory screen pops up is a frequent thing. On the other hand, if you get unlucky in deyploment, running into one is almost certainly a death sentence. Don't get me wrong, you CAN kill them. But you will NOT be in shape for another fight, especially on Deadly.\n\nNext, we have the different Warbands, and how they're built. Chaos Warbands are nigh unplayable right now, due to random mutations. Imagine you buying a mutant. Imagine you get lucky and you get a blue bow early on. Great, I wanna build a ranged guy! Cool, he got clawed Feet on Level 1! Now he's faster! Then you hit Level 5. And his arm mutates. He can not use ranged weapons now. Oh you invested all his points into Ballistic Skill? Well too bad. Throw him out. Then you have melee guys who get a thousand eyes. Now they cant wear armor anymore! You built him for tanking? Well up yours and your silly tactics! Buy a new one!\n\nIt's arbitary, there is no system to it, and it will frustrate you to the point where after the sixth time you had to throw out a high level guy, you're just not gonna play them anymore.\n\nFinally, and probably the "least" offensive, is the UI, loading screens, and bugs. Some of the information is hidden behind 3 different windows, and there is NO way to customize any of it. Everytime you wanna look up something, calculate your next move or just flat out inform yourself about the guys you're fighting, it involves annoying clicks, searching through 4 different menus until you finally find what you're looking for. Deployment does not allow you to jsut click on the spot on the map, you have to cycle trough each deployment point manually. Some maps have what feels like 50 deyploment points. Imagine how fun it is to cycle trough each with EACH of your guys. 10 man Warbands? The fun is here!\n\nThere was also an announcer added with the release. The general announcer sounds like a random dude, let's call him Jeff, they pulled out of an office to announce EVERY BLODDY THING you do. Gotta collect 10 Wyrdstones? Don't worry, he will "update" you on it EVERYTIME you pick up one! The voice is not even cool, it's not a cool evil voice like you'd have in Dungeon Keeper, or War for the Overworld. It's just a boring, regular guy. You got the atmosphere down on the other stuff, why suddenly slack off here?\n\nBugwise, it's a lot better than it was in earlier versions. But there are still random things that should not be acceptable in a full release. The ai will sometimes randomly engage and diesengage people it isn't supposed or get stuck (Usually on staircases). Some doorways and holes cant be entered from one side, but from the other side they can. The game feels like having rough edges, that should definetely have been fixed in EA before coming out proper.\n\n\nNow, if the above is looked at, changed, or adjusted, this game will get a big fat blue thumb from me RIGHT AWAY. The foundation is there, the game can and will be fun for you, if you can get past all that. But IF they fix it, it's gonna be even better. Fantastic even.","November 24, 2015","false","47.6"," 1,146 of 1,279 people (90%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","90","146","1","36","48"

I tend not to write reviews. I tend not to take out the rubbish (trash) and I often find myself tutting at the sound of my girlfriend cleaning up around me. I tell you this to put my recommendation into perspective. It would be spiteful of me not to recommend this game.\n\nThis is one of my favourite games. I watched it, I waited for it, and, finally, I bought it. I regret not a coin. This game is not even finished, and it's already awesome. I hope and pray that I don't tempt fate (or encourage the devs to get lazy) but I have very high hopes for the final release, and I'm even looking forward to the inevitable DLC (a concept I loathe to the core).\n\nAs for what it is, it's a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. The customization is what makes it. I love games like Xcom, Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem but I have always wanted a game where the team really felt like my own. This is the closest yet.\n\nLet me demonstrate how. I use a player on my near perfect team who is missing an eye and a leg, sometimes gets confused and fails to acts, and is so battered that he can only move half as far as his teammates. Why do I hamper myself with Glen Hobble? Because he has been with me since day one. He picked up his injuries in the line of duty and he lost a leg saving his captain. I care more about Glen Hobble than my own good-for-nothing son.\n\nBuy this game. Help the community to make it even better. Do it for me. Do it for Glen.","October 5, 2015","true","156.0"," 254 of 292 people (87%) found this review helpful 213 people found this review funny","87","254","292","213","6"

(GWF)\n2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)\n3) everyone else (EE)\n\nFirst the TL:DR version:\n\n1) a GW fanatic and preferably familiar with the Mordheim Tabletop game. (GWF)\n\nYou have been waiting for this game since the first time you critted the Ogre mercenary. It's here. Go buy it. Oh wait, its not a straight conversion like BB? Hmmm. Well then have a look below to see if this adaptation is for you. Yes there are some bugs and yes the AI is not great, but this is meant to be played vs friends anyway right?\n\n2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)\n\nIf you like levelling units, creating a unique warband in a medievalesque, semifantasy setting where death lurks around every corner, where every conseqence is final (no re-doing ANYTHING) in a turnbased environment that you can play vs the AI or vs a friend online, then this might be for you. If you do not like permadeath and rather be able to reload a battle until you get that perfect win: stay away.\n\n3) everyone else (EE)\nWell actually see 2. You wouldnt be reading this if you were looking for a great footballmanager now would you? :)\n\nSee below for a more detailed description. Use ctrl-f to quickly find your part.\n\n1) If you are  a GW fanatic and familiar with the TT version. (GWF)\n\nI'm betting you have been waiting for a vid adaptation of TT for ages. Well here it is. So go get it. I'm thinking for you the most important question is:\n\nIs this Mordheim?\n\nThe answer is both yes and no. (isnt that great ;) ).\n\nNo because this is NOT a straight conversion (Like BB for instance). Some mechanics have been changed, see below.\nYes because this is indeed the city of Mordheim and how you always wanted it too look.\nYes, because in essence its about levelling units, gathering wyrdstone.\nYes because its unforgiving, no turning back, no savescumming, no redo if you pick a wrong skill. This can be frustrating but never more so than in the original because there progression was basically random (yeah! +1 Initiative form my skaven assassin, woot woot! Not).\n\nSo whats different, whats the same?\n\nMain similarities are:\n-turnbased mechanic\n-injuries and levelling\n-climbing\n-charging\n-critical hits\n-wyrdstone gathering/selling\n-most weapons of the TT are in\n-and some skills.\n-there is RNG ('dicerolls')\n-psychology\n\nMain differences:\n-the turn-bases system is unit-, not warband based (so units alternate turns according to an initiative ladder instead of complete warbands ).\n-the skillset has been changed with many new skills, some familiar but many that are new.\n-there are a lot more stats which have a lot higher thresholds.\n-dodge is no longer a 'skill' (like sidestep) but together with parry, overwatch and ambush are selectable stances that finish a units turn (and activate when a unit is in range or attacks).\n-warband rosters have been changed around a little to make them more similar.\n-stuff like fear and terror behave differently from the TT etc.\n-There is an action pool for movement and reloading and such, another one for attacks and spells and such.\n-There are no wounds but each unit has a health bar, and thus units damage for health not wounds.\n-Deployment is not the same as in the TT as the nodes you can deploy in a are predfined.\n\nYou might not like all the changes they've made to the game. For me, in the end, the similarities outweight the changes which I see as an attempt to recreate the game for a vritual medium.\n\nAgain, if you like GW and like(d) the TT this is a must-have. Watch some lets-plays if you are unsure about the new ruleset.\n\n2) If you are a general fantasy/tactics lover. (GFTL)\nThen you don't really care much about the comparison with the TT because you never played it. You know the GW universe perhaps but have never been into their miniature games. However, if you do like fantasy stuff then the setting of this game will appeal to you. There are ratmen, there are horribly mutated creatures, regular mercs, and some crazy nuns with hammers. Sounds good? Read on.\n\nThis game is basically an X-com type game. Units take turns on a map, that represents a district in the city of Mordheim, a Medievalesque city that has been hit by a meteor so its somewhat in shambles. You and your band are there to gather fragments of this meteor (called wyrdstone). Since the meteor hit however the City of Mordheim has become somewhat unpleasant.\nSo what are some features of this game?\n\n-procedural maps that retain their basic layout (street here, square there) but are different each time, (hey last time this building was still standing now its gone/missing the topfloor/completely ruined etc.) creating new routes, blockades etc. each time you play.\n-customizable units (appearance and playstyle).\n-many many skills.\n-units progress and become better or get hurt and die.\n-non-obligatory story missions\n-four warbands with distinct playing style\n-MP play possible (but limited in its options, i.e. no matchmaking or rankings or whatever).\n-variety of weapons, spells and units to equip, level and master.\n\n-Difficulty: I think its important to note this from the get-go. This game is not easy, esp if you are a newcomer. RNG mechanics seem to favor the AI (as they always seem to do :) ), your captain can go Out of Action (OOA) during the match by failing three 80% parry chances and end up post-match losing his leg, being megalomaniac or worse, plain dead. As in terminaly, no turning back, no re-loading dead. And he just turned level 6. And now he's dead. Get the picture? If you are hoping for an easy game stay away, because you will ragequit so often you'll develop haemerroids. The next point ties in with this.\n\n-alt-f4 is punished. If you, for any reason abort the game, the engine will treat it as if you ran away from battle and all your units are considered to have gone OOA. This means they all get to roll for injuries. This could mean your warband is crippled and its startover time. Is there no save? Well offc there is. But you can't reload it to 're-do' something. If you mess up and charge a deamon with your level 1 youngblood and he's dead, he's dead, and he stays dead. No turning back.\n\nSo let's say that you like all this? Anything else? Well yes. While the game might be difficult because of how it works, the AI is not very, you know, smart. In fact, given some practice, you will be able to defeat the AI on the hardest missions unless you are unlucky with your deployment. On higher difficulty missions the AI gets a health and damage boost and that goes a long way to increase the cchallenge. But if you are looking for a really hardcore challenge in tactical terms you need to play online because the AI will not deliver.\nAlso, the story missions can be a bit of a chore sometimes, but hey, they are optional, so the game doesn't force these on you.\n\nBut still, even with an AI thats not perfect (and let's face it, in which complicated game is the AI ever perfect? Total War, I'm looking at you, you money-recieving, morale boosted, stackbuilding, mapsitting incompentent!) this game is many hours of absolute fun. The maps are beautifully created with lots of attention to detail and winning matches can be exhilirating. Especially online where they are buttclinching, sweatdrenching affairs.","November 21, 2015","true","480.0"," 237 of 281 people (84%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","84","237","281","27","11"

The difficulty is the kind of unfair that requires you to think about every move you make, even one attempt to cut a corner and you're punished severely.\n\nI've played a fair bit now and from the negative reviews I've read alot of people seem to dislike the hardcore nature of the game. I can appreciate why but I don't think anyone was ever mislead about how difficult this game would be or the penalties your units face for going out of action in a mission. This is almost a roguelike RTS, the best thing about this game is that you use the environment as part of your strategy to out manouvre the far superior enemy, lock them down and beat them into nothing.\n\nAt the start of this game everything is a struggle, in the middle of this game everything is a struggle, and the nature of this game is that you will eventually lose. At the beginning you will be strapped for resources and struggle to meet demands, but after a while you will be strong enough to use key warband members to cover small areas while your fastest guys rush to get what you need before diving back into the fight. You do slowly build up breathing room as you go on but its only ever really enough to cover the losses you suffer since the further you get in the more devastating each loss gets.\n\nTo close I will tell you the story of one of my favourite troops, the troop that really got me attached to the game. This is the story of Stumpy. Stumpy wasn't always called Stumpy he used to be called Lushkin Var but that only lasted a few weeks. Stumpy was just a normal Verminkin with a simple goal, not die horribly anytime soon or suffer an injury that leads to a name change. Sadly this is Mordheim so that was always going to be based on a wing and a prayer.\n\nStumpy served the warband well, he was fast and efficient and gathered much wardstone but one day he got carried way and over extended against the dreaded Possessed and was cornered by two Brethren and a Chaos Spawn. Stumpy was mangled before he could even fight back and although the battle was won by his side Stumpy lost an arm and from that point on he was Stumpy. Stumpy used to be a halberd user, all his stats and skills were based on this and at level 7 at the point of losing his arm this effectively made him not as good as he could be, (I know alot of people like to call a troop useless at this point but the truth is they are not useless, they are just not optimal which is not the same thing, and the fact that makes you give up on your troops is appalling its your fault they end up this way anyway). So the newly made Stumpy picked up a sword and bided his time till he recovered from his injuries.\n\nOnce Stumpy got back on the battle field he was kicking ♥♥♥ and taking names, with 20% less body for the enemy to hit he suddenly had a massive advantage in terms of 20% more dodge. He'd take anyone on head to head with almost a suicidal recklessness, alas after months and months of being the back bone of my fighting force he eventually got cornered in an abandonned building by the dreaded Possessed heavy line up. Unable to beat them in a fair fight he tried to run out but the only exit to the building available to him was the attic, and to get to it a climb was required. With only one arm Stumpy was trapped, he could not escape and had only one choice, fight for his life. Stumpy did the only thing he could and stood at the top of the stairs forcing the enemy to engage him one at a time.\n\nStumpy fought hard and took out two of the dreaded possessed before the unthinkable happened, a Dark Soul jumped into the room through the attic Stumpy had hoped to escape from with an enemy on both sides and not chance to disengage of room to flee just to buy time Stumpy failed his All Alone Test on the next turn. He failed it soo badly he tried to flee and the first free attack from the Dark Soul stunned him,  he was a sitting duck and because of this he was taken out.\n\nAs the rest of my warband mopped the enemies up and broke through the ones stopping them from helping Stumpy the battled ended with us winning, but sadly Stumpy suffered the dreaded permanent death. He was gone forever, I was devastated, like I had to make a cup of tea and watch TV for a bit. It was awful but life is cheap, and I got over it before my tea got cold and moved my focus to my Black Skaven duo, the gruesome twosome - Belle and Sebastion. But thats another story.\n\nIn summary this game is hard, this game is frustrating, this game needs patience and this game is not to be played for hours and hours every day. This game is slow and best played as a mission a night, after work and before bed its a great unwinder after a long day of a 2 hour commute and a 10 hour shift. The atmosphere of the environment and its aesthetic are sublime. It does have long wait times but so what, start loading and go make a cup of tea, or pair your socks or some other thing that takes a few minutes that you always put off. Its worth it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHIS EDIT WAS ADDED 6th February 2016\n\nSince the latest patch and the introduction of two new hired swords in DLC the game has improved significantly over some of its initial flaws held against it in alot of other reviews, the most major improvement of which is the loading times have been drastically reduced. I am not impressed with this however as I no longer have enough time to make a cup of tea while its loading.","December 27, 2015","true","251.2"," 189 of 227 people (83%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","83","189","227","58","4"

There are no mouseovers and feedback from the UI is very poor as a result.\n\nEach unit plays their turn in initiative order. All unit control is done from a 3rd person/over the shoulder perspective when it is that unit's "turn", using WASD/Controller to move the unit in realtime around the point at which they started, up to a certain distance depending on that unit's stats.\n\nThere is a tactical overview map which can be brought up. Unfortunately, due to some fairly arbitrary reasoning: you cannot control any of your units from this tactical view like in other strategy games. I feel as a result the game suffers quite a lot. The developers have confirmed that this will not change.\n\nThe choice of inital mercenary bands is disappointing. All empire mercs are now lumped into a single faction (no Reiklanders, Middenheimers or Marienburgers).\n\nI am very disappointed I bought this game, and would urge anyone considering a purchase to wait for a demo to be available to be able to give the game a try before fronting up any cash.\n\nUpdate:\n\nTo be fair to the devs, since I wrote this review they have started a thread asking for ideas to improve the mouse and keyboard controls: http://steamcommunity.com/app/276810/discussions/3/606068060820913464/\n\nUnless some really dramatic changes come out of this however, I don't see my opinion changing.","January 13, 2015","false","2.1"," 656 of 894 people (73%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","73","656","894","28","67"

The author cannot ensure that you will have fun. In fact equal parts stress and fun are to be expected. If you do not have fun playing this game try going for a bike ride or playing skippy-rope.\n\nFirstly, a concept that might be familliar to some:\n\nWinning isn't always good!\n\nIf you've played Darkest Dungeon, you'll already know this, but if you haven't bare this in mind. In this game there is winning and there is  winning . There is "killing the enemy team with minimal casualties, collecting plenty of precious green-crack (wyrdstone) and completing all of the objectives" winning. And then there is "half of my warband that I spent thousands of gold on died but it's ok because the narrator told me I did good in the loading screen" winning.\n\nNow people might tell you it's the hideous AI that cause the difference, but I've found that every time the latter has happened to me it's because I was too greedy. Too greedy for that sweet green crack.\n\nThat leads to the second tip on how to have funᵗᵐ\n\nDon't be too greedy!\n\nActually I should rephrase this. Don't get upset if all your dudes die when you're greedy! Being greedy is pretty fun in this game, so I'm not gonna tell you to refrain yourself from scrounging up enough green crack as possile. But be warned - this is the primarily way your warband will die.\n\nYou will have just won a mission pretty convincingly. You'll be assursed of your skill as a masterful tactician and may even be convinced that Sun Tzu himself would have been proud of your most gracious dispray. You'll start deploying for the next mission:\n\n"yeeeeah, I'm sure I can be spread that thin" you'll tell yourself, "I'll just make a rush for the wyrdstone then regroup my dudes!!"\n\nAnd then two turns later all your heroes will be surrounded whilst your fat little henchmen try and scramble to help them, plodding slowly accross the map before deciding ♥♥♥♥ it, it's not worth it, and surrendering half way. This how is my wizard became a blind psychopath who can barely use magic anymore. I still keep him around, though I'm not quite sure why.\n\nNow for some guidance on the more unintuitive points:\n\nThe loot system is a little bit ♥♥♥♥ed\n\nOkay, so apparently a mercenary is unable to throw 5 gold pennies on the floor in order to pick up a piece of ripe green crack rock worth around 100 gold. The loot system in this game can be pretty frustrating, but once you get used to it, it definitely adds to the flavour.\n\nYou cannot swap items unless there is space in what you are looting, which means you can't pick up any green crack if you're inventory is full. This is something that annoyed me at the start of the game as you just want to pick up all the ♥♥♥♥ you can and then not being able to swap items for far more valuable wyrdstone is frustrating. But later on you realise it adds more to the game. You have to be careful with what you loot and decide early on who you're pack ♥♥♥♥♥es will be so you can have them sup from the pap of strength.\n\nThis also applies to extra mission objectives. If you win a mission by killing someone - guess what? You can't loot their corpse! This doesn't really make a lot of sense and it makes extra objectives a lot more difficult, but rightly so really - they give you pretty hefty rewards. If you have a bounty mission you want*(*optional being the key word here) to complete you have to try not to win too fast so you can kill and collect the bounties before the games over.\n\nyour dudes are pretty fat, be careful where you put them!\n\nOcassionally you will accidentally place your buddy a little bit too centred in a tight pass. Ocasionally this will block 4/5 of your buddies/guys from getting where they need to go. Ocasionally this will cost you a mission as half your warband sit there waiting for your buddy to get his fat ♥♥♥♥ out of the way.\n\nYou may also end up getting your favourite hero trapped in a corner and brutally murdered by an enemy hero because you thought a hard difficulty mission wouldn't be that bad and you assumed there was space to flee.\n\nThat brings us to the next point:\n\nOnly do normal missions!..  ...at first\n\nStarting out with a warband be very wary about doing missions other than normal ones. Your first warband is like a newborn babe. It is very fragile and very precious to you. Attempting a Hard or Brutal mission is like trying to feed your newborn baby a rare steak when it's only just started teething.\n\nOnly start with harder level missions once you have some levels under your belt and/or you start to understand how the AI works. When you have a more developed warband they can be more fun, but don't be surprised if something goes wrong and you're favourite hero dies.\n\nRNG in this game is RNG\n\n"REAL ♥♥♥♥ING OBVIOUS MAN"\n\nNot so much. There is RNG and there is  RNG . You won't find any PDR handholding here like in dota 2 or wow or most other mainstream titles for that matter. Some people seem to claim that the RNG in this game is fasle and the actual percentages for completing actions is lower than what's listed but this seems like BS and I can't see any reason for the devs to do this.\n\nFrom my perspective the RNG in this game seems exactly that - random. You'll have moments where your dude will miss 2 attacks in a row that had a 86% chance to hit, but you'll also have moments when all 3 of your marksmen will manage 40% chance shots into combat in a row and save your hero from getting his face mushed into putty.\n\nAlso, failing acrobatics tests are both frustrating and hilarious. Yes, my leader did just spent half his turn trying to scramble up a small ledge, losing half his hp and then giving up, yours was busy collecting green crack? Well done.\n\nPick up this game if: you like other masochistic titles like Dark Souls or Darkest Dungeon\nyou like watching men in tights trying to scramble up walls\nyou like watching people kill themselves by trying to be wizards\nyou like watching mutants slap people in the head\nyou are catholic/ like nuns\nyou fantasize about colonies of rat people living in the sewers under your city/ town\n\nFor the best dramatic effect I suggest you start the game with Reikland Mercenaries, take mostly marksmen for your henchmen, and give everyone a gun and an American WW2 name.","January 27","true","37.0"," 109 of 125 people (87%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","87","109","125","54","2"

Since you aren't the only with that great idea you will meet other gangs there ... meeting in that case means you fight them.\nThe gameplay can be compared with other turnbased strat games like X-Com but your warband (your gang) is a bit greater. Since there are no custom warbands yet I can't tell what exatcly sizes are possible. In the original boardgame most warbands have a maximum size of 15 and only skaven warbands (mutand rat people) can recruit up to 20 bandmembers.\n\nIn this early acces state these RPG elements (like building your own warband, recruit new "soldiers", buy equipment, search the city for loot and treasures after battle, learn the fate of your wounded bandmembers or level up your bandmembers) aren't implemented yet. But you get an impression on how the gameplay is working and in my opinion it plays out well.\n\nFurther there are some enhancements compared to the boardgame: for example vision and spotting system.\nWhile playing the boardgame you always know where your opponents troops are. Thats changed here and adds a great immersive feeling to the game ( threats could lure behind every corner in the narrow gaps of Mordheim) and of course it opens new possibilitys for ambush tactics.\n\nThe controls and gameplay are very simple and even playable with a controllerpad if you want to play it on your TV from the sofa. Although most of the rather complex strategy elements of the boardgame aren't missing here. (Like several stat checks on moral, ini, etc.. Great for ppl. like me who are cursed with misfortune as soon as they grab a dice, all random events are calculated automatically. )\nSo positioning and awareness of your strenghts and weaknesses are as important as they were in the original boardgame.\n\nFight itself is also calculated based on stats. Hits have a chance to fail, victim has a chance to parry/dodge, damage varies and has a chance to crit and so on. But fights take longer as they do in the boardgame since combatants have more HP. In the boardgame fighters (espeacially henchmen) happen to be taken out of action extremly fast. Often a succesful hit + damagecheck is enough to take em out (most fighters haven't more then 1 HP).\nThe "more HP system" of the PC version pleases me more. On the other hand, the crit system is a bit booring (as far as I saw it). Crits just do extra damage and once I stunned an opponent with a melee crit. Crits in the boardgame are more funny since crazy **** is about to happen after a crit :)\nI'm missing that a bit here.\n\nGraphics are quite good and events like climbing/jumping/fighting are shown like a little movie (like in X-Com)\nThe atmosphere is great so far.\n\nOnly con from my side so far:\n- only 4 Warbands "races" are planned so far ( Human Mercs, Skaven, Sisters of Sigmar and Cult of the Possessed ) missing are Witchhunters and Undead that are also available in the standart boardgame rules without any expansions.\nI could imagine that they will probably be added as DLCs but I hope they don't sell em for ripoff prices. With all the boardgame expansions the variety of different Warbands is nearly endless.\n\nI really think this game has a lot of potential and I really hope they implement all the things that made the boardgame great and don't screw it up.\n\nTLDR:\n\nNo RPG Warband content yet. Combat gameplay only.\n\nPro:\n- Great combat gameplay so far\n- Boardgame mechanics are represented well\n- Good atmosphere\n- Nice graphics\n- At some points better then the boardgame ( for example real ambushes since the opponent can't see your troops all the time... technical impossible with a boardgame )\n\nCon:\n- Only 4 Warbands planned so far, original boardgame version had 6 (+ X with expansions)\n- Critical hit system was more exiting in the boardgame. As far as I saw it here it was more damage + chance to stun.\n\nSo far great potential (it even made me write a review ... that happened never before). Curious to see the RPG elements coming that made the boardgame great and special.\n\nPS: Sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.","November 24, 2014","true","8.5"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","127","151","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/276810/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","I'm going to give this a very, very hesitant recommendation. From my understanding, as I've never played the tabletop version myself, this plays nothing like it so don't expect a fully faithful recreation here. However, this game is a Turn-Based Strategy game, and as a TBS lover there is some fun to be had here...occasionally. If you've ever played Valkyria Chronicles, this game feels incredibly similar.\n\nLet me get this out the way first. If you have an SSD, use it with this game. As many have said before, this game's load times are absolutely awful. I could browse my favorite porn site, beat off, go make a sandwich, watch some TV and catch my favorite show, and this ♥♥♥♥ would still be narrating during the load screen with the "In Progress" disclaimer not showing me any real, actual progress. AMD also has issues with this title, such as an annoying graphical glitch with a white line on your screen.\n\nAnyway, one thing that definitely irks me right out the gate is the missed opportunity to include more factions/"races". This game suffers from a severe lack of variety on this front, especially for a board game that had so damn many. Games Workshop's official list for Mordheim had Beastmen Raiders, Carnival of Chaos, Dwarf Treasure Hunters, Orcs & Goblins, Undead, Witch Hunters, and quite a few others[www.mordheimer.com]. In this PC game? We're limited to Skaven, Sisters of Sigmar, Cult of the Possesed, and a very limited version of Mercenaries. So essentially of the numerous possibilities, we only get 4? The only hope we get from devs on this is "it depends on the sales of the vanilla game" as potential DLC. This isn't even doing the core Mordheim game justice, considering it had Witch Hunters and Undead in the original ruleset. Not even mentioning the missed opportunity with numerous weapons absent, even necessities such as giving Sisters of Sigmar their one ranged weapon in slings(apparently it wasn't included because it along with whips were too difficult to animate or some b.s.).\n\nAnother missed opportunity being customization options. There's hardly any to choose from aside from 1-4 different hair styles per troop, 1-3 slightly different models of clothing pieces, and 1-4 different hair colors. This means your Warband of people is going to start looking like clones of each other incredibly fast(especially since they all have the same face with no customization option there either). Once again, the hope here? Possible DLC in the future. This might not seem like much, in the original XCOM all your men ended up looking like Guile anyway right? Well, it certainly does deserve mentioning I feel.\n\nI honestly could go on about the missed opportunities here, but let's just talk about what we actually do get instead of what we could have had. And to start off, the AI in this game is ♥♥♥. Like...straight Boondocks Thugnificent Booty Butt Cheeks. It's so bad that the devs didn't work on coding better AI algorithms, instead giving them  damage increases[mordheimcotd.gamepedia.com] for them to compensate. The flavor of the warbands is completely missed and avoided with the tactics of the bots. Which is to say they have none, and usually just blindly rush you. It doesn't matter which unit(s) they have, they will engage you regardless of the situation. No ambushes are set, no tactics are employed, no guessing what can come next...except the mindless onslaught of the enemy bashing their head against the wall to break through. This is made 50x worse in the "Campaign" missions you get, where the devs thought it wise to place on a layer of artifical difficulty by having the AI spawn endless amounts of units at you, to overwhelm you incessantly at times. They don't stop coming until you complete the objective(s).\n\nWhich leads into another point. The objectives in this game, in particular during campaign missions, are tedious, convoluted, and just flat out uninteresting and unfun - as an aside the difficulty is also very arbitrary. For example the very first mission as Mercenaries has you fighting a Skaven Rat Ogre, after you raid a port and invade it akin to the WW2 Normandy Beach landing. I lost a man just trying to climb up a wall(and failing horrendously multiple times, it's RNG based yay!) while a Skaven blasted me to bits with a pistol. Another mission had me finding 3 randomly placed vials around the map(it doesn't tell you where they are, so you have to look WHILE combating the enemy), and filling them up in another part of the map. This isn't fun. Do developers play this ♥♥♥♥ before implementing it? The inventory system is nightmare fuel and the main aspect in the campaign missions. You can't pass items among your men, or drop them without use of a container. It took me about two seconds to up and say, "yeah, that isn't very enjoyable with these game mechanics."\n\nSecondary objectives don't fair much better, and honestly a good majority of the time they are absolutely and completely forgotten the minute you encounter your first AI opponent. Why? Because as I said they just mindlessly rush you with no regard. It doesn't help that the secondary objectives don't make much sense anyway. Secondary objectives like "Steal their idol and bring it back to your cart" end up falling on their face, because grabbing their idol drops their morale, causing them to rout. You never even get back to your own cart before the match ends because of that, and unfortunately you don't even get ♥♥♥♥ing credit WITH IT IN YOUR HAND because you didn't fulfill the goal to the T. Another secondary objective says "Kill X guy and pick up his bounty equivalent item." Trouble is, sometimes you can kill that guy and the round ends then and there, not giving you time to pick up the item(even though it's AT YOUR FEET). The secondary mission objectives are ludicrous, and encourage silly tactics to work around to tack on a few unneeded hours of tedium to the game.\n\nAnother aspect that absolutely kills the game for me, is that the game doesn't account for your actual unit levels. The only thing the game looks at when making mission difficulty is your warband level it seems. Lost a high ranking guy? Well, let's hire someone similar, right? What's that? Anyone other than the level 0 guy is a ♥♥♥♥ing obscene amount of gold? Well then ♥♥♥♥, I am stuck with the level 0 guy. But the game sees my warband is level 6 with a combined rating of 1,000+, so it accordingly throws a bunch of geared level 5-6 troops at me. Needless to say I got ♥♥♥♥ed. This kind of just adds on yet another layer of difficulty/RNG not needed. It's beyond ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating...\n\nWhy recommend it then? Because this game does have a lot going for it on the stat-end. You can cutomization the heck out of your men in this regard. There's also a ton of choice in skill and spell selection here as well; Seriously, check it out[nithon.de]. You can build your Warband in so many different ways, I would really doubt you would ever find someone running the same things as yourself which is awesome. The game mechanically is very rough, flawed, and RNG based, but if nothing else this game delivers tons of choices for you to play with. This game also really comes to life in multiplayer, as some things can only truly be employed by another living, thinking player. Ambush sight lines, high ground access point blocking, etc. And what's cool is that as bad as the singelplayer is, you can still carry over your warband over into multiplayer and vice versa.\n\nAs I said, a very hesitant recommendation. Only if you're a turn-based strategy fan(that likes the ability to customize your troops) and a fan of Warhammer fantasy would I say to get this game.","January 2","true","51.6"," 92 of 105 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","92","105","15","0"

This is what a Games Workshop adaptation done right looks like!\n\nWith more than 70 hours of play time under my belt, I'm still just as captivated by the game.  The tactical combat is serious fun and easy to pick up but just keeps getting deeper as you learn and progress.  The persistant warband progression features a huge skill tree to customize your units and both permadeath and persistant injury to keep things tense.  The four factions (Human Mercenaries, Skaven, Chaos and Sisters of Battle) are nicely varied, asymetrical and can be sucessfully adapted to different tactics.  Battles are filled with meaningfull tactical decisions where positioning, timing, equipment and skill set all matter.  Each trip back into Mordheim still feels like an exciting, high stakes risk.\n\n---Original Early Access Review Below---\n\nHaving just finished my first Early Access skirmish, the first thing I wanted to do was come here and report that it's exactly what I was hoping for.   The game systems remind me of my favorite things from Firaxis XCOM and Valkyria Chronicles, and it's easy to tell the developers care about the GW source material.  The first Early Access version only includes a small slice of the game, but it's already possible to play a fun skirmish, and there is a ton of potential here once persistance and progression are added.\n\nThree thumbs up (Three? Blame Tzeentch..) for a good looking, faithful, and most importantly, fun Mordheim adaption.","November 20, 2014","true","95.8"," 139 of 173 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","139","173","4","0"

They are then replaced by level 0 punks who are immediately targeted by the enemy and killed in two shots in every fight making it impossible to level them up again.  It is highly repetetive and slow.  The AI does not change it's strategy in any way, ever.  Whatever the goal of the mission they will rush you and try to inflict permentant wounds without any other goal or concern for its own troops because it's squads are randomly generated and not presistant.  Occasionally it is exciting, but it is the excitement of gambling, only good when you happen to beat the odds.\n\nThere is a good game here, buried under bad decisions based on apeing the boardgame and making things as grindy as humanly possible and providing no 'endgame' to that grind besides killing your units so you can start over again at a significant disadvantage.  "but the point is to fail and then start over!"  if so, it is poorly designed because starting over is a vastly painful waste of time.","December 14, 2015","false","222.9"," 224 of 299 people (75%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","75","224","299","20","0"

I've given it a fair crack and there's a lot I like about the game, but in the end I've decided that the negatives outweigh the positives.\n\nIt has the worst case of RNG ♥♥♥-hattery I've yet encountered. It makes bloodbowl look even handed and fair.\nRoutinely expect to rack up failure after failure at apparently simple tasks. (Writing this, I have just failed 13 sequential attempts to climb a wall that apparently had a 67% chance of success). It's also common place for you to miss a swing at an almost dead opponent who promptly turns around and kills your hero, while tzeentch strikes down your spellcasters at random. There's not enough men in a warband to compensate for these failures, so each battle quickly becomes incredibly frustrating and a few bad luck failures in a row cost you the battle and theres nothing you can do about it.\n\nCrappy map work with lots of inexplicable cant-go-there spots.\n\nBugs. Many and various bugs. Ranging from graphical glitches and some twitchy camera work to it being completely random whether or not your guy in ambush stance actually attacks people moving into his range. Also I'm damned if I can figure out what conditions you have to satisy to make "charge" an option. Sometimes its' there, sometimes its not.\n\nGameplay is slow and drawn out. I've played for about 15 hours or so and only completed 1 story mission. Exciting it is not.\n\nBattles have optional objectives which are intended to shake things up, however the moment you come into contact with the enemy you quickly become tied into a series of small fights and the optional objectives are forgotten. Since the enemy will rout and the battle ends as soon as more than 2-3 guys go down you never get a chance to go back to them.\n\nThe RPG elements dont appear to have much affect on the gameplay. None of the skills you can learn are really significant, most add a couple of % to a few RNG tests which, as previously stated, are utter bolloks anyway. Certainly they're massively outweighed by the effects of injuries.\n\nObscenely long loading times. I mean it.

I have to say that the game devs have impressed me with their attention to the community, despite some of the issues remaining (see below for original early access review) it has improved a lot.\n\nI'd still say that if you're only looking at the game because of the title, you will likely be disappointed. The style of game is not the same as the tabletop original.\n\nIt plays better than it did in early access, a lot of it has been fleshed out now. And the XP/progression and customization has been added rather well. I haven't played all that much since release but it seems that warband progression increases the overall difficulty of every single battle available, so that progression seems to be offset by how much the fights increase. Rather than giving easier options for lower rewards, everything just gets harder based solely on your warband score. So you can min/max it, or just keep disbanding experienced troops to lower that score and farm. Which goes against the purpose a bit if they were aiming to avoid people grinding against easier opponents. It just removes a choice of play. Again, this is based mostly on the community posts I've read and the limited time i've put into the game since release.\n\nI'm still wary that this game will be yet another DLC heavy game, and being one of those who find that to be very anti consumer it's another black mark. The existing 4 warbands seem fairly fleshed out, not exactly balanced yet nor true to the source but each seems fun to play.\n\nTl;Dr - I would still have not purchased this back in early access if I could go back, but if it was on a sale I'd give it a look. Maybe watch the progress for a while if you're unsure, I doubt it's finished yet despite being released.\n\n-Original Review-\n\nStay away from it for now. After pre-order it MIGHT be worthwhile, who knows..\nFirstly this is coming from a fan of Mordheim, the tabletop game. A lot of my issues with the game are solely down to how much they've deviated from it, as the only reason I even looked at this game is because of the name.\n\nDoes it play well on PC? Barely. It feels like a console port.\nThere's currently no XP/progression/customization. This WILL be in the released version, but how well they manage it is in question..\n4 initial warbands promised, this screams a warning of a DLC heavy game. As well as minimal customization.\nBut are those warbands accurate to the tabletop warbands? So far, not at all. The game's being balanced around equal sized warbands, and as they've included skaven as one of the first released this becomes an issue. Skaven were always meant to be weaker in equal numbers, but they had a significant number and mobility advantage. That's gone. The humans have been merged into one, and been stripped of any actual character. They're just generic humans now.\n1-2 Knockdown, 3-4 Stunned, 5-6 Out of Action? Nope. Hitpoints, when that gets to 0 it's more than likely out of action.\nArmour saves to shrug off all damage? Nope. Very small damage reduction.\n\nThe only positives I can think of are that finally someone's making a mordheim game, even if it is just in name and theme rather than content.. The graphics are pretty damned good so far, but not that great compared to other games that are currently out. The third person perspective's an interesting concept, but so far it's just been a bit of a poor gimmick rather than something that actually benefits the game.\n\nI really hope they take a few steps back and recreate the game in a closer manner to the blood bowl PC game. They're clearly going after the fanbase of the tabletop game, and this game really doesn't feel anywhere near to the tabletop version. Hopefully this doesn't end up another game that I regret pre ordering, my inner fanboy (mordheim was my favourite games workshop game) and hype swayed my hand and now I'm looking at it a bit clearer I shouldn't of risked it.","January 19, 2015","false","6.0"," 376 of 550 people (68%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","68","376","550","14","34"

With Skaven (don't we all love them?)\n\n\nConsidering it's only early access you should not get too depressed at the lack of options at this moment.\nThe game flows quite nicely with the two currently available factions (Skaven, Empire) - And at that I did actually enjoy myself despite the lack of variant gameplay options.\n\nRight now it's only 1on1 Skirmish (quick-battle) for us to play. Altho, as I've only faced the computer I noticed the AI is quite simplistic, and also it's abit too easy for units locked in melee to disengage, thus completely stopping a melee character to root an archer for example from shooting him in the face after disengaging melee,\n\nAlso, the options to make use of the last actionpoints after attacking are very lacking - After you attack, either parry or dodge action is allowed for the typical melee character. Thus there is no real punishment for an attacker. After you swing, you'r always allowed to boost your parry/dodge stats. - Why not simply make it automatic - since no one would simply click end turn and thus wasting the free boost.\n\nThere are several weak points in combat so far - no terrain advantage/disadvantage in combat. An archer on the ground is able to snipe at high percentage possibility vs a small rat hiding 1 meter inside a building. Go sixth sense! - But do not ever forget, it's still early access and these things are subject to change.\n\nIf you buy and test this game at early access, it will be your obligation to report issues and give positive feedback to the developers, if not for them - do it to make sure your investment makes a quality purchase instead of a "chance-risk" of a money exchange for entertainment.\n\nIt's totally up to you if you wish to dedicate yourself into an unfinished product.\n\n\n\n\n","November 20, 2014","true","39.1"," 82 of 107 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","82","107","0","7"

Yes, it's maddening to have a warband route just before you accomplish a secondary objective. Yes, it's insanely frustrating when a character with over a 70% chance just can't climb a wall. Yes, it's brutal when you have a few bad games and you have to disband and start again. But all these "problems" are absolutely how the table-top game plays out, too! Welcome to Mordheim! To all who worked so hard to make this game, THANK YOU! I can only hope there will be some future DLC with more warbands joining the mix!","January 9","true","208.0"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","52","60","2","14"

This game is by no means finished. I would recommend waiting until it is a little further along in development before purchasing straight away.\n\nWith that out of the way let's begin. Mordheim City of the Damned is the electronic and spiritual successor to the tabletop franchise that spawned out of Games Workshop's very own tabletop world of fantasy Warhammer. You take control of a band of warriors and proceed to try and outwit and eviscerate your opponent.\n\nThe gameplay is a nice blend of a turn-based RPG with elements from the tabletop game itself. In my opinion this is the game Relic should have been making for the Warhammer franchise all this time. And once it is finally completed it will be a real gem. There is talk of adding more warbands, adding to the original four. These new bands will supposedly include Undead, Dwarves and Elves.\n\nThis game has tons of potential, and once all these features which are currently locked in game start working, it will get even better. Plus who doesn't enjoy watching their Commander fall flat on their ♥♥♥ from trying to climb a 6ft wall.","April 18, 2015","true","7.5"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","42","47","5","2"

It's a great turn-based strategy game with individual levelling for all characters.  There is a great feeling of satisfaction that goes into levelling up a party.  To that extent, it's a lot of fun, but it has some pretty serious issues.\n\nThis is a "hardcore" style game.  If a character gets hurt, he stays hurt.  If a character dies, he's gone forever.  this is an interesting dynamic which I typically do not like, but it's okay if it's done well.  In this game, it is done well.  Most of the time.  however, towards the end game, it turns into a game breaker, and I'll explain why.\n\nThe story missions are challenging, to say the least.  No, I'll go one step beyond that.  They are hard.\n\nFirst of all, they put my warband into a tactically stupid situation that I would never put myself into.  Both of my archers were paired with my mage, and two of them were dead before they even had a turn on my first play-through.  On my second playthrough, after losing one of my archers to perma-death and firing the other because he was pretty much worthless after suffering a brain injury, I used only melee characters with much better success.  That doesn't change the fact that my warband was pretty much decimated due to a flaw in the game.  Oh well.  Another 20-30 hours of play time to get my warband powerful enough to take on the mission again.\n\nOn my second playthrough, I was plugging along just fine.  The basic premise behind that mission is that there is an invicincible opponent that goes around destroying all of your characters without batting an eye while the player struggles to figure out how to inflict damage on her.  When I finally figured out that you need to disable the pillars, it took three turns to arrive at the first pillar while this enemy is mercilessly killing my warband.  When I finally arrive, I think "finally.  I might be able to inflict some damage!"  But no.  I need some shard or something, and who knows where the heck that is.  Suddenly, it sinks in.  Even with the shard, it will take 5-6 turns to disable all of the pillars.  And that's not including the amount of time it will take to find the shard.  So, yeah.  My warband was completely decimated a second time, and I'm not willing to put 20-30 hours of play time into this game again just to get my warband powerful enough to take on the mission again.\n\nSimply put, when I purchased this game, I was looking for two things.  I wanted a turn-based strategy game.  Check.  Secondly, I wanted a game where I had the ability to level up individual characters in my war party.  Check.  What I did not want is a puzzle game where if you get it wrong the first time, you realize you've wasted 20-30 hours of your life.  If I wanted to solve puzzles, I'd go play Portal.  There is a reason why I don't play Portal.  It's because I hate puzzle games.  What's worse than a puzzle game?  A puzzle game where failure is pretty much permanent.\n\nIf that type of frustration is what you are looking for in a game, then by all means:  Purchase Mordheim.  As it sits, this game took over 100 hours of my time, and I want that time back.\n\n","January 3","false","223.7"," 72 of 95 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","72","95","8","2"

The emphasis in early access has been on balance and keeping to the spirit of its tabletop predecessor, and it has done that in spades.  Its color pallete and graphic design are ludicrously dark and forboding.  Every map is liberally painted with corruption and death, with every little bump or crevess hiding another way to get killed.  In this aspect, it is just like every game of Mordheim you've ever played on your high school buddies kitchen table.\n\nWhere the game differs is in its combat and warband growth.  The warband building system is difficult to master, yet varied enough to cater to quite a few different playstyles in one warband.  Half of the challenge right now is finding out what works the best, and I forsee it becoming quite similar to the tabletop game's tendency to rely on cookie cutter net lists, but this doesn't bother me at all.  Its something you can plan for and counter with ingenuity and skilled gameplay.\n\nCombat is often initiated totally by surprise, yet can be flipped in just two or three actions.  While individual characters can shine, what really makes the difference is your follow up.  This is a great way to really do combat, as it makes you truly have to think out each turn before you take action.\n\nAll of these together come wrapped up in a very neat little package, a promise of things to come.  Its still in early access, but there is still so much more Rogue Factor can do.  The skys the limit...try it out..watch the learning curve, and you will be happy you spent the cash\n\n","September 24, 2015","true","284.6"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","0"

I feel like I just have to leave a comment here - partially for the potential buyers, but also for the developers.\n\nRogue - you have created what could be a true epic strategy game.  So far, i am loving your design choices.  Continue to pour love into this game.  Warband development / progression / equipment is probably going to be what makes or breaks this game.  If you do this well and reward players for good play and gently punish those that choose poor strategies - you will do well.  It should be fair and over time the better players should build stronger warbands.  I also feel that the possibility of having assymetric multiplayer could help this feel awesome.  Allow the community to build "clans" and allow clans to challenge each other for even greater rewards and risks.  This "style" or genre of game could become a HUGE thing.\n\nWarcraft 3 initially was going to go with this style of game (small persistent warbands that developed over time), but they abandoned it.  I always wanted that game to be made and this could be it.  The possibilities are endless.  You could overlay a "mordheim strategy map" that clans could vie for control over.  Limit a server to a certain number of players and let different clans and factions fight for dominance.\n\nAnyways - i'm excited.  This game so far shows an INCREDIBLE amount of potential.  Please continue to listen to the community, but also know when to NOT listen to the community.  So far, your vision looks like it's paying off.\n\nGood luck, Rogue.\n\n","November 21, 2014","true","11.5"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","50","63","0","1"

Maybe I expected too much, I don´t know, but I expected a better game . It has been just full released but i feel like game lacks content, A LOT.\n\n-First of all: Only four warbands. Seriously no orcs, dwarfs or undead?\n-Very limited customization of characters.\n-Few warrior classes. I expected more variety.\n-The management of your units in only 3 groups (leader, hero and adept) is just too basic and rusty.\n-Very few types of secondary objective (steal idol, kill and steal "x" unit equipment and collect "x percentage" of wyrdstone).\n-Multiplayer is broken: almost no matches can be found.\n\nAlso, in my opinion, one of the biggest issues in this game is the AI: The AI makes lots of "stupid" decisions but the real problem is how the devs tried to fix it: In campaing, you will ALWAYS have to face a superior warband (even on normal difficulty), no matter the mission, it will always have better stats than your warband. So the difficulty (normal, brutal, deadly) is based in how high the difference in stats will be. I dont know, but i find this combat system too unfair, especially when you have the risk of losing your warband members forever (permadeath) and losing a couple of valuable characters means almost a forced warband restart because fights, even on normal difficulty, will be impossible.\n\nUnit placement is a nightmare: In some maps you will have more than 30 deployement spots and you cant just click the point where you want the unit to be placed, you have to switch between the 30 spots until you get the place you want.\n\nSame with inventory management: If you have fulled the capacity and want to pick something from the ground, you can´t just switch items. You will have to go to a chest and leave the objects you don´t want there before taking more. Seriously?\n\nFinally, the excesive focus on random chance in this game is just annoying.\n\nOf course the game is not rubbish but i don´t think it worths 40$.

That will include tales of victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, frustrations due to unforeseen events (likely combined with minor mistakes), pyrrhic victories, and even fortunate defeats.\n\nI once had a relatively inexperienced character hold against, and severely damage, a massive Rat Ogre, long enough for help to arrive. In a later game, when facing the lethally quick Skaven (rat people), he stuck his neck out to help two fellow warriors get to a safe position, delaying the Skaven leader and tying up three others for two turns, before paying the ultimate price (perma-death).\n\nThrough it all, you'll be challenged, and likely have to restart with a new warband or two. But once you get a handle on the gameplay, you'll be rewarded with a nuanced tactical and strategic challenge. For instance, I spend several minutes at the start of each game (against the AI, mind you) looking over the game's map, planning my deployment and strategy for that mission. You'll benefit not only from such planning, but also from careful use of tactics, such as adjusting your formations to ensure shooters have clear shots of incoming enemies, and ensuring that your fighters are in ambush stances to prevent access to your soft targets.\n\nOh, and friendly tip for fellow lovers of ranged combat: set melee weapons as your primary weapons for your shooters (you can have 2 sets of weapons), and their ranged weapons as secondary. You'll be able to switch back during the game, but (most) melee weapons give you far better initiative, which can buy you time to get into position. And for this purpose, stick to initiative-boosting weapons, like spears, daggers, and swords.\n\nEnjoy!","November 30, 2015","true","460.6"," 75 of 106 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","75","106","11","0"

It looks like it, it feels like it, but it is an adaption of the table-top game, not a direct port. So if you want Mordheim as you remember it, this is not it. But it is still an amazing game.\n\nIt captures the look and feel of TT Mordheim very well. The characters look like they jumped right off your miniature shelf and into your monitor. The world feels exactly like Mordheim should...dark, scary and evil. It is very close to Warhammer lore, and if you want a Warhammer Fantasy fix this is surely your best bet today. No Age of Shitmar junk here! Just traditional Warhammer goodness!\n\nPROS:\n-The maps are truly amazing and detailed. There is nothing else like it. Multiple stories in buildings, raised walkways and terrain, traps and dead ends. Ruined buildings and plenty of flanking and high ground opportunities abound. It blows away anything else in the market and needs to be seen to be believed. All maps also are different every time you play them due to procedural terrain generation. Never the same experience twice.\n-The graphics are well done, the animations are varied and many, and as said above they really captured the feel of Warhammer in it's entirety.\n-The development options are immense. 175 total skills and 8 unique spells per faction. 7 different characters for 4 warbands. So many ways to build your characters to fit your playstyle.\n-'Hardcode' gameplay. You cannot save and reload (although you can save/quit and continue again at any time) or as it's known, save-scumming. Characters can get injuries and die. You live with consequences.\n-Huge array of maps for multiplayer, with many options.\n-Seamless integreation of Single Player and Multiplayer. They are basially one and the same.\n-Unique campaign for each faction and a large single player experience.\n\nCONS:\n-The wealth of options can be overwhelming to new players. If this doesn't bother you, you'll love it.\n-The lack of dedicated MP support. Since the publisher didn't cough up the cash for dedicated servers, the community will need to start their own leagues. But nothing stops you from doing MP-only with friends. You will need an 'honor' system (and screenshots) to enforce MP only.\n-Hardcore gameplay can be a turn off. If you can't handle setbacks, you won't like this game.\n-AI still needs work. It can be challenging at first, but after a while it is fairly beatable. Of course, that's where MP comes in. Note the developers are still working on the AI.\n-"Only" 4 warbands. If you want a lot of options they aren't here yet. That said, the four warbands offer immense options anyway. But if your a TT purist, or really want Undead or Dwarves, they aren't here yet.\n-The complex maps can sometimes cause issues with AI pathfinding, and you may not get why you cannot disengage from combat because some rock or skeleton is blocking your way.\n\nIt has to be said the development team, Rogue Factor, has been truly amazing throughout the early acces in terms of accessibility, communication, and feedback. A number of suggestion I myself have made are in the game...they really listen to the community, beyond any other developer I've ever seen. They will continue to refine the game even after release, and if sales justifiy, it, they will add more Warbands and functionality.\n\nIn the end, I found this to be an incredible game, well worth the $40 US. If you like warhammer, and deep turn based strategy, and want fully 3D maps that blow anything in the market away (XCOM has nothing on these maps) then this is the game for you.\n\nVERDICT: 8/10\nImproved MP support and AI will bump this up to a 9 or 9.5.","November 20, 2015","true","577.0"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","42","52","0","0"

Although it has been said that to players of the Tabletop Mordheim it does not feel like Mordheim except for the looks (meaning some core rules not being implemented), this is a fine game already. From playing the early version I can say that devs work hard to get rid off bugs and balance the units and they are highly appreciating user feedback in the forums.\nIt feels a lot like XCOM in Multiplayer but has a initiative-based turn order per unit (not per player like XCOM). To me the best aspects of the game are yet to be implemented (statistics, customization, leveling, mission goals)\n\nThe downside of this being early access is that you have only 2 pre-defined warbands available for play, while customization, leveling your units and creating class/skill/euipmtent combinations of your own is key to replayability. If you buy the early version you have to be aware that it is getting repetitive and the best thing to do is play 1-2 games per day max and report bugs in the forums.\n\nIf you don't want to spend your money yet I recommend to follow the announcements because this game feels like it's going to be great.","December 7, 2014","true","76.3"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","41","51","0","1"

Mordheim is brilliant now. It's still a bit sluggish, a bit slow with the loading, but it's so, so, so much fun.

This is one of my few exceptions. I bought this game when it was early access... because i love 40k... the video looked cool... and i thought that maybe i'd play it as one of my ï'm bored and i don't know what else to do"games.\n\nIt developed slowly but consistently and i have to say that the devs have methodically ironed out the flaws as they've arised to make it a solid game. It now loads much faster, has few bugs, is genuinely fun and has beautiful little parts such as your warband members develping their own story over time. For example I was GENUINELY upset when "Reject Ralph" finally died. Reject Ralph was initially hired as a "replacement" gunner for when i was training one of my more valued... party disposables. Reject Ralph became a valued member of my party and... lost a leg... an arm... and an eye in service...! I was very upset the day when i realised that his little wooden leg would no longer be stepped upon and the sword held in his left hand (being no longer able to fire a rifle) would no longer swing... as i could not "Ält + F4" and load the game before his departure.\n\nIn short, my review is outrageously positive due to the genuine investment in your party that the game makes you have. Moving forward, i would like to see a larger variety of maps, warbands and mission types but i have no doubt given the hstory of the developers that this will come.\n\nMy thanks to the "boredom game"that i actually rate highly in my library.","May 6","true","46.8"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","29","32","7","0"

A Scaven warband tasked at recovering warpstone from the depths of Mordheim. Kashmet had a loyal warband behind him. His officers, Mik Varr and Drac Rat watched his back and as he led them to victory over and over. As the Vargen Front grew so did they the attention of larger warbands that feared the rats may steal their warp stone from under their noses. Be it overconfidence or stubbornness, the Vargen Front decided to attack the rather powerful 'Cult of the Possesed.' The battle ended in a decisive defeat. Several clan rats where slain and the commanders all suffered permanent injury. Drac Rat lost a leg, but he shrugged it off. He was already slow from the heavy armor he wore, being a little bit slower won't hurt. Mik Varr lost his right eye, limiting his aim with ranged weapons, but as an assassin he preferred to stab his opponents in the back anyway. Kashmet lost an arm though. He could no longer wield his dual warp blades, who's green glow struck fear in his enemies. Unsure of his usefullness, Kashmet went into battle wielding only a club. Instead of being a handicap to the team, Kashmet beat indescribable amounts of ♥♥♥. Not afraid of death, he charged headfirst into battle with his club. Many a foe received a cracked skull at his hand. Fear of the One Armed Rat spread through the rivaling warbands. Under the leadership of the One Armed Rat, the Vargen Front: Decimated the Cult of the Possessed, Burned Empire ship yards, and destroyed the burrows of the Black Paw Clan. Kashmet's status in the Under Empire grew and grew, but all great hero's must fall. The Vargen Front was charged with destroying the Temple of Sigmar in the name of the Horned Rat. An ambitious mission that Kashmet was honored to accept. It was during this mission that the One Armed Rat squared off against a Maiden of Sigmar. As an elite unit, Maiden's of Sigmar are avatars of the god. Normally one would not face such an impressive foe alone, but drastic times called for drastic decisions. The Vargen Front's flank had been broken. A Matriarch and lesser sisters has reached the more delicate members of the warband and Mik Varr's scouts had suffered injuries and to fall back. As the warp guards reinforced the flank, the Maiden showed her self. She approached wrapped in a holy light carrying a mighty war hammer. She had to be held off until the warband could reorganize their ranks. Kashmet met the Maiden in one on one combat. The Maiden hit hard, but Kashmet was fast. He dodged her slow, but powerful blows and lashed back over and over. Slowly he whittled her down. With gnashing teeth and cunning feats of agility, the One Armed Rat seemed to be besting the Maiden until she finally land a blow. Her mighty war hammer brutaly caved in the skull of the One Armed Rat, slaying him. Although their leader was defeated, the Vargen Front still achieved victory. The Temple Burned in the name of the One Armed Rat.\n\nThat wall of text was the story of my favorite character from Mordheim: City of the Dammed. I have never cared so much about any character I have created in any game. He died a few days ago and I am still sad about it.\n\nAbout the game though. Mordheim is a tactical rpg like Fire Emblem or XCOM. Just like those games it is absolutely brutal. When a unit is defeated in battle, instead of dying right there, they have a chance to just be injured. It can be a light wound or a permanent injury. You can chose from 4 different warbands, Scaven, Sisters of Sigmar, Cult of the Possessed, and Empire Mercenaries. The aim of the game is to scavenge the fallen city of Mordheim for Ward Stone and sell it for profit. As your warband grows you can hire new units, level up each units stats, and buy new gear for individual units. Its a complex game with a very high learning curve. The online play is brutal because your units can still be injured, but it feels so good to get the hate mail when you kill some fools. The developers are very active and the game receives patches every two weeks. They plan on adding new warbands soon. This is without a doubt my favorite game of the year.","December 7, 2015","true","76.2"," 53 of 73 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","53","73","15","3"

It will simply charge you with whatever  units it has as soon as the game starts and will largely ignore even the most valuable loot along the way.\n-Only way to replace units is to either hire level 0 scrubs who will be wiped out in 2 attacks later in the game or pay exhorbatant fees to hire from a weekly pool of randomly generated warriors who still are just barely a few levels higher than 0. Advancing along the games campaign and smuggling system will give a free higher level unit, but in a game so heavily reliant on RNG with such aggressive AI this will not make up for the heavy number of losses you are likely to experience.\n-Small number of factions combined with a very simplistic AI creates tremendous repitition with the tedium only broken by campaign missions.\n-Loading screens long enough for you to pick up a new hobby.\n-Clunky UI. Although I hear is much better if you use a controller but I was not that fortunate.\n\nMy experience with this game has felt a lot less like some tactician and more like a compulsive gambler who enjoyed the ups and downs of such a hardcore game but every gambler has a point where they realize the pain of the game has finally outweighed the enjoyment. Mine came when I had 4 critical hits on three different characters and my leader killed himself with a 9999 damage bad luck roll all in one turn. That was the last straw that made me realize the game just wasn't enough fun for me to be worth such frustration.","January 10","false","51.4"," 63 of 90 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","63","90","4","0"

Mordheim is a great tactical game full of deep tactical opportunities and ways you can customise your own warband to lead on to glory.

It's a solid tactical turn-based strategy game with an emphasis on unit cohesion. I've played as all of the factions with the exception of Sigmar, which is next and I think you'll be happy with the variety. Though Chaos seems underpowered in terms of ranged combat and Mercenaries overpowered in the same area, it is still in beta and final balance tweaks are happening constantly.\n\nYou'll also find a good variety of players when you take it online, from people like me, who tend to stick to the rooftops and use ambush tactics, to brawny, frontline players who smash everything they see, to entire units of snipers. All are effective given circumstance. The magic targetting needs a little work and the Skaven need more ranged options, but otherwise the game is incredible, especially considering the phase its at.\n\nAs a former Mordheim (coreheim) player, and a fan of this style of dark fantasy, as well as a tactical strategy fan, I'm going to give this game a 9/10 potential with a current score of 7.5/10 because of interface issues and the above complaints.","February 21, 2015","true","6.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

Right now, it's a $30 demo with extreme loading times, and most elements of the game missing - which might be forgivable outside of the fact that those elements are what would make the game worth investing any time in to at all right now.\n\nWhen I say extreme loading times, we are talking 3-5 minutes for a skirmish vs. A.I.\n\nThe core components of the game are looking promising, but the camera clips constantly through the scenery, often placing the camera awkwardly below the ground behind your current unit during an attack. The U.I. is in desperate need of some revisions. Attribute checks, for example, are identified on one end of the screen, and display the result on the far end of the screen. This is poor design and should be a unified element in the center of the screen tying the attribute check directly to it's result. a tip should also be included to explain what a failure or success means - this feature should be enabled by default, but allow veteran players to turn it off to reduce screen clutter. This might seem a bit strange to say, but this game is so obsessed with hiding things from obvious view that it's overly streamlined.\n\nThat said, if you turn on everything, it's certainly a lot of info so there is a balance to be struck, but the radial menu feels pretty good to use and would be where I would focus my attentions as the UI designer.\n\nThe map needs work also. Getting the cursor over an element should identify that element - as is, the strategic value of the map is very dependant on how well you know each and every icon. Memorizing icons is not an edge which should exist.\n\nThe lack of game modes is pretty egregious for a game they are asking $30 for - certainly it's understood that this is a game in Beta/Early Access, but as is, this is not a game experience, it's a demo that isn't worth playing in it's current state.\n\nThe graphics are fine, but the models require some level of enhancement, especially on the highest settings. The rat ogre, upon whom I seem to get focused during opponent actions, is quite disappointingly rendered. There is no separation on the large front teeth, the fur and skin textures are flat and outside of the life you see in the armour, everything looks pretty dull.\n\nIt's not all bad, of course. The game play is pretty spot on (even with the UI deserving a bit of a reworking) and the strategy of the game has been captured well in this digital interpretation. The movement of the Skaven is well animated, and the management/advancement element of the game which is only implemented in a skin-deep "level your warband to 10 immediately" demonstation, does look like it's going to do the job well and fulfill the needs of the Mordheim fans to level their warband up and craft it in their own unique ways.\n\nLong story short, pop this promising game on your follow or wishlist and wait for quite a few patches and updates before you throw any money down on it. Based on potential, this game is highly recommended for a future purchase. For early access, I would say skip this offering and find something that will give you a little more return on your investment.\n\nEarly Access Score : 4/10\nPotential: 8/10\n\nFun? 1/10\n\nWhy? Because playing the AI seems to generate a random warband to face - and every time, they have been significantly more powerful than my warband. As in, they appear to have at least 6 actions to my 3. They hit 2 times harder, and twice as often.

So for none have met the standard or feel of any of the table top games , besides the DoW series and Blood Bowl which both are kinda hit and miss, but awesome none the less.\n\nThis game is really good already in it's early access phase. And I can see that it is only going to get better. As it stands now ( an update for the third warband and new functions ,IE stat item allocation , is happening as I type this) you have the human Mercernaries and the Skaven Clan Eshin warbands. Customization is limited , as it is early , but it is getting there. The game is simple and complex at the sametime.\n\nThe ui and function of each character is pretty self explanatory and if not, the information is easy to find. the Ui , in my opinion , is clean and not distracting. It doesn't break the immersion or distract the tactical mind.\n\nI have played both warbands ( awaiting the patch for the third warband Sisters of Mercy YUS! ) and both feel right.\n\nThe only probelm i have so far , the devs are working on.... graphical bugs , camera clips , all the NORMAL stuff for an early game. It's the only thing that breaks teh immersion, and well at times can aid you or your opponent, as in unseen movement of enemy troops.\n\nI surely DO recommend this game IF you have patience and are willing to see the game grow and expect a game NOT finished, especially at this price of $31.99. As I know GW products tend to sell on the higher end of there produst platforms, nows teh time to get this. Just get it , don't play it , and when it releases with everything , jump on t , and be happy you saved money for a more finished product in the end.\nUPDATE: With the latest patch, giving us progression and scenarios - This game has become even MORE amazing than before. The devs are styaying true to the GW feel and mechanics. The models look amazing, the atmosphere amazing! The music puts you right n the mindest of the Warbands! UI has been further made user friendly, loading has ssen a decrease in time ( which is amazing !! ) .\n\nInjuries ( one of my skaven is missing an arm , and it shows, and it's amazing, he's got a dagger full of skittering anger ready ! ), downtime, wages, gear, consumables, magic , tactics, player progression - aside from indivdual warbands ( warbands are Mordheims word for gang or team )\n\nThere are 4 warbands as of yet : Mercenary : soldiers looking for monies  Skaven : ratmen from Clan Eshin ( ninja / pirates ) Sisters of Sigmar : the holiest and angriest women alive >.< and Chaos : fiendish humans selling body parts for warp gifts and angry magic!\n\nAll very well produced and very true to their playstyle.\n\nThis is the best Early Access game I have ever purchased, and makes me believe in early access success.\nI keep coming back to it in between all my other follies of gaming, but this is the one you find yourself going " Ok one more minute-mission...." 4 hours later and 3 pots of coffee\n\n\nEither way buy it, play it , enjoy it.

The skirmish was hella' fun and left me wanting more. So why haven't I played it more?

You engage the enemy and try and rout them or complete optional objectives. My optional objective was collect 16 warpstones, but due to restricted capacity there was no point in this so I just engaged the enemy. You can climb to higher ground with the risk of falling and the various units are unique (such as a stupidity check for a Rat Ogre, spell casters etc.). There is loads of potential here with a campaign, progression and equipment for your squad. There are four diverse squads at the moment.

Percentages don't mean anything.  You'll have a 90% chance to hit an enemy and never hit them for the whole battle.  You may have a 90% chance to dodge, but the enemy will hit you 3 times in a row.  With 2 of them being crits.  I bought this game when it was first released in early access on steam, and it wasn't this bad back then.  A recent patch says it "fixed" the rng system.  Since the patch, I've just noticed getting critted more often and hitting the enemy less often.  Supposedly the unbalanced RNG system is put in to counter how bad the AI can be.  I'd rather have a smarter AI. There are also so many ways for a warband to get screwed to the point that they become unplayable.  Permanent injuries happen often.  Miss 4 payments of wyrdstone and no more single player mode.  If you get rid of a warrior because of an injury that makes them basically useless (severed leg on an already super slow warrior) and you can't afford one of the overpriced hired swords, then you have to hire a new guy at level 0.  He won't help at all and will just die because the enemies will still be leveled based on your warband's level.  Ok, I've ranted enough.  I'll still be playing this game occasionally because I am a skaven fangirl, but this game really needs some fixing.","December 16, 2015","false","77.2"," 62 of 94 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","62","94","5","2"

I really want to enjoy it and want to see it reach its potential.\n\nIf you and a friend, who were both really into Mordheim have a couple of days free, you will get hours of enjoyment out of the game in its current state. The customisation is fairly extensive and the developers have stayed loyal to the feel of mordheim, without limiting themselves to a straight adaptation of the dice rolling version. Some players might be turned off by this, but the devs have done it right and the game feels great to play. If you like the warband managment side of things, you can currently spend hours just trying out different warbands and setups.\n\nThe bad side is that playing against the AI gets really old, really quickly. In addition to the AI being really bad in its current form, the CPU warbands you fight in exibition are significatnly weaker than those made by the player. CPU warband rating is generally around 2k, while player made is ~3k. While I find little satisfaction in beating the AI in any game, such a lack is far more pronounced in this game currently.\n\nThere are alot of bugs, but this of course is to be expected and does not overly concern me. I am confident the devs will work through them in time. Most notably and obvious is the camera angles - AI and camera seem worse on proceduraly generated maps, as does people being able to attack through walls - this should really be addressed before new maps are created, there are plently of maps at the moment, and good replayability due to specific parts being generated differently each time.\n\nSomewhat worrying, is the lack of an in game bug report system. I feel like this would benefit the devs no end, and really help focus their attention on getting the game into a better state. It would also soon remove many of the minor issues which can turn players off a game forever. Chaos spawn getting stuck in a doorway two games running is irritating. I know it will be fixed, but others are not so patient. This is doubly so where people have paid for the game, it is not a beta.\n\nI am recommending this game, the hours of enjoyment I have gotton so far have been worth the money, and there is the promise of many more hours to come if the Devs continue their hard work. Note however, that online games are uncommon so you really need a buddy to play against.\n\nFinally, and if everything else I have said is ignored, I really hope the Devs will pay attention to this point. The planned future updates make no reference to an online matchmaking system. Single player in this game will simply not keep anyone interested for long. Even if you extensively overhaul the AI in advance of the single player campaign, the joy of Mordheim is, and has always been playing against other players. I envisage a perpetual campaign where players are matched against other warbands based on their warband ranking which would effectively act as an ELO. Players will also need the ability to make their own private campaigns. I want to be able to take 6 friends and sit for a weekend starting from scratch.\n\nPrivate multiplayer campaigns and an ongoing online campaign should be given priority over any single player campaign. Even in the games current state, the ability to create your own league (aka bloodbowl) with friends would dramatically increase sales. This seems comparitavely simple compared to making loads of new maps and scripting 32 single player missions for the single player campaign, which will still be dull unless you plan on DRASTICALLY overhauling the AI.\n\n\n","June 15, 2015","true","119.4"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","0"

So here is my long review and two cents, i hope you enjoy reading it\n\nTo begin with i'll mention the great -\n\nThe game is set in the warhammer universe and the atmosphere of the game perfectly captures the chaotic and ruined hellscape of the ruined city of mordheim, you play as one of four warbands in your quest to plunder the city's riches and satiate the lust of your contractor, whom you must regularly send shipments of treasure (Wyrdstone) to or you suffer severe consequences.\nThe city is tremendously pretty to adventure in, and by that i mean the maps are rather detailed and there are plenty of nods to warhammer lore.\n\nThe game is turn based with an RNG system and rather similar to xcom in that you have your little "Base" where you do all sorts of things such as customisation of your henchmen, buying equipment and so on, as well as the fact that you send your troops off to battles around the city to loot and otherwise stab the ♥♥♥♥ out of anyone that gets in your way. The game also contains permadeath, mutations, and permanent injuries too, to spice things up a bit. But they can also result in you wishing to fire a henchman as it is largely a hindrance when your tank darksoul gets his shield arm severed..\nThe battles are rather intense at times, always keeping you on your toes and rarely forgiving of mistakes, and the loot is absolutely worth it if you take those risks.\n\nThe game also contains a LOT of different weapons, each with their own benefits and drawbacks and so this allows you to tailor your warband to your tastes and play style, allowing for sneaky light armoured guys that run around shooting things from rooftops, heavily armoured guys that run around bonking things with big weapons, etc\n\nThe game has quite the "narrative" sort of system going for it as well, for example i have frequently conversed with my friends as to how their warbands are going and we will tell stories of how our henchmen only just barely made it out alive of battles with their lives intact, or how many people lost numerous limbs in one battle, or how even a single skaven went around on a luck streak beating the brains out of half an enemy warband.\nOther times we will mourn the passing of our level 10 henchmen that we literally spent over a hundred hours playing with and have uncountable stories with.\nThis is further reinforced by the fact that you may rename your characters, and even add bios to them to make them feel more lifelike (and to make you cry more when they inevitably perish due to the city of the damned).\n\nNow, positives aside... there are some things that bother me\n\nOk, so mordheim is typically described as a "hardcore" game, and while it could be said that it certainly is, the problem is that this comes from the fact that most scenarios you are put in are actually...rather unfair.\n\nNow hear me out for a second - during all battles, even on easy as far as i know, the AI always brings more units than you, and with an increase in difficulty, the more units they bring than you. To make matters worse, their stats are also ALWAYS better than you, even on easy difficulty. And to further makes things harder, on any difficulty beyond hard (which is the second easiest difficulty ironically), Chaos Daemons show up on the map and rapetrain everything in sight. It's to the point where they either destroy your entire warband, perma killing half due to the level of ♥♥♥♥ and permanently injuring the other half of your warband OR the daemon turns on the AI warband and you run around looting every orifice of the map while the AI gets butchered helplessly.\n\nIf by some strange chance you do manage to take out the daemon as it flails it's arms around the map relentlessly, you typically won't have enough leftover soldiers to actually damage the opposing warband, it took my entire warband to take out a frickin daemon just to have an entire imperial warband rock up immediately after with their pockets stuffed with half of the city's treasure and then proceed to jam their swords into my moist chaos buttocks.\n\nFurther reinforcing how i feel about the game being unfair to a certain degree, is the campaign. The campaign missions are VERY hard. Very, very, hard. Even if i outclass the opponent's warband rating by 500 points.\nSo how does that work?\n\nWell, the campaign levels are always unique to the mission and typically have lots of features you dont normally find in typical missions, such as opening doors, teleporters, weird ♥♥♥ daemon things, special abilities, even a unique character to come with you and so on. This means that campaign missions typically take 2-3 tries, at least for me.\nIn which the first try was typically scouting around the map and inevitably having that be my downfall as i am forced to cluster all my soldiers for their own safety (So that they can pile into combat if an opponent reveals themself) and then find out that is a great way to clog up the corridors and get the reverse of what i wanted (One or two guys attacking one AI which eventually chews through them and then the next two unlucky sods step up to get their genitals torn off by the AI)\n\nAnd then if you fail the mission to begin with, your henchmen are typically rather heavily wounded, possibly for several in game weeks and maybe even missing some of their wargear. This means you must wait quite some time before you're ready to take on the campaign mission again, keep in mind you're still fighting AI which outclasses you always AND in campaign missions the AI never retreats AND respawns.\n\nNow, for my final complaint about the game i will detail what actually made me stop playing the game..\nIn the late chaos campaign, i had to assault a bridge which was owned by a mutated ogre, and his chaos possessed henchmen. This mission is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and takes the "unfair" to the stratosphere.\nI will now explain why - Your warband starts off in tunnels underneath the bridge, you must take out a skaven and his rat ogre bodyguard. Ok. not too difficult.\nHowever you must then spend several turns of yours then looting the tunnels for skaven gas bombs and then "imbuing" them back at your spawn with some spoopy extra ability that lets you take out the damn ogre in the mission to begin with, so this is like 5 extra minutes of tedious movement. Ok... so not as bad as it could be.\n\nBut, once you eventually get your little pixelated dudes to the top of the bridge, you must loot some rags in the ruined houses and dip them in oil to convert them into oil bombs in order to hurt ANY of the extremely powerful henchmen of the ogre. This is done by throwing said oil bombs at the henchmen and then piling into combat with them.\n\nThe problems are as follows-\n\n1. The rags are in random locations\n2. I can almost guarantee one of the henchmen will see and pursue you\n3. The oil to dip the rags in.....is next to the ogre's lair...\n4. If you dont oil bomb the henchmen, they can reap your soldiers and won't stop until you bomb them and kill them\n\nThis gets worse because if you attack the henchmen when they're not debuffed from the oil bombs...then your attacks heal them instead.\nSo you can undo like ten minutes of fighting if you fail to realise that the oil has worn off and then you accidently heal them back to full by chopping them once.\n\nThe same problems go with the ogre too, but are magnified greatly. the only way to kill him and his 1000hp is to douse him in BOTH the skaven gas bombs mentioned earlier AND the oil bombs. Otherwise he just nukes your warband and you cant do anything.\n\nrunning out of space to rant so i gotta call it a day..haha","January 16","true","157.6"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

Also, the DLC warriors are great. They add a real dynamism to the Warband.\n\nA word of warning though. This game is very unforgiving. You will make mistakes, you will overextend at some stage, hungry for Wyrdstone, your warriors will be permanently mutilated or die. Accept that. It is what makes winning a battle so exciting and losing so upsetting.\n\nIf I could give the old me advice (250 hours ago), it would be:\n\nNever do maps where your Warband is scattered randomly - you are leaving them in the hands of the Gods\nWyrdstone is everything - try to do maps with the highest Wyrdstone rating possible, balancing difficulty.\nFill every slot - hire all the warriors you can and rotate them to gain experience. It may take a little longer but that way when one loses a leg or gets brain trauma or dies, you won't be too upset.\nBe patient - Money is hard to come by and good gear doesn't begin to appear until at least level 4. That's fine. A time will come where you have all the money you want and can really invest in skills that suit your Warband and the gear you have.\n\nLastly, thanks to the devs of this game.

I'm a fan of Space Hulk (The original board game, not the steam version, we're talking 1990's here), it was my introduction to Warhammer and Games Workshop. The version on steam comes highly recommended by me. This game is shaping up to be an evolution of that direction, and it's absolutely fabulous. Developers, keep up the good work, as my hat is off to you.\n\nLets break it down, the following scores are for video gamers, not warhammer fans. If you are a warhammer fan, your excitement and imagination will already see this game is possibly one of the most immersive and enjoyable tabletop simulators in existence, with expansions that evolve elegantly into the video game format. A bit of RPGish element, and a threat of permadeth of hard-won characters adds new layers to a style of gaming we've all come to love. And the FX and animations bring the world to life, like I've only seen in it my imagination. Great Job Rogue Factor Realize, no game exists I have ever given a 10 to... yet. That is a perfect score.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nWhile not completely triple A, it comes incredibly close. Atmosphere and character models are high resolution and the modular qualities of the world are hidden behind well crafted layers of detail. I expect this to improve, but even if they don't, they're far beyond anything a TBS or RTS has ever attempted before.\n\nSound: 7/10\nThe sound effects are admirably done. The atmospherics are up to the task of providing the player with combat awareness. I am expecting, as they progress, for more sound effects to be added, atmospherics, and other aspects along with the dynamic qualities planned. While doing the job, it doesn't make you terrified. And this is Mordheim, ask a Warhammer player, you should be terrified.\n\nLevel Design: 9/10\nOnce you're done navigating the narrow alleyways and threading your way through the rubble of a house, you'll find plenty of advantages to be had above you from sniper nests to byzantine catwalks, while below your feet lie sewers and pits with murder holes a plenty. Whether your climbing over rubble to take a shot, holding back enemy at a choke point, or slipping through ruined walls and cover to flank, the maps of Mordheim are complex, layered, balanced, and ever changing. The procedurally generated map methods they use have provided me with a puzzle at the beginning of each game as I am forced to reassess and explore. I see lots of replay value.\n\nControls: 8/10\nWhile I heard problems about using a keyboard and mouse, I found the controls to be tight and smooth. Movement is elegant, a huge step forward from X:Com and Space Hulk, giving players unprecedented options and a fluidity of play that I've never expected in a TBS. Movement is a simple WASD affair, looking is with your mouse, and all combat is done through action selection. Elegant and intuitive.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nThe game is Turn Based Strategy. Two teams called warbands, each consisting of up to ten units. Units are varied, and have classes, and these will be developed as the game goes along, allowing for many options that are not available, but should give you a wide variety of customization when it comes to your characters. Currently, warbands are pre-selected.\nBasically,  its an evolved game of X:Com PVP, two teams, go at it. Initiative is by character not side, and action points are a bit more complex. At the moment, there is enough to keep you playing, but online I have not seen many players yet. The AI is very enjoyable to fight, I have not gotten bored of it yet. It's on par with X:Com without any singleplayer, and a lot of shiny new aspects to add some fun.\n\nContent: 2/10\nA lot of content is planned, a lot simply isn't there. For you who aren't warhammer fans, you may wish to hang back until more content is coming out... however... it is worth the sale price for early access, I would easily part with the full price for this game when its finished.\n\nOptimization: 5/10\nLONG, LONG, LONG loading times. And the game tends to freeze, in combat, without any progress being possible until the game is restarted. It is early access. 3-4 minute waits are not uncommon at this point for me in my playing. Longer are rare, but have happened. Once the game has started, aside from the above bug, the game runs smoothly, quickly, and is quite enjoyable. The slowest aspect of this game in a multiplayer setting will most likely be waiting on the other human being to make up their mind.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nGet the game. If you're a video gamer and love Tactical/Strategic RTS/TBS like me? If you're a fan of tabletop games of ole, or modern video game emulations of them, or if you're a Warhammer fan. Everything in the feature list is already worked into the menus. The game looks professional, it looks promising. While Early Access is always a gamble, I already consider my 32.00 well spent. And that's what it comes down to. Is this worth the money. Will it be fun for the time you spend on it and for what you spent in cash on it? The current content is worth easily 20 dollars, 30 dollars with their most recent content update. If they keep it up, you'll be buying it on sale effectively after this point.\n\nEnjoy and see you in the streets of Mordheim.","January 9, 2015","true","19.0"," 83 of 137 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","83","137","8","7"

It's not possible to create and load saves.\n- Missions completion is very unsatisfying. The missions I've played so far have all instantly ended in victory after a morale check fail on the enemy's turn. There is no chance to prevent enemies from escaping and kill them, or to loot their goodies or to explore the map after a hidden dice roll decided the game is over. Instead, there is a message informing you that the mission is completed. Um, yay?\n- Inventory management during missions is madness. Did you pick up 3 pieces of armor earlier and now come across something else you want to pick up, like a piece of Wyrdstone? Too bad, because there's no way to drop or swap items. Unless you want to swap items while looting a chest, that's ok. Or unless you're trying to swap Wyrdstone for Wyrdstone, in which case the swapping UI will be shown, partly clickable but unusable. ARGH! Which brings me to:\n- The game has a very clunky user interface. Mordheim seems to be designed with consoles in mind; the mouse is unusable for situations it would be perfect for. Get ready to swap between actions using the Q and E buttons. Also apparently a good fit for trusty Q and E: selecting locations on a map. Why allow a left-click when you can turn selecting something into a mini-game based on random chance?\n- A heavy focus on random chance (yes, besides the UI), including to determine between hitting an opponent for full damage or missing entirely.\n\nAs well as a bunch of small bugs as well as rules you'll need to figure out by trial-and-error, all of which would be less of a problem if the game simply offered a save function.\n\nI'll continue playing for a little while longer to see if Mordheim: City of the Damned is worth it for me after getting used to these flaws, but for others who aren't already fans of the Mordheim license I recommend caution in spending the time and money required to explore this game's mysteries.

On top of that the factions you can play are pretty limited for characters that you can recruit into your warband. As well weapons and armor are VERY limited, there is only 1 of each type of weapon that comes in 1 of 3 tiers that only change the stats.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nOn top of that the graphics are sub-par, not killer bad but the game is done and still some walls just don't render all the way. It just feels like a Alpha/Beta game\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nGame feels like an Alpha/Beta game that just got a "Good Enough" stamp. I cant say it enough I truly thought this game was still in alpha or beta the last i played it it just feels unfinished.","December 13, 2015","false","10.0"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","40","61","0","2"

There are several slow deaths to a warband but most result in you not being able to make your diliveries on time.\nHowever if you do the following you may be okay. Just remember this game likes to teach you lessons the hard way, so instead of getting angry at the demise of a beloved warband leard from their death and move on.\n-THE GOLDEN RULE: Use every single day to gather wyrdstone if possible.\n- Keep reserve members and USE them. I cannot stress this enough. You will need alternates.\n- Miss as few days to gather as possible. a good roster of alternates will help this when you take a beating.\n- Keep and train an alternate leader. Your leader is often your most bad ♥♥♥, though if you want him in the front lines you will need an alternate for his eventual healing time.\n-Only do the story missions when you don't have a delivery pending.

Now there is a persistent, fleshed out campaign for all four factions currently in the game and the interface and gameplay is smoother than it has ever been. Characters level up, get new equipment and start to take on personalities for themselves (with your imagination) sort of like XCOM and it really sucks when someone you've been grooming for greatness gets taken out completely. Also, be careful, the campaign mode does have a game over/perma death feature. Unfortunately those loading screens are still absolutely horrendous... especially when some of the levels last just as long as they do. Honestly though, there has never been a better representation of the Tabletop game of Mordheim on a visual medium than this game and I only hope more factions can be added, more humour brought from the actual game itself, and more content be added into this already complete package.

The game's mechanics have certainly captured the 'feel' of playing Mordheim perfectly. (I spent many hours playing it growing up.) It is however, as has been made clear, incomplete.\n\nOnly two warbands are currently playable and only two more are confirmed. There is currently maybe 10-15 hours gameplay and that's pushing it. I'm really, really excited as to where this game could go; and I really believe it has the makings of a huge success. I say this guardedly though. They've been very tight-lipped as to exactly what features are to be expected in the future and I can't help but feel we'll be waiting an incredibly long time for a game that will really hold our attention.\n\nCurrently the only really playable feature is playing one of two warbands (Skaven or Human Mercenaries) in a pretty easy match whilst you fight against a warband with half your numbers.\nThe maps are interesting, the gameplay rewarding. But as of now - there's no reason to pick this up over say, X-Com; unless you're purely playing for the Games Workshop IP.\n\nIt's expensive for what it is, but I consider it an investment into a really solid game so far.

It is, essentially, a perfect reproduction of the tabletop game. (once all warband maintenance is in properly over the next few weeks it will literally be perfect)\n\nFor those of you who didn't play the tabletop game.\nThe detail and love that has been invested in this game should be readily apparent from the 10 minute gameplay trailer above. However its so much more than that.\nThe system is easy to learn, and yet has the kind of strategic depth that will keep Turn based Tactical players coming back for more and looking further and further into the little numbers that control the world.\n\nFlanking/Charging/Parrying/Dodging, reloading ranged weapons, jumping over gaps and off ledges. All make the genius of how they have you use your Strategy points (movement) within a series of rings marking where you will use a point up via movement. Go down some stairs and the lines readjust as you move making it always clear where and WHEN you will use one.\n\nOverwatch/Ambushes Keep moving players on their toes and make scouting important.\n\nAnd yet the game/battles/skirmishes themselves play out fast enough that no individual game will take longer than an hour and most will be over LONG before that. Especially in the early days of your Warbands when there arent maximum members.\n\nTheres a lot to love here from a gamers perspective. Turn Based Tactical games are easy to turn into "Turn Based Repeat every other battle you have ever had here" This one has enough fresh content with random maps that you can run even the 2 preset warbands in the first early access release at each other again and again and it will not play out the same way.\n\nIf the final product (due for release Q1 next year) continues in this vein and from all the information i have found i see no reason why it shouldnt. It will be 10/10 from me.\n\nFor now, 10/10 for the content provided. (its Alpha so i expected more bugs than i saw, theres literally only one that ive encountered in 7 games. and it wasnt game ending)","November 21, 2014","true","53.0"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

However those deployments are mind bogglingly terrible and generally decide the outcome of the match before the match starts. For example there are starts where 1-2 members of one warband start in the midst of the enemy warband, with the remaining members of the warband 3-5 turns away.  This is a situation you cannot recover from.  Or the start where you have small groups of 1-3 members spread around the map with the enemy team in a coherent blob, the enemy team can wipe out 1 and severely damage another group before you can support.  You cannot recover from this.\n\nThey have outright said they do not intend to fix this, they merely intend to allow you to choose which models get wiped out (at the moment it is purely random).  This is kind of iffy as hell.\n\nAdditionally, the campaign AI is terrible, they attempt to counteract this by giving the AI ridiculous stat buffs and allowing them to succeed at rolls they fail (while displaying the failed rolls in the combat log :?).  This leads to you being forced to exploit the terrible AI if you want to win, as you simply cannot win any other way.  This is not fun.  It also means if you get unlucky with your deployment, the AI will just steamroll over you without you being able to do anything.\n\nHowever, they say they will remove the AI buffs once they make competant AI which is able to move and fight properly.  It just so happens they claim this will be "near impossible" to implement, so no idea when that will be.  They refuse to fix it in either of the sensible ways (ie options or mission difficulty based stat buffs), which is odd.\n\n\nAdditionally the inter warband balance is terrible.  At the peak you have chaos, who's fighters are all stats wise amazing, and who's fighters nearly all ignore one of the two forms of defence (parrying), half of thier fighters are immune to psychological tests (a big thing) and thier caster, who is also thier leader, is the most powerful thing in the game, capable of taking 3 other models completely out of the game per turn\n\nAt the bottom you have humans, who's fighters are all subpar, who's leader is an inferior version of thier already inferior fighters, who's caster has no useful ability, a weak direct damage spell or an even weaker (ie 50 damage when melee swings for several hundred) AOE.\n\nSkaven and sisters are in between, they have good features and negative features, but they are a shadow compared to chaos.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if warbands had model counts suitable for the power of thier individual models, but they dont, everyone brings 10 (or 8 + impressive).\n\n\n\nThe game could be good if they put some effort into fixing it, but as it stands there is a huge way to go.  Here's hoping that in a few months I can give this a positive review.","October 8, 2015","false","28.5"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","30","45","0","9"

Like most games I feel this game has its strong points, oddities and areas with room for improvement.\n\nYay!\n\n- I like the graphics and the field of view when you run around the city with your warriors, at no time did I get odd camera angles or lost sight of my warrior.\n- I like the movement system and the option to retrace your steps when you realise you ran the wrong way (This ofcourse is not possible if you get ambushed/ step in a trap/ pick up loot.)\n- Once loading is finished the missions are smooth going.\n- I like the campaign system. The missions in itsself arent too varied but every battle is hugely differant anyways.\n- customization is quite nice. Some more wouldnt have hurt at all but you can give your warriors fairly uniqye appearances. I like it you can see on a model which sort of armor it wears and what weapons it holds.\n\nUndecided:\n- Some more information would be nice at times. The tutorial is quite informative but a little more explaination about how combat works would have been apprechiated.\n- Loading times. Pretty darn long. I guess this is where refills and bathroom breaks come in. Mitigated by the lack of loading once a mission starts.\n- Difficulty settings: I like it when I can decide myself at what difficulty I play. Yes, you can (ussaully) decide to stick to 'normal' missions but it'd be fun too if you once in a while were the stronger gang on paper yourself.\n- I am not in too far so maybe this still is to come but I'd be neat if there were engagements with more then 2 gangs involved. 2 weaker gangs ganging up on a stronger gang? Yes please.\n\nNay\n-Only four types of gangs! I realise the studio is small and adding new gangs costs a lot of time but I for one wouldn't mind paying if some gangs were added as dlc's. Gimme orcs! Undead! Elves! Dwarves!\n-All games being Ironman can be heart rending when you lose a valued member of your gang. Not seeing what your taking out members of other gangs results in is a bit dull. Why can't member be captured?? I'd be nice to have some sort of league idea where 64 gangs slug it in Mordheim in a Blood Bowl tournament style. Then it's fun to cripple an opposing warband.\n\nDespite some nays I still think all in all the game is quite worth the bucks you pay for it.

The devs have time and time again posted how they want the game to be HARD CORE. They have done everything they can to ensure that players who want an easier difficulty are pushed about and insulted in their community forums. They went out of their way to keep people from save-scumming their warbands. The AI isnt smarter at higher difficulties- it just gets extra HP/Damage/Stats % across the board instead. The AI warbands ratings are always based on your own warband point rating and then modified with extra points(gear/stats/weaponsetc) to make it always an uneven fight in favor of the AI. The AI doesn't have to worry about trying to collect wyrdstone to keep its warboss shipments up.. while you do. The # of enemies in a warband will always mirror the # of enemies in your warband for the AI. Basically the Devs decided that\nA) You can't really want a more casual experience for the game, you can't WANT it because they say so. Screw you if you dont like it. That is how they come across any time it comes up.\nB) The AI was never really made to do anything except charge right at you and fight to the death. Individually each AI warband member will be strong and faster and have more health than your warband members - because it always gets a % boost across the board to its stats and rating. They will also be dumb .. and just run right at you the second they see you. Even if waiting 1 round would be the difference between them hitting you 1 at a time .. or all together. No tactics. No strategy.\nC) Basically I dislike any company that goes out of its way to eliminate savescumming or the like from its single player campaign aspects. It isn't really, IMHO, their concern if someone wants to reload a game where something nasty happened to them while they were playing a computer AI. There is no one harmed by such a deed and their claim that it somehow harms the enjoyment of the game doesn't hold water.

Also, there's basically no way to keep exploring/looting once combat is initiated, unless you're willing to sacrifice valuable members of your warband as cannon fodder to allow the rest of your guys to go scavenging around for stuff. Not to mention, any stuff looted by your warband members that are downed during a battle is lost... and there's no way to keep looking around after a battle is over. Even if you are winning, these battles can just end abruptly with a rout failure, making you lose any further stuff you might have gained.\n\nAlso, I wish there was more customizability for your warband, more than one type of hero, etc, and maybe a couple more customizability options for each character type. But alas, its a great plan, and I hope it gets better... but as of now, I can't recommend it.","December 29, 2015","false","6.6"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","30","46","0","1"

All of the complaints about hit percentages are unfounded.  I belive the percent chance to hit shown does not calculate the doge or parry chance of the enemy.  Therefore for example, a 90% hit chance will hit 9 times out of 10, unless the enemy dodges or parries.  I think the balance is quite challenging.    Finally a game that does not just let the player walk thru with ease.  This challenge has kept me interested for many hours.","January 16","true","137.7"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","20","28","2","1"

Matches are hard to find, partially because there is no automatic search-function going that would find an opponent of the same strength for you, partially because one does not see if there are games to be had without staying on a screen that has that as the only function, and partially because when one creates a game one can't see if someone else makes a game you would be ready to accept.\nIf you want Multiplayer, get 1-3 friends to challenge.\n\nStory Mode is short and minimal, and compensates by being absolutely brutal. However, normal missions are the bread and butter, story missions just the cheese&ham, so it is not all that much of a con. And Story Missions are not required at all, beyond for gaining few points to make life easier (see below).\n\nThe game has the strategy common sin of being very hard for new players. However, there are mechanics in place for making starting all over easier the more one has played, and recovery within a save is quite possible. After some time, the difficulty, story missions aside, averages to medium-hard-easy: your starting troops are unreliable, in the middle the enemy may surprise you with better stuff than they began with, and at the end your experienced troops should not get easily overwhelmed. Half a con, if I may.\n\nNow for the good stuff:\nThe game is quite balanced and has immense tactical depth.\nMicromanaging is possible and as deep as one wants it to be, but not required beyond the minimum awareness.\nThe artstyle is good, while obviously not quite the same quality as AAA games. Few of us play TBS for absurdly good graphics, however, and it is beyond good enough.\nSingle Player, despite being short on story, is varied and good enough for (looks at time played), at least 450+ hours. AI is a bit dump, however.\nThis point can't pressed hard enough: Despite being a game made with a skeleton crew, the Devs are active on the forums and actually answer to constructive feedback beyond any and all call of duty. Nothing feels like having actual personal dialog with the devs, possibly multiple times a week.\nBug reports are read and acted upon. Feedback is routinely checked. We get information about what is going to happen and often why.\nWith experience to compare Mordheim with likes of Hearthstone (devs basically never engage in personal discussion, there is no evidense that bug reports are even read, and changes happen as little as possible, regardless and especially despite consumer feedback, and tend to be tactical nuclear strikes when nerfs happen (killing not only the complained stuff but everything around them)), the Devs have accumulated enough goodwill and benefit of doubt that they could eat live kitties in in-game mandatory cutscene and the net impression would still be positive for me.\n\nSo as said: 9/10, bought this and both DLC:s, bought to two friends as presents and have 2 more copies to spare.\n\nPS. Do, by the way, buy the DLC:s. Cheapish, good, not gamebreaking, and makes the very start somewhat easier.","February 18","true","678.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","11","12","5","0"

Every encounter is stacked against you, even the easiest encounters; as such you are always losing units and making an uphill battle into a late game progression you realistically can’t win.\n\nMordheim is less of a race with a reward and more of a marathon that doesn’t end. It starts fun but quickly kills that fun by playing the “I’m a hard game because I need to be” rather than “I’m a hard game because I naturally am that way due to my mechanics”.\nThe AI (which will be your primary opponent) still runs into walls and misses tactical advantages that would win them the game; however it makes up for this by having a huge overhead advantage on you from the start.\n\nThe AI is through and through dumb. It gets caught on doorframes, misses easy wins and even damages itself. In the later stages, winning is determined by exploiting the dumb AI rather than playing tatically.\n\nAlso, there is currently an issue with the "ambush" feature, which allows you to end your turn but attack any enemies that come close. However, there is a small area where you can engage the unit set to "ambush" mode. I kid you not it is about 2 pixels in extra distance. you can get extremely lucky and try to pixel hunt for this area, risking being charged and hit.\n\nBut that AI can calculate this and has no issue with charging you those 2 pixels out of your attack range, effectively making the ambush feature 100% useless unless you are in close quarters, at which point you may as well kill your own unit because the enemy AI will always have better units than you.\n\nOne hugely flawed system is the attack chance, which is calculated in a pseudorandom fashion, for those of you who may not know, pseudo random boils down to a process that may appear random but is in fact not, as such having a 95% chance to hit is what we may as well call guaranteed, however the hit rate isn’t 95% at all. It can be much lower than what is displayed on screen. The result? Missing easy hits multiple times. Lots of times.\n\nI know it's impossible to change how the game calculates the chance, but since Mordheim relies on this so heavily, there really needs to be a better system put in. It gets frustrating when the game says that you have an 87% chance to hit, but doesn't tell you of margins of errors or how it's calculating it. As such, you can miss 80%+ hits in a row, several times.\nAs a result, the percentage to hit indicator becomes useless as a way of judging chance.\n\nTo this end, the game quickly begins to seem like a grind, you are always going up a slope slowly and small setbacks have big impacts. Some people may enjoy that, but I don't like grinding in progression, I like to feel like I'm gaining headway every game I play. Not feeling like i'm making progress slowly kills interest in the game for me.\n\nThat said, I have never played a more stressful and unpleasant tactical game in my life. And I’ve played Darkest Dungeon. Not trying to make the comparison between the two, but Mordheim is unfair and hard because it constantly scales against you whereas Darkest Dungeon is hard because it's difficulty is determined by the player's greed.\nFurthermore, the way customisation and side missions have been implemented reeks of laziness. The developers couldn’t even be bothered to explain cosmetic customisation beyond “Style 1” and “Style 2”.\n\nThat said, Mordheim follows a copy and paste layout in general\nA typical Mordheim warband play through is this:\n\n1)	Randomly generated mission\n2)	Collectable request\n3)	Randomly generated mission\n4)	Randomly generated mission\n5)	Randomly generated mission\n6)	Randomly generated mission\n7)	Scripted mission\n8)	Collectable request\n9)	Randomly generated mission\n10)	Randomly generated mission\n11)	Randomly generated mission\n12)	Randomly generated mission\n13)	Randomly generated mission\n14)	Randomly generated mission\n15)	Etc.\n16)	Warband becomes so crippled you are forced to start again\n17)	Repeat at 1)\n\nIt’s impossible to explore this vast city that was made, since the AI will just charge you regardless if they are outnumbered and/or outgunned. This means you get to see tiny parts of the maps, which are very loosely randomly generated and after a while, you get to know the maps inside out because there are so few of them, as many of them have been reserved for scripted missions (which are poorly designed). The maps are also very small.\n\nIn the end, every warband you make will fail because you need to keep up to date with deliveries (which the game does a terrible job of explaining), this means you can't buy new warriors all the time and every injury sets you back by days and gradually makes you fall behind.\n\nThat said, every mission is the same tatic; group up, go in as a group and just pray for crits and getting that 2% chance you need to win. To this extent, this is the primary reason why I do not like Mordheim, in tabletop Warhammer games, there was always a diverse scenario to be played. But here it's dummed down into focusing enemy units and getting lucky from a badly coded RNG system.\n\nIf you want you can go for the side objectives, which there are three of (yes a whole three!), these side objectives are often highly optimistic, due to how the maps are asymmetrically generated, it's common for the objective to be impossible to complete because the side objective markers are too far away from your starting point. The AI will just charge you and you will have the choice:\n\na) Risk losing most of your army\nb) Do the side objective and get a tiny bit more xp at the end of the game\n\nThere were a lot of ups and downs in the development, but it ultimately ended in a game that ended up worse than it started off as 6 months ago.\n\nMordheim is dumb, shallow and a waste of money.\nIt does no justice to the current failing licence, it had potential, but I seriously doubt that the developers will make it better.\nDon’t bother.","January 17","false","97.2"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

In this "Early Access Review", I will focus on what the game currently has and not what it currently lacks.\n-The graphics are quite nice and the character models look like the tabletop figures i know and love from my Warhammer Army.\n-When you built your Warband you can choose their weapons, the abilities and uprade certain qualities like strength/intelligence/initiative etc., name them/change the name of your warband,   adjust their looks.\n-Skirmish Mode: You fight against human enemies or CPU and you are able to determine the starting conditions of the game (like: all troops in one place or spread all over the map/the winning conditions etc.), however you are not able to choose what CPU army you want to fight, so if you want to fight a specific CPU army you need to make a private lobby and click on the CPU button till you have the enemy of your choice.\nThe game is turn-based, in your turn you...:\nYou walk a certain distance\nYou can engage the enemy\nYou attack/do magic\nYou can loot enemies\nYou are able to flee\nYou can lurk for enemys to get near to your position for an auto attack\nYou can increase your fighters defencehowever there are no phases like in the Warhammer tabletop game, so you have more freedom in what to do when you wanna do it.\n-The Campaign mode is now in the game (it´s the main game focus): In this mode you built your Warband from the ground up, equip their weapons etc., then you choose one of the 2 randomly generated missions, you earn experience, you can loot dead enemies to find new weapons etc. After you finish your mission, you have to pay your soldiers and pay the treatment of their wounds. However if one of your soldiers needs treatment, you can´t use him for a period of time (4 days for example), which can really f**** up your Warband, so you need to play very carefully. Your main objective is to smuggle a certain weight of your warpstone out of Mordheim to your contractee, you earn warpstone by winning missions, but you have only some days to gather enough warpstone for the next shipment. You can go to the shop to purchase armor, weapons and potions etc. for gold. When you are done end your day by clicking on a tent, your warriors will lern skills and the treatment days for the injured will reduce by 1. Then you go on your next missions, or a story mission, that has different objectives and conditions.\n-The CPU is challening, but combat against other players is much harder.\n-The game costs plenty of money in early access and it will even become more expensive after early access. Maybe because the Warhammer license is really pricey, but however it limits the people who will buy the game strictly, because no one who doesn´t love the Warhammer universe  will buy this game. (<--At least that are the reactions, that I saw when talking and reading about the game).\n-The tutorials are only battles with text sometimes and you can´t just read the text in an extra menu (<--Might be improved in the future)\n-Only four warbands will be aviable at the release wich is my major source of criticism because in the tabletop version of mordheim you are able to choose from 15 warbands. I understand, that making new warbands is pricey and much work, but at least the Witchhunters and the Undead would be very interesting to play and add much more variety to the game.However we will get more after release, through DLCs and this is perfectly fine as long as they have a reasonable price (4-5€)\n-Although the game is still in Early Access, it seems nearly finished and progressed in the right direction.\n\n[I´m German and only made the review in english because the whole game is in english, so there is the possibility of grammatical errors in this review]","April 18, 2015","true","30.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","1"

However, the things it does badly are ruin-your-day badly things that turn me off the entire experience.\n\nThe theme, the graphics, sound, and warband levelling? Brilliant.  Takes me back to my childhood when the tabletop game was released.  It's everything I could've wanted.  Warband options and customization I hadn't expected, and the campaign mode's persistent unlock system - across all your failed games - is a really nice touch.\n\nHowever... None of that awesomeness is worth enduring:  worse-than-XCOM unfair RNG (seriously, even XCOM's non-insane difficulties have a hidden adjustment to save you from complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t failing every 90% chance you come across until you lose)\nimpenetrable/clumsy UI\nflat-out nonsensical pathing restrictions\nunintuive-at-best-nonsensical-at-worst rules restrictions ("I know you just found a valuable cluster of wyrdstone, but we can't let you drop that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ penny you found to free up some inventory room to go grab it"),\ncomplete failure to communicate critical mechanics in-game in a reliably consistent way ("I could defend on another turn... why can't I now?!")\nStraight-up, no excuses, stupid mechanics - like having to keep your warband dancing around your nearly-finished opponent in terror that you might accidentally win too quickly, leaving all the loot uncollected, and all the secondary objectives failed.  WHAT KIND OF IDIOT DESIGNER PUNISHES YOU FOR WINNING TOO QUICKLY?Even mouse-over tooltips are missing.  How hard is it to have mouse-over tooltips for stats so you actually know what that symbol means without having to go read the manual?\n\nThe game had me thinking, "That's so awesome," on a regular basis, but on the balance of it, it had me snarling, "THAT'S SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T," far more often.  And not in the fun way.\n\nWhether it's your supposedly-nimble ratmen blocked off from a critical route by an ankle-high obstacle, failing every high-percentage roll you make while the enemy doesn't seem to suffer the same problem, or a UI that makes you shift through several different menus just to equip your team with some gear, the negatives have so much of an impact that all the positives stop being enticing enough to encourage me to persevere through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe UI and its problems are probably the most unforgivable, especially when you can see how elegantly other games  can do it.  I want to fight other warbands, not fight the UI.","March 1","false","29.6"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","1"

While there are some rule/play changes I think they might actually serve to enhance the game.   Such as strategic points (how many actions a toon can do) to the negation of the W (wounds) characteristic , and instead, a pool of hit points.  Saw something about Idols,  and that did seem a little hokey.\n\nMusic and atmospheric effects are right on.  Graphics ditto.  The even have Morslieb correct.  (That green little moon).\n\nRead a comment about Ranged troops being over-powered.  In table-top, where one shot takes out a warrior, and ranged troops always in hard cover, they were just as dominant.\n\nNot enough here for yet for someone who is new to Mordheim.

So far reading about the game and playing a couple of hours of it I find this game manages to capture the spirit of the tabletop game pretty well.\n\n- The game has great visuals from the dark Chaos touched ruins of the city, to the look of units and their abilities. The visuals really put you into the world of Mordheim. More variety  of maps would be good but I am sure more will come out with release.\n\n- The frustration of your units failing time and time again to hit an opponent while the opponent wails on them! 100% Game Authenticty.\n\n- The current Warbands are pretty fun. I love we get female characters and they aren't wearing bikini chainmail. And any game that lets you play as Skaven is an automatic win. One of the biggest things I think will make or break this game is how much will available on release and how much will be DLC later. If they give us a decent selection range, more then 4 just warbands, off the bat the game could be pretty great! Hopefully within each Warband there will be some some diversity to choose from eventually, Clan Pestilens instead of Clan Eshin for Skaven for example.\n\n- I am excited they brought the customization of your Warband to this game. I can't wait to have a unique group to despair at as the die off in combat. Have battered veterans with new skills and missing limbs. Not much of this is in the game yet so I will have to hope it delivers what is promised.\n\n- Scenario games with plenty of interesting objectives similar to the original game! I haven't delved into these too much yet but I am hopeful that the game will feel less like a bunch of pointless battles with a little bit of lore behind each one.\n\nThe game is currently glitchy and a little bare bones but that is to be expected for early access. But it is still a fun game to play in its early state so I have high hopes for the game.","February 4, 2015","true","16.9"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","0"

This game is phenomenal!  I've never felt inclined to review a game until Mordheim came along, so this is a first!

It's not without its flaws, like any game these days (mainly, AI pathing bugs), but it's very easy to look past the non-game-breaking issues when what Rogue Factor has done with Mordheim obviously shows they really cared to deliver a top-notch experience, and I trust they'll work through the bugs in due time.\n\nWell worth $40.

Your dice will always fail.  Your best fighter is gonna go down HARD in some of the most gut wrenching ways.  And after you piece the broken parts of your computer together, you will realize just how much you love it!\n\nIn Mordheim there is not just you and the opponent, there is you, the opponent, and the map.  If you are not careful, the map of Mordheim will slap you around (or help) and put an end to that uber strategy you were just gonna pull off.  The need to improvise, the need to make the best of a worst situation, these elements are actually fun.\n\n"But how the hell can losing my characters in defeat be fun?!"  Glad ya asked.  See, if one of your characters goes down in a fight, they don't die, they do an injury check.  They could lose an eye, a leg, they could be rendered useless, or they may even have a "Near Death Experience" and gain extra XP!  Also, for every injury, a warrior recieves a negative rating on their overall rating meter that contributes to the strenght of your warband.  Long story short, if your rating meter is lowered on a specific warrior and that warrior does not lose a vital statistic (such as his Intelligence is harmed, meanwhile he is a Strength based warrior), the warrior just made your warband stronger.  Also, some injuries are just fun and they really add flavor and character to your mercenaries.\n\nEvery mode in the game feels incredibly distinct.  Such as, the random battles which fall underneath the catagories of "Capture the Flag, Wyrdstone Rush, and Marked for Death" are fun and exciting fast maps to play (relatively, battles can go upwards of 2 hours.)  Campaing maps are rich in story and objective and feel like a Dungeons and Dragons table top game brought to life.  On-line versus play is constantly being tweaked and perfected and strategy certainly helps.  It is VERY fast paced with options to have count down timers till the turn is ended for each player.  These times can be adjusted to fit your convenience.\n\nAnd to touch on customization, this system is incerdibly deep, from the character progression skill trees to the ability to customize each individual body part skin on nearly every warrior and give custom color sets as well.\n\nThe amount of progress this game has had since the release of Blood Bowl 2 is staggering.  There are positives, there are negatives, but ultimately, this is a title that will please big fans of Final Fantasy Tactics, X Com, Disgaea, and Total War.\n\nI feel like I only scratched the very very tip of the iceberg when talking about this game.  Again, please check out my stream for any and all questions, I love talking about Mordheim!  http://www.twitch.tv/wicket_and_cub","November 1, 2015","true","277.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

They've really brought the city of Mordheim to life and have added a great deal to it, visually and mechanically (there are various traps throughout).\n\nIt is not a direct adaption of the rules, but what they've done is actually quite excellent, with strategy and tactical action points.  This allows you to move/search/set stance (strategy points) and make attacks (tactical points).  They've added stances which are quite interesting.\n\nEach attack reveals a % chance to hit, and I do question how accurate this value actually is.  If I'm told I have an 80% chance to hit, then I expect my warriors to hit 4 out of 5 blows.  In the game, I've seen the reverse, missing 4 out of 5 blows (and I'm not at all discounting how the defense system works, because those are separate 'rolls').\n\nThe difficulty of the game is brutal.  I have to abandon my first warband because of a string of serious injuries to my leader prevented me from playing them.  Instead, I had to wait too many days and eventually I've lost out on my first shipment.\n\nThe question is, is it too difficult?  That's a tricky one.  I'll try to offer my thoughts.\n\nThe luck system feels off, as I've mentioned.  There is a massive series of random rolls 'under the hood' and you never quite feel like you're in control.  As I've mentioned, 80% chance to hit ends up feeling more like a coin flip.  As such, the game feels like you're in control of the movment of your warriors, the stances and all the non-luck based actions, but when it comes to the game rolling the dice, you have no ability to affect that.  When you see a string of misses and failed rolls, it gets frustrating.  Very frustrating.  (Suggestion: If you could spend unused actions points to boost your jumps/attacks that would at least feel like you're stacking the odds in your favor).\n\nI've seen some one-sided things that make me feel like the AI has a superior advantage.  I've seen a single AI warrior walk up and demolish one of my own, whereas I've never been able to do he same.  I seem to always require 3-4 warriors to pound away at an enemy to beat them.\n\nIn the original game, you receive money immediately after every battle.  Here you must fulfill a shipment and I find that those requirements are set a little high.  You will be struggling to collect wyrdstone to fullfill those shipments and while I get why this was done, I'm not a huge fan of it.\n\nWhere I see the problem: the auto collection of wyrdstone after a map is way too low.  The maps are generally too small to collect wyrdstone during the game.  You might have time to collect a few small pieces to bolster yourself but once the fighting starts, you need to commit all your troops to the fight.  The automatic wyrdstone collect after a fight is a paltry amount.  You can make your shipments but only if you don't receive any massive injuries that slow your progress down.  I don't find this part to be fun.\nIncidentally, I did manage to get a huge windfall in one session, simply because the enemy didn't fall it's rout check and the last enemy was wandering the map aimlessly.  This allowed my warband to wander around freely and collect a large amount of wyrdstone and that changed the dynamic of the game.  This was a random event and my other warbands are struggling badly with trying to collect enough.\n\nThe difficulty of a game like Dark Souls is very hard, but there is skill behind your victories and losses.  That's what makes the difficulty tolerable.  Thsi difficulty here feels like it's randomly generated.  You've little control over many parts of the game.\n\nOne final thing about the difficulty: So far, every fight that I can do in the campaign is listed as 'normal' or harder.  Essentially, there appears to be no fights where I can pick on a weaker warband.  Everything appears to be equal or tougher.  I think there should often/always be an option to pick on a weaker warband, if only so you can recover a bit from getting brutalized from a bad situation/poor luck.\n\nSo is it too difficult?  I would say yes, just a bit.  I'm doing very well with one of my warbands but as I've mentioned above, that was dude to the AI not routing and allowing me to clean up.  Another of my warbands needs to be disbanded because of how awful the random number generated rolled on my behalf.  Essentially, what this games needs is a come from behind mechanic.\n\nI'm enjoying this game, but find it very frustrating at points.\n\n\n","November 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","1"

The additions and expansion of the game leading up to the full release yesterday have all been on the positive side.\n\nWhat I like...\n\nTactical Combat\nFirst person POV - Valkyria Chronicles would be the closest comparision I can think of but I like this aspect even if the camera movement frustarates me\n4 throughly planned out factions that give a different feel and campaign for single-player\nRPG elements are present but do not overshadow the tactical nature of the game at least until you reach rank 6 (up to 10 possible with full release)\nAtmosphere and artwork where clearly a point of emphasis for this team\nHigh amount of customizations abilities/skins availble for each unit\nContent - Lots of it and the pacing means if you like what you see here your in for a treat because there's more of it\nChallenge - There is one which is nice\n\nAC/DC\n\nRNG - Present and accounted for\nPace - Not necessarily a drawback but early game is slow until you learn the mechanics and certain scenarios were painful to finish because of there size/hiding or hard to reach units\nMultiplayer - Slow as in even by turn-based pvp standards slow\nDifficulty - More specifically difficulty due to unfamiliar systems and half explained mechanics read up, play tutorials a few times each (thought incomplete still helpful), or learn as you go but not much gets spoon-fed\nMusic/Sound - I liked it well enough but some sound effects are off and everything gets repetitive a bit too quick\n\nWish it were better.....\nCamera - Nearly rant inducing when I first start playing but some tweaks seem to have improved it a bit\nCharacter Builds Vanilla Among Same Units - Nice to have customization options but it seems most units are pigeonholed into one or two roles though I may just need more playtime\nLoading - Loading - Loading - Loading - Loading\nWorld Interaction - My biggest complaint so I'll elaborate a bit -\n\nI think due to limitations of the Infinity Engine some tactical features that would have been great have been left out - No FLYING DEATH SMASH from the top rope for example. No Pushing/Pulling to Move Enemy Units into Danger Zones. Danger Zones (exploding barrels, launch pads, or their like) are for the most part absent. Elevation matters for ranged attacks but not melee (kinda meh on whether it should or not but worth noting). The traps are annoying and could be done better or done away to improve the experience.  Wydestone collection comes into play but feels secondary even when it should be your primary focus to advance the campaign.\n\nPersonally I am a big fan of the universe of Mordheim and I have to say I am impressed with how much fun this game has provided me already. I am well over the 30 hour mark and I have yet to complete a single campaign so the value for investment is defintely there if you enjoy the game.\n\n8/10\n\nIf they can ever optimize this game to cut down on the loading screens (tough to do but some improvment would be nice) I would say this game comes in pretty close to a 9 for me. If I am still playing this game for as long as I think I will be I may be bumpiong it up for that reason as well. Honestly, I almost hate this game for not having world interaction completed to the level I would prefer but I enjoy what's here enough without it. Guess that leaves room for improvement if they ever make a sequel.\n\n\n","November 20, 2015","true","29.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Run far away, and dont ever look back.\n\nNow if your still reading, I am assuming your not one of the aforementioned types of gamers. So lets narrow it down again. If your the type of gamer who wants fast paced action, doesnt like turn based fare, and hates RPGs or turn based strategy games, you may want to hit the road as well.\n\nNow who's left? Ah, you. Yeah the ruthless adventurers and ambitious meglomaniac tyrants of the gaming world. My kind of people.\n\nMordhiem is a turn based fantasy strategy game with heavy RPG elements. Its set in the Warhammer Fantasy setting, and takes place in a shattered city called Mordheim which was struck some time in the past by a big rock. And you control a motley warband scrambling against other likewise warbands (of which there are four types you can choose from...Mercenary Humans, Skaven (rat people, and I dont mean the band!) Sisters of Sigmar (the ugliest women I have ever seen!) and my personal favorite, the Cult of Chaos!) Who are out to get the rocks for your master, whenever he needs a fix. Wait, no.....They aren't crackheads. These are magic rocks called wyrdstones, which are not really healthy to be around, but since we have to pay the bills, we have to just shut up and deal with it.\nYou start off with an ugly leader, commanding even uglier troops. But the harsh looking characters and enviroments have a flavor that fans of warhammer (like myself) are quite fond of. The game captures the essence of the Warhammer universe perfectly. As you move through the game, you can choose to partake in either story or random battles, which will reward your freaky looking band with exp. and loot. So far, I am sure all this sounds very familiar to fans of the genre.\n\nBut its distinctively different in some great ways. For example, the realism. Your characters are in constant danger of not only perma-death, but permenant injuries. Not only do these injuries cause debuffs and penalties in combat but actually show on your character! So, lets say, you lose an eye, it shows, lose a limb, it shows. Get your face smashed to hell, yep....It shows. Now this feature is well done and, frankly, badass! No worries though, because every so many days, replacements show up of varied levels looking for work. And sometimes they even bring nice gear you can strip off them hehe! You will also later get "impressive" warriors, as they are called, which can be anything from elite warriors to daemons and spawn. And just like the injuries I mentioned earlier, wyrdstone warps some characters in positive ways as well, so when your uglier-then-my mother in law hero grows horns or some such thing, dont panic....Its all normal in Mordhiem....\n\nAlso, stores have a random and limited stock, forcing you to work with whatever you have the luck of getting in the store or from loot. Not to mention enemies can also loot you! This is actually a great feature as well. And forces you to make decisions your wouldnt normally make. One example would be putting a powerful "epic" weapon on a lower ranked character. It will make him more effective, but then you run the risk of losing it.....\n\nAnd as for loot, there is plenty to be found....Weapons....Armor...Helmets....Beer that messes you up and buffs you....( Damn the Bugmans Ale). You can detect loot within buildings and on corpses in the street and so forth with a skill called "perception" that every character has by default. Other skills also become available as you level up....From passive skills that let you ambush or charge in a wider range, to activated skills that knock your enemy around like a red headed stepkid....(No, I dont condone knocking around kids, I just wanted to use that saying cuz its catchy) And if for any reason you get lost, scan the skies while perception is activated. A blue light will show your your "camp" ( a wagon with which you can store the loot you find) while a red light shows the enemies camp (A wagon where you can jack thier stuff hehe).\n\nThere are far too many skills to go into detail with, but I have found a moment at this point for ALL of them to be useful. And some "special" skills you aquire will even let you move a hero to leader, or a henchmen to hero, boosting there stats significantly and allowing them to learn better skills!\n\nMovement is something that takes some getting used to in itself, as unlike many "grid" based games, its much more realistic. Yeah, you have a limited range for moving on your turn, but youll be climbing walls, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and occasionally, falling and busting your clumsy ♥♥♥ haha (which always gives me a laugh as the damage is usually minimal)\n\nSpeaking of damage, your going to want to build your dodge and melee resistance, as healing is very hard to come by. There are some healing draughts and poulices, and the Sisters have some healing skills (as does the globabier), but youll have to learn to minimize damage to survive. And never charge one of your guys out as a lone hero or he will get slapped stupid, unless your confident in your characters power, or your using an impressive (spawn rock hehe). Always treat every fight like life or death for your character, because it just might be. No phoenix downs HERE to save the day.\n\nThe good news....Win or lose, it will give you experiance, some loot, and stat boosts. SO if you get mauled at first, replavce any who are dead or too damaged to push on, and youll eventually start to turn the tables on them.....\n\nThere are only three complaints I have with the title, but I have high hopes after reading the developers forums that they will be adressed in the near future. And that is the lack of variety in Warbands and Characters (every warband is unique, dont get me wrong...And they all have thier own playstyle. But its not enough of a good thing, but I am positive they intend to address this). The second complaint is that the gear needs to look more varied on characters,and the final complaint is I feel the level cap is too low (because leveling your band is such a blast, its kind of depressing that max is reachable so quickly). Do these things keep the game down? No. They are really not enough to make the game a failure. And they are things that can be, and I think will, be addressed as time goes on. But its still a game worth every penny of its price as it is now. With those issues addressed, no other game would even come close. But its still become one of my favorite TBS games in years. Ive played the genre for about 20 years now, and I dont say this too often. And I have to REALLY like a game to write up a review, because, well, I am a lazy sonova.....HAHA! You know......\n\nMordhiem stays very true to its source material. Fans of the table top game, or strategy/rpg hybrid fans, will love it once they have the hang of it. This is a game that truly rewards patience. I like the DLC as well, but I have pnly tried out one of the two characters, yet now I wonder how I ever got by without him haha! (Tip,if your having trouble with the dificulty, get the globadier, as he is extremely useful)\n\nThe games not perfect, but they are not done adding to the rich game they have created. And yes, its hard at first, but if you learn to use skills, ambushes, and the terain to your advantage, you will be handing out can-o-whupass in no time.\n\nThe variety also needs work, but if this is adressed in the future, Mordhiem will go from a fantastic game to probably the best Fantasy TBS game ever made. Yes, it has that much potential!\n\nI cant recommend this game highly enough, as long as you heed what I said about patience and the learning curve, Mordhiem will keep you entertained for many, many hours!","March 11","true","256.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

The controls are easy to pick up and combat / movement both simple and advanced are fully explained in the excellent tutorials.\nHere comes the inevitable 'but'part.\n1.  Even though the game is centred around the collection of Wyrdstone there is little opportunity to hsrvest any once you make contact with the enemy.  You simply have to pile all your warriors in to prevent isolated warrkors from getting splattered.  It seems like the only time you can collect any is if you deploy near to a deposit or come across some on your way to link up with your warband.\n2. The acquisition of loot is impossible once the enemy warband routes. This means that even though you may have put OOA some enemy with really good items that you have no chance to loot them. Also, even if you win the match standing 2 meters away from the huge Wyrdstone deposit you were on your way to you get no chance to collect it and therefore do not benefit from your victory.  Maybe a victorious warband should be given 1 final turn to collect any nearby loot/wyrdstone but made to ignore and be ignored by remaining enemies.\n3.  At certain times you have no say in the deployment of your warriors and they end up at isolated spawn points.  Then on the very first turn, some enemies can sprint across half the map, home in on them, stun them with their first blow and OOA your warrior with the next 2 hits...and there's nothing you can do about it, you're just a spectator at this point. I dont mind hard games or getting a bashing if I make mistakes, in fact i relish the experience of playing my way back out of difficult situations. However, in my opinion, no game should arbitrarily place you in a position where you literally have no chance to influence (for your benefit or detriment) the outcome of that position.\n\nI realise that this game is still early access so my aim here is to inform, not to rant.\n\nIf you like turn based strategy games and / or the Warhammer Fantasy Universe then buy this game immediately because it's one of the best you will ever play.","November 19, 2015","true","171.6"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","2"

The game would reach perfection with some additions if, for example, enables you to mix creatures from all warbands and creating your own "dream team", ideal for online "high stakes" conflicts.\n\nIn the world of Mordheim traps are commonplace and you will encounter them in all your battles. The biggest trap of all is the multiplayer mode. You must have lots of guts to encounter warbands runned by human beings. People do not make stupid moves, will not leave the battle in any way and there is a great chance to know perfectly well the map of the region in which you'll play. At the same time if they happen to have much better equipment than you, your warband is going to be chopped to pieces in a jiffy!\n\nTo love passionately a video game it must offer you great excitements and Mordheim excels in that area. The "dice", i.e. the success rate of every action in the battlefield, is a fleeting "mistress" whom some times shows you her favor with a critical success and at the very next minute, turns her back on you with a critical failure, forcing you to curse gods and demons. You will feel great satisfaction watching your fighters to tremendously improve themselves by upgrading their stats while at the same time your treasury fills up with money, equipment and weapons.\n\nYou can watch my ongoing videos from the game here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAlrmwwKDyU6_2BMpz9qDBQnEQQ40iwT\n\nGiannis Moschonas\n\nEditor in www.gameworld.gr","April 26","true","36.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

Only 4 teams(which I'm sure will change), only game mode right now is skirmish which is basically a practice mode. You don't earn or get xp/money/injuries/warpstone/loot/etc. It's on the map, but after the match everything resets which makes it kind of bland and repetitive after a while(more teams released would at least offer some more play styles).  I'm also not sure how i feel about them going with hitpoints over wounds (ex my Demon has like 240hp or approx instead of 5 or 7 wounds he'd get on the table top game), the loading time on fantastic settings was pretty bad(but the graphics are good)\nThe magic system could be better. Again, since you dont gain xp, you don't see many spells\n\nThats the negative stuff.\n\nThe game has a really good Warhammer feel to it, the Dev's definately took with time it.\nTons of battlegrounds, all very interesting and fun.\nThe game play is alot of fun, but tricky until you figure out the controls.\nLots of potential and upcoming content including a campaign mode(hopefully soon)\n\nSo overall, I'd say too much $$$ for what it's offering unless your a diehard Warhammer fan.

The missions and combat are incredibly repetitive, and the RNG and AI get frustrating at times with seeming like they are TRYING to screw you over.\n\nStandard, non-story missions all have the same objective:  kill or rout the other warband.  There are optional objectives, but these are usually best ignored.  The problem is that the best strategy in every mission is to lump your people up as tight as possible and advance in a blob like toddlers playing soccer.  Sending warriors off alone or in pairs usually just ends up with them getting ganged up on by superior numbers and killed.  By keeping everyone together, especially in missions with no time limit, you can eventually come across less numerous opponents and gang up on them, killing enough to rout the band.  Also, you really should prioritize either ranged or melee combat for your warband.  Trying a balanced approach has, in my experience, been less effective than ganging up using a single strategy.  Hang back peppering approaching warriors with a warband full of bows, then pulling out melee weapons to finish off the stragglers that reach you, or give everyone a big axe, surround your target, and chop him apart.\n\nMore frustrating though are the penalties for failure.  One bad match can cripple your entire band, with the story missions being particularly punishing with a laundry list of mandatory objectives, and demanding you either complete them all or fight to the near last man.  I've played 3 of the story missions, and lost 2 of them thanks to either glitches or frustrating randomized spawning of the literally infinite reinforcements.  Using my Chaos band I fought into a Sigmarite temple to try and defile 11 different holy objects.  Once I'd killed the guards, defiled 10 of the 11, and fortified the entrances to the temple as best I could with my surviving warriors, creating cross-supporting zones of fire and ambush lanes, I sent the hero up to the belfry to get the last object, only to get ambushed on the roof by a randomly generated hero reinforcement, who charged and killed my wounded hero, generating an automatic failure condition.  Goodbye 45 minutes of work, hello injury rolls.  Another Imperial warband did not lose a single match until the story mission, then a glitch indicated I'd found 10 of the powder barrells I needed to use to blow up a location, but could only pick up 7.  I kept looping the map trying to find new barrells or respawn the old, and the infinite reinforcements wore me down until I ultimately lost, and then half my previously undefeated warband suffered permanent, debilitating injuries such as lost hands and arms.  Easier to just start over at that point, but there went all the days of progress.","January 11","false","20.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Mordheim: CotD offers the Player the possibility to explore the ruined City of Mordheim with his Warband to scavenge for wyrdstone and treasure and  of course to battle rival warbands. Mordheim offers a single player mode as well as a multiplayer mode. The game looks fantastic and can be both great fun and highly frustrating due to its Games Workshop typical randomness.  The tactical fights in Mordheim are, especially during the first half dozen or so fights, challenging, not so much because of the brilliant AI, but in Hard, Brutal or even Deadly Maps the AI Units get buffed to the point where unskilled warbands are very likely to perish.\nThe more strategic side of the game (levelling your warband and picking the right skills) is fun and rewarding, but due to the lack of a save game option your faults will be permant and that might proof to be very frustrating for players new to Mordheim.\nThe developer decided to make the game a permanent "hard-core" mode, meaning there is only autosave and closing the game during a battle (or the game crashing) will leave your warband in a devastated condition (wounded, missing equipment,probably even dead).\nSo IF you allready play the Tabletop game and like it: buy Mordheim:Cotd.\nBut as for now I wouldn´t recommend Mordheim: CotD to casual gamers because of the formentioned "Perma Hard-Core Mode", the game might proof to be to frustrating and time consuming to build up even your first warband.","October 30, 2015","false","139.9"," 35 of 61 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","35","61","5","4"

Some people who were hoping for that have been disappointed, but personally I think a direct translation would have been nearly impossible, and in the end probably less fun.  And it is fantastic fun.  Creating and customising a warband is very enjoyable, and the battles themselves are fairly short and sweet, so it's a good game to dip into for half an hour.  Each warrior will progress in both positive and negative ways as they accumulate experience and injuries, the horrors of Mordheim both hardening them and taking their toll on their minds and bodies.  That will mean that your warband will be unique in subtle ways, and you'll get to know each member.\n\nThe lore and atmosphere of Mordheim are lovingly recreated and you can tell there is a lot of love for the original here.  The cityscapes are absolutely beautiful and although scenery often gets in the way more than providing many strategic options, some maps change things up wonderfully with multi-floored indoor areas being a particular favourite of mine.\n\nThe game, they warn, is 'hardcore'.  Battles won't always be fair, and losing can have dire consequences.  For the most part this works well, though the sheer number of ways in which a character can be randomly screwed over, often permanently, sometimes makes you want to quit and start over.  Losing a limb, for example can make a character next to useless.  It would be awesome if there were some crazy ways to try and heal such wounds, say with erratic healing spells or mechanical prototypes with chances to add another level of random craziness to battles.\n\nIt was exciting to be a player of an early access game with regular updates and news, from a team who really listened to player feedback.  There's a lot more that could be added to the game, in fact it seems a waste not to develop further with such a deep and unique framework.  The product as it is is magnificent, but it is absolutely ripe for further add-on content especially additional warbands, as I think 4 is the absolute minimum they could have got away with.  It gives lots of variety as a player, and many strategic options in multiplayer, but it certainly gets repetitive seeing the same few bands of enemies in single player mode.  Perhaps an old-fashioned 'expansion pack' would be a better idea than small pieces of DLC, as lots would be willing to pay to expand the experience with any kind of new content.\n\nIn short, it's brilliant.  Maybe the best game ever made within the Warhammer universe.","May 16","true","90.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's like seeing the tabletop game come to life right before your eyes. The strategy system is rather deep as you can lay ambushes for your enemy to run into, place yourself into a dodge or parry stance giving you a slight advantage in 1 on 1 combat, or block the enemy's path with your units. Winning does feel very rewarding as your units will level up and get stronger, but losing can be just as punishing because you can lose those valuable veteran units if they die.","December 11, 2014","true","5.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

There's still some that pop up now and then, but rarely anything that will impact your gameplay in any major way, and they will presumably be worked out too.\n\nNow the two major points: RNG and difficulty.\n\nA lot of players complain about the RNG. Not because it's broken or rigged, because it's not (several have tested it and confirmed that it's working fine).\nNo, they complain because they either do not understand how RNG works (it's a "Random Number Generator", and a big clue is in the "Random" part), the gameplay mechanics or do not like it when they lose.\n\n\nFirst, for those not understanding the gameplay mechanics, here's how an attack works:\n-you attack a target, and a "Hit Roll" is made (based on your Hit chance)\n-if it's a Miss, you miss\n-if it's a Hit, your target gets a Dodge/Parry roll (if they are in Dodge/Parry stance)\n-if they pass their Dodge/Parry roll, they Dodge/Parry the attack and take no damage\n-if they fail the Dodge/Parry roll, you deal damage\n\nSimply put, you need to first Hit, and (if they are in a Dodge/Parry stance) they have to fail their Dodge/Parry roll.\nThat's where a lot of people get confused or frustrated. The hit chance displayed does not take into account Dodge or Parry, only your chance to "Hit" (or not Miss) the target. So you'll find a few individuals claiming this makes the Hit chance shown is wrong.\n\nYes, you can potentially miss 3 hits in a row when you have a 95% chance to hit. And yes that can happen in a short span of time. But over the course of 10,000 rolls, a 95% chance to hit is a 95% chance to hit. Conversely, sometimes you'll also manage to hit 3 times in a row with a 5% chance. And it's exactly the same for the AI. I can't stress this enough: the AI has no hidden advantage to it's rolls!\nStreaks will happen on all sides, both good and bad.\n\nIf you can't accept that sometimes RNJesus will screw you, then you can't stop reading. You will not enjoy this game, and I highly recommend against buying it.\n\n\nThen there's the difficulty.\nIs it a hard game? Yes. It's hard in the same sense that Mario Bros. was hard. Make too many mistakes and it's Game Over, start again.\nBut if you look at most of the negative reviews, they are form people with very little time played. Few have more than 50 hours and the majority seem to have less than 20 (even as low as 0.1).\n\nAnd there's a good reason for that: This game takes time to get into properly. It's not a "Jump in, kill some things, log off and have a biscuit" game. This game requires a certain amount of patience.\nYou'll most likely fail spectacularly with your first warband. Maybe even your second and third.\nIt really can be a punishing experience at first.\n\nBut when you start understanding the mechanics and taking some time to plan your warband and unit builds, things suddenly get a hell of a lot easier. Those mobs you needed 3 units to take out first time around, you can suddenly take on 2 at a time with only 1 unit.\nAnd the more time you spend planning and choosing your stats, skills and equipment, the better your units get.\n\nAnd then you get screwed by RNG, and your favourite unit dies. And when I say "dies", I do mean that the unit is dead and gone. No medical kits. No Revival spell. No Phoenix Downs. Your treasured Hero is lost forever.\n\nSo you buy a new one and make him even better.\n\nThat's how the game works. Your units are always replaceable, and you will replace them for better ones. Managing to get to Rank 10 without losing any units (not to mention without injuries) is supposed to be an achievement, not the standard.\n\nSo in the sense that there's always a chance you'll lose units, or even your entire warband, all while trying to make sure you can fulfill shipping demands, it is indeed a hard game.\n\nPersonally, I find it a nice change from the way more common mechanic of not actually losing anything if you fail. The Arkham series is a great example of that. Fall to your death? Nope. Automatic Bat-Grapple to a ledge. Get shot or beaten to death? Nope. You simple resurrect at the last Auto-Save. Nothing wrong with that type of mechanic, but it is not what you'll find in Mordheim.\nThere are no backsies here. Consequences are permanent.\nIt's certainly not for everyone, but I like it. Makes things more exciting when you know you can lose something.\n\n\n\nSo, the positive things about Mordheim: CotD.\n-Warband and unit customization is vast and can keep you occupied for hours and hours.\n-The 4 warbands play very differently, and themselves be played in very different ways.\n-Single-Player is large enough to keep you occupied for a long time, with both random missions and 8 Story mission per warband. There is no end to the ranomd missions, so you can keep improving your warband as long as you like.\n-Multiplayer is really fun and engaging. It offers two different versions, one with consequences (injuries, death, loot gained, etc) and one without (no loot gained and no injuries or death). In both cases the match can be heavily customized to suit your preferences.\n-4 mission difficulties (Normal, Hard, Brutal, Deadly) let's you choose what kind of risk vs reward you go for.\n-Random monsters can appear and attack both sides, but are restricted to Brutal missions above rank 5 (so if you don't want to meet them, you don't have to).\n-Singleplayer and Multiplayer are tied together, so you can rank up your warband vs the AI then go fight other players.\n-potential for expansions (maps, warbands, etc) is huge.\n\nNow for the negative parts.\n\n-Multiplayer, while great fun, is lacking. No servers means no rankings, matchmaking or anything. There's only a lobby and inviting others. It can make finding matches a tedious process.\n-AI is dumb as a brick. As soon as you learn it's behaviour, you can easily beat it.\n-Visual customization of units is a little lacking.\n-Singleplayer and Multiplayer are tied together. Yes, it's also a negative, because it limits a lot of tweaks and additions to Singleplayer because it would affect multiplayer too. A "PvE only" option where you can Save at any point (or restart macthes), or "PvP only" where you can't buff up fighting the AI, are two highly requested features.\n\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to those who enjoy strategic and tactical games where you plan ahead, and spend time with warband and unit management, as well as fighting.\nI would not recommend it to players who want quick-paced action or easy games that don't require much thought.\n\nJust be aware that things take time and will not always go your way.","December 19, 2014","true","632.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kor-angar/recommended/276810/","kor-angar","Kor Angar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kor-angar/","92 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter a very satisfying Early Acess period, Mordheim finally reached the Full Release, so it's time to update this review.\n"Mordheim:City of the Damned" is a tactical squad based game with battles set in the dark Warhammer Fantasy setting of the tabletop spinoff called Mordheim.\nThis game builds close to its tabletop foundation and focuses on delivering intense round based tactical battles between mercenary warbands in the streets of a city fallen to chaos. While for our grown casual gaming community this might seem to be plain flavor text someone would write on a box of the store shelf version, the game is not to be taken lightly as it definitely keeps its promises.\nWhile any misstep or just plain bad luck could cost you your hard earned equipment, the lives ouf your men or the whole warband the game expects you to handle critical situations like a commander would do, by sticking trough and minimizing losses instead of running away. Loading a different savegame is impossible as this principle is enforced with an automatic savegame system ala Darksouls. Still trying to dodge fate (Alt+F4 or just aborting a mission) will result in punishment for leaving behind your troops on the fields of battle. They return injured and broken, if they ever return. The immersion is further increased by permanent effects that can be aquired by your Troops at the end of battle which are an essential part of the progression system. While XP and resulting Level Ups provide skillpoints and attributes to be spent, permanent Injuries or Mutations span a wide range of effects that will sometimes change the use of a warrior or even render him useless (e.g a Blind Archer).\nThe Missions are played on very open maps that all have random factors that could change between loadouts thus giving the wide range of different city settings even more variety. Outside of missions the game provides a lobby or hideout for your warband, giving a chance to trade and manage your warband as well as play against real players.\nAs PVP goes, it is tied to PVE progression. It is possible to do matches against players as an alternative to playing against AI, but to gain any XP from this for your troops you have to play by the standard PVE rules. Without consequences are only the so called Exhibition matches that give you a chance to try stuff out, but as mentioned they give no XP.\n\nNow as someone who started playing almost a year before release my level of optimism towards this game is higher than average and it has been met with over the top amounts of dedication from the devs. I do feel bad for wording criticism but I need to be fair about the amount of masochism required to play this game ... Let me phrase it like that: I doubt you want the game to be keeping its promises.\nIn certain aspects this game is suffocated by its many design choices to value atmosphere over quality of life. It's like the polar oposite of modern AAA+ titles that deliver a fun experience without soul. Most of the things that give Mordheim it's "soul" are things that you probably will hate quite a bit.\nThe sometimes long and mortifying battles have to be played in one session, no way of saving and continuing later on even in Singleplayer make it impossible to slowly digest this game and force you to choke it down in bites of undeterminable sizes. You never know how long the next mission will take and there is no way to tell because even the easiest loadout available can become a hell of a nightmare.\nWhen already demoralized from sitting trough a loosing battle, you are forced to watch your people die until your warband drops below a certain moral value. There is no way to retreat or disengage, you are locked in a slugfest until one has lost roughly 60% of the warband, no way out.\nWhen you are on the receiving end of the beating the game can quickly reach a point of no return, after this you are condemned to patience for the game to end. The only motivation to sit trough this is that the punishments for abandoning the mission will count all your warriors as knocked out while otherwise one or two might be spared before the morale value sinks low enough.\nAfter reaching the mission recap, the real headache starts when your units roll for Injuries if wounded. The chances range from miraculous recovery to lost limbs and mental problems. While it can be fun to adapt to changes in your warband, after spending alot of time to train a mercenary loosing him to debilitating injuries that render him useless can be demoralizing. Attachment sooner or later just become frustration. This is true for any efforts you put into the game, as it is very quick to ruin them. That exactly is the real difficutly of Mordheim. It revolves more around how well you can stomach bad news, rather than how well you can solve difficult problems.\nMaybe you get the feeling the game wants to punish you for loosing games? So there is more to your assumption than you'd think. It's the warband management element. It requires you to pay your mercs after every loadout, pay for their treatments after injuries and fullfill deadlines for certain shipments of wyrdstones, magical stones you plunder while inside the missions. If you should happen to fail several missions in a row you will struggle to pay all those bills. The consequences can be dire enough to stop your campaign progress.\n\nSomething i wanted to save for last is the terribly clunky interface and HUD. I just got used to playing with an Xbox Controller while still using mouse and keyboard in the menus. The interface did get improved over time going from functional to usable. Warband management is overall impractical without clear look and feel in the menus mixing console and PC designs - failing hard at both - some buttons being unreachable with controller or alternatively being laggy with the mouse. In the missions you notice that over the shoulder perspective is not really practical for gaining insight in the possible layout of the city behind the next cover. The game substitutes this with a birds eye view map screen you can activate to get overall orientation of your units and enemies you might have spotted. Sadly there is no way to gain insight on entrances and exits of building from the map view and you must rely on backtracking while looking for an exit. Especially annoying in PVP, eiter for you with a turn timer or for the opponent without one. Talking HUD, to activate the different abilities of your units you use a circle menu that reminds me of "Baldurs Gate" or the first "Neverwinter Nights", they feel equally strange to navigate with mouse or controler.\nBut well the UI and HUD are probably not what will make or brake the game for you ... judging by the early acess period I am positive the UI will get improvements sometime soon.\n\nTo be fair, for me personally all the good and the bad (and the queen) this game does is lost to the fact that I can barely find time to play it. This game requires me to dedicate a whole afternoon to it as I find it impossible to break it down to smaller sessions. Add to this the rather slow progression and many elements that setback your progress makes it take forever to see some improvement with little room for experiments.\nStill I have alot of fun with this game and do highly recommend atleast trying it out.

I love the fact your characters can get injured and you have to manage your warband, not just throw them into repeated combat and I don't mind having rolls on my attacks, my dodges, my spells, the things that I understand mordheim and games like it are all about but in a game where having a small advantage will win you the game having character placement down to RNG is just insane. Start the game with a character a little too far away or a little too close to multiple enemies and you've immediately lost before you've even started, sure you can fight, try to group up but the point is that tiny bit of RNG completely influences the rest of the game. It feels as if any choice I make is overall irrelevent because the match started with me a player down.\n\nThe RNG on routing also drove me crazy, multiple games I have played now where when it comes down to it I was the obvious winner, but my team surrendered because a random henchman in no tactical position at all who I pretty much sacrificed to ensure me the overall victory died. I've had teams rout when they're still a player up, 3v2 with higher health and better equipment than their opposition.\n\nTheres just far too many RNG influences in the game that take the overall result away from the players control, it feels as if no matter how good or bad you play the result is mostly decided from the initial starting positions, if I get the jump on the enemy I'll win, if I don't I'll lose. That wouldn't be so bad if "getting the jump" involved pulling them into an ambush but it doesn't, it involves getting lucky enough to start in useful positions.\n\nTLDR: If you're the kind of person who doesn't get frustrated by losing a game down to a couple of bad rolls in the first few minutes of gameplay then this game is probably going to be enjoyable for you.","September 29, 2015","false","6.3"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","3"

Sometimes it takes an unnecessary amount of walking to get around a corner. I've also had henchmen get inside a building, then not be able to get back out, as there was a slight clipping issue with a piece of scenery (rubble) just inside the door.\n\n-Warbands look superficially different, but statistically behave almost identically in battle, there is very little differentiating between the different troop types and playstyles, even having a massive two handed weapon has the same effect as having a weapon in each hand.\n\n-AI tends to rout a bit too easily, meaning you dont get to loot their wagon or corpses (although I believe you will be getting access to all the remaining map loot in the full campaign).\n\n-Magic and missile weapons are a bit underwhelming, considering the extra effort to use them effectively.\n\nSome of these gripes are bugs that will (hopefully) be ironed out by release, but some are game mechanics which make the game less interesting to me.

Honestly, I think this game has huge potentials, but right now I only seem to get trashed on by every other faction. Even when I'm at an advantage of 4vs2. Example: 4 of my warband have a 77% chance to hit, ALL of them. Even with such a decent chance, they miss, EVERY, SINGLE, TIME. But then again, it's early access. I don't use the hit chances as a reason to write the negatives, especially since I know this game will be great when it'll release.

Four different warbands square off against one another in a ruined city, competing for control of the city and the resources it contains.  It is difficult, unforgiving, and I love every second of it.\n\nOne of the things that stands out most to me is the way the gameplay functions.  When a unit takes their turn, instead of relying on any sort of grid, they are free to move around in a third person free roaming mode, limited to their movement range.  This gives the game a very open and exploratory feel, and really feels like a skirmish instead of a board game with pretty graphics.\n\nEach army is unique and favors different playstyles.  They have their own unique skills, equipment, stat limitations, and unit types.  This provides a huge range of options with which to customize your playstyle.  On that subject you'd better get good at the playstyle as well, because the game will punish you if you don't.\n\nOne of the core principles of this game is that choices matter.  If one of your units falls in battle, they may suffer injuries that will affect their stats, lose equipment, or even die and have to be replaced.  If you do well, they will be rewarded with experience points that level their stats, provide skill points, and increase their health.\n\nThe game is still in early access and as such there are a few things to beware of.  Graphical bugs still exist, the balance might feel a little tough one way or another, and sometimes minor glitches may cause attacks to not work quite right, but these issues very few and far between, and the developers release frequent updates to address the issues and add new features.\n\nAll said and done I would highly recommend this game.  The great support from the development team, the wonderful art style and game features, and the originality in the maps and warbands combines to make a very memorable and enjoyable experience.","November 13, 2015","true","84.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

After more than ten hours of play I still can't decide if I really like it or not. Party management is a lot of fun and quite compelling, but the actual combat in missions (which is what's going to take up most of your time) is kind of boring. Especially in the early game combat is just a slugfest to see how the RNG likes more, once you start getting skills and spells it changes a little, but it essentially still boils down to a melee slugfest 99% of the time. The races don't feel distinct enough, they have a short list of 6 unique skills (3 active, 3 passive), their own spell list (none of which will make you go WOW LOOK AT THAT MAGIC!), and skaven and sisters have a few unique weapons. Other than that though all races share basically everything, I think the devs missed a huge opportunity by deciding that every race should have a warband of exactly the same size, which is one of the biggest deviations from the tabletop game. Only having four races too gets boring to play against.\n\nSo I think in the end I don't know if I can reccomend this unless you're a big fan of the old tabletop game and are willing to give up some concessions to have a video game that's fairly similar to it. Someone looking for a deep tactical game would probably be better served looking elsewhere at something like Valkyria chronicles as the RNG is the sole determinant in combat and it can be INCREDIBLY swingy.  The party management is great, and if you're super into that kind of thing you might like this game, but it does feel very, very grindy at times.","February 29","false","22.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

On the other hand, if you actually use them and they are put out of combat (happens pretty often by the way, even if you're experienced a bad RNG for a match can still ruin your day.)  then they could get brain damage, lose a limb, an eye, get a permanent wound, or even straight up die, which really breaks my heart when I spent so much time making them into a real character and then firing them because they got hit so hard they don't even remember where they are in the next battle.\n\nSo, if you like emotional heartbreak and aren't afraid to use a little imagination, definitely a game for you.\n\nWhile the RNG can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times, its usually fairly balanced and you'll get an extremely good game for each extremely bad one.  The game plays A LOT like XCOM, just in a very different setting.  To make things even more fun, it plays like XCOM does on ironman mode, with autosaves aplenty and no save scumming (or at least minimal) so what you do actually means something.\n\nSo, if you like XCOM, and want a challenge, go for it.\n\nBut maybe you really hate the fact that there's no progression in XCOM, that every game means you lose all your previous progress, well well well,  Mordheim's got you covered.  They put in a "Veteran System", which basically means the more you play, the better each new warband you make gets, crazy stuff right?\n\nSo if you like progression throughout an entire game and also through each one of the warbands you create. you know what to do.\n\nYou like choices?  Well, there's a few.  Sure, four warbands may not be a ton of choices, but like the rest of the choices in game, they actually matter.  Each different warband actually has an entirely different storyline, that's baller!  I mean, that makes the game like, 4 times more replayable, at least!  Not to mention each warband looks and plays distinctly differently.  You may play your sisters of sigmar like tanks, and your skaven like rogues, or you could do it the other way around, I don't judge.\n\nSo if you like choices, yup, this game is the way to go.\n\nMaybe you hate difficult games, well then this is tough for me to recommend, but I'll do it anyway!  In fact, you should recommend it too!  Grab a friend, name a warband "The Salvation Army" and feed your friends to your heart's content!  Easy mode has never been so, well, easy!\n\nWant something easy? Yeah, mordheim even has that.\n\nOr maybe you wanna show off the greatest warband that has ever existed.  Can't get enough of rubbing it in your friends faces that you wreck everything, but don't want all your grade A units to come back from a battle beaten and bruised? Oh man, guess what?  Yeah, morheim's got you.  In exhibition mode you can crush your friends warband without actually destroying it for real, proving you're the king of the city of the damned (for whatever that title is worth.)\n\nLike to brag?  Do it.\n\nI guess it wouldn't be a review without a bad section though, I'd like to see coop 2v2 warband matches, I think that'd be cool.  Then you could mix up your strategies and build warbands around support, I'd love to see some straight healers supporting another warband, it would bring a whole new perspective to the game.  The item interface is mildly annoying, the fact that you can't drop items and cant get rid of anything unless you put it in a chest is really inconvenient, especially on missions where you have to pick up certain items, but I suppose you could always just consider it another resource management tactical choice "should I pick up this nice item? or use this character to go get the quest items?" Finally, impressive units are insane, I have to push my whole team on one to even attempt to fight it, and if its friends are nearby they wreck me.  It's not even about luck at that point, they are just entirely too good at both offense and defence.  My whole team can barely take one out (relatively early game) and then they get to have 3 swings on my characters?  It's like the game is trying to wound my warband.\n\nSo, get this game, and also, if you don't have friends, just add me, I'm game to feed you whenever.","December 11, 2015","true","40.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I've never actually given a game a negative review. But I guess that changes here.\n\nTo say this game is brutal would be an understatement. This game loves to poke you in the eye and then keep pushing with its finger. Now, I don't mind a challenge. In fact I usually relish it. But this game takes it to a new level of frustration to the point where any semblance of fun goes out the window.\n\nAfter about a dozen battles, I've lost three warband captains. Sure, I can hire new ones no problems, but the enemies I face only get progressively more difficult, meaning the guy who's supposed to be the anchor to my party has to hide in the back and avoid even thinking about direct combat, because if these later enemies even sneeze on him, he'll explode. And captains are mandatory to actually fight.\n\nI could forgive the game's lack of polish, the mediocre graphics, the absurdly long load times (upwards of 2-3 minutes to load a skirmish with an i7 and SSD!), the little bugs, the glitchy interface, even the random crashes and framerate drops I keep experiencing. At it's core it's still a fairly fun system.\n\nBut just when things actually seem to be looking up and I win a few matches, I find it's just a lull of false security. I go to look at the day's available missions. Both are labeled Hard or Deadly in difficulty, and with non-optimal deployment setups (I've found that if you don't start with your warband tightly placed, you WILL get slaughtered). I use some of the few gold I have left to send out scouts and find another mission. Nope, still Brutal difficulty with sub-optimal deployments. Well, maybe I can skip the day and refresh it. But wait, I have a wyrdstone shipment to complete, and if I don't get it sent out the game is gonna shove its finger in my eye again.\n\nSo I grit my teeth and go to the lowest difficulty mission available. Of course my warband has to be scattered across the map. Of course the computer player actually knows where your guys are, even if you're not in LoS. Of course the weakest of my three teams is almost immediately ambushed before I can group up properly. Of course they're scoring critical hits left and right and of course my guys are largely missing, even with 80% or greater chances of hitting.\n\nWhich brings me to perhaps my main complaint. This game straight-up cheats. There is NO WAY a properly programmed random number system should JUST HAPPEN to wind up with the overwhelming majority of my attacks and dodges, when my displayed chance of success is 80% or higher, being failed rolls. Sure, even with a 95% chance some attacks are going to miss. But I shouldn't be whiffing six or seven times in a row with those odds.\n\nAnyway, I think the breaking point for me was the last fight I was talking about above. I'm getting slaughtered, but grouping up and actually starting to turn it around. Strange how the enemy troops ALWAYS have "room" to disengage and flee, but I'm always blocked in. I'm trying to run down one of these guys, I just need to hit him one more time and he should be out. My guy traps him in a room and attacks. 84% chance to hit. It shouldn't be any surprise at this point what the result was. Then the AI guy makes a counter-attack, scores a critical hit of course, which stuns my guy, and next turn he gets two full attacks to kill my guy.\n\nIn frustration I slam my fist on my desk. My Black Mesa coffee mug, which I've had for over four years, bounces off and shatters on the floor.\n\nThis game all but literally destroyed my favorite piece of diningware. 0/10\n\n(And yes, of course several of my highest-ranked warband members were permanently maimed after the fight)","January 31","false","25.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","11","17","5","0"

I am excited about playing this game as of Sept. 27 2015. It has a very good feel to it. Like playing one of the Games Workshop minature tabletop games. You can change a ton of bits on each model and paint it several different colors and schemes. The game is almost like the table top game as well with the item selections, the spells, skills, attributes, and perks all adjustable and customizeable.\n\nThere is now progression and consequences, in my first battle my hero was surrounded and defeated, in the after action report it was revealed that the hero had been mortally wounded and lost an arm. The model was forever afterwards missing a limb and could not hold a shield anymore. There are objectives during combat and the AI isn't terrible at ganging up on you and isolating single units. (not certain at this time if the AI will complete objectives of it's own or if it has them) but the game has a sense of RPG to it now.\n\nMoney well spent as the developer keeps pushing out new content and seems to be working on something that could be unique in the Games Workshop videogames; a digital version of the table top game. 4 races at this time and hoping to see undead, orks, and elves, but a very solid game at this point with most bugs stompped out regularly as they creep up. I would recommend this game to any GW fans of the old mordheim and inquisitor games.\n\n\nP.S. I would love to see skins and maps for Inquisitor/Necromunda using this engine, all the mechanics are similar enough to make it a fantastic 40k experience.","April 17, 2015","true","15.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

My PC is not exactly what you'd call slow, but it takes phenomenal amounts of time to get past the game's loading screens. Considering that you need to go through that ordeal every time you want to fight a battle, and that battles are practically the sole focus of the game, this detracts massively from the overall experience. And while I call the game "Tactical," this only really holds true playing against other human beings. The AI in this game is competent - clever, even - but nine games out of ten are almost guaranteed to have some kind of bug, whether that be running against a wall and never getting anywhere, not reliably counting as engaged in combat when fighting on or around stairs, or trying to get somewhere they simply will not fit.\n\nDespite this, however, the management and progression systems are well polished, the skill and equipment mechanics deep and interesting enough that you can spend hours customising your fighters to fit the roles you want, the injuries show up in all their gory detail on the character models, and the array of mutations available to Chaos warbands is a thing of absolute twisted beauty. I feel entirely satisfied by the breadth of customisation available in this game, and overall it does a superlative job of capturing the essence and character of the Warhammer universe.\n\nBut when considering this game always bear in mind that I wrote this while waiting for a scenario to load.\n\nEdit 09/02/16: It bears mentioning that loading times have now been much improved. I would say that it's even quite quick, now, often finishing before the excellent loading screen voiceovers finish doing their thing.","January 11","true","132.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Or keep looking if your not into  rogue like games with permadeath and things where you have to restart numerous times to end up at the same conclusions based heavily on luck.\n\nHaving said that, this isn't a terrible game. Its in fact very impressive as far as its system implementation and battle system. If you enjoy multiplayer you will like this game. But that is where this game would shine and ONLY would shine is in multiplayer. Me personally I'm not big on multiplayer. I'm giving it a negative as a single player perspective.\n\nWith all Games Workshop games, in my opinion is based (around 60%) on luck. Other being strategic planning. This game is no different and it doesn't give you a whole lot of options as to how to strategise battles when the enemy AI just seems to bum rush you everytime and then it just becomes a dice rolling game. Some battles won, some battles lost but overall a pretty meh feeling after 10+ of these battles.\n\nComing from someone who dislikes multiplayer in every sense of the word, I have to admit that this should be a multiplayer only game as the enemy AI is just too dumb to do anything but a dice rolling and stat comparing game (which they always have more then you, to make up for its lack of intelligence)\n\nI know people enjoy this game and I totally respect that, because in fact it IS very well put together and for a small group of devs its promising. I just can't personally recommend a friend paying for it knowing these faults. I would recommend it to someone into multiplayer games.","October 6, 2015","false","42.4"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","6"

In this regard it keeps itself a bit more roguelike that you progress in a veteran System to permanently unlock feats for existing and future Warbands.\n\n---Fun---\nA big part of the Fun to me comes to me from the difficulty and so does the rage I feel in some moments, but let me tell you it is glorious to do. The Atmosphere is certainly there being in the dark grey alley's of Mordheim and to see the destroyed buildings and Chaos influenced area's all around.\n\nTo build up your own Warband from Scratch, seeing them rank up and life or die to tell their own stories really makes this game to me. I have a little Skaven (Verminkin) named Nirk that lost his arm in the first Mission I set him into. But this little Henchman survived up to the point of writing this review and pulled himself through despite so many times where I thought him lost. He won a special place in my heart and I will cry the day he won't make it home.\n\nYou will get easily attached to your Warband and mourn the loss of your favorite Units, as you customized them with 4 color and 2 skin variations on each body part, as well the several skin tones to choose from.\n\nThe Campaign Missions are brutaly hard and very fun to play in my opinion, something anyone who enjoys a challenge will love.\n\nThe Development team is small and for their size of 20 dev's what they created here is truly astonishing and you can tell by my review that I'm simply in love with the game and wish them only the best for its future lifespan!\n\n---Recommendation---\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves a challenge like in the old X-COM games and loves the rage enducing nature that RNG can have with your plans. The fact that the tide of battle can shift in one moment to the next will keep you on your toes throughout the battle, while you scavange for loot and wyrdstones to keep your Boss satisfied and rank up not only your warband but also in the Veteran System and Factions to unlock Units and other Bonus.\n\nThe games difficulty is certainly not for everyone, but if you love a challenge and don't mind the game being Early Access, in the current state it is one of the best I played in the last year.\n\nIt easily happens that you find yourself at 3 am wondering what happened to your time, as the "one more round!" is very present in this.\n\n- Old Review from September 7th 2014 -\n\nWith Mordheim I had more fun than many AAA games I played during the Years.\n\nThe Dev's are very active on the Forums and I love their responsiveness to the matter.\n\nMany changes have already been made in way of balance or gameplay,\nregarding to player feedback and THIS is the reason why they have my support.\n\nThe game is already good and fun to play despite it's buggy state\nas well the gameplay looking already quite smooth.\n\nThe Kind of open development they offer with the Roadmap on their front Page,\ngives everyone insight on what is inside and what is to come.\n\nThe obvious bugs and frustrations that an Early Access can bring,\nyour getting the full game at a discount and able to help and bugfix a great game to be!\n\nAll I can say is that I'm in love with the game and I gladly recommend it.\n\nThough if you prefer a finished game I would recommend to wait,\nas it's unfinished in it's current state.","February 7, 2015","true","74.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

This game feels very atmospheric and true to the franchise, the art direction is suitably gritty yet gorgeous. That being said, the game does need some refinement - but thats what Alphas are for right?\n\nThe general flow of the battle can feel clunky at times, due to some small issues with pathing and combat initiation. Some turns feel a little awkward and slow as you control units with WASD and not with the mouse. Combat animations look good but lack variety. Spellcasters add an extra layer of strategy to your turns but lack battle presence and majesty. Granted i am not so familiar with the spellcasters of Mordeheim but i am very familiar with Warhammer Fantasy and the likes of the Bright Wizard.\n\nMulti Player is where its at - if you can get a game going. Being Alpha, there are currently issues with connectivity, load times and the odd desync. I have played a few games and they were pretty awesome. The battles can take a while to get going as both sides map out their strategies and asess their opponents but once your Warbands collide the action picks up.\n\nAfter some refinement, general optimization and tweaks to the flow and meta of Mordeheim i can see this becoming a *great* game. We have still yet to see the best parts too - looting, warband customisation, match making and unit progression. And im hoping the game files are moddable as this game will go down well within the modding community and Warhammer fans alike.\n\n8/10.","November 21, 2014","true","23.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you hate difficulty, go play dark souls. Its easier.\n\nThats the short version, if that turned you off, stick around there may be a bright side to it.\n\nFirst of all, if you like tactics games, you will like this game. Valkyria chronicles, War of the lions, Fire emblem, XCOM, if you have favorable memories of any of those games then you will know the drill here and have a good time.\n\nThe game wont be easy, You will be punished for your mistakes, but ristaking leads to the best rewards.\n\nThe basic concept for most matches boils down to that. Many people will complain that deployments can decide a mission before the game starts, but those same out of position characters are usually the ones who gather your resources. And honestly, if your deployment makes you lose the game your doing it wrong, since you can always turn on the option to personally deploy your forces. And at that point you can either do hammer and anvil scenarios (which will always favor you) or retreat and gather scenarios (where you pull back to a defensible location first before moving back out to collect resources)\n\nAlso, there is a large degree of verticality to this game that doesnt really have an equilvalent in those other games i mentioned. Mobile factions (or factions that make themselves pseudo mobile) tend to do well simply because they have an easier time navigating the world. Ranged weapons are critical in many of these vertical locations as they allow you to get in damage when your opponent cant.\n\nThat being said there IS a faction for which only the bravest and manliest among you will play. The sisters of sigmar. My faction of course :p\n\nThey are the least mobile faction with the worst ability to climb, leap, or generally cover ground.They are the only faction that is completely incapable of using ranged weapons. Sound awesome? Thats because they are also the best faction in straight fights. 1 on 1 they will beat their equivalent in other factions....but if your opponent lets you be 1 on 1, they are doing something wrong :p\n\nHope this helps, cheers!\n","October 31, 2015","true","57.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

How does it fare up?\n\nOverall pretty well.\n\nTo make this short, sweet, and lazy: if you fall into any of these catagories, you'll probably find this game worth the price:\n\n-fan of the original mordheim tabletop game\n-fan of warhammer\n-constant progression marred by varying degrees of crippling injuries suffered in battle\n-don't mind a bit of RNG goodness\n-like the idea of being able to customize a warband and watch as they grind themselves into the ground hunting for precious green rocks admist the horrors of a dangerous trap filled battlefield.\n\nDid those interest you? if so, you might enjoy this game.\n\nhowever, there are some things to keep in mind:\n\n-graphic/animation quality is quite low for a title priced as such, especially when compared to the incredible graphics of also recently released vermintide.\n-1v1 matches only. No options (balanced or not) for multi-player. Considering how long each match takes, this might be for the best, but still something to mention that the option isn't present whatsoever.\n-rng injuries/battle system is fun for some, but not fun for others.\n-not enough customization options to make the warriors truly feel like "your own". Presets can be quite annoying to work with.\n-LOOONGG loading times. even on SSD and cranked up computer.\n-Occasional multiplayer D-syncs which makes playing contest matches a bit risky.\n\nkeep in mind, at this point, for those more focused on the narrative, there is a "contest" mode which allows injuries and such to take place in multiplayer, but no way to set up leagues, multi-player matches, or other features one might expect when trying to do those old-classic crazy matches like you can when huddled around a mordheim tabletop.\n\nfor 40 bucks, the quality of the game is a bit low. I recommend it if those bullet points interested you. If they didn't, then perhaps look into vermintide for a AAA production game at a 30 dollar price tag set in the warhammer universe.","November 19, 2015","true","65.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

(Items, Progression, Wounds,etc.)\n\n- Complex but easy to learn. Chapeu to the developers to invent a game like this.

In Mordheim you can move free in 3rd Person but it´s roundbased!\n\n- Best tactical game i´ve ever played. If you like XCOM or any CQC based games on squadsize, you have to get it, even if the medieval warhammer fantasy setting isn´t yours.\n\n- I had bought it on march this year but started to play around one month ago.

I am not the most veteran PC gamer, in fact you might say I am pretty casual so my references are limited. This game is not without flaws, but the company creating the game has been very good at addressing the community's issues. There is so much more to say about this game, like that this game feels like Final Fantasy tactics all grown up, or that it is without a doubt the best Games Workshop video game to date. Anyway, as a novice commenter I hope this helps. If you like turn based strategy rpgs and dark fantasy, I cannot recommend this game enough.

I primarily did this because the load times are absurd (SSD has no real impact). The game itself has some flaws with usability. Based on my short time playing, I'm under the impression that dodge/parry is not factored into the displayed hit-chance (again, I could be wrong).\n\nBecause the AI is poor (and it's not easy to make a good AI for this sort of game), the developers instead give the opponent an advantage. Sadly, it's a straight up advantage rather than an attempt to make things interesting (special perks and such). It's easy to feel that the game is unfair to the user.\n\nThe AI opponents also take full turns, with their units moving out of site (rather than teleporting when viable). This means you spend a lot of time waiting for the enemy to move. Combine that with the load times and you've got a whole lot of waiting.\n\nHonestly, if the devs improve on some of the issues, then I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others.

This game is insanely difficult, and if you're a working adult like me and your hardcore gaming days are gone, then you don't have the time it takes to slog through this. More importantly, the level of difficulty makes it un-fun for me. But If you're a huge fan of the Warhammer universe like I am and you just need to get this, get it when it's deeply discounted.\n\nThis game follows recent trends towards making incredibly difficult games where one setback can actually derail the entire campaign. Lots of people seem to like that level of difficulty, and so what I see as negatives, fans of this style of game will see only positives.\n\nThere are two aspects to the game: squad-based tactical combat and a long-term metagame. First, the combat. Yes this game looks great, the environments are all impressively detailed and the cramped urban environments make levels with a wide-range of tactical choices. But your squaddies miss too often, even when they have 80%+ to hit. The enemies never seem to have problems hitting, however, and you can check the community page threads for people having similar complaints with the RNG. I don't enjoy games where RNG can f*** everything up if you've taken steps to get in a good tactical position. Why/how do 4 attacks miss on a skaven which is surrounded? Combat is brutal and troops which get KOd require expensive treatments and healing time before they can return (or they can just permadie). It's so easy for your troops to get KO'd that you'll spend a lot of your gold getting them treatment, which means you won't have gold for other stuff.\n\nAnd on that point, the long-term meta-game is also too hard. You'll have money problems like I said when you have to provide treatment for troops who get KO'd because they missed all their 80% to-hit attacks so they can get critted to death in return. The main objective of the meta-game is to collect wyrdstone (during the combat levels)  to deliver to your faction. It starts out OK, 75 for the first shipment, 120-something for the second. But then it quickly ramps up to unattainable amounts--I say unattainable because selling surplus wyrdstone is how you make gold to pay for treating injuries or training skills or spells. So on the 3rd+ wyrdstone shipment, you have to decide between making the money you need to keep your warband running, or saving up for the faction delivery. Because it's so easy for your troops to get hurt, it's also easy to fall hopelessly behind in the meta-game of wyrdstone deliveries, which dooms your warband to failure, because missing one delivery adds a fee to the next one.\n\nOne mission that goes bad can screw your entire game, because having troops in recovery means you go on less missions, which means you're getting less wyrdstone, and you have no hope of making the deadline.\n\nSome people like the type of game where one setback can send you all the way back to the start. That's fine, but many of us don't enjoy that and I feel like that was properly advertised. Luckily for me I grabbed this when it was early-access *and* on sale at the same time.\n\nI know that I won't finish this game, because I don't have the time necessary to slog through it. Which is a shame, because the world of Mordheim that these guys built really comes to life (ironically enough) and the graphics look awesome, and the maps are great.\n\nI hope (and I know this probably won't happen) that they make a 'normal' mode which is less painful for non-hardcore gamers.  Any of these ideas for a 'normal' mode would be welcomed by many players, I'm sure:\n\n-Lower the current increases in required wyrdstone for each shipment after the first. Example: Ship2=~120; Ship3=~220, about 100 more wyrdstone required within the same time-limit (!)\n\n-Make Wyrdstone more valuable on the market, and/or reduce the cost of training skills/spells.\n\n-Reduce the cost of treatments! OK, maybe that wouldn't mesh well with the setting of Mordheim in the Warhammer IP. How about increasing the value of wyrdstone instead?\n\n-Nerf the enemies stats and/or RNG (only when playing the game in 'normal' mode)\n\n-Make it so that you can recover from a major setback. This is the one thing that absolutely needs to change. Make wyrdstone more valuable to allow a player to have the resources he needs to be able to survive and recover from a major setback.","December 20, 2015","false","55.9"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005768777/recommended/276810/","76561198005768777","LogicBomb47","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005768777/","118 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATED REVIEW:\n\nIn spite of my initial review of the game being rather negative, especially with regard to the random number generator and other random aspects of the game, I have to say that the game kept me playing.  I've been playing the last couple of days, steadily working through a new campaign, and I am absolutely loving the game now.\n\nOne thing that isn't very apparent when you start out is the fact that, in the early stages of the campaign, the game is brutal.  This is largely because your warriors don't have any skills, gear, or money to acquire new gear.  Similar to other campaign-oriented tactical games, like Darkest Dungeon, X-Com, Blood Bowl, etc., if you persevere with the "darwinian" nature of the early game--and simply understand that warriors will die--the game eventually 'opens up' as the warriors that do survive slowly acquire the skills and gear necessary to become even better.  As additional hero/warrior slots and types unlock, and the money starts flowing, things get better and better.\n\nThe RNG can still be frustrating at times (most tactics games are like this), but as your warriors become more skilled and powerful, the chances for really bad streaks of 'bad luck' tend to be mitigated somewhat.  More than anything, with the right gear and/or stat increases, your warriors don't seem quite as fragile.\n\nAt this point, if I could change anything about the game, I'd perhaps add a little more information to the in-game tutorial.  While it goes through the motions of showing you a handful of common things you can do, it doesn't really expalin why you would want to do said things.  For example, learning how to disengage from battles and drawing the enemy into ambushes is extremely important, especially in the early part of the campaign, when your warriors are weak and can't trade blows for very long without being knocked out of combat.  Keeping your warriors 'alive' is also vitally important, as rout tests are based on the morale/number of warriors you have on the field of battle.  Therefore, if you have a deeply wounded warrior, sometimes its best to run him back to your cart (or some other safe area), and just let him sit out the remainder of the battle (instead of being knocked out).\n\nThe other thing that the tutorial doesn't really explain very well is the smuggler's den.  This part of the campaign game is extremely important, as it funds pretty much everything you do wtih your warband.  Without a fundamental understanding of how the smuggler's den works, you simply won't have the gold necessary to buy additional heroes/warriors, or pay for training, treatment, wages/pay, scouts, etc.\n\nAll in all, I'm having  a lot of fun with the game now.  The initial hurdle of getting through the first few battles, and coming to grips with how each of the game's campaign systems work may have taken more than a few hours, but I have to say now that the game is really fun.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, and I like a lot of what I am seeing--however, that said, I can't find myself recommending this game (yet) for one simple reason:  The hideously random nature of the game is just too ridiculous.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm not just saying this in a "kneejerk" kind of way.  I understand perception bias (that sense that you're ALWAYS getting bad dice/percentage rolls, when you really aren't), and I can appreciate the fact that the game is difficult (sometimes brutally so).  Having played many games in which the RNG is a major factor to your success, I am well aware that streaks of good and/or bad luck happen.   But the RNG is just the tip of the iceberg, and when combined with all of the other randam "elements" of the game, it just makes for an extremely frustrating experience.\n\nWhen you're not getting a string of bad rolls (say, five or six 75%-83% success failures in a row ... while the enemy team seems to never miss), you have to deal with unlucky positioning and/or creature spawns as you move your team around the map.  Because all movement is turn-oriented, and based on an initiative order, you're commited to your movements when you have no idea what's around the next corner.  In a general sense, this is fine, as it's all part of city-fighting.  But frustration sets in quickly when nearly every other mission spawns neutral creatures (like horrors, daemonettes, etc.) that utterly rip your team apart.  You make one unlucky move, and *bam* two of your warriors are dead.  You can't disengage.  You can't flee.  You're just dead.  And these aren't even "Hard" or "Brutal" missions--this is on "Normal".\n\nI played one mission where a daemonette murdered nearly the whole enemy team (they had two members left) as I strategically outlanked both the enemy team and the daemonette, while I raided their wagon.  Pretty cool.  But even with only two members left, the enemy team would not route.  And then the daemonette, apparently wanting to "share the wealth", ran all the way across the map to where the rest of my team was, and proceeded to murder one of my warriors.  After which, my team suddenly routed, even though I still had my leader and one more member than the enemy.  I instantly lost the mission.  While it was kind of 'interesting' and cool that I could "play" the daemonette to kill the enemy team, in the end, the totally "artificial" way in which the daemonette just ran across the map to murder my team and randomly cause a route was highly annoying.  Which leads me to my next issue:  routing.\n\nRouting seems completely random.  I can kill the enemy leader and half their team, and nothing happens.  But if my leader gats taken out, it's almost a certainty that my team will be instantly routed.  Route tests seem to happen without any kind of discernible indicator, too, besides some text.  One turn, everything is fine-and the next you simply lose.  LoL.  The concept behind being defeated by route testing is fine, but the implementation is poor and rather unsatisfying from a gaming perpective.  Which just about sums up the entire experience of this game.\n\nOn its own, the RNG is fine.  In other games, like Blood Bowl, or Talisman, it's an integrated part of the gameplay--because you can either strategize around the randomness, or the game is simply driven by the randomness and centered more on making choices.  Mordheim is neither:  you can't strategize many outcomes because positioning, encountering and randomly spawed creatures of ridiculous strength ruin any "game plan" you might have; and at many times the combat does seem very driven by the randomness while not providing anything even resembling an interesting choice to make.  More often than not, you have to just sit there, selecting the same thing you've selected for the last three rounds, while you slowly watch your team get ripped apart by unlucky circumstances and dice rolls.\n\nI really want to like this game, but it just really seems to be missing something.  The only feeling I have while playing this game is one of intense frustration.  Which is really strange, because I absolutely love randomness and replayability in games.  Mordheim just doesn't have the right "mix' or synergy yet between randomness and game mechanics, and it's for this reason that I simply cannot recommend this game at this time.  That is not to say, however, that, in the future, this game will not be good.  As of now, the game is still in early access and many of the balancing and/or frustrating aspects of the game may still be tweaked.","October 23, 2015","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

This is the patch!!!  Mordheim was in pretty rough shape when I first bought this game.  This patch has skyrocketed it passed the warpstone moon!\n\nBefore, the game was just a shallow "slug-fest" with no real strategy involved.  Yes, they eventually implimented the ability to create max level warbands, but it was still generally a shallow experience that got boring quickly.\n\nNow that they've implimented warband progression, the depth behind the gameplay has increased exponentially!!!  Before, even though the goal of each match was to "win" by routing the enemy warband, there was no real incentive other than "winning."  Because of the progression, now, warpstone is essential, even more so then "winning" the match.  Sure, you still want to win because you get more XP and winning also usually means your guys dont get as beat up, but the real goal now is to collect as much warpstone as possible.  Because of the new quests and the way the black market works, you can still salvage a loss by collecting a ton of warpstone in the process.  Instead of just rushing through the twisted and corrupt buildings of mordheim just to swarm an enemy charactor, I've found it necessary to take my time and strategize.  My recent strategies have been to have stronger "front line" units engage and tie up the enemy models while I employ runners to scout around the map, gather as much warpstone as they can fit in their pockets, and run back to deposit it in my cart.\n\nIts just a ton of fun now that this new patch has added so many dimensions to gameplay.

I am glad I did. The game strikes a very good balance between challenge vs. playability, emersion, risk vs. reward, progression, etc.. I absolutely love the 3rd person point of view and feel of the game play. It gives you the illusion of playing out a mini adventure, each time you start a new mission. There are quite a few naysayers out there who exclaim that the game is too hard or unfair. This is a thinking man's game. You must plan out your actions carefully and execute. Do I risk splitting up to gather more reward or play it safe so that I have strength in numbers? If you like a challenging game that affords you the opportunity to imagine yourself as the leader of a small band of brothers (or rats, sisters, etc..) and enjoy advancement and progression, you will like this title. I am not crazy about the Warhammer universe, but the gameplay has me addicted...there is always one more thing I want to do before putting the game down...good mix of tactical play, overall strategy in mission deployment, warband management, etc..\n\nPros\nImmersive Gameplay: You identify with your merry band of warriors\nNail biting: Many missions will come right down to the wire\nChallenging Gameplay: Rewarding to those that want a challenge. Feeling of accomplishment. You earned your victory!\nVaried Maps and Mission set Ups: Every mission will be a bit different than the one before.\nPoint of View: Refreshing 3rd person perspective that plays out before your eyes. It doesnt seem turned base...you are almost watching an action movie.\nFog of War: What's in that house across the street? Should I risk going in and getting cornered? What about that treasure chest that's in there?\nCustomization: Moderate character customization options. rename and tailor the look of your warband.\nPick and Choose: though not really a sandbox game, you have some flexibility in picking the missions you want to play.\nFun: I just enjoy playing the game. I cant put it down.\n\nCons\nIron Man: No combat saves. For me, this adds to the game tension (risk vs. reward) so is not an negative, but the game is unforgiving. You will live with your mistakes (or die by them).\nFinesse Required: You must learn the tactics and how to play the game to get good at it. (Hint: Stay together!)\nLuck: There are some situations that amount to dumb luck (good and bad) that no amount of tactics will overcome. This hasn't occurred too often, but it does happen.\nCustomization Options: what is available is good but wish there was more.\nRepetitive Missions: though I have not tired of the missions, they are similar in scope and style, save for the four story missions. Could become "grindy" for some.\n\nReview based on the solo campaign.

I've been playing the last couple of days, steadily working through a new campaign, and I am absolutely loving the game now.\n\nOne thing that isn't very apparent when you start out is the fact that, in the early stages of the campaign, the game is brutal.  This is largely because your warriors don't have any skills, gear, or money to acquire new gear.  Similar to other campaign-oriented tactical games, like Darkest Dungeon, X-Com, Blood Bowl, etc., if you persevere with the "darwinian" nature of the early game--and simply understand that warriors will die--the game eventually 'opens up' as the warriors that do survive slowly acquire the skills and gear necessary to become even better.  As additional hero/warrior slots and types unlock, and the money starts flowing, things get better and better.\n\nThe RNG can still be frustrating at times (most tactics games are like this), but as your warriors become more skilled and powerful, the chances for really bad streaks of 'bad luck' tend to be mitigated somewhat.  More than anything, with the right gear and/or stat increases, your warriors don't seem quite as fragile.\n\nAt this point, if I could change anything about the game, I'd perhaps add a little more information to the in-game tutorial.  While it goes through the motions of showing you a handful of common things you can do, it doesn't really expalin why you would want to do said things.  For example, learning how to disengage from battles and drawing the enemy into ambushes is extremely important, especially in the early part of the campaign, when your warriors are weak and can't trade blows for very long without being knocked out of combat.  Keeping your warriors 'alive' is also vitally important, as rout tests are based on the morale/number of warriors you have on the field of battle.  Therefore, if you have a deeply wounded warrior, sometimes its best to run him back to your cart (or some other safe area), and just let him sit out the remainder of the battle (instead of being knocked out).\n\nThe other thing that the tutorial doesn't really explain very well is the smuggler's den.  This part of the campaign game is extremely important, as it funds pretty much everything you do wtih your warband.  Without a fundamental understanding of how the smuggler's den works, you simply won't have the gold necessary to buy additional heroes/warriors, or pay for training, treatment, wages/pay, scouts, etc.\n\nAll in all, I'm having  a lot of fun with the game now.  The initial hurdle of getting through the first few battles, and coming to grips with how each of the game's campaign systems work may have taken more than a few hours, but I have to say now that the game is really fun.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, and I like a lot of what I am seeing--however, that said, I can't find myself recommending this game (yet) for one simple reason:  The hideously random nature of the game is just too ridiculous.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm not just saying this in a "kneejerk" kind of way.  I understand perception bias (that sense that you're ALWAYS getting bad dice/percentage rolls, when you really aren't), and I can appreciate the fact that the game is difficult (sometimes brutally so).  Having played many games in which the RNG is a major factor to your success, I am well aware that streaks of good and/or bad luck happen.   But the RNG is just the tip of the iceberg, and when combined with all of the other randam "elements" of the game, it just makes for an extremely frustrating experience.\n\nWhen you're not getting a string of bad rolls (say, five or six 75%-83% success failures in a row ... while the enemy team seems to never miss), you have to deal with unlucky positioning and/or creature spawns as you move your team around the map.  Because all movement is turn-oriented, and based on an initiative order, you're commited to your movements when you have no idea what's around the next corner.  In a general sense, this is fine, as it's all part of city-fighting.  But frustration sets in quickly when nearly every other mission spawns neutral creatures (like horrors, daemonettes, etc.) that utterly rip your team apart.  You make one unlucky move, and *bam* two of your warriors are dead.  You can't disengage.  You can't flee.  You're just dead.  And these aren't even "Hard" or "Brutal" missions--this is on "Normal".\n\nI played one mission where a daemonette murdered nearly the whole enemy team (they had two members left) as I strategically outlanked both the enemy team and the daemonette, while I raided their wagon.  Pretty cool.  But even with only two members left, the enemy team would not route.  And then the daemonette, apparently wanting to "share the wealth", ran all the way across the map to where the rest of my team was, and proceeded to murder one of my warriors.  After which, my team suddenly routed, even though I still had my leader and one more member than the enemy.  I instantly lost the mission.  While it was kind of 'interesting' and cool that I could "play" the daemonette to kill the enemy team, in the end, the totally "artificial" way in which the daemonette just ran across the map to murder my team and randomly cause a route was highly annoying.  Which leads me to my next issue:  routing.\n\nRouting seems completely random.  I can kill the enemy leader and half their team, and nothing happens.  But if my leader gats taken out, it's almost a certainty that my team will be instantly routed.  Route tests seem to happen without any kind of discernible indicator, too, besides some text.  One turn, everything is fine-and the next you simply lose.  LoL.  The concept behind being defeated by route testing is fine, but the implementation is poor and rather unsatisfying from a gaming perpective.  Which just about sums up the entire experience of this game.\n\nOn its own, the RNG is fine.  In other games, like Blood Bowl, or Talisman, it's an integrated part of the gameplay--because you can either strategize around the randomness, or the game is simply driven by the randomness and centered more on making choices.  Mordheim is neither:  you can't strategize many outcomes because positioning, encountering and randomly spawed creatures of ridiculous strength ruin any "game plan" you might have; and at many times the combat does seem very driven by the randomness while not providing anything even resembling an interesting choice to make.  More often than not, you have to just sit there, selecting the same thing you've selected for the last three rounds, while you slowly watch your team get ripped apart by unlucky circumstances and dice rolls.\n\nI really want to like this game, but it just really seems to be missing something.  The only feeling I have while playing this game is one of intense frustration.  Which is really strange, because I absolutely love randomness and replayability in games.  Mordheim just doesn't have the right "mix' or synergy yet between randomness and game mechanics, and it's for this reason that I simply cannot recommend this game at this time.  That is not to say, however, that, in the future, this game will not be good.  As of now, the game is still in early access and many of the balancing and/or frustrating aspects of the game may still be tweaked.","October 23, 2015","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

I have been a fan of Mordheim from the TT days. When I read on Rock Paper Stone that Mordheim was about to be turned into a PC game, I instantly upgraded my rig, and created a Steam account.\n\nI purchased and have not looked back since. I joined the community {basically The Gentlmen of Mordheim} and participated in this EA - there have been issues, desyncing and invisible blocking and the attacking through walls etc.\n\nThat said this game is REMARKABLE the translation from  TT is not faithful or prefect, but what Rogue Factor has given us is a beautifully rendered visual experience, accompained at times with sublime gameplay.\n\nLet's pause a minute and discuss the visuals. The City itself really captures the menace and threat of all the literature I have read about Mordheim. The streets are barren and forboding. The architecture exactly how I imagined it should be. The skies are dark and full of ominous promise. The whole vista is a sight to behold. I can't wait to see the finished article.\n\nThe modelling is exquisite - the Skaven have been captured magnificantly, not only the detailing but also the character. RF's Skaven are simply a work of art, easily imo unstriping the attempts at Rattyness that Vermintide is showing us.\n\nWatching a rat socerer cast a mist is a joy to behold. Or the way they run, with their arms out to the side, clutching a pair of Warplocks and their cloaks flaring out is WONDERFUL!\n\nThe way the Sisters raise a Sigmarite to the heavens when invoking a blessing is spot on!\n\nI could go on and on...\n\nAll of the Warbands look fantastic - RF should win an award for their creativity and sheer brilliance!\n\nThe gameplay can be riveting - so many tactical choices to be made. Placing a unit in front of a trap and waiting for an opponent to attempt a charge, and getting stopped by the trap is a particular fav of mine.\n\nSetting up a sheildwall and halting an enemy in it's tracks and then using ranged to slowly dismantle the enemies ranks, is another joy.\n\nNow with Progression this game has reached new heights. Apart form all the incredible management options the Hideout now affords us - the arrival of progression makes the choices of where to put the points even more important. The injury system really injects, tension and drama - I have two rats with only one arm each!!\n\nI could go on and on - but this game is a MUST HAVE for any fans tactical/turn-based strategy games.\n\nROGUE FACTOR BE PROUD VERY PROUD!!!\n\nBUY-BUY YES-YES!!!!!\n\n10 out of 10 and it isn't even finished!!!!\n\n","September 27, 2015","true","11.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The one thing that I imagined beeing a flaw in gameplay was the Action point system, since I´m quite a diehard fan of the tabletop I feared that it wont "feel"like mordheim. Boy was I wrong :D\n\nShort explaination: Your fighters can use their AP to move arround, reclaim AP´s by simply going back the path you used. So you are able position them tactically and set up traps, find nice sniping spots... But be careful of the chaotic infestations on the ground, walls and in corners, they will interrupt your movement if a charater gets too close and set´s it off. This will end a movement substep, and a char cant reclaim the AP´s he used till he hit the trap.\n\nThe experince system is a bit different, as well as the attributes. It´s heavily influenced by the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay system and it works really great!\n\nThe procedural map generator is really cool, and the campaign special scneraios bring a lot of flavour with them, and you´re able to field the dramatis personae of your warband to the skirmish.\n\nresumé - If you like turn based tactical games you really should consinder the game, even if you haven´t got a tabletop background. If you like the Warhammer Universe and especially the Mordheim theme, it´s almost a must buy.","November 22, 2015","true","248.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Good amount of story telling in their journey. They can get injured and lose limbs, eyes, and more. If you like xcom then I'd definitely give this a shot!\n\nI would like to see some more weapons and gear, the current selection is a bit limited. Some may find the game play repetitive, but I personally love it.\n\nWould love to be able to equip battle scarred warriors with things like hooks and eye patches.\n\nThe RNG may make you rage, but ultimately a clever leader will regularly bring their war band to victory. Yes you will lose people, sometimes for stupid reasons that you couldn't control, but such is war.\n\nI see some people hating on the game for RNG. Personally I like the challenge and honestly it's not a super hard game I win like 90% of the time and only lose people every 7 missions if that. Yes I do rage at the skaven when they triple dodge my swings but I get them in the end. I will say this, if you're looking for a walk in the park game where you can just beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies this is not that game.\n\nI will levy one bit of criticism against a particular RNG element in the game.The smite or "magic kill debuff" is really unecessary. In the game using any spell has a chance of giving your spellcaster one of a variety of debuffs or negative actions. Some examples are:\n\n-turn ends immediately\n\n-reduced accuracy for a couple turns\n\n-other stat debuffs like hit chance\n\nOne of these negative actions in response to ANY spell cast could be a smite which deals 9999 damage to the caster and thus insta kills them. This can happen to your casters or the NPC team casters and I've seen both. Ultimately it's too strong a penalty and I think it stronglty discourages using casters. The other debuffs are one thing, but the insta kill is too much. Why have a caster when you could just recruit another melee hero who has no chance of dying on an arbitrary action? It already takes a ton of money just to teach them spells so why bother?\n\nThis is the games biggest weakness in my opinion and I wish they would remove it. Even when it happens to the opposing team it's usually not a big enough deal that it changes the tide of battle and if that is the point of it, an RNG mechanic that can change the tide of battle, it can be done in a lot of other more interesting ways.","December 11, 2015","true","115.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauxhawk/recommended/276810/","flauxhawk","CTi flauxhawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauxhawk/","627 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMordheim: City of the Damned is a turn-based, squad-level tactical game set in the devastated city of Mordheim. You begin by choosing a warband - the current choices include four different warbands with (what is currently) a basic variety of units, spells, and abilities. You manage what units from your warband you will take into combat within Mordheim. Some are more capable than others overall (heroes) and their inherent unit statistics vary leading to variety in capability - in other words, units with higher agility have higher dodge and hit chances, higher toughness means shrugging off damage, intelligence affects spell-casting, so on. The unit statistics can be viewed from your warband management screen, along with equipped weapons, armor, abilities. Currently you can only change armor and weapons (from some basic choices with differences in combat effects) and swap out your warband units. The plan is for your units to gain experience as the game's development progresses, thus making your units more powerful (and mitigating some of the RNG effects). Most units can currently carry two sets of weapons for tactical variety. Weapons such as swords allow the user to parry while halberds hit hard but suffer an accuracy penalty. Some weapons apply debuffs when they hit enemies (poison blades, warplock pistols, etc.) that can stack and ruin someone's day.\n\nEach unit has two types of points - blue points for movement actions and red points for offensive actions. Blue points allow your units to move, climb walls, jump down ledges, reload ranged weapons, flee from opponents, swap weapon sets etc. Red points allow you to attack, cast spells, etc. Some actions require combinations of both (for example, safely disengaging from an enemy without provoking an attack of opportunity requires the use of both types of points, or taking full aim with a ranged weapon).\n\nThe turn order for units is displayed at the top of the screen but since units of the same type utilize the same icon the information provided isn't as useful as expected. Turn order is determined through initiative based on unit statistics. You can also zoom out from a unit by pressing the LALT key, giving you an overview of where your units are currently stationed, any visible enemy units and previous known locations of currently out-of-sight enemies (marked with a ?). This is extremely useful as Mordheim's devastated and maze-like city streets can be difficult to navigate otherwise.\n\nAction success is percent-based, so you can clearly see your chances prior to performing any action. This is of course where RNG effects can be extremely frustrating, but again, once experience gains are implemented stronger units should help mitigate this. Like a lot of turn-based tactical games with these mechanics risk management is an extremely important aspect of the battlefield.\n\nThere are lootable points on the battlefield and dead enemy soldiers will sometimes drop 'special' weapons (in other words weapons with different statistics, or essentially 'magic' weapons). You can't permanently keep them in your inventory at present but in the future this should impart a sense of unit progression and reward the player for succesfully defeating opponents.\n\nGraphically the game is well-done - on the highest settings the game is crisp, runs smoothly and has nice effects. The music is suitably dark considering the setting and lends an appropriate 'doomed' quality to the atmosphere. Those who don't enjoy the Warhammer universe's grimdark grimdarkness might have to overlook these items to enjoy the gameplay.\n\nThere's quite a bit more to be done in Mordheim. I personally am looking forward to unit progression and the loot system. As it stands the game provides you with one-off skirmishes between warbands to give you a taste of the game's combat and gameplay.\n\nIf you love games such as X-COM, Xenonauts, UFO: Afterseries, or essentially any squad-level turn-based game you'll definitely enjoy this. Keep an eye on it - if they don't fug it up this could be great.","February 5, 2015","true","22.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

At a later date (when the game is officially released) we will come back and update our review of it. The score we will give at the end of this review is the score for the game as it is right now. And, on that note, let’s get rocking.\n\nI – Story [8/10]\n\nMordheim: City of the Damned is a turn-based strategy game (with some RPG elements mixed in) from Rogue Factor. It is a digital adaptation of the tabletop game Mordheim from Games Workshop. Set in the city of Mordheim (part of the amazing world of Warhammer) a comet has crashed and turned the whole city into a horrific battleground for bands of mercenaries from across the land. The prize? Fragments of Wyrdstone that came from the comet and that are scattered throughout the city.\n\nIt’s not the most intriguing of stories (and, let’s face it, this was originally a tabletop game), but I rather liked it. Not to mention the gorgeously morbid setting in an absolutely immersing universe.\n\nII – UI [5/10]\n\nThere were very few things I didn’t like about the user interface as it sits now. Accessing individual unit stats and action menus is easy as can be, but (again, this is still in early access and will hopefully change) the lack of functionality in the tactical overview map is disappointing. It is often times hard to plot out your strategy on the overview map and then attempt to put it into action in real time. A minimap would definitely alleviate this problem to an extent, but increased functionality of the overview map should definitely find its way into a future update of the game.\n\nThe really troublesome thing about the user interface is the incredibly awful camera angles during your opponent’s turn. I can’t stress enough how annoying the camera angles are during action phases that are not yours. Sometimes you’ll be looking at a unit in a completely different area of the map that has nothing to do with what is currently happening and that is if you get lucky. More often than not, you’ll be looking at some scenery. While that isn’t necessarily a bad thing in and of itself (the environment is fascinating), it gets obnoxious in a hurry.\n\nAs far as actual action animations go, the camera angles need some work, but the animations themselves are pretty nice.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nI love the gameplay in M:CotD. I’m a newcomer to the Warhammer universe for the most part, especially the fantasy side of it, but M:CotD is genuinely fun.\n\nThere are currently two modes of play. The first mode, “Battleground Only”, is essentially a deathmatch. The object of this mode is to either kill all of the enemy’s units or cause them to rout, effectively forfeiting the skirmish. This (alongside the tutorials) is a good way to become familiar with the mechanics of gameplay.\n\nThe second mode of play is “Extra Objectives”. In this mode you can win the skirmish in the same way you can win a “Battleground Only” match or by being the first to complete a secondary objective. There are three secondary objectives: “Marked For Death”, “Crush Their Will”, and “Wyrdstone Rush”. To complete “Marked For Death” you will need to kill specific units of the enemy’s warband and collect their belongings as proof. To complete “Crush Their Will” you will need to steal the Idol of the enemy’s warband and stash it in your chest. To complete “Wyrdstone Rush” you will need to gather a certain percentage of all the Wyrdstone on the map. Also, your team and the enemy team could have different secondary objectives or you could have the same one. It keeps things interesting.\n\nYou also have the ability to alter the roster of your warband. Other things you can manage is what equipment certain units have and how their skills are being developed. You gain experience the more you play with your chosen faction.\n\nIV – Content [7/10]\n\nFor M:CotD to be in early access, it has a fair amount of content already. There are four playable factions to chose from currently (Empire Mercenaries, the Cult of the Possessed, the Sisters of Sigmar, and the Skaven Clan Eshin), four playable maps, a good diversity of units for each faction, and a good smattering of items to equip your warband with. As it is now, is there enough content to justify the price tag? Probably not. At least, not quite yet. There is still more than enough to keep you going for a good long while though.\n\nV – Visual [10/10]\n\nNow we’re coming to the aspects in which M:CotD really shines the brightest. The graphics are beautiful; both character models and the landscape. Everything is dark and gloomy and the atmosphere is to die for. Every unit is intricately detailed and wonderfully animated. The environment may be the best part about M:CotD. It might be Hell on earth, but it is an unforgettable place to visit.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nWe have now reached what I consider to be the greatest part about M:CotD: the music. The music in this game is perfect. It really sets the feel for every single battle and incursion into the cursed city. Not only this, but the sound effects are incredibly well done. As far as sights and sounds go, Mordheim should be your next tourist destination.\n\nVII – Overall [8.3/10]\n\nOverall, Mordheim: City of the Damned is off to a great start. This one has serious potential and I cannot wait to see where it ends up in terms of it’s completion.","February 13, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I find this game is a true homage to one of it's first true tabletop experiences, without (Well mostly) the obsessive power creeping that has come from it's latest instalments of tabletop games\n\nSetting\n\nMordheim, as the name is stated, is played in the once great imperial city which is now just empty corridors and frigtening manisfestations of chaotic energy. And Mordheim the video game doesn't dissapoint. The city itself is well presented and offers the true tabletop experience, baring a few things that tabletop players are farmiliar with such as a birds eye view of the battlefield and no fog of War.\n\nIn a way this makes the game feel more like a discovering city fight than the all omnipotence view we as tabletop players come to expect, that is there are no way of knowing where your oponent is unless you take the energy to find them. I was genuenly surprised when my character walked out of a door to suddenly come face to face with a Rat Ogre. Boy did that make me a bit paranoid for open doorways and back alleys.\n\nOverall The setting is what you would expect from this game, it hits the spot with not only a pinpoint nail, but also the flying hammer behind it.\n\nGameplay\n\nLet it be known that the games i enjoy all have one thing in common, and that is not how pretty or how vibrant the world is, I am not a gamer who thinks of such trivial things so zealosly. Instead i find that the games i enjoy all have mechanics that are both easy to pick up and hard to master.\n\nMordheim is no different, it's mechanics very farmiliar to my knowledge of the tabletop game, with a few good exceptions. The Combat sequences do feel like they have that tabletop feel to them (Such as the no guarantee of doing a stance such as dodge or Parry), this is a good thing. It shows that the developers reseached their source material well.\n\nHowever I did notice other things in game which vary way differently than their tabletop Counterpart. These features were noticeably different and feel more on the side of a computer game than a tabletop. And result in things that are rather alienating compared to it's tabletop counterpart (Which is a suggestion of you shouldn't believe everything that is being portraiyed in this game as it's tabletop counterpart) other than the few things that felt like they didn't feel right I had no quams with the system as it was hitting pretty close to home\n\nExtra Features\n\nMordheim doesn't really feel like mordheim until you add the one core component from it's tabletop edition into the game, if it didn't have this it would just feel like a city fight of Warhammer Fantasy, and i would say as a person who has playedc both, they are SOO not the same\n\nInstead the introduction of the persistant warbands and the campaign system trully make this a very well made recreation of the tabletop game and make every fight and every warband that much more investing to the player. It's not a simple matter of making a dream warband and proceeding to curb stomp every opponent out there but rather seeing your characters become the warriors they are from every bloody battle you encounter. You as a player pour your time and effort to make your characters an extension of yourself, which makes it all the more harder when those same characters lose vital parts of themselves or even perish from your roster permanently.\n\nMordheim the tabletop game was unforgiving to it's players and made them that much more invested in the survival or their warband, Mordheim the PC game delivers the same hit, time after time.\n\nVerdict\n\nOverall, I feel  that this game is truly a great extension of it's tabletop counterpart and it makes due of it's promise to give you that genuine tabletop experience. If you are a veteran of the tabletop game i would highly invest in this. For those who haven't played a tabletop game i would suggest you try this out. The concepts and mechanics can help you get through the trial stages of learning this remarkable and addictive game.\n\n9/10","December 20, 2015","true","70.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I like the fact that I can select a style of weapon or type of armor, and I can cutomize those items by putting runes in them.\n\nI like that I can chose which skills I'm going to use based on how I spent my attribute points.\n\nThe development team listens to the customer base, and actively pushes out patches.

There are too many issues.\n\nIn case you aren't aware, Mordheim is based on a skirmish tabletop by Games Workshop, though as I understand it it doesn't use the original game's rules. The adaption is a turn based strategy game in a really dark fantasy setting where you build and manage a warband. You recruit heroes and henchmen and slowly build them up by surviving randomly generated missions. There are permanent consequences anywhere, from permanent injuries after dying to downright permadeath. There is a constant race against time too since you need to deliver a ressource in time that you can gather during missions every few ingame weeks. If you manage to do it the timer is reset, but if you don't the whole game is lost. Losing too many people permanently and not being able to go to missions to gather the ressource does in essence also lose you the game permanently. This doesn't happen after 3 or 4 hours by the way, this will become a problem after 20 or 30 hours.\n\nIt would all be fine if it would all be down to your skill as a player, but there is a TON of reliance on RNG in this game. If facing permanent debilitations because of things completely outside your control is something that bothers you, dear god stay away from this game.\n\nBut it wasn't what made me quit playing ultimately (no I didn't ragequit after losing the game). What kills it is the slowness. There is a ton of waiting for enemy actions during missions and slow animations that can't be skipped or sped up. Also, the story missions are absolutely terribly designed. They are on maps that are confusing as heck with totally unclear mission directions. And they take forever. The first try you are almost guaranteed to lose until you figure out what the mission is even about. They are just a complete drag and no fun at all. After 20 hours of building my warband, seeing the forth mission of the sisterhood and thinking that I will have to face more of that ♥♥♥♥ after 20 more hours I just lost all energy and motivation.\n\nThanks but no thanks, there are games that are simply more fun than this.","February 27","false","19.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I think a couple stories will describe this nicely.\nFirst imagine your magister, high level and very powerful. You take him into a normal difficulty mission that goes fairly well. The enemy has very low moral and is expected to break soon. As you go to cast a spell, you read that the success percent is nintey and so you cast it having action points to spend. After casting it, your magister is cursed. He takes 999999 damage (instantly killing him). Him bieng slow the round ends after his turn. Your warband then breaks and you lose the battle. After battle, your magister dies, perminently. You then proceed to delete that warband and almost the game.\nNext, imagine your winning a battle, all looks well. The enemies turn has just ended so you proceed to issue attack commands to your warband as combat is near. You miss every hit that round, and the next. Every percent chance says "seventy" or "eighty" but you miss, everything. After two round of bieng slaughtered your warband breaks and a majority of your party members suffer wounds.\nAnd I know, mordhiem is based on a tabletop game that comes down to dice rolls, but as someone who (once, age of sigmar is a thing) played warhammer fantasy, this game is not near as deep strategically, and I have a hard time understanding why it is considered a tactical strat. game when so much of it comes down to chance. What skill does it take to have your party leader die to an enemy scout because he cant hit him on an "eighty-percent" chance?","January 22","false","16.0"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","4"

Once the RPG elements of the game have been implemented this will be brilliant.\n\nI like the more dynamic move options instead of your standard turn based grid style of movement.

Nothing that breaks anything, just every now and then you get an angle where you cant see whats going on.\n\nThere are points in the game that need graphics optimization...I am currently playing on the "Simple" Graphics configuration and in the main menu screen, my cards fan is screaming.

In due time the other factions will be added and so will the progression system which will take this game to an unbelievable level of enjoyment. It is easy to see just how many places there are to go with this game, especially if it is eventually open to player modding in order to add many factions which the developers may not have an interest in adding themselves.\n\nI look forward to future updates and will continue to play and enjoy the current content.\n\n","November 24, 2014","true","26.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspaceotter/recommended/276810/","aspaceotter","aspaceotter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspaceotter/","104 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I am going to try and be as informative as I possibly can with this game.\nThe game has four factions each one with unique units that can wield and use varieties of armor and weapons. To start the game you are going to choose one of four factions, the choice of faction is crucial to your play style. Once chosen you are going to begin leveling, and yes you level everything, even the poor little meat shields you hide your damage dealers behind. This entire game is based on leveling, accept that fact and youll be perfectly happy with the game. Now the key detail of this game in my eyes is going to be resource management in the warband screen. EVERY MEMBER of your warband must be paid, and you must send wyrdstone to those who request it, miss four shipments and its game over. Inside your camp you can almost fully customize your characters (this is a detail of the game that i want more improvement on) by changing the styles of their gear and equipping them new armor and weapons, also training them over days in spell casting and skill use.\nnow once outside of your warbands camp youll be placed on the campaign screen (the newest update added this finally!). Once on the screen youll be given a variety of missions to choose from, all with varying difficulty and loot. Once you get your warband high enough you will be given an end of act mission. These end of act missions have objectives that must be completed such as placing sanctified hammers on statues, and cleansing the corruption from holy artifacts.\n\nThe actual gameplay is a turn based strategy format. Units take turns based on their initiation, this is lowered by heavier cumberson items and armor/weapons. In many ways I have found that the weaker glass cannon units go first most of the time, and depending on your faction you may or may not have any of those. Now one thing this games combat does very well is its implication of stances. there are many stances in this game including ambush dodge and parry, being the primary stances. Combat can be very difficult at times because your units move spaces may not get you in a proper postion to attack, and often leads to bottlenecking through doorways or over bridges. Each mission you recieve has a primary objective of killing all enemies or causing them to retreat. Retreat is caused by you forcibly removing morale from an enemy by either surrounding them and causing fear, or the killing of their units. (im not sure about this but it seems like killing enemy heroes and leaders causes a deeper impact on morale)\nOne thing to be wary of is any kind of % chance, as this game is still in Alpha I will go back and change this review as needed but as of now a 78% chance of climbing over a wall seems to have only a 30% success rate, and yes I have tested this by losing over 3 units to trying to climb one wall.\n\nAll in all this game is amazing, definitely a must have for any warhammer player, and a must try for any strategy enthusiast, this game will punish you through crippling soldiers or even permanent death though. So if you do decide to try it watch for ambushes, and stay away from charging Daemons! Enjoy!","October 10, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am happy to report that they fixed that, each warband you make feels unique, and you star with a rookie, or later on with the right amount of coin you can be a trained rookie. So what is  the good and the bad?\nCons:\nThe AI can be a bit wonky, as in if another is blocking the path to get through, they will just end there turn, did have one funny moment when an ranged AI decided to jump of a 15ft wall, take fall damage and attempted to shoot and miss, felt bad for him.\n\nThe daughters of Sigmar feel a little op, if you are brand new to this game, this is the faction to avoid in combat, they are the tank/mage group, meaning they can cause lots of damage and take it, now they are fun to use and also I do appreciate they are not visually clad in bikini's as most games I see will do with an all female faction.\nThe Price is a little high in my opion, I bought this when I had more money, for an Early Access I understand they need every cent to make the game good, but you risk scaring people away. In this regard I would say  if a friend bought this, ask to try this game, cause if its not for you, then you will probably come to hate this game.\n\nThis game has its own lore, but if you are not a Warhammer, fantasy or 40k fan, you may be lost, I would see the Warhammer wiki page, but this is a grim dark fantasy game, meaning its not going to have a happy ending on most days. The story for now is ok, I do enjoy making my own adventure, but there is no cutscenes, (so far), so you dont see a major progresion, they are realeasing Act's as time goes on, so maybe there will be chages.\n\nPros:\n\nIts a good warhammer game, visually all the characters are right, the weapons they use is correct, and all the maps feel like you are an a chaos corrupted hell hole.\n\nIts fun to see your warband progress over time, and customize them, give them new armor, weapons, skills, so its like xcom except warhammer, and you feel the weight of their deaths.\n\nThe mission types are fun, for now, mostly its about collecting wyrdstones, and fighting enemy warbands, and if the mission is to hard you can send scouts to find different missions.\n\nThe engine is not to bad, the game visually is good, gruff, abomination look is what I would expect from a warhammer game. I hope they do add in a faction like Orks/goblins, since all the other factions have a specific reason for being there, it would be a game changer if one was there just to kill everyone, not for chaos or the empire, just for fun.\n\nSo all in all my fun rating is a 10/10, I love playng this game, but my more professional side says a 7-8/10 it has issues, some parts of the game will feel a bit unfair, like if you have a 95% chance to hit but miss 3 times, and have a dodge of 80% but get hit twice does feel a bit cheap, and if the decrease the price a bit, I would reconmend this game to all my warhammer friends. I did not play the boardgame version of Mordheim but this game has caught my interest. That feeling of conquest is always great and this review may change when its complete, but for now I reconmend this game because for the time being, even though I went into more details about the bad, its still a fun game I just went more into it because I feel that part is for the devs or people who want to see what may turn them away from this game, and weigh it in their own minds, because this is still a a fun game  and I enjoyed it.","October 12, 2015","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Update 8, Patch 4, EA rating - 95/100)\n\nThis is an updated review after full-release. Changes are written with capital letters. (Release 19/NOV/2015, v. 1.0.4.1).\n\nMy overall rating for Mordheim: City of the Damned: 100/100\n\nAnother adaptation from Warhammer universe, this combines elements of real-time strategy and RPG genre. Decent atmospheric settings full of horror and merciless battles, that is what this game promises you. Add a management of your warband, improvement of skills and a decent portion of strategy with luck and you have, what it is really called. War over cursed city, which we will look into further in details.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Good design and performance\n+ Strategic map\n+ Variety of actions and reactions (most of them are responsive)\n+ Good tutorials\n+ Warband management\n+ Commented objectives, stories before and after the mission\n+ VOICED STORIES AND INTRO ADDED\no Complex control\n- Four factions only (may not be negative at all)\n\nGameplay is a decent part of the game and it is very well balanced. Now there are only four factions, but tactics, randomised elements on map and also important luck factor are creating a formidable game experience. Turn-based strategy is very well combined with RPG genre, so you have to improve your warband, change the position and disposition of the troops, after that, you have to fight your battles on the battlefield.\n\nBattles need another strategy guidance, you have to rely not only on your warriors, but also to environment and luck. Everything is possible in war, so also here, even the weakest unit can disable or rout the strongest enemy with the right conditions and events happened.\n\nCommented objectives, intros and outros to the mission are adding a great impression to the atmosphere of the whole game. Player can feel himself/herself like the biggest general and strategist in the world.\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Excellent graphics\n+ Art style\n+ Cam view\n+ Wounds have influence on characters' appearance\n\nVisually is Mordheim stunning. Perfect set of backgrounds, various part of Mordheim, nice details on units and many features have a wonderful impression on a player. Also your warriors may suffer wounds and injuries, which are visible then, so you can tell, who is a novice and who battle-toughened veteran.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Well composed\n+ Theme for each faction, map\n+ RELEASED AS AN EXCLUSIVE OFFER FOR ALL PLAYERS\n\nSoundtrack adds points for Mordheim: City of the Damned, themes are adequately changing, underlining both nature of each faction and sinister atmosphere of cursed city of Mordheim. After full release it was added and automatically downloaded to game folder (link specified at store page).\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\n+ Balanced\n+ Various mods\no Seeking by rating (adjustable)\n\nMultiplayer also provides another possibilities for your warband to perform, you can choose of plenty modes and community is fair and friendly. There is also "Exhibition" mode, where no penalties will remain after ending. For other, experienced units are recommended, because loss can disrupt your precisely build warband in one unlucky mission. Though you can seek the enemy just to suit your rank, so it is compensable and you do not have to have an elite unit at all.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis title is a very wonderful adaptiation of Warhammer universe, yet in the process of perfection through Early Access. Also turn-based strategy and RPG combination seems very promising, though there might be some bugs and people should be aware of that and considering this during their reviews, written or spoken, does not matter what. Developers are working fast, communicating with community and releasing patches regularly, each with huge balance.\n\nAbout the price, game is complex, replayable, I understand that 39,99 EUR might be expensive for some players (Early Access costed 31,99 EUR), but it is worthy, singleplayer for sure, multiplayer experience are giving also points to this title. Though it is very similar to late Early-Access phase, it has those improvements, which exactly were needed to be done.\n\nThe game is recommended for Warhammer fans, turn-based strategy, RPG players and also players outside this genres. Each of us has a bit of dark fantasy within us.","October 20, 2015","true","349.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is definitely in early release stage but by far one of the better early release games on steam. At this point it's more playable than most fully released games!\n\nBeing a big fan of the Warhammer series from everything to lore and the table top (both Warhammer fantasy and 40k) I was really excited when I first discovered this a while back. Most of the games made with Games Workshop are usually the 40k space marine type or Dawn of War. This was obviously a delight because it looked like a “real” attempt at the fantasy style instead.\n\nI was a bit hesitant to pick it up at first mainly because of the bad wrap on early releases lately and from everything I read it was meant for a console and was still pretty rough for PC users. As I watched it though it went from “mixed reviews” to “Mostly positive” the developers were releasing some awesome new content and watching some game play on youtube it looked like it might actually become a real game instead of another early release disappointment (here's looking at you Day Z).\n\nThe game play itself is pretty solid. You have the 4 factions all of which are pretty balanced and at this point pretty simple. At this point in the game you really on have the tutorials (4 of them which really do cover all the game and take less than an hour) and skirmish. You create a map and choose the opposing faction if it's against AI or you can randomly pair with another person for some PVP. The unique thing I liked about setting up the game were the vast options for starting locations or scenarios. For example you can can do standard set up (both teams start at opposite corners) you can do Ambush (one team starts all inside a building and the opposing team is surrounding the building) Fog of War (Both teams are completely scattered across the map) and the list goes on and on. The maps even at this point are impressive and I love that they randomly generate so you hardly ever get the same map twice.\n\nThe combat is pretty simple which might be a down point for some, but personally I enjoyed I. It keeps the game play fast and allows you to focus on other strategy rather than micro managing each character during their turn. You basically have two types of points for each unit Strategy Points and Offense Points (SP and OP respectively) your SP points allow for movement and your OP allow for combat which you can see pretty decently in the game play video. Depending on the skills or spells your unit has you are allowed to cycle through your available options each turn  by hitting Q or E. This helps make the combat smooth and quick. Most of the strategy is in placement of troops and sight. Much like in the tabletop game the first few turns are setting up your units in defensible areas or in getting the enemy in line of sight. This may seem tedious for those who want action but it is incredibly fun to run around as an Ogre or Cultish Wizard looking for positions of advantage.\n\nOutside of the match you do have the option to micro manage your troops which was also fun from a looting, leveling, and buffing standpoint. You can customize your squad with gear which can be looted from battles and eventually purchased, you can spend points and level skills, spells, or abilities, and you can enchant your weaponry (Hammer of Sigmar +5 awesomeness). This makes you invested in your war band but keep in mind this game also has perma-death so don't get super attached to your beloved hero.\n\n\nSome awesome things that stand out:\n\nThe overlord view during a match that allows you to plan and scope the whole map was really a cool idea and works very well.\nIn game log for all actions so you can see why you missed that hit or miscast a spell.\nDark fantasy art and feel is seriously awesome as hell. They did a fricken epic job making Mordheim seem like a city of dark magic corrupted by chaos.\nLore (though limited) is all accurate and pretty intriguing. It will be appreciated by fans of the genre and at the same time new players won't be confused or lost without background.\n\n9/10 would run around for an hour as a Skaven assassin again.\n\nThis would be an amazing game for just an RPG in the style of Fable or Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning. Give me this city as an open world map and let me build a character and I would pay an A list game price for that.\n","April 18, 2015","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There are a some bugs, such as camera issues and a few invisible walls, but this comes with early access and I'm sure these will get ironed out in time. I'm deffinitely Looking forward to the next update.\n\n\nREVIEW OF PROGRESSION - update 8.\n\nThe game at the moment is very entertaining, slightly addictive, and requires some skill to keep your team going. There are small issues with balancing, enemy warbands seem to level more quickly and have +40% health, but again this is merely the beginning of testing progression; which will hopefully be perfected in the near future as this is what will affect replayability.\n\nThere are still some bugs floating around, the old invisble wall, but they are steadily being fixed by the developers. The only concerns I have as of now for the game are small UI things; the placement of buttons, perfecting icons such as those on the map; that reduce submersion into the game.\n\nFingers crossed for the next few updates.

That said, I thoroughly enjoy the game and the customization of the warbands. Each warband is different and fun to play.\n\nPros:  - Fun and enjoyable combat.\n- Great dark setting with tons of tactical options per map.\n- Great game to play with a friend/stranger (Chat is funny often with other players)\n- Map options vary widely, as do starting positions.\n- Love having total control to respec and get a solid feel for each warband's strengths.\n\nCons (as of E.A.): - Some of the larger maps might not run as nice as smaller maps.\n- Bugs (as expected) that can stop a multiplayer game. (usually issue with the connectee to host)\n- Needs some optimization to run better. (Poor graphics options; 5 preset)\n- Fighting CPU is lack luster, you'll win every game.\n\nSo in all, its runs like you might expect any unfinished game to. Its a solid game play and idea that i will admit is super fun. If you and a friend(s) can find some time to dedicate to this game I can promise you'll have a good time. I haven't yet found a match-up of warbands that is completely one sided so every game has fair play. :) If you are looking for a great turn based stratagey game with amazing potential check out Mordeheim, you wont be sorry.","September 9, 2015","true","50.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I will, however, be leaving a lengthy review explaining my opinions of this game.\n\nFirst of all its one of the best tabletop to video game conversions I have ever played. The play mechanics are superb and feel refreshing for a turn based strategy game, aside from the RNG.\n\nThe overall look and feel of the game are excellent, it is a great blend of horror and strategy. Great graphics, awesome artwork, cool noises, amazing voice acting, and genuinely creepy.\n\nYes the game can be immensely challenging and unforgiving, but that is one of the best parts. Real true consequences that you will be feeling the effects of for a long while to come, so play smart, be cautious.\n\nThe downside of the game is really that the AI, although incredibly tough, is incredibly stupid. Every match is basically a Zerg rush. The AI will throw everything it has at you (aside from one guy who will wander around aimlessly) right at the start of match.\n\nThe goal of the game almost entirely revolves around collecting this precious green crack called Wryd Stone. The AI is not at all interested in doing that. Instead they will mindlessly pursue you like ravenous zombies.\n\nIf they could improve the AI, wherein they actually cared about collecting the Wyrd Stone, as the game implies they should, and used some genuine strategy instead of 'walk straight at the closest enemy and kill' strategy it currently uses then this game would be huge win.\n\nAnother sore spot is the RNG. I suggest you keep a pillow close by to bite on because you will be getting royally ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥.\n\nThe RNG seems to purposely want to cause you to smash your computer in complete rage. I have lost numerous battles, where I overwhelmingly had the tactical advantage, simply because my team would continually miss attack after attack and take every incoming hit right on the chin till they where all decimated.\n\nThere is little to nothing you can do about the RNG except pray and pray. It completely sucks the idea of 'being the smarter tactician' right out of the game. They should add in some fail safe so you can only miss so many times in a row or something along those lines because it seems no matter how likely your odds of landing a hit are its always a 3/10 chance you will actually land the hit... especially when you really really need to land that last freakin hit!\n\nLastly, I absolutely love the fact this game has multiplayer support. Although it is neigh impossible to find a match unless you join a community group that host pvp tournaments. It may have been the saving grace of the entire game if not for the fact that multiplayer is not balanced at all.\n\nEvery faction in multiplayer has some super cheezy tactic or advantage that will make them OP depending on what lvl your currently fighting at.\nEarly on the Skaven move so far and fast they can easily swarm, poison, and kill half your team before you even get to move. Later on the Sisters will drop comet after comet, after comet, after... you guessed it more comets on your head till you have two guys remaining that they quickly surround and flog to death. Late game the Mutants if played right, will have uber mutations giving them more strength and health than anyone making them a wall of flesh and claws that will pound your face, body, and soul into the ground.\n\nIf they where to improve AI, add a more forgiving RNG (so the game is more based on tactics than luck), and tweak the multiplayer balancing this game would be absolutely amazing. For now I suggest if you like tabletop games, turn based strategy, Warhammer, or are a masochist get this game next time its on sale.\n\nI'll be looking forward to updates... if there are any.","March 23","true","129.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(all right, I confess I was greedy and tried a "deadly" mission, which turned out to be a mission against sisters... mental note: don't do it again)\n\nBut actually, aside from the "psychological" side, losing is not as damaging (in game terms) as you could think, because the difficulty of most missions depends on your strength.\n\nGoing for a "normal difficulty" mission is a bit easier with a strong team than with a weak team, but not that much. (it's still a bit easier with a strong team because as your teammates level up, you can chose skills and usually, we humans are better than the AI at building "consistent" characters (with skills that work well together)).\n\nSo I my opinion the game is great because it feels unforgiving without being actually completely unforgiving.","March 2","true","310.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is infuriating but also fun, A diabolical mixture that these folks at Rogue factor have put together, that shreds my patience while making me want more of the short lived thrill when I overcome some ridiculously  stacked odds.\n\nI definitely recommend getting this game and familiarizing yourself with it.

Graphics and sounds support Warhammer world very well and I like the narrator voices too.\n- "Roguelike" elements (injuries, deaths, no savegames) fit very well into a dark fantasy setting. A couple of injuries to a favourite character gives him/her actually.. more character :)\n- Asymmetrical factions make game more interesting.\n- Many kinds of viable builds for warbands.\n- Meaningful tactical choices in combat.\n\nThe only bad thing I really come up with is the AI - a point that is relevant mostly when playing the single player scenarios. This is what I have to say about it:\n\nIt is a popular complain that the AI REALLY sucks and that it is easy to win games using choke points. And it is true - except when it isn't. The scenarios also start with deployments that try to screw you up, like spreading your warriors alone across the map and enemies rushing towards you and engaging you when you haven't even had the chance to react. So while it's true that the AI is stupid and you can "farm" it, sometimes it's so much opposite that it's unfair (and it's kind of realistic and in the game's genre it is acceptable). And sometimes it's something in between.\n\nI admit it's by far the weakest part of the game - Luckily the game does it's best to minimize the effect.\n\nI haven't played multiplayer yet, but of course there the situation isn't the same.\n\nOverall this game gives me wonderful moments in a grim dark fantasy world.","March 29","true","66.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well it is to Blackguards what the new XCOMs are to the old ones. So it's a 3D tbs. But it's designed to be pretty hardcore from the outset and this actually works because it stops you getting too strong too soon and retains an addictive quality where you just don't want to accept defeat. In this sense, then, it actually has more in common with Blackguards than any other game I can think of. The same moments of feeling absolutely robbed by the RNG and the same crazy difficulty spikes. I can understand why some have downvoted it for this reason because it can be very frustrating and it constantly autosaves so, much like a roguelike, there's no getting around failure with scum saves. I read a few reviews where people criticise the AI but, to be perfectly honest, the fact that you are outnumbered by superior forces 99% of the time means that if the AI were any better you would always be crushed. The warbands are just about different enough to be worth multiple replays and overall it's a very rewarding experience for those who can stick with it. Arguably not worth the full £30 for various reasons but anything £20 or less and you should snap it up immediately.\n\n*edit* Oh it also has pvp but most will likely be too scared to touch it until they have played many hours in campaigns.

While in most games a defeat or setback is manageable, it is possible that a few poor rolls and suddenly your warband's leader is worthless. Some will argue skill has an effect, which it does, but skill cannot prevent you rolling too many misses regardless of how good you believe you are.\n\nIf the computer received similar injuries as you did, that were visible, then things might be different. But unfortunately it's another case where the computer doesn't have to suffer as the player does, which is why I wouldn't recommend this game.","June 5","false","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My friends were interested in Warhammer Fantasy and one of them got the 3rd Edition 40k starter box. I had a look at his White Dwarf magazines and Mordheim jumped out to me. A role playing games based on end-time conspiracy theory set in the WHFB universe. Of course in 1999 we had the whole year 2000 prophesy nuts going beserk.\n\nMy first warband was the Cult of the Possessed, followed by the Witch Hunters. My friends played Skaven, Undead and Orcs, the last of which was released in White Dwarf magazine. My friend who played Skaven let his brother use the mercs from the starter box, and my own brother got the starter box and used mercs as well. On top of this, the table-top club we went to had about half a dozen guys also buy the starter box. In up, we had at least 12 people playing all different warbands every weekend for about 3 years.\n\nAround 2003, I moved away from my home town and stopped table-top gaming for a while. I picked it up again however in 2009 and started playing Mordheim again until 2011. Life was a lot faster and I couldn't play as much as I used to. When I heard about this game coming out, I immediately jumped on board the band wagon because of my teenage passion for it and rekindling the fires of my youth.\n\nNow for the game itself.\n\nI feel that the game could use a little spit and polish to improve a few graphical and sound issues (as well as some dodgy camera angles), but overall this game captures the feeling of playing the tabletop game. The music and visuals are incredibly atmospheric and the turn based nature of the game works well as a translation of the table-top to the PC. Would I change any gameplay elements? Not really. The only real thing i'd like to see added is the ability to play a multiplayer campaign against friends or with jump-in games to mix things up a little bit.","October 22, 2015","true","140.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

My warband was battered during a story mission and I was certain I would lose the battle and pay dearly with tonnes of injuries, probably ending my run as this warband. Instead the Mercenary Ogre who was about to kill the VIP I had to keep alive missed three time in a row against her whilst she was stunned. The level 0 henchman Novice I had with her managed to land a critical hit, stunning the ogre, which led to my spellcaster calling a comet down from the sky and crushing the ogre where he stood, winning the battle for me.\n\nNow, this game is a beta. Like all betas, it comes with the "don't buy if you rage easily at faults only a game can do." Case in point: three quarters of my game time so far has been with my Mercenary Warband. I go into their fourth story mission and the games bugs out, the enemy I was facing never ends its turn, probably a unit I cannot see moving about  endlessly trying to reach one of my guys. I was forced to abandon the mission, and all of my warband was injured. All three of my heroes died, two archers lost their arms and would have to be fired, and my leader became a simpleton. Needless to say, I wasn't too pleased.\n\nDespite this, the game is immensely fun and satisfying if you can get over its rocky starting out phase. The interface tells you nothing on the surface when in-game, requiring you to be out in warband management or to go into a seperate menu to find out what "Righteous Fury" actually does and why it always misses. The payment and treatment system gets in the way a bit too, you will often be forced to fire and replace henchmen and heroes to keep your warband at fighting strength. However this can often be wasteful, the game seems to force you to pay for treatment and upkeep before you can fire any warrior in the warband, which seems utterly bizarre to me.\n\nDespite these negatives, the game shines on premise alone. The way characters are controlled is similar to turn based tactics games like Valkyria Chronicles. With the RPG elements of the tabletop Warhammer Fantasy Battles game, like the original board game was intended to be based around. The amount of customisation, stat variance, spells, skills, weapons, armours and trinkets in the game at present allow you to make your warband however you desire. This makes for some great innovation as people try to find the best possible set ups for your heroes and henchmen, but due to the diverse choice of loadouts, you can very easily counter these "metas" of soldiers should you want to play online.\n\nMultiplayer is not why you will buy this game mind you, the game's AI is not stupid, but can be exploited once you have figured out pathing, who it will target, etc. You will often find times when your spellcaster is near to death and hide them behind a shieldwall of heroes, and the AI will sooner run the length of the map for another attempt at that spellcaster than fight into your men. Ledges and cliffs are often exploitable too. Sisters of Sigmar come with no ranged weapons besides their spells, and the AI will refuse to use shortcuts like climbing and leaping, this results in very easy missions that are labelled "brutal" just because you stacked 5 archers on a cliff and put your captain and hero with a high parry chance in the way of the stairs up, leading to a Turkey shoot for your men.\n\nOverall, I would say this game has btrought me hours of fun already. I've been frustrated with how the game can ♥♥♥♥ you over sometimes, but that's just how these games go. XCOM fans who enjoy the iron man difficulties will find a passioniate love for this game. As it takes XCOM's "lose a man and that's it" style of gameplay and turns it up to eleven, with a whole host of mental and physical injuries that can steal your level 7 Champion from you in the blink of an eye. Needless to say, I do love this game.","November 3, 2015","true","25.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

They nailed the atmosphere of the boardgame/lore!\n\nNow with the addition of the continous campaign/warband!? This is the game I've been dying for!!! I absolutely love the advancement and the customization options. Not to mention the fact that I can take my exhisting band and throw it online against another person and keep all the loot/xp for my single player campaign (and vise versa) not to mention the possibility of losing one of my leaders/followers for good! It's the perfect platform for the RPG and TBS fan!\n\nI'm really enjoying this game now, and with the addition of the campaign I recommend it to anyone whos a fan of tactical turn based and roleplaying games!!!

I've found more bugs and the story missions can be confusing sometimes.  But, the epic feel of survival is great.  I'm not one to complain that I miss a 95% roll.  I don't believe that game is broke or cheats, I believe I just had a bad roll.  I also hit the other day when I had a 7% chance on a shot.  It is random and it happens, but games like this are built that way.  I don't want to know exactly what is going to happen every sword swing that would be pretty dumb.\n\nThe injuries don't bother me.  I don't ever deploy my own troops, I always let the computer deploy them for me.  I like the difficulty.  I have a Human Merc warband and we've struggled and also dominated.  Nothing better then getting smacked around, scrapping together after the fight and going out and deciminating your enemy next time.  Yes you can do that.\n\nThis game is simply fantastic.  There are minor issues here and there and some odd graphic glitches.  But, overall the game requires thought and planning.  But, I think it captures the warhammer world very well and handles the mechanics of the boardgame.\n\nI wish it had multiplayer servers and warbands were stored online for online play.  Some kind of ladder or online campaign would be great as well.\n\nI would buy additional warbands as DLC.  I would also pay for multiplayer.  It is a great merc sim and really has been the kind of game I've been waiting for.\n\nWell done, Well done indeed.\n\n9.0 out of 10.  Would like multiplayer ladders, servers, clans etc...  Also multiplayer campaigns.  I hope this is game is a hit and they look at funding or kickstarting some of those features.  We also need more custom options for faces.  All my guys look the same and that is annoying.  Make it so people can mod.","November 16, 2015","true","78.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Once I booted it up I was blown away at how in-depth the customization, ui, story and gameplay for a $40 game are.. which really is only $32 if you use the right purchasing avenue. There needs to be some tweaks for example I get demolished unless I get super lucky, if I miss more than once in an exchange then I'm dead and I miss more than I hit(80% hit chance 0/4 hits is just hard to accept). I would totally spend another $20 to have more character customization options to have more of a personality to the members of your warband, most of the models look fantastic(except the human faces are plan awful).

So far only 2 warbands, Skaven and human mercenaries, but they will add a lot more over time. Mechanics are fun, graphics and sounds are good. Overall a fun turnbased experience with a very interesting new take on action points, and how they work.\n\nUpdate: With the full release here and 4 warbands instead of two. They added Sisters of Sigmar, a hard-hitting band of religious nutcases Warhammer style as well as adding Cult of the Possessed, which is a Chaos warband, with all that that brings. Mutations, weird way of thinking and just plain barbarism.\n\nWith over 100 hours logged, I have this to say: The game is very unforgiving, and at times extremely frustrating. Very long load times, which seems to be something the company can't fix because of how the game is built. it has a built in anti-rage quitter system, meaning if you quit during any mission or skirmish, it treats it as if the warband got routed and EVERY SINGLE WARRIOR in the fight will have to roll on the injury table to see if they suffer any injury or lose any equipment. This is very harsh, especially for single player where you don't really hurt anyone by abandoning a mission that goes really, really bad (considering the loss of one skilled warrior can set you back around 10 hours of game time). it doesn't help the AI is dumb as bricks, and pathfinding for large units really is an issue. More than once, I see them stuck by a door and just can't move.\n\nStill, even with its flaws this game is very addictive and I stand by my early access opinion, the game is great.","November 21, 2014","true","164.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is also a story line as well but this game isnt story driven.\n-Just an overall fun game imho.  If you are into fantasy-esque, squad turn based tactical combat this game is worth checking out.\n\nCons:\n-This game is hard.  Frustratingly hard.  Its not hard because of ingenous AI.  This games main issue is the fact that the RNG acts strangely.  It appears to be broken -or- coded by the devs for you to intentionally fail.  I tend to think its the 2nd of the two.  Now this isnt always a bad thing BUT be prepared to miss 5 attacks with a 70% chance to hit BUT only when you REALLY need to hit.

I haven't tried my hand in multiplayer yet, mostly because no one ever seems to be on, and I'm not going to wait around for half an hour in matchmaking to play a game. The Ui is a bit clunky, and could really do with some streamlining. It honestly seems like they designed the controls with consoles in mind. Having the ability to tie active skills to hotkeys would be really nice, and better skill navigation in general. Overall though, this game is really enjoyable and its very easy to get caught up in the story of your warband, and there is a lot of room for tactical depth. It is like a renaissance xcom with more options.

Right now you can test the game with preset warbands but there is no campaign and no form of progression whatsoever. Progression is also not slated for the next major update. I'll pick this up again in a few patches when it's a bit more polished. The game currently is quite stable though I find the system of scrolling through abilities one at a time archaic, they should be hotkeyed 1-10 and placed on the bottom the the screen IMO. The map needs a zoom/scroll feature. Right now it is very hard to tell what's where on the map. A legend would also be nice. This game is still fairly early in development and as such I cannot currently reccomend it.","April 13, 2015","false","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

You can loot other players and even die without doing anything wrong? Prepare for banging your head against the monitor, because it would happen...\n\nAt first, i thought that this game could be much better with an isometric view of xcom and the literal translation from the tabletop like bloodbowl... but I think that Rogue didn´t go for the easy, and they did a very good game.\n\nStill a few issues, but this is truly addictive and the developers made a huge leap since early access.\n\nYou want to see your hands shaking?

However, it is an altogether pleasant experience and game. Mordheim: CotD is a turn-based video game adapation of the tabletop Mordheim game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, where the goal is to survive a hellish landscape in order to gather a rare, and dangerous, material known as Wyrdstone, known for its chaotic influence and ability to enhance magic. Being set in the more turbulent era of Warhammer Fantasy history, there is an abundance of weapons to use that are unique, magic with consequences, strict limitations and possible firing zones with ranged weapons (of which there are bows and firearms), and mythical races of characters. While this game does not have all of the races from the older Mordheim, the four chosen are very different and give a very accurate (read: grimdark) feel for the setting.\n\nThe four races in CotD are the Empire Mercenaries, Skaven, Cult of the Possessed, and the Sisters of Sigmar. These races are divided into Warbands, consisting of (as time goes on) one Leader unit, up to three Hero units, one Impressive unit, and five Henchmen units. Following will be a generalization of each race, their purpose, and then a general playstyle (though this game is nearly limitless with how you create your Warband, and how you play them, especially with injuries being added into the mix). Spoilers will be placed for storyline, although only very vague information is given.\nThe Empire Mercenaries are a warband of human mercenaries from the proud coalition of human factions.\nThe Empire Mercenaries are part of the Order alignment, implying good intentions and care for the world.\nThe mercenaries are sent to gather Wyrdstone for their employer. They do not care about his reasons.\nMercenaries generally rely on tankier melee units and higher damage ranged units. Amazing in a team, this warband has issues if separated, for a ranged character is helpless if ambushed in melee, and will die from a few hits, while a melee character lacks the damage to best his opponent, leaving them locked in combat for several turns.The Skaven are a race of greedy and cruel humanoid rat-men, particularly from Clan Eshin, a clan of assassins.\nThe Skaven are part of the Chaos alignment, working for selfish intentions and care little for anybody but themselves.\nThe Skaven warband is attempting to gather Wyrdstone, which they call Warpstone, in order to increase personal prestige among the ranks of the influential Murderlord.\nThe Skaven are low health with high Initiative (order of who goes first per turn) and high damage. They generally rely on quickly swarming an enemy (one of their racial skills, appropriately named Swarm, gives bonuses for every Skaven attacking the same unit) and wiping them out one or two at a time. Lacking any tanks until they get their Impressive rank warrior, they rely on Dodging and Parrying even more than the other races. The Cult of the Possessed are a faction of mutants and chaos warriors with no regard for life at all.\nThe Cult is a Chaos-aligned faction, willing to murder and betray, and even mutate their own bodies, for more power.\nThe Cult is attempting to obtain greater and greater power from an entity known as the Shadowlord, in exchange for Wyrdstone.\nThe Cult is generally a more melee oriented unit, though they have a Magician as their Leader, and rely on overwhelming power to kill their foes. Lots of buffs, decent health, and high damage make them a force to be reckoned with, especially in the scarily narrow streets of Mordheim.The Sisters of Sigmar are a zealous group of religious fanatics, similar to Paladins from other games.\nThe SoS are aligned with Order, hoping to combat evil and to spread the message of their god through face-smashing.\nThe SoS are attempting to gather all of the Wyrdstone simply so that it cannot fall into the hands of evil.\nThe SoS generally rely on powerful and high health units to completely destroy their enemies in combat. However they are slow, and have a very difficult time dealing with multi-level attacks.\nMordheim is a very dangerous place often causing injuries to your Warband ranging from a simple experience loss, to amputation, and death. The game is very unforgiving, and you may make two or three Warbands, having them be crippled and ruined one after the other, until something finally clicks and you surge ahead, destroying your opposition and doing SO good until your main warrior loses an arm, and can no longer use that bow/halberd/shield that you relied on, and you scream into the night, causing dogs to bark, and you fume and pace around your room trying to decide if you should get a new Leader, make a new Warband, or accept the 20% dodge increase from losing an arm, and you just keep rambling and crying and pout... sorry, that hit a little close to home. As a game of incredibly high risk though, the RNG is downright out to get you, and you will often miss attacks you had an 85% chance to hit. Twice. This may seem unfair, however it is more accurately tied to the tabletop game where you'd roll upwards of five die per attack. Yet, even with an AI you swear is cheating, your best warrior being taken down by a stupid ambush that you totally weren't in range of, and RNG causing you to lose your best tank because he missed a 97% parry chance, victory is insanely addicting.\n\nMordheim: CotD, despite being brutal and unfair, is one of the few games I've played in a long time that really made my victories feel hard-fought and well-earned. I'm addicted to finding out what I could do, and could have done, better. 8/10\nTL;DR: Hard game, lots of customization, game literally hates you, you may want to amputate your own limbs (I mean, hey, 20% bonus dodge chance!).

However, expect to get frustrated and absolutely hate this game at times. That said, you might find yourself lucky and absolutely adore this game. The reason why I wrote the love/hate mix is because although this game is a lot of fun, at the start you'll struggle. Then again maybe you won't. You'll experience bugs from time to time, some minor, others major. For example, there's no timer at the moment, or at least there's no timer that I'm aware of. So if the enemy bugs during their phase, you'll find yourself stuck in the game "waiting for your opponent" and you'll be stuck waiting for the B'stard forever untill you decide to leave. Now, you can't leave without taking punishment as if you lost. This happened to me, one of my Warband *party* died, and the other lost his arm (he was my archer!). So because of this bug, a bug which I experienced when I had only just started a game, two of my warband were seriously hurt/killed. Bummer I know.\n\nI haven't had any problems with bugs for a while now, but I'm sure they're waiting for me. I'm also finding the right pace to play at for me. When I first started playing I died a lot, I'd make and break warbands because the game frustrated me. But then I started to think more, plan more. I haven't lost in a while now, sure a few lost hands and broken feet but you can't expect to come out of each game without a scratch.\n\nThis game was hard, is hard, but I'm slowly getting better, stronger, and I'm having much more fun. You might follow this pattern, you might not.\n\n9/10 I would tell my friends to buy this game, but I wouldn't tell that one friend (we all know one) who would tear out his computer and throw it out of a window.

It has many unique winning conditions and the game is unpredictable until it actually ends, crushing the oponent, epic comebacks, fight toe to toe are intheir full meaning. This game requires strategy and planning than unecessary level of micro. It has a good amount of maps and additional winning conditions adding to the main winning condition and also it will gave way more factions than those already in game it will never tire players by being a repeated action with different "skin".

I died almost instantly.\nSo I read some tips in the Internet and also armed with my previous experience... I created a new warband and never lost yet. The game has an AI that you can exploit easily. In fact, just playing it slow and carefully is enough for the AI to not know how to tackle you. It promotes slow movements and usage of the choke points. Anything else is just inviting the punishment it seems (though If someone says I'm not doing it right, I won't object, maybe I didn't figure out other tactics).\nAfter that, it eventually gets repetetive. Shipments feel much more of a chore than fun, but it seems that they are the one thing that forces you to try and explore the map in search of resources.\nOn top of all of that, the game is slow. Yes, it is a turn based game, but it is not slow because you have to think much, it is slow because you click end of turn and wat... And you wait more than you play. And you wait while it loads. It might be not fair to judge the game based on such a thing like this, but in the end - it affects the satisfaction you get from the game.\nVisually... There are not many models to choose from. There are plenty of color skins though, so I am on the fence here. It's ok, but it could have been much better. I think that customization and sticking to your characters with their backstories is the huge strength of the game.\nI see the potential in this game. It could as well turn 6 to 8 out of 10 if it is going to be worked upon. Otherwise, hard to say.","November 30, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This game makes you want to look after your warriors due to the perma death/injury system every decision you make counts. After 60 hours of game play I can say I would defiantly recommend this game to fans of the warhammer universe.\n\nRNG is a huge part of this game I would be lying if I said it did not matter how lucky you are, you will find times when you are about it attack an enemy and all you will be thinking is please hit! Please hit! and…… Swing and a miss! But that’s the game if you can deal with stuff like that you will have a blast.\n\nAnyone who knows what this game is about or even reads up on it should know what they are letting themselves in for it is not a friendly game, but by god once you get into it you don’t want to let go.\n\nI play Skaven it was hard going at first but I love my little warband now, you can even customize the colouring of the armour I mainly use it so I know where my hero’s and leaders are, the weapon rarity and choice leave a little bit to be desired having only 3 tiers of weapon quality. Its fine but I could think of better ways to do it. (not going to go into it in a review) the stats system works well and is easy to understand, the single player campaign is all I have played since release and I can say it works well and is very fun the campaign missions are nice and add a lot more depth into the game.\n\nThe voice actor for the Skaven campaign did a great job, I have not played multiplayer since the release but I did play it during early access, it is just as fun as the single player IMO, a little harder depending on your opponent.\n8.5/10 from me for this game.","November 30, 2015","true","89.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The base combat system is easy enough to grasp (though the keyboard controls feel clunky at times) yet still hints at a lot of depth in gameplay. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do with the single player campaign/warband progression.\nThe game captures the world and atmosphere of Warhammer Fantasy quite well with good character and level models/textures. I did notice that a failed climb-down animation using a Sister parted her torso from her legs a bit and exposed the nothingness inside, but it's early access and that's only a small visual bug.\nThe only gameplay bug I encountered was on the Temple of Sigmar map, skirmishing against AI and playing as the defender in the siege scenario. It took me a few turns to realise what was happening as I had no idea where the AI team was - they were trapped outside and didn't seem capable of getting in (which I think required climbing) so it would have been up to the defender to exit and engage the enemy.\n\nGiven the newness I have no idea how good (or bad) the company is at updating and sticking to schedule etc., so can't comment on that yet. Looking forward to playing more as the updates come. The game is definitely worth keeping an eye on even if you're not interested in playing the early access (which I usually avoid, but I'm a fan of WHFB so I couldn't wait for this).","November 21, 2014","true","55.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

What does this mean to any normal people? The enemy is in three groups? Wrong, the enemy are all initiative 70 skaven clustered in a little group consisting of their entire warband, in sight of after one move, who methodically go around and in 4 on 1 or 5 or 6 vs 2 massacre your men. Meanwhile your strike teams have deployment zones that are too far away to be able to get there to assist before everybody is dead.\n\nSo you put time into building a warband, then have it massacred.

The level load times are what they are, and I can live with them.

If you really want it, wait for a sale. Please note that this game is till being updated, so in the future you could buy it, after bug fixes and the game is more nicely ironed out. (Also note that this review may quickly become outdated. The bugs and other things I complained about may have been fixed.\n\nThe game can be quite glitchy, for instance, one time one of my warriors randomly fell through a floor (Which by the way should not happen) and was stuck underneath a building for the entire game. There are many other glitches as well.\n\nThe game is quite unbalanced, the skaven, for instance, are very unbalanced, instead of adapting the board games way of balancing it they decided to change it. See, the skaven in the board game are very weak and dull, but they come in great numbers. In the game however, they are very strong and almost impossible to hit. They have little health, but hit stronger than the sisters of sigmar, and your lucky to hit them.\n\nOh yeah, and the game is based entirely on chance.\n\nI also feel that some of the impressives should be stronger, specifically the Sisters of Sigmars impressive. She's pathetic. I got into a map and I saw a skaven players rat ogre. So, I charged her at it because it was exposed and there were no skaven near by. Then she missed all of her attacks, and was killed in two turns by the rat ogre with help from another skaven who ran across the entire map, because, oh right, the skaven are also incredibly fast.\n\nIf you want to win multiplayer battles, just play as the skaven!\n\nJust to clarify, I like this game, but it should still be in early access. This game is just so broken and needs lots of fixes and patches. The price tag is ridiculous considering how broken this game is, if it were in early access it could be excused.

It is simply issued as a means to excuse an appallingly negligent hi-lo RNG that is geared simply for that - you will fail an abundance of reasonable rolls because this lazy-♥♥♥♥ programming has been PR'd as hardcore.  ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ more like.\n\nToo many issues that still need fixing and I mean from the ground up, ambush, overwatch, dodge, placement etc etc (even picking up wierdstone, which is kind of currency, it auto selects to pick up the smallest quantity first, when there are more than one in your area.  COME ON!).\n\nWith a game with such a small catchment bracket, (I had never heard of this and bought it because I like the Dawn of War series) its further expansion from its original hardcore fans would require it to be successful in the combat, strategy stakes.  It fails so badly with one of the worst RNGs I think I've seen and that's after a recent RNG 'revamp'!!!\n\n\n3/10  and that is only because the baroque scenery and sound effects are, admittedly, very good but that's of little consolation.\n\n20.12.16  I have given this game a really good go and I'd take a refund in a heatbeat.  I wouldn't listen to any of the gaming review websites who have given this a score over 5, they either haven't played it, are drunk in the workplace or are the worst kind of chums.  This is ♥♥♥♥ing dire and is uninstalled (slap to the face).  A real shame as the underlying concept looks to be pretty good.  GW do this for a living, not sure if Rogue Fuctor can be accused of doing the same.\n\n10.02.16 Tried it again, after the recent patch and I take it all back. This game is a game of a winner. Winners who should offer a refund. I will grudgingly accept.  Seriously give me a ♥♥♥♥ing refund, you ♥♥♥♥ programmers.\n\n18.02.16  Tried it again, again, after apparently another rng tweak after some amateurish programming started killing saved games.  One plus before I get into it - the map has improved and although it's not for most I like the unique method (if you zoom in, you can tell the levels you are looking for for a shooting point etc).\n\nNow, giving the opposition lesser weapons is not an rng tweak it's just lazy amateur ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, built by a business that put all it's accumulative intellect into the business name.  One glaring problem from the very start is that when you fail an All Alone test,  you will run and get chopped down, when the AI fails they skip a turn.  Just so laughably ♥♥♥♥.  Everything I've said already about this farce holds true.  This game is dead in the water and the programmers have nobody but themselves to blame.  I've a feeling it's only going to get worse for them, silly little people.\n\nThey've even brought out DLC for this s#hit.  Talk about delusions of grandeur.\n\nMake a game people willl want to play, make sure it works, make sure it isn't a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, give it difficulty levels so that people can play at their own pace, give it saved game so people can reload instead of having to restart and give it an ironman setting (although Xcom is still too buggy for that and this is far, far worse).  Don't, DON'T ♥♥♥♥ on the punters' tents and tell them it's raining with this hardcore ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, when you're too ♥♥♥♥ing lazy to put a decent RNG together.  If you can do the above then you may last.  If you can't - find another ♥♥♥♥ing job, one that you're actually good at and give me a ♥♥♥♥ing refund so I can get this ♥♥♥♥ off my library.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of flaky RNGs of late (this, the god awful Shadowrun series and Blackguards), all TBS and all being simularly criticised for just ♥♥♥♥ poor RNGs.  Is there a market to buy RNGs so you don't have to dev them yourself?\n\nIf so then these 'devs' really need to check what they're buying because such poor RNGs and subsequently poor games (as the RNG is the most important component of a TBS, where relevant) can kill a studio, before it's even got off the ground.","December 18, 2015","false","314.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This is not a "broken" game. It is a game that is extremely poor by design. It will not "get fixed". Will highlight some of the -obvious and terribly cynical- design decisions taken, in order to artificially lengthen the game as well as creating a need for "DLC investment". The importance of the latter in the game's "strategy" became very apparent with their recent launch of laughable content (two extra options for characters - paid).\n\nThere are many shortcomings but the following are the highlights:\n\n- The combat design is ridiculous. The whole concept of side objectives (which are necessary to meet to have any chance of progressing through the game, as the rewards are intentionally pitiful) is awful. Makes sense from the developers' point of view though. This is a game where the only plausible strategy is to keep formation and gang up on enemies (1:1 you will die most of the time. Outnumbered you will die almost every time - levelling up does not help; see below). The side objectives are aimed at just one thing: Preventing you to keep formation and ganging up on enemies. You basically only have two options. Go after side objectives and fall to statistics (hugely abused by this game, as a "bonus"), or win battles and get next to no rewards - so lose on the "strategy map".\n\nThe whole loot system as utterly attrocious. Everything about it (when you can collect it, the fact that you essentially lose most of it when you win, the storage system etc). It is all aimed at one thing: Destroying rewards so you stay longer in the game, particularly through the crappy "veteran system".\n\n- Strategic progression and the "veteran system". This is where your warband progresses, in a poor excuse of what Mordheim is supposed to be. Coupled with the "Veteran system", which is supposed to earn and track rewards from multiple warbands fielded by the player over the course of "playing" this game. Neither works.\n\nSkills are so incredibly expensive that you cannot pay for them, as the rewards are too puny. You will watch your warband's characters accumulate skill points that you cannot afford to spend. There is a work around here, which is obviously intentional. Kill enough warbands, waste enough time mindlessly, and you will sllllllooooooooowwwwwllllyyy inch up the veteran system's ranks. One of the "benefits" is that it lowers costs and increases starting gold for warbands. See what they did there? That's an example of how the game is artificially lengthened, without any challenge or reason to engage in it.\n\nUntil you get to that sweet spot (which requires many, many hours of extremely boring grinding and killing warbands), you actually get PUNISHED for levelling up. Whenever you are matched with an enemy warband, it is roughly scaled to yours. However, their characters, of any given level, come complete with the skills you never afforded for yours. With every level you add to your characters, they get markedly worse than their upskilled opponents of same "rank". Clever.\n\n- It has been a long time since I have seen a game that so cynically and obviously rigs the dice throws. It is getting a bit of a reputation for this and it is actually well deserved (Which is not the case in most incidences when this accusation is levelled at a game). Yes, I know how statistics work, yes, I know about the law of large numbers and, no, I am not "impressed" by some fluke throws that did not go my way. I am a 40+ post grad engineer; not a frustrated teen. Will not go into great length of what I tracked and for how long (it would mark me as OCD if I did). Believe me or not, but what they did is just stunning. It is now actually easier to track as (obviously in response to the aforementioned reputation), you can see the modifiers for each "roll". The transparency has made the rigging even more obvious and easier to measure.\n\nThis old staple of lazy and cynical programming is usually nothing more than a nuisance - another artificial way of increasing difficulty and lengthening the game (both very important to marketers, in the age of DLC). Basically, it usually means save-scumming or pay for extra "power" to overcome the handicap. In a game with permadeath it is a complete dealbreaker.\n\nCould add considerably to the list. Overall, a highly negative experience and a huge let down for a Games Workshop and Mordheim hobbyist who paid for this piece of junk from pre-release (an extremely rare choice for me - at least it taught me a lesson).","February 9","false","95.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","3"

Main objective is always to beat the opponents warband or make them rout before you lose or rout)\n\n-> Wyrdstone Rush where you collect typically 45% - 60% of the wyrdstone in the map to complete the OPTIONAL      objective\n\n-> Marked for death where you have certain targets from the other warband normally between 1 and 3 specific people you need to kill and take an insigna from\n\n-> Crush their will where you are tasked with retrieving the opponents idol and bring it back to your own cart\n\nI completely understand why some people would consider this a too small amount of missions even though i am completely fine with them.\n\n\nPositive:\n\n- They have done a great job at making your warband feel like they matter giving you that classic fear of someone getting killed or sustaining a permanent injure like an arm or a leg that has been severed.\n\n- The insane number of different abilities both passive and active you can gain through the lvl up system\n\n- The ability to equip your mercenaries with different weapons and armor to suit your playstyle not to mention the rarity difference from common to epic quality\n\n- The depth they have put into the lvling. You are able to lvl up your warband, your mercenaries and give them stat ups, the different wyrdstone collecters and you can in a way lvl up the game with their veteran system.\nSome of these make very little difference but make a nice surprise sometimes while others will be looked at as a goal to obtain after 1 - 2 missions\n\n\nSummary:\n\nI think the game has things to work on and i completely understand some of the concerns some might have but the most importent thing to me is the fact that the game runs well and provides a lot of things to do when you are not on a mission and a great tactical experience when you are in a mission.\n\nIt is very easy to look at the game at first and think of it as unforgiving and very hard but once you get the hang of it the game becomes very interesting and i will absolutely recommend this game.\n","December 17, 2015","true","66.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The AI in this game does odd moves, ignores objectives, stares at walls, yet will B Line to your weakest guy and try and swarm him with no regard for the battle. It does this to simply inflict permanent damage on your warband, while its crew are just randoms that are totaly expendable. The Overwatch melee stance works sometimes, other times enemy stroll past without a care, only to somehow stun their target with a damn knife ?  You will never get a charge off on an overwatched enemy, the tiny split second between the charge option showing and the enemy counter charging you is about half a second.\nThe skill tree in this game costs so much yet delivers mostly marginal effects, maybe a %5 increase onto an ability. Only to see your investment wasted when your guy ends up with a headwound that turns him into a potato. Replacement guys are vastly overpriced for a measly 1 or 2 level character, and because they are the weakest , will be targeted by the AI and go down faster then a crack ♥♥♥♥♥ . There are hardly any decent items found as loot, or for sale, so dont count on outfitting a new guy to the max.\nYet this games most offensive, and just plain insulting aspect is its totaly broken and deceptive Random Number Generator. Stare in disbelief as attack after attack at %95 misses (not parried or dodged). Gaze in awe as the AI lands powershot after powershot on your warbands leader who had a %80 dodge enabled. From what I have observed in 300 hours of game on several accounts, the AI gets a %25 bonus and you get a %25 penalty.\nSo go through mission after mission of danger, builld your followers up, only to watch them die . There is no end point to this game,it just grinds you down. Win 100 battles yet in 1 bad battle where the AI pulls ♥♥♥♥ from its ♥♥♥♥ and stuns on near every hit, and your main guys end up with game ending wounds.\nWish a decent company had worked on this game, instead of this pile of ♥♥♥♥ brick muppets.

Therefore all the 9.6 hours ive put in is now in vain as I cant progress any further.\nOn a plus note, I haven’t experienced any frustrations with the RNG.\nI couldn’t recommend this to anybody because it really feels like you are playing a game that has no real objective, the character customisation is fairly pants to be honest, there are also only a handful of weapons. How many different pieces of armour would you expect in an RPG with ‘deep character customisation’? I would say at least 20, perhaps more? In Mordheim there are 2, light armour and heavy armour.

The game as a whole works well though, and it's got enough content to keep you occupied for many hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightfighter17/recommended/276810/","nightfighter17","nightfighter17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightfighter17/","29 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI purchased the early access game on Halloween after reading some pretty great sounding reviews. Just a little bit of background I don't write reviews on video games EVER as I haven't found any that stand out to me enough to warrant a review (please note I'm 21 and have been gaming since I was about 6). I am a fan of strategy games such as xcom, civ 5, galactic civ, Dawn of War 1 & 2. Mordheim as an early access game has already managed to push them out of my mind. It is challenging but not ridiculously like dark souls (which is important as at that level of challenging the game is no longer fun). I find myself attached to the characters on my team and worrying way more than I should about my characters surviving.\n\nThe things I love about this game\n- Warband team style play offers customization for play style ergo you can use 1 hand weapons, 2 hand weapons, archers, magic all to your play style\n- 2 resources gold and wyrdstones which can make for some extra complexity as you have to ensure you have enough of both otherwise you'll tick someone off (not enough gold and you can't pay for treatments or pay your soldiers not enough wyrdstones and you won't be able to make your quota to your employer)\n- Have yet to find any really overpowered units. using 1 hand weapons for example you lose damage if you compare it to a 2 hand weapon but you gain dodge chance or you can equip a shield and be able to parry.\n- Magic abilities have the chance to backfire or curse characters as you use it so you can't train your mage up to be as ***kicker and use him to kill the whole enemy team (atleast from what I've seen so far).\n- It's only early access which means they are actually looking at reviews and bugs and game suggestions and actually fixing them and modifying the game so it can only go up from here!\n\nThings that I feel should be addressed\n- I say addressed as it's in early access still so most of these are just things that need to be tweaked as they're still working on the game.\n- the percentages for tasks appear a little skewed to me. what I mean is I'll have a 75 percent chance to hit someone I'll attack them 4 times and miss all 4 times. This get's a little irritating when you have your havy hitter who has a big 2 handed weapons that does but loads of damage but can only attack once per turn and he constantly misses. Or when you are trying to climb a wall and you have a 70 percent chance and you use all of your moves falling and injuring your character who is wearing cloth armor and is an archer (near killed him doing this).\nIf you ask me archers are a little underpowered making them reload was a good check and balance however they do very little damage and can only attack once per turn (keep in mind they're just hitting the first skill point for me so I may be able to upgrade them down the road to be better)\n\nErgo just off of the campaign to the first act this game is awesome!

Gameplay is good, game speed needs refining but I am sure the developers will iron things out as they continually make well thought out improvements.  Really impressed so far and am happy to have parted with my cash.  Character development is also fun - you may find that the peg leg, one eyed survivor of many a nightmarish encounter will still be in your team long after he may have wanted to retire.....\n\nI think this is worth a blast, but be prepared to have plenty of time to complete some of the main campaign missions as no saves in game (at least that I could find) mean a long session unless you want to force your team to retreat in order to turn the computer off and get on with real life!","November 5, 2015","true","265.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Characters will have to make all alone checks even though there are friendly characters 2 ft. away from other friendly characters.\n2. stupidity checks from skull fractures completely destroys a chrarcter's usefullness. my warlock has a 14 intellegence, is lucky to pass a stupidity check 20% of the time. tone down the difficulty of the checks.\n3. exiting the game causes the match to be a rout and all of your characters take injuries. ive had it where i had to exit the game because the game crashed and when i turned it back on, 3 of my guys had missing arms. i shouldnt be punished for having to turn off the game. i realize that the devs dont want players to exit the game when their warband is being beat, but there are better ways. XCOM EU had the ironman mode. the game would save whenever a action is completed. that way players couldnt just go back and redo past actions.\n4. Blue items get lost on characters way too often. i beat a warband decisively and only had 1 casualty. the captain comes back without injury BUT somewhere along the lines, he lost his blue shield, sword and helmet. thats insane. blue items seem to get lost more than white items. maybe its just me overreacting, but those blue items are insanely useful when it comes to fighting stronger warbands or doing story missions. losing them with the frequency as I have can have terrible effects in the long run. i dont want there to be no chance of dropping them, just a little lower chance of it. maybe add in a perk that makes it impossible (or extremely unlikely) for them to drop a designated item?\n5. Not being ablr to leap across a gap because there is a enemy 1 story below you. i dont think this was intentional. probably just a glitch.\n\nI really REALLY like the game, but its a really frustrating game. A lot of it comes from the RNG, but thats just the nature of the game. i really hope that the devs listen to the players and tweak the game for the better.","November 5, 2015","true","40.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I feel obligated to also help put down some criticisms that I've been seeing on the forums. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, this game is a PORT OF THE ORIGINAL MORDHEIM game from tabletop fantasy warhammer. This game is made by mordheim fans FOR mordheim fans. The reason that there are bubbles around the characters is because of Movement Bases. The reason that you cannot loot everything on the map after youve won is because you couldnt loot everything on the table after youve won. If you want to do that then youll have to cripple the other warband and hope they dont route. The reason that there are only 4 warbands is because ........ you guessed it, in the original Mordheim there were only 4 warbands. Human, Sisters of Sigmar, Skaven, and Chaos. There were other warbands created by the community, but nothing official by games workshop. Ive been playing Mordheim for over 16 years off and on and I find todays gamers to be quite spoiled and childish with some of these complaints on the forums.

I love a tactics game that allows for random non-story line missions that can be done as often as desired! The game is challenging and you are just as likely to take a loss as you are to push through to victory! I highly recommend this game and am so looking forward to more to come!\n\nUPDATE 11/21/15\n\n100hrs into the game and I still love it just as much as I did at hour 1. I have already suggested this game to many of my friends. As a turn-based rpg fanatic I love the way the game plays and the unique abilities for each warband. The permanent injury system is a nice touch, if not heart breaking at times (your star hero gets swarmed by skaven and ends up losing an arm). The maps are great, have a very Mordheim feel to them and pleasing to the eye. Some suggested improvements:\n\n*In-battle equip system. On the occasion I've accidentally sent my warband in and my warrior only has a dagger after getting robbed the last battle. After killing a rival, I can put a sword in my backpack but not simply hold it in my mainhand. I'd even be cool with the action costing strategy points to equip, etc.\n\n*Skills are way too expensive for the amount of gold you are able to make. I literally have an entire roster of warriors with 2-4 skill points because I simply cannot afford to pay for all of them to skill up and still meet the constant demands for wyrdstone shipments. Average low skill is 95 gold (and I have the scholar veteran skill too), the higher level skills range to upwards of 280-300 gold. Even after completing a 259lb wyrdstone shipment I'm only able to pay for two or three skills before I'm in danger of not being able to pay for treatments, equipment loss, and upkeep. I suggest perhaps a separate currency system for skills? or a lowering of their price, or an increase in wyrdstone shipment payouts? Or maybe even just dropping the gold cost as you already require skill points themselves?\n\n*Wyrdstone shipments come at regular intervals with increasing amount required and it is a great idea. It gives you a huge reason to harvest the pesky green crystals. However, the demand is a bit strenuous. It would be a lot easier to pay for skill upgrades and my warband in general if the demands weren't so constant. I love the system, but maybe a reprieve between shipments would help tremendously? Sometimes being able to send small shipments to one of the side smugglers helps out a lot, but then in doing so puts me behind the 8-ball on the next demand that comes within a day or two of the last completed.\n\nLove the game, keep up the good work. I've got three open games going so I need to get back to my mercenaries. Look forward to updates and hopefully more warbands. (I'm looking at you Dwarves, Undead, Orks, elves (both kind), Witch Hunters, and *hopefully* lizardmen.)","February 4, 2015","true","111.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Although my Ogre and leader pushed back the Sisters of Sigmar, I feared I would have to gather wyrdstone without the Warlocks for a while, but they both ended up with mental scars... Megalomania, meaning they could not cast spells ever again. An unrecoverable psychological illness, they might as well have died in the service of the empire, so I sent them into an early retirement.\n\nMaking matters worse, this could be the end of my warband. With a pressing wyrdstone shipment deadline and not enough good men left to survive an encounter with the wandering demons, recovering resources to hire good men is out of the question while I muster up the courage to drag inexperienced henchmen into battle, training them up from scratch.\n\nThis story is why Mordheim has potential -- I cannot wait to lead other bands of warriors into battle, but I would like to bring a medic for long-term treatment of the most insidious afflictions.","November 6, 2015","true","69.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a little bit of background I don't write reviews on video games EVER as I haven't found any that stand out to me enough to warrant a review (please note I'm 21 and have been gaming since I was about 6). I am a fan of strategy games such as xcom, civ 5, galactic civ, Dawn of War 1 & 2. Mordheim as an early access game has already managed to push them out of my mind. It is challenging but not ridiculously like dark souls (which is important as at that level of challenging the game is no longer fun). I find myself attached to the characters on my team and worrying way more than I should about my characters surviving.\n\nThe things I love about this game\n- Warband team style play offers customization for play style ergo you can use 1 hand weapons, 2 hand weapons, archers, magic all to your play style\n- 2 resources gold and wyrdstones which can make for some extra complexity as you have to ensure you have enough of both otherwise you'll tick someone off (not enough gold and you can't pay for treatments or pay your soldiers not enough wyrdstones and you won't be able to make your quota to your employer)\n- Have yet to find any really overpowered units. using 1 hand weapons for example you lose damage if you compare it to a 2 hand weapon but you gain dodge chance or you can equip a shield and be able to parry.\n- Magic abilities have the chance to backfire or curse characters as you use it so you can't train your mage up to be as ***kicker and use him to kill the whole enemy team (atleast from what I've seen so far).\n- It's only early access which means they are actually looking at reviews and bugs and game suggestions and actually fixing them and modifying the game so it can only go up from here!\n\nThings that I feel should be addressed\n- I say addressed as it's in early access still so most of these are just things that need to be tweaked as they're still working on the game.\n- the percentages for tasks appear a little skewed to me. what I mean is I'll have a 75 percent chance to hit someone I'll attack them 4 times and miss all 4 times. This get's a little irritating when you have your havy hitter who has a big 2 handed weapons that does but loads of damage but can only attack once per turn and he constantly misses. Or when you are trying to climb a wall and you have a 70 percent chance and you use all of your moves falling and injuring your character who is wearing cloth armor and is an archer (near killed him doing this).\nIf you ask me archers are a little underpowered making them reload was a good check and balance however they do very little damage and can only attack once per turn (keep in mind they're just hitting the first skill point for me so I may be able to upgrade them down the road to be better)\n\nErgo just off of the campaign to the first act this game is awesome!

I love a tactics game that allows for random non-story line missions that can be done as often as desired! The game is challenging and you are just as likely to take a loss as you are to push through to victory! I highly recommend this game and am so looking forward to more to come!\n\nUPDATE 11/21/15\n\n100hrs into the game and I still love it just as much as I did at hour 1. I have already suggested this game to many of my friends. As a turn-based rpg fanatic I love the way the game plays and the unique abilities for each warband. The permanent injury system is a nice touch, if not heart breaking at times (your star hero gets swarmed by skaven and ends up losing an arm). The maps are great, have a very Mordheim feel to them and pleasing to the eye. Some suggested improvements:\n\n*In-battle equip system. On the occasion I've accidentally sent my warband in and my warrior only has a dagger after getting robbed the last battle. After killing a rival, I can put a sword in my backpack but not simply hold it in my mainhand. I'd even be cool with the action costing strategy points to equip, etc.\n\n*Skills are way too expensive for the amount of gold you are able to make. I literally have an entire roster of warriors with 2-4 skill points because I simply cannot afford to pay for all of them to skill up and still meet the constant demands for wyrdstone shipments. Average low skill is 95 gold (and I have the scholar veteran skill too), the higher level skills range to upwards of 280-300 gold. Even after completing a 259lb wyrdstone shipment I'm only able to pay for two or three skills before I'm in danger of not being able to pay for treatments, equipment loss, and upkeep. I suggest perhaps a separate currency system for skills? or a lowering of their price, or an increase in wyrdstone shipment payouts? Or maybe even just dropping the gold cost as you already require skill points themselves?\n\n*Wyrdstone shipments come at regular intervals with increasing amount required and it is a great idea. It gives you a huge reason to harvest the pesky green crystals. However, the demand is a bit strenuous. It would be a lot easier to pay for skill upgrades and my warband in general if the demands weren't so constant. I love the system, but maybe a reprieve between shipments would help tremendously? Sometimes being able to send small shipments to one of the side smugglers helps out a lot, but then in doing so puts me behind the 8-ball on the next demand that comes within a day or two of the last completed.\n\nLove the game, keep up the good work. I've got three open games going so I need to get back to my mercenaries. Look forward to updates and hopefully more warbands. (I'm looking at you Dwarves, Undead, Orks, elves (both kind), Witch Hunters, and *hopefully* lizardmen.)","February 4, 2015","true","111.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Skaven can absolutely destroy you if you let your people stray too far away.  Highly recommand this game.

This game is brutal.  You cannot save or reload.  Everything that happens is permanent.  Your dual wielding commander loses an arm?  Tough break.  There is no way to go back before he lost an arm and redo things.  This warning is immediately followed by another - the game is ruled by dice rolls.  You can do everything correctly and still have your 84%-chance-to-hit killing blow miss three times in a row.  In those moments, you will hate this game.  The devil is in the dice, my friends.\n\nMordheim is based off of a tabletop game that I never played.  I just jumped right into this after seeing some youtube videos of it.  And I can say this - at least some of the reviewers who give this game negative reviews came here to rage-review after RNGesus abandoned them to their fates.  And it is incredibly rage-inducing.  But that is part of the allure of the game.  Eventually your warband WILL die, and after a point, that will only happen thanks to bad luck.  Accept it, embrace it, or don't waste your money.\n\nThe game is a dark, gritty, terrifying foray into a devastated city to recover magical space debris for your master of choice.  The plot serves mainly as a backdrop to the gameplay, which is unforgiving until you get the hang of it.  You make a group of fighters, take them on missions, try to accomplish any side objectives while killing the other guys, and if you're lucky, make it back with everyone alive and mostly intact.  Then you pay your guys, buy some better stuff, hire some replacement guys, and go back out again.  Every mission is a nail-biter because of just how much can go wrong.\n\nIt's fun.  For me, that's the selling point.  They nailed turn-based tactical gameplay.  Luck plays a role, but clever tactics play a much bigger role, and oftentimes you can make inferior numbers win through strategy.  They used the permanency mechanic to make it high-stakes, and I love it.  Sometimes the dice betray you, and sometimes they save you.  If you can get past that, then you'll likely find the same thing I did - a game you can keep playing for hours and hours on end.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended, but understand what you're buying - this game is not for the faint of heart.","March 4","true","67.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Raising troops from rookies isn't part of this game. If a unit dies or becomes a liability, hiring a pre-levelled units is the only real option to replace. Anything but early game, rookies will be targetted and easily killed by any enemy. Take this as you will.)\n\nEarly on, it is very, very unforgiving. Against the AI, 'fair' fights are suicidal. They are better than your troops. Routs come early (maybe not so early with Sisters) and without the skills and gear from progression its very luck-based.\n\nMid-game (warband rank ~ 5-7) is a bit better, you have the gear and (hopefully) some skills that will synergise. A hero or leader miiiight be able to fight one on one with an enemy unit.\n\nLate-game, its either very easy, or utterly painful, since RNG effects are pretty extreme (massive crits mostly).\n\nEnemy scales to your warband rating and rank, difficulty is mission based (changes the rating of the enemy warband up with higher difficulties). The design seems to be that you'll always have a challenge. Doesn't really work out.\nAI is fairly suicidal, enemy warbands are random genned for the mission. How their stats are allocated, present injuries and their equipment is also mostly random (seems to be skewed based on race). This is what makes the mid-late game easier, as your warbands are hopefully designed to a plan. Difficulty adds health and damage % bonuses to enemy troops.\n\nAs your warband ranks up, you get more money (from selling enemy enchanted gear, which they get to match your rating). More enchanted gear on your troops = more on enemies, so more cash.\n\nRandom gen missions, especially later on, are very grindy due to enemy health bonuses.  Damage bonuses mean armour isn't very useful (its % reduction), parry/dodge is better. Healing in-combat is essentially non-existant (rare consumable, provides little health). Most consumables are either useless or have minor effects that you could do without.\n\nThis is a game about numbers. Small numbers adding up to hopefully have a noticable effect together. It is fun, once you get used to the mechanics and maps, but does often become tedious. Combat does tend to become drawn out and limited animations don't help.\n\nA huge amount of the game is at the mercy of the RNG (...basically anything but movement essentially). This is, however, popular in some circles. I have noticed that the RNG isn't completely random though, it does often have a tendency to roll high or low and rarely in between, but this might be personal effect and not affect everyone.\n\nTL;DR, not a bad game, fun, not for everyone, but does become quite boring later on.","March 4","true","149.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it for half price, 20 down from 40. Im not sure Id recommend it at full price but its worth getting for a bit less. As most other people have mentioned, the game is difficult. If you like a game with plenty of tactical thinking and no save scumming this is for you. A lot of people complaining about the rng aspect of it being broken, but as with the xcom games, if you are careful and tactical, you will rarely ever lose a battle... The 4 factions are nice and distinct, the chaos faction and the skaven are great. I would recommend starting with one of the 2 human factions til you find your feet as they are a bit easier to get and a bit more straightforward.

With that out of the way, I can say comfortably that there is a lot of fun to be had with this title. With fun, tactical gameplay that challenges as much as it excites, Mordheim is a game that will both enthrall you when things are going just right, and frustrate you to the point of your bowels releasing when you realize that there is no turning back as the game has it's way with you. Thanks RNGesus for both the strengths and overwhelming weaknesses that you've bestowed upon my digital self worth.... Anyway, as I was saying, if you are looking for a perfect game, this is not it. What you are buying is a game that you develop a relationship with and hope that the devs improve the technical aspect of things, which they have in the past. If you've played this game and liked it, please give it a thumbs up to show others that there is something worth playing here. If you hated it, try writing something that is constructive and could help both the devs and the game's community out. Thanks for reading this and good luck seeking out that experience that suites whatever it is you're looking for.

It's tactical and relies on strategy and wit, but luck plays an important part, and it may not always be on your side. But if you're up for a gamble, then there's no denying it; Mordheim is one of my all-time favourite turn-based tactical rpg's.\n\nMaking good use of the Games Workshop franchise in terms of atmosphere and looks, the devs managed to create an extremely addictive and engaging game, which will gradually suck you in until there's no getting out. It's great fun to level up your soldiers and unlock skills that will offer whole new ways of approaching each match.\n\nIf you're a fan of games like X-Com, know that Mordheim does share a few similarities, but it's also very unique. It's much less forgiving of your mistakes, but it also feels much more rewarding when you are successful, as it really puts you to the test. If you're not afraid of trial & error, and occasionally getting your behind slapped by Lady Luck, then don't think twice and dive right in - this game is totally worth it.","March 21","true","195.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Potential.\nPlaying is smooth, friendly, highly enjoyable experience that is wow much fun, designs and graphics look amazing!\nAll the content and stuff that is so far just promised will turn this into a shiny, beautiful gem that you will love polishing with your bleeding, aching, hateful eyes when your favorite character dies with an unifinished "WHAT THE FUUUUUU...." on his lips when a single Skaven rapes him with a rusty shank.\nAnd then you will start again, forever unbroken circle of suffering and happiness, as Nurgle commanded.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nUPDATE 10.10.2015\n\nVince, mate, you should get a raise for these sick social engineering skills.\nI gave it another fair 10 hours and I love it. And I'll do another solid 24 during this weekend, and the next.... And every other after.\nAs stated in my review that was played in Alpha, where nothing was yet added, but you could clearly see the potential guys in Rogue were building on. You (or at least me) could see options in different weapons and armors with different features, skills active/passive, spells, 3 type of skills in 3 neat categories, combat strategies and approaches/specialisations, mountains of effects changing the bloody tide of the combat, masterfuly complex truly 3-dimensional maps created with story-telling depth, characters in detail designed with solo customisation panel with about 20 clothing slots. There is just so much of it, yet all strangely familiar and intuitive, so the complexity is clearly seen and not overwhelming.\nNothing of this was in Alpha. Until Vince poked me to give it a try....\nAnd all of these features are now in game. I have a dude that got hit to the head and sometimes forgets to take initiative, so he passes the turn. I have a crazy sigmar mother, that studied and trained in the rituals of Sigmar, but after a fight with one skaven got megalomaniac psychosis, so she can't cast spells or use ranged weapons. Now, just looks DEATH straight in the eye. Oh, the stories they used to say at the bonfire...All before bunch of mercenaries burned my whole core and I had to look for a completely new group. And you know what? It was amazing! Not because I enjoyed seeing them grow crippled, blind, when contemplating to fire them from the warband, but stupidly enough didn't. It was we also shared powerful and amazing moments that bonded me with  characters as a true RPG should. Progression is fast enough to enjoy it, options are endless and one well used skill or spellcan turn the tight of the battle.\nFor all of you graphic and sound freaks, you will enjoy the whole environment as the game runs with smooth FPS, computer cold and imho generally very well polished and optimalised. Music is well composed and doesn't get old fast, very nice ambient and effect sounds, especially grunts, screams and curses :D It's hard to not compare it to so many games, but anyone who likes small character group RPG with posibility to play agains your friends and never want to speak to them again....And you will play this over and over. As I expected and as was foreseen by Lord of the Underwold - Morr: This is an amazing ducking gem. I'm forcing all my friends to buy it, so I can kick their asses. Buy this game and fight me too maggots, Nurgle will have your corpes!\nIf you wanted to hear some if, but and maybe, this is the part. Sometimes, just sometimes camera watches from very bad angle and during movement, skills and spells it is fixed in an animation. It can get annoying, but when the animation takes over you already commited to the action, so there is no harm done. Nothing bad. So far thats the only thing I noticed and somehow touched my gameplay. Nasty rolls and deaths not inculed :D I hope Rogue doesn't stop and continue to their players, as this very "article" prooves they are focusing their attention on us and our needs and suggestions.\nIn this, I would the love option of battles, where 4-5 friends form one warband from their allstars against another team of players. Suppose ladders, ratings and PVP leagues are just a question of time. I already love the "one more game" feeling :P\n\nTL:DR;  Easy to play, hard to win. Amazing turn-based RPG game with depth that is intuitive, looks and runs very nice. It's not for normies, difficulty drives you crazy, it's like in good old times: harcore - but you feel great when you win.

(16gb gpu, 32gb ram, 4.8ghz i7... TEST ME BABY)\n\nMulti layer gaming top! Fight from the sewers or the heights of ruined buildings sniping off your enemy.

I'd add a forrest and mountain maps and maybe a big scale more open map, where multiple warbands can add up to a battle type scenerio rather than a skirmish.\n3) More interactive warband mangement, fighter improvements and warband ratings on top of the player ratings.\n4) An online leaderboard of best players and with what warbands.\n\nLike I say, great core of a game.

The atmosphere is gritty, the graphics are great. Once everything is added, which doesnt look like it will be long, such as character progression, items, campaigns its truley going to be an amazing game.\n\nI only played the table top version a couple times but this looks like it will be a great port from tabletop to video game.\n\nIt has a few niggely bugs, mostly camera bugs (looking at walls etc) but towards the end of my first game I suffered a bit of packet loss and the game never recovered and i had to end process\n\nUpdate:\nI've played a couple more games with a friend and its still great fun but also frustrating. Although you dont see any "dice rolls" you still fail at times and can do nothing but condemn RNGesus.\n\nSince they have released the warbands compendium which has explained a couple of things to me I finally managed to get ahead in a game as the Skaven. I'm ahead on kills. All my monstrous creature needs to do is kill the mercenery leader and his buddy. First turn he fails his stupidity check, the next turn he misses all 3 84% attacks and promptly gets ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped in the face. It was a total turn around.\n\nThe whole line of sight system and ambush moves works really well. Watching my opponent walk into 2 tanged overwatch skavens and a melee is too satisfying. A perfectly executed ambush. I cant wait for the progression and loot system to be introduced.\n\nAnother bug: My rat ogre was able to walk into a building through the doorway (just) but once he was in, he wasnt getting out :(","November 23, 2014","true","25.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The turn-based action in this game really brings to life the strategy that was such a part of the game in its tabletop format. The game is not without its issues and bugs, it is still in early release, but I am very excited to see how this unfolds. So far, there are only two playable warbands and you have no customization available, however, in the tutorial two other warbands are revealed and the potential behind the campaign customization is viewable. I am curious to know how they will balance offline and online play and as to whether a warband can engage in either or if it will be restricted to one.\n\nEither way, I think anyone who ever engaged in Games Workshops' Mordheim had best take a serious look at this game and even if you never did, it is a great game if you are into strategy and tactics.","November 24, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The atmosphere is gritty, the graphics are great. Once everything is added, which doesnt look like it will be long, such as character progression, items, campaigns its truley going to be an amazing game.\n\nI only played the table top version a couple times but this looks like it will be a great port from tabletop to video game.\n\nIt has a few niggely bugs, mostly camera bugs (looking at walls etc) but towards the end of my first game I suffered a bit of packet loss and the game never recovered and i had to end process\n\nUpdate:\nI've played a couple more games with a friend and its still great fun but also frustrating. Although you dont see any "dice rolls" you still fail at times and can do nothing but condemn RNGesus.\n\nSince they have released the warbands compendium which has explained a couple of things to me I finally managed to get ahead in a game as the Skaven. I'm ahead on kills. All my monstrous creature needs to do is kill the mercenery leader and his buddy. First turn he fails his stupidity check, the next turn he misses all 3 84% attacks and promptly gets ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped in the face. It was a total turn around.\n\nThe whole line of sight system and ambush moves works really well. Watching my opponent walk into 2 tanged overwatch skavens and a melee is too satisfying. A perfectly executed ambush. I cant wait for the progression and loot system to be introduced.\n\nAnother bug: My rat ogre was able to walk into a building through the doorway (just) but once he was in, he wasnt getting out :(","November 23, 2014","true","25.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The turn-based action in this game really brings to life the strategy that was such a part of the game in its tabletop format. The game is not without its issues and bugs, it is still in early release, but I am very excited to see how this unfolds. So far, there are only two playable warbands and you have no customization available, however, in the tutorial two other warbands are revealed and the potential behind the campaign customization is viewable. I am curious to know how they will balance offline and online play and as to whether a warband can engage in either or if it will be restricted to one.\n\nEither way, I think anyone who ever engaged in Games Workshops' Mordheim had best take a serious look at this game and even if you never did, it is a great game if you are into strategy and tactics.","November 24, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can move a certain amount of points in any direction, with unlimited backtracking (As long as you aren't overwatched/ambushed/trapped) until you confirm the movement\n\nA loot system is within the game, and before and after each battle, you will need to deal with the warbands equipment and stats/skills.\n\nThe setting is pretty neat, it takes place within an Empire city that was destroyed by a Chaos meteor that has strewn valuable Warpstones all over the city.\n\nEach of the current 4 warbands has a neat play-style and reason for being within Mordheim.\n\nSisters of Sigmar: Heavily armored nuns that lack ranged weaponry. They are trying to purge the city and destroy the Warpstone.\n\nReiklander Mercenaries: Medium to heavy armored humans that have an abundance of ranged weaponry. They are trying to collect the warpstone to sell to other Human nations.\n\nCult of the Possessed: Mutants and Demons that are fairly medium to heavily armored, they lack good ranged weaponry, but make up for it with a variety of neat mutations and mechanics. They are trying to collect all the Warpstone to appease their god.\n\nSkaven douches: Light armored mostly, dodge everything, and moves all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. They want the warpstone cause they are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or something.\n\nThe persistent injury system is very unique, a unit going down in a battle is not the end of the world, and very easy to recover from. Often they may not even die, but can be effected by a variety of injuries that alter the way they play.\n\nAnd example is my Chaos Magistrate who originally started out as a caster...well..a blow to the head has convinced him he is actually a god, and only ever uses melee weapons now...thought I should fire him, but damn, he is making it work.\n\nAny-who, I enjoy the game.","November 3, 2015","true","154.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mordheim: City of the Damned has everything that I love in a game: a grim-dark universe rich with lore, simple controls, procedural encounters, customizable characters, and a difficulty that cannot be altered or lowered.\nThis game is hard, not because it requires skill but because every action taken by your characters, (walking is mundane and requires no actual roll), will be resolved randomly based on a percentage of your characters' skill; this percentage will be bigger or smaller from how high the skill is required to perform that action is. This means, you, as the player, have no actual control in how well your characters perform, the most that you, as the player, will be doing is moving your characters to an enemy and telling them to attack or up to a wall and telling them to climb it, all you can do is watch and hope they succeed. The player is soley responsible for strategy on the field and building up your warband to get better percentage rolls.\nSo let me reiterate, this game is hard, and you will become frustrated when you fail but the replayability for this game is extremely high and I advise playing as each of the available factions because they each require different types of mindsets to play them, and nothing feels better than settling with a race or faction that just speaks to you on an emotional level.\n\nAnyways, I recommend this game to anyone who is a huge fan of unforgiving turn-based random number generators, meaning if you really liked Darkest Dungeon you are gonna enjoy this. I have been playing since the Cult of the Possessed were first added during Early Access so I am very pleased with how this game has evolved.\nOh and I highly recommend looking up the official lore and fluff for Warhammer Fantasy, you'll be suprised at how vast the universe can really be.\nThanks for reading.","November 19, 2015","true","90.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Come on, fix this please.  Parry is worthless, and Sisters of Sigmar are do too much damage.  I would recommend staying away from this game till they truly balance these broken factors, they distinctly break the game.","January 29","false","86.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very early. As it is it's not really worth getting. Buggy, bad interface, limit options. All the usual annoying EA problems that you would never want to see in the final game.\n\nHowever, it shows real promise. So far the EA only really does the battle part of Mordhiem (which at most is only half of what makes Mordhiem what it is) but it's fun. It's a different take to the table top game but it works well and still feels liek Mordhiem. Tatics play a part but so does the dice roles, creating a rather good balance between strong positioning and risk vs reward.\n\nOnce they add more warbands, warband creation and injury/experiance, this could be a great game. And at 20% off right now, it's not a bad time to get into it. But if you do, you'll find only limited gameplay until more features are released.\n\nOne thing to remember is that they have changed a few things from the tabletop game, so look up the differences before buying. Also, only 4 warbands are going to be available on release (Human, Sisters, Prossessed and Skavan) but they are hoping to do more (currently that might be witch hunters and Undead!) A limited choice of warbands will hold this game back, so hopefully they release more.","November 23, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sister of Sigmar are mean and hit hard and use magic, think of each sister as a paladin and thats roughly what your dealing with.\n7.Did i tell you how much i hate the sisters of sigmar? A LOT!\n\nOk, if you read through that, then yeah man its a great game, take your time, 2v1/3v1/4v1 etc as much as you can, RNG isn't reliable so don't rely on it, move every move like your character is your child, and invest in Weapon Skill over Accuracy!!\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swoo/recommended/276810/","swoo","Monco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swoo/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nJust to get it out of the way, *no* the game is not worth 20-30 dollars in it's current state. It's less an Alpha and more a 1v1 combat demo of the four warbands with no campaign or warband management that made the original Modheim, Necromunda, and Blood Bowl games so fun.\n\nIs it worth the 20 dollars as a pre-order for the full game? I'd say yes.\n\nThe game is fun. I wasn't sure when I first saw the original videos, but it's a lot more of a tactical RTS game then you would think. Instead of player turns you go by unit initiative turns, and map vision is 100% based on your troops line of sight. They have changed the looting system to an almost scavanger hunt while in the middle of a PvP match - You now search for the warpstone and enemy chests during the fight, instead of getting a list of rewards after the match. Looting is also a team effort as each warrior of yours has 2 open inv spots, plus 1 extra spot per 4 str. So the entire warband will need to work on gathering the loot instead of having 1-2 packrats. The movement system is really simple to get the hang of as each point of movement your character has opens up a set distance shown in a blue ring, and as long as you don't run into an enemies range, you can always revert changes and move him in a different direction at any time. Combat reminds me of Fallout - each trooper seems to have 3-5 action points, and different combat maneuvers cost a different amount of your pool. When your warriors can actually gain xp and purchase skills and new equipment I could see this system being a helluva lot of fun.\n\nI can't say anything about the magic as you basically get an attack spell and a buff spell and that's it. Again, when the warriors can be developed more I could see this system being fun, but right now it's just a fancy bowman.\n\nMultiplayer is less fun. It's a bit buggy, it's full of a lot of rage quits right now, and since there is no warband progression 99% of what makes these types of games great is missing. In a patch or two when they hopefully have the xp system working and people start forming leagues, multiplayer will be worth it. Right now, I can't say it's a selling point.\n\nThe fact it's shipping with only four warbands (more will come via paid DLC I am sure. :/  ) is dissapointing as well. With all the great races and backstory the Warhammer world has, you would at least have hoped to see one of the Dwarven warband types, along with one of the Elven warband types, included in the base game. As it stands you basically get the Germans, the Joan of Arcs, Humans-but-cultists, and the awesome Skaven (rat assassins).","February 5, 2015","true","33.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

You will make choices, knowing that there is no "best choice."\nLoss: Yes, random rolls can pile up, forcing you to lose a treasured unit.  You are fighting with other mercenaries over the "City of the Damned", people will die.  You might actually care for them.  It will hurt.  You may quit.  Or you may find the young replacement and swear at how wortheless they are compared to the veteran that they replaced.  It feels like a warzone, and that's what I wanted.  Learn to dodge.\nChoices: The optional objectives are woth more than the primary.  The primary is, usually, easy.  Beat the not so smart AI.  When just starting, I did lose a few primary objectives.  You learn to stick together, and if you don't start together, get together ASAP!  Then you start winning primary objectives.\nYou start looking at those optional objectives.  And realizing that if you want to accomplish them, you might have to break out of your comfortable, stick together, everybody comes home safely routine.  Maybe you start taking risks.  And you like the rewards.  Then somebody gets caught alone against a swarm, or maybe just a single impressive unit.  And it hurts.  And you wonder if those rewards were worth it.\nStick through it, learn.  And you can find yourself making most of the optional objectives and making it home in one piece.  And sometimes you look at the map/setup and realize it's the day to just hunker down.\n\nThose two things are why I love Mordheim.\n\nIt does have some negatives. Managing inventory during a mission could use the ability to drop items. I get annoyed when the enemy routs immediately after I take down the one guy I needed to take down, only to not get the chance to grab his token before the rout ends the mission.  Deployment could be made more user friendly (selecting deployment from the map instead of cycling). The game has gotten a LOT better since it first came to Early Access, and I hope they continue working on some of those.  But the good things more than make it worth dealing with the few annoyances in the game, in my opinion.\n\nI hope they continue, either through DLC or just updating the game itself, to develop more warbands, more equipment, more customization of models and more mission types (story or procedural).  But I love the game as it is today.  I would just love to have more too :).","December 28, 2015","true","145.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

After the debacle with most of the early access games I have invested in before, this particular game gave me hope that there are companies out there really willing to work hard.\n\nThere are very few games like this that have been released. It is a diamond in the rough, and is apparently based off of a tabletop game that I had no idea even existed. I have delved into the turn based action and immediately felt right at home. I loved the way my warband could be customizable, but I almost wished there were more options. Maybe this will be a patch or DLC they may release.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great tactical gameplay\n- Classic well designed turn based action\n- Interesting preparation experience\n- Customization options for combat\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Good graphics, but not the best; however, I have seen most of these games being played for depth rather than glitz and glammer.\n- The AI isn't the smartest as yet, but I am sure they will make the necessary changes. (I was able to snipe a baddie because he didn't know how to "jump down" from a ledge, and just moved back forth in a 3 foot pattern for 7 turns)\n-I would have liked to have seen more customization options, which I am sure they will be making available from DLC.\n\n\nI would recommend this game for fans of the old fanfaire of turn based games. It isn't Final Fantasy Tactics by a long shot, but it is the only title that I have personally played that has even had a chance of comparing to it. Not bad guys, not bad.\n\nP.S. after three days of playing this game it has corrupted my soul. This game is HARDCORE. If you are easily discouraged, I would not recommend it. lol...

The RNG is is out of whack, spent the better part of 4 hours getting into melee bundles where the entire enemy warband almost one shot all my members including hero and leader (60+ damage a swing) where as I can only deal 15-20 (assuming I'm lucky enough to hit at all) no matter the troop type so if im lucky 3 or 4 of my members can take down one enemy, this is with a starting warband on what was meant to be a basic map. Resource gathering is far too hard in the early part of the campaign and it's far too easy to be left with no warband and no gold or wyrdstone to be able to come back from. I appreciate the gaem is suppossed to be hardcore in that your band is persistent but the difficulty curve is waaay too high to be fun. Tried 3 different warbands varying between ranged or melee heavy or a mix and none of them could win a match or gather any resource of note. Found the menus and interface annoying and hard to navigate, causing some frustarting mistakes in battle, nothing feels intuitive and all the information feels like an overdose so nothing really sinks in. I did like the look and atmosphere of the game and it's always nice to have some customization options so that kept me entertained naming my bands and coming up with backstories, shame they all got hacked to bits  so deftly by uber buffed ai. More warbands choices might draw me back eg. Vampire Counts, but I'd be very cautious after this 1st taste tbh. Really unsatisfying and frustrating experience in it's current form.

The worst part about it is that I like this style of game, and I desperately want to like this one, but I just can't because it's not honest.  The roll system in this game indicates a percentage likelihood to succeed in any given task, so when I have 7 people who all have a greater than 75% chance to hit their targets and I hit twice in 3 rounds, I have a problem.  If this was one scenario then I'd write it off as a set of bad rolls, but it's not just one scenario.  As the Skaven, who have the best agility, I failed 7 out of 8 of the agility tests I tried with over 70% chance to succeed.  As the mercenaries who have the best ballistics skills starting out, I never hit once with a ranged weapon.  The Sisters of Sigmar were the group I had the best luck with and I did that by tanking and trading blows, but that only works when you can actually hit at the rate you're supposed to.  So take any given % chance they show you and subtract somewhere between 20 and 50 from it and you'll have the actual rate of success.  If the numbers were accurate I'd love this game.  Instead I hate it because I'm constantly expecting what it tells me.\n\nEdit:  I've forced myself to continue playing in order to get my money's worth, and while I still don't recommend the game, I do have some more insight into it now.  I'm leaving my initial review because most of what was said still stands and it accurately portrays the frustration I felt upon initially starting the game.  I've since found that the game seriously suffers from an inverse difficulty curve where the game is extremely difficult for people who haven't put any time into it yet.  The more you play the more bonuses you get for both existing and new warbands.  This means that warbands you start later will have fewer starting problems, mostly that they won't feel forced to take missions that feel outside of their level.  The issues with rng still exist at higher levels.  When I have a skill that initally has a 75% chance to succeed and I cast it 3 times at base and 2 times with a plus 15% chance to succeed and I only get one success and 3 "divine wrath" results that basically end that characters turn (and the divine wrath chance was only 15% chance on each cast) I feel as though instead of being told my success rate I'm being told my failure rate.  I understand that the game is supposed to be difficult, but there is definitely something wrong with the rng.  I'm even contemplating keeping track of everything I do to see just how far off the percentages are.  The game can become enjoyable, if still frustrating, but it just takes too much effort to really be worth it in my opinion.","February 12","false","18.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

This game goes back to the very basics of what Warhammer is; and is a direct reputation of the turned based combat. Mordheim takes Warhammer and makes it into the strategy game it should be, but that being said it still needs improvement. For starters, when I have defeated an enemy  champion, the game tells me I have been defeated and none of my progress is saved. With all things taken into consideration, the game is still in beta and is not near completion.

This game is exceptionally good, and it's current reviews do not reflect that. When reading other negative reviews I encourage potential buyers to read with the question in mind "Would this person's problem have been solved if they had just been better at the game?"\n\nI read review after review and nearly every negative one I read was filled with paragraphs of "The RNG is broken, Its impossible to recover from deaths or serious injuries". Having played the game a significant amount I can confirm that these extensive reviews could easily be replaced with "The game was too hard for me"\n\nMordheim is hard, think Dark Souls. There is a sharp learning curve to it and even with my brother and I playing and sharing information I still couldn't get a lvl 10 warband decent enough to beat the last mission until I remade it 3 times. This was not as frustrating as it sounds though because there are plenty of options and variations to try, and each on has a particular niche that it works best in.\n\nLastly, I have had this game since early Beta and the team working on it is one of the best I have experienced. Currently the game is only lacking in a few quality of life tweaks like the touchiness of shooting through windows or ambushing through dorways. But in the short time I have owned this game these problems are repidly disappearing\n\nMy point is, the game is too hard for the people leaving poor reviews and I highly recommend it","December 20, 2015","true","231.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Great potential for future growth.\n\nThe ambience and atmosphere of the game is great however I am not too sure about the suitability of the soundtrack.\nWhile I think the soundtrack is quality it sounds like the drums of war and great battles at points. But these aren't great battles: they are skirmishes for ones life in the dregs of a corrupted world.   Anyway it seems insignificant. Stylised music for each warband would be great also. Ironically the opening menu ambience is fantastic but it does not seem to be replicated in skirmishes.\n\nAt the moment the games engine doesn't seem quite capable of supporting itself and I would highly recommend the coders get their butts in gear as to fixing critical game glitches for example playing versus  player seems to get stuck and 4/5 times will not get unstuck and you are left thinking of what might have been. Load times that don't seem to be done justice by the in game content.\n\nThere are some minor graphical glitches  mostly in chraracter models. The human impressive unit looks bald from some angles if he has no headgear. The ogre has an invisible buttcrack when he's stunned. Sisters are miraculously empty on the inside of their armour and it's particularly evident when they fail a drop check. Brethrens robes spazzing out.  Overall the graphics are solid, stylised and make a positive impact on the game.\n\nQuite a few quality of life problems and glitches that need to be fixed up. There are spots in the map that are bugged one way or another. For example in the sewers of the church of sigmar there is a reddish tentacle-ridden area that one of my sisters got stuck in. There are multiple places where, as a ranged attacker, you can walk up a wall and get stuck in it for an added height boost and sniper spot particularly in houses of the merchants quarter. Seems to be a few problems with characters magically falling down walls they just climbed.  And the menus in skirmishes could really do with full mouse capabilities.\n\nThere are people who are griping and giving this game a bad rap. You must understand that there will always be people who give a game a bad rap and in the last 5 years they seem to have crawled out from under every rock and basement known to man.  If you have a reasonable intellect you can master the keyboard menus quite easily. The game is quite the very definition of early access and an excellent early access game with the promise of great growth potential for 2v2 and great customisation and strategy.\n\nHowever I'm extremely fearful that this game will collapse or I will have to boycott it because it will become a left right and centre cash grab. Indeed, the game already shows omens of it in the form of currencies of wydrstone and coins. The "Smugglers Den". The potential to buy boosts for your characters for exp and expedite their learning of new spells.\nPurchashing mercenaries (Priest of Morr etc),\nWhile the wyrdstones and currency and upkeep are all in tune to the rules of the game it does not mean a player should have to fork out unreasonable amounts of real cash to manage them.\nThe seeming potential for your warriors to become incapacitated or injured for periods of time, while realistic, is probably more about the potential for customers to purchase boosters that let them recover completely or faster.\n\nDepending on how overboard the group goes with cash grab if they do and I imagine they will. ( And come on, it's sanctioned or run by Games Worskship the people that sell, while of good quality, small figures of tin or plastic at prices going beyond twenty dollars and then squeezing you for the paint($36 for 2 medium pieces), the glue($12) and the tools(32+18) as well. Bless them.)\n\nConsidering that the base game is not free to play they will be walking on thin ice with me and I imagine a lot of players if there isn't a reasonable means for those who can't fork out money to build their warbands up and give them a sanctuary to play and enjoy the game where they don't constantly get stomped on by someone who has already learnt grand true comet of sigmar and  has 200 damage weapons. Sigmar forbid they make it so you have to WAIT because your lack the funds to pay for your warband or you don't have enough warriors and can't afford to buy a new one.\nThat will drop the game to the status of a glorified facebook game and I would be severely disappointed.\n\nThat aside I will try and remain positive for this game and hope to see it blossom into a popular title of its genre or atleast become a cult classic.\n\nFor those of you considering the purchase of this game in early access please consider the following.\no The PvP is not thriving yet\no You can't build up resources or exp at this point\no There are some fatal game errors\no The game requires more resources to run than it appears","February 5, 2015","true","36.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But I can see myself playing this game, until it is complete and allows me to manage my troops through an evolutive process.\n\nMordheim is a game in the spirit of the many Warhammer themed games that already exists. The World of Warhammer is a grim world where life has no value and everyone, from the greatest hero to the lowest of the low, can die in an instant. It shall be the same with your troops. They will get hurt, light and grave, they will die. You will loose your Champions, but if you play your cards right, you will prevail ... at least that's how I hope the game will shape up to be ... like its tabletop equivalent, up there with tabletop Bloodbowl !\n\nEdit: I have now come back to Mordheim: City of the Damned after its launch. This is the game I expected so this review remains positive ! I'll give you my pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n- Turned based epic fights\n- Character progression coupled with injury/death system that can be ruthless if you really are unlucky (your favorite hero/leader might die or have permanent injuries each time they are put out of action ... of they might get lucky and miraculously recover) ... don't put all your eggs in the same basket and you might want to wait until your characters are better equipped before training them for this 200 gold skill ...\n- The maps are fun. There's a lot of terrain to cover and you'd best remember to manage movements tactically.\n- Warband progression is, overall, very slow but I consider this a pro since it rewards long term planning and strategy. Bad luck can really mess with your plans ... but we accept that as one of the reasons we play such a game in the first place.\n\nCONS:\n- Long loading times. I understand the scale of the map and that warband generation is a complicated process but ... I can't imagine people at minimum requirements not ending up losing patience.\n- Random numbers generation (dice rolls) is weird. This game gives us percentages but I feel like it rolls d4s in its tests. It's come to the point where I started rolling dice as I made my throws for a couple games, to compare and I wish I could play with dice ... they never gave me 6 misses in a row twice in a game on 84% chances to hit, my dice respect statistics a lot more than the game seems to be doing. I mention this only because I'm usually very good at risk assesment in such games but I'm now almost convinced I have to threat a 75% chance of success more like a 40% chance of success when taking decisions. Is that only me ?\n- The user interface and user experience could easily be vastly improved. Menus could be arranged differently so that there's no counter intuitive stuff such as a list of incoming events in the Mission Selection screen (there could be a "general information" menu for that and other informations spread around different menus). The "Warband management" menu where you pay for treatments and characters upkeep is a button just like other buttons. It could have its own menu or be a bit more evident, since it opens a menu which is different from the menus opened by other similar buttons in the same page. I'm sorry that I didn't bother suggesting that before the game was released.\n- A lot of randomness which you cannot influence. For example, sellswords and shop inventories. I don't dislike the current system, I just wish there was a way for me to have a way to influence those. At times, my progress was slowed or my warband subefficient simply because I couldn't find anything good in the shop or because available sellswords didn't fit what I needed (when I could afford them, sometimes I had kickass sellsword worth 40 gold !!! Other times, I have over priced leaders who really aren't worth the price they ask ...)\n- Hard to navigate the map, to gain knowledge about it to better strategize. Sometimes I wish I could get out of my characters' perspective to inspect something he can clearly see even if the range was limited (it would have to be). I always have so much trouble finding building entrances ...\n- I wish there were more different warbands to chose from. DLC !\n\n\nOverall, this is the game I hoped for with longer loading times. It is a challenging game, but also a rewarding game. Don't get frustrated at your losses, learn from them ... and if you lose again tell yourself you can't win them all. Bury your warband, remember them and start a new one.\n\nGood hunting amongst the damned !","May 3, 2015","true","39.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

If however you think this game is not for you then its time to rethink your life and play this game.\n\nThe passage below was part of the review however about a week after I put this paragraph in the devs made a small patch largely focused at fixing the level I'm referring to. This is what I like about this game and these devs they do appear to seriously want this game to be enjoyable, and it is, rather than a bunch of jobsworths out for a paycheck.

The 1st mission of act 2 for possessed, vs Thag is one of the most poorly constructed, time wasting and utterly worthless elements of the game, if you don't read a guide first the chances of losing your warband are staggeringly high.

RNG rules and it doesn't favor you in the least apparent 80% will miss three times in a row for your warband but the AI doesn't seem to obey the rules of Chance.\n\nBut even if it did it serves to highlight the real problem with the game. The complete lack of depth to it's gameplay to give context, at the ten hour mark you may have characters with two or three abilities all behaving much the same. Some warbands have purely worse troops that still cost the same...management is shallow and limited, deployment is more often then not taken from you.\n\nAll the preparation in the world and all the careful management (or what little the game offers) matters little when all but moving your troops is reliant on a dice roll.\n\nOther tactics games simply do more, often with much less powerful hardware.\n\nAdd to that an abusive requirement to hand in resources regularly forcing you to focus on collection in battles where the AI can simply focus on you.\n\nThe entire game seems like it was designed by a dev team who didn't know how to make a challengeing game but still wanted to plaster "Hardcore" on eveything.\n\nIf you're a warhammer fan you've probably already brought it and are playing it like me simply because it's a warhammer game that's vaguely playable.\n\nIn even simpler terms, this focus on making as simple a game as possible but also as "Hard" makes a game that only real masochists will enjoy beyond it's warhammer skin.

But it is undeniable that there are SERIOUS balance issues. Sisters warband and Skaven are superior hands down.\n\nThe start of the game is MUCH too brutal to players.\n\nThere is no increasing difficulty as the mobs increase at the same rate your warband does.\n\nItems at the start of the game are completely pointless. If you work for hours and hours and don't die you MIGHT get a better weapon or armor.\n\nAlmost all potions have a downside to them that typically outweighs any benefit and they also take up inventory space, which means you will not be able to loot as much.\n\nRanged units are trash until MAYBE they are OKAY at the end-game when you have lots of units (MAYBE).\n\nProgression takes too long and by the end of your progression you aren't even happy with what you ended up with.\n\nIf you pick a good faction, and then only go after missions that are the easiest type (warpstone rush) then the game is super easy mode. But if you stray from that, you will probably not play the game for a few weeks when your leader falls and dies.\n\nCustomization is poorly labled... instead of picking colors for your clothing/armor you get to flip through a list that is just numbered (lazy programming here). You also get to do that for every single character since you cannot do a pre-built color scheme similar to the original 40k games.\n\n\n\nFinal impression: This is sorta like the "kife-game" of video games. It looks so cool, and that's probably why you want to play it. But after the pain of actually playing the game, you will be filled with remorse and sadness. The balance issues really just kill the game right now along with only having a few units and a few warbands to choose from. At best this is a watered down intro to the tabletop game. At worst, it is a waste of any time you put into it.","January 29","false","7.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chewyspeaker/recommended/276810/","Chewyspeaker","Chewy Speaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chewyspeaker/","327 products in account","Early Access Review\n\ntl;dr There are very few features currently in the game, but what's there is very good and very promising.\n\nSo, point of mention: I never played Mordheim before this; I'm familiar with the game and its concept, but never had a chance to actually get in a campaign. Also note that this review is current as of the second content update\n\nCurrently the game only really has the combat more or less. There's 4 warbands (essentially Skaven, Empire, Warrior Priest Empire, and Chaos), and they all have unique units with different skills and abilities, including a powerful Leader unit and 1 impressive unit (Ogre, Chaos Spawn, Rat Ogre, or Super Sister) The rest of the options are fairly simple as to be expected from a starting warband, usually with only a skill or two differentiating them besides their different stat lines. Unfortunately, this does make the units feel very generic, but that's how I imagine they are until level ups and injuries anyways.\n\nSurprisingly, combat/movement does not take place on a grid, but in 3D environments using circles to mark how far you can move with each movement point. This does create some weirdness moving around objectives, because you can end up eking out a lot more movement in some situations, looping around obstacles without leaving your circle, but largely looks really nice. The movement is also interestingly handled by WASD, so you actually get to run around with your guys, which was a refreshing change and felt really good. A nice side effect of this as well is that the entire game is playable with a gamepad, hinting that they may move into consoles at some point. Circles also dictate enemy threat zones and ally "control zones", which is an area that keeps other allies from performing actions. It sounds strange, but basically its simply to keep you from stacking 30 guys on one enemy. Nice to note that although there are many missing features currently, the game does include a fairly polished 4-part tutorial that also gives you a chance to see all the factions. Load times were a bit of a bother, but that could also be my machine. Lastly, the interface during the game was very nice. You're able to easily open windows with a single button press that will allow you to see a summary of your active character's stats/buffs, the target character's stats, or a breakdown of what modifiers are on certain actions (explaining why your success chance is higher or lower than expected). All in all, it allows the player to only be confronted with the information they feel they need without requiring lots of popping back to a settings menu.\n\nInsert standard comment about bugs and it being in early access so hopefully they will be polished out.\n\nCurrently, the only form of customization that exists is choosing what weapons your guys have equipped. Dual wielded weapons can be equipped in any combination, so there's actually some nice variety here in, even just with equipment, deciding and executing specific roles for your dudes. As warband management is the newest feature, it's pretty light, but there's lots of promising space on the screen to be filled in. Notably, there's something like 12 locked equipment slots, hinting at lots of consumables and magic items coming in the future (one of the tutorials actually mentions something about enchantments). The Skills page is broken up into something like 10 different tabs, also hinting at lots of customization incoming (currently you can only skirmish with the starting armies, and loot + XP are not applied).\n\nGraphically, the game is, frankly, amazing. I'm running it on a 3-year-old laptop and I was getting decent FPS on the "good" setting, which is better than the vast majority of games I've played. Surprisingly optimized for an early access game. I'm not a huge fan of the maps and environments, but that's mostly a question of taste; I'm not one who really enjoys OMG SO GRIMDARK!!!1 all the time. That being said, for that vein they do look absolutely fantastic. They also sport lots of points of interaction, allowing you to climb and leap through different elevations. Nice level design so far from what I've seen. Traps and looting are in, though can't really say how big a role they currently play.\n\n\nAll in all, I have to say that I am very impressed. Like I said, the game still has lots of missing key features, but the thing is that they seem to be taking their time and making sure that they do everything right the first time around rather than spit out a bunch of features and try to massage it into a playable state. Personally I won't be playing a whole lot of it right now (since I'm mostly looking forward to the warband growth aspects of the game), but it is totally playable and, compared to almost all other Early Access games I've played, seems to really be starting on the right foot.","February 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","1"

Mercs have no spellcasters until higher level and comes into play with weak spells.  by the time you get him tha spell that gives people in an area a -5% to hit, dodge and parry will help very little.\n\n2. Skaven are the best in balance with a good dodge that can help you early in the game and Chaos and the sisters have spells that can help you in the game throughout combat.\n\n3. Sisters are overpowered to the point where if I'm randomly scattered and I am against them I abort as soon as I can.\n\n4. Potions are pathetic and virtually unusable in most cases.  A 10% increace in armor protection will not outweigh the 100% loss of stun resistance, especially when you have a skill that can give you a good chance to stun early on.\n\n5.

Yes the game does have it's glitches, which I hope the devleopers are looking into and going to try and fix, but I have seen few games roll out without a few glitches at release time. The game is unforgiving, but the table top game was just as unforgiving and I enjoy that part. It makes you feel like this mission could be your last so you need to use tactics to not just win, but to survive. If you run up and attack a whole warband with only one guy, well bad things are going to happen to your one guy. The game also makes you think about future missions. You can't just go and blow all your gold on members and equipment. You have to save money in case you need to replace that equipment or even replace a member who died or was too injuried to be worth using anymore. Luckily they have the reserve system, so members who are injuried can be put in reserve while they heal, or even train (yes training takes time in game also) and a fresh member can replace them. The controls are a little hard to get use to at first, but after a while playing the game, it became easier. While the load time is horrible and the AI seems to take forever to make its move during it's turn, it has yet to push me away from this game.  Overall, it is a good, horror filled game that you never know what is coming at you around a corner and you never know when it will be your last. If you enjoy these types of games or if you enjoyed the table top game, this is definitely one to pick up.

Unfortunately, the developers have got it into their head that it's a good business practice to cater to the super hardcore masochist crowd and ONLY to that crowd. In the same vein as Dark Souls, you'll really only enjoy this game if your idea of fun is getting brutally mauled over and over and over again, mostly because random dice rolls decided you're going to die.\n\nThen there's the community. God forbid you have a concern that the game might not be perfect, for the tiniest voice is discontent is met with contempt, scorn, and mockery from the aforementioned masochists. They will actually TELL you to ♥♥♥♥ off and don't play the game if you don't enjoy the savage beatings the game gives you, even if you did everything right, and yes, you CAN do everything right and still get your warband destroyed because of the RNG, but the hardcore crowd will blame it all on you, tell you that you suck, and should either suck it up and enjoy it or leave. They seem to have no idea how detrimental to the game's longevity this is, nor do they appear to care, so long as they preserve their precious "hardcore" status.\n\nThe devs, unfortunately, have plainly expressed their intent to NOT implement certain features (like a basic Save/Load mechanic) because they want to be "hardcore like Dark Souls," they have no plans to expand upon the pathetically lackluster customization, and generally have made it very clear that they don't intend to do anything but cater to the most hardcore of hardcore players.\n\nIn short, if you liked Dark Souls or XCOM on Hardcore Ironman, you'll like this.

Game balance is for crap, and without difficulty settings, I don't even want to fight 100 fights to figure out how to finally beat them.  (Worst part, they were the same faction, so it is not factional aspects).  And when they ran into 3 traps and still killed me so completely, something is wrong.\n* Management doesn't seem to say much, not sure how to "configure" people to win, assumed the default would do it.\n","May 11, 2015","false","1.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"

The developers have done an admirable job imitating the feel of the classic Mordheim miniatures game. The systems work well and there's some interesting decisions to be made once your warband gets past the first couple of missions and gain a few skills. Persistent injuries, forced ironman and your main income being what you scavenge in the middle of combat makes the campaign compelling even though it's mostly random missions. If you wanted a 50-50 mix of Blood Bowl and X-COM, this is it.\n\nWhat pulls the game down is 3 things:\n- Less-than-stellar (read: bloody stupid) AI. A big no-no in a strategy game\n- Obscene waiting times. Maps take ages to load and if 3-4 enemies have a turn in succession you may as well tab out and watch a youtube video\n- Godawful 3rd person camera and WASD movement. The game is practically begging for an isometric/eye-in-the-sky view.\n\nIf you can live with that, this is a solid game. Especially if you play it against people instead of the easily cheesable AI.","December 2, 2015","true","26.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It all comes down to horrible random roll streaks that the AI suspiciously doesn't suffer while still having WAY better stats... Way to take the intellegence out of game design Rogue Factor.\n\nWhat's so sad is there is a lot about this game I like:\n• deep RPG progression\n• loot system\n• unit variety\n• dark gothic theme\n\nProblem is none of it comes even close to making up for the unavoidable absolutely horrendous punishment you're going to take.\n\nBut the bad doesn't end there:\n• incredibly repetitive missions. It's almost always the same "kill or route all the enemies".\n• horendous AI. Either charge in or in the case of the large units, get stuck on collision\n• devs' attempt to balance terrible AI: give the enemy WAY better units and stats.\n• way too punishing and permanently crippling to be completely dependent on randomizers. You'll find yourself missing or falling flat on your ♥♥♥ over and over again as if those 90% likelyhood of success ratings are just there to force failure on you despite perfectly laid battle plans.\n\nI normally enjoy a challenge when a game like Dark Souls does it right. They make difficult challenges fun and rewarding because if played perfectly, you can succeed and do well. This game however punishes you severely for failing rolls out of your control over and over again and right from the beginning. I fail to see why the developers seem to want to ♥♥♥♥ their customers off. Where's the fun or success in that?\n\nSo as much as I wish I could recommend this as a deep and rewarding strategy game, unless you're a masochist, don't even think about buying game. Find something fun to play instead! :D","January 9","false","84.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Because I have crummy Internet I am not able to download it as quickly as I would like.  However, the patches for the game have been amazing.  I would reccomend it to anyone who likes nitty gritty turn based games.\n\nMy thoughts on the different warbands:\n\nCult of the Possessed: So far they are my favorite warband to play as.  They have good attacks, but lack in defense.  That is okay considering their henchmen start with two handed axes.  Thier leader starts out with a decent spell and their hero does have the chance of random mutations.\n\nClan Eshin: They are my second favorite to play even though they lack physical prowess.  They are not able to hit very hard, but their leader does start out with a poison weapon.  On the other hand, they are all excellent at dodges from the start making you harder to hit.\n\nSisters of Sigmar: The Sisters of Sigmar are the absolute worst warband to face in my opinion.  I have yet to win a battle against them and they all seem to be overpowered even at low levels.  When I try to play them, they always end up doing awful.  They seem to have a pretty good chance of doing well later on down the road though.\n\nMercenaries of Reikland: I have honestly not played them as I have never been a huge fan of the Empire.  I don't know all that much about them.\n\nOverall, the game is very difficult to start, but it the game is very rewarding to players who do well.  The game itself is a little clunky, but it is a very good game.","March 24, 2015","true","63.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","4"

It took me seven warbands to even get out of the blocks but that is becasue it is a learning experience.  Now I've got the hang of how to bring my squad together and focussing on preparing the battle ground that I want I can make pretty good progress.  That said it is still not a case of rinse and repeat.  If I make a mistake I get punished, and severley.  Yes the RNG can be punitive but it cuts both ways - Hero caught out in the open about to get mashed by a leader and hero from the enemy and then my lowly archer on the roof gets a stun on both bad guys in same round.  Without RNG that could never happen - I think the game gives you more extreme highs and lows as a result but I kind of like that.\n\nMy biggest problem so far is that I cannot for the life of me see how I will ever amass enough cash to be able to skill up - got tons of skill points available but never have any money to be able to apply them.  Maybe it will get better in time.  Always seem to end up in combat very quickly and get a rout before I collect a fraction of the loot.\n\nI don't know the table top game or the Lore surrounding it but I hope we get DLC where I can have Greenskin and Ork warbands.  On warbands I should add that I'm not wild about the warband representations.  I've got a chaos crew who I think look the best of the bunch.  Think the Mercenaries (particularly the starting Hero unit) look like they'd fall over if you sneezed on them and why are there now mixed gender groupings?  Got to be boys or girls.\n\nThat said it's got me hooked so thumbs up.","January 24","true","160.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

That would almost make someone instantly change their mind about buying this game. Why aren't their more positive reviews up front for people to see? And steam, shouldn't the out dated reviews be moved down the list so people can see reviews about the current version? (I know iPhone and iPad app store only keep reviews about the current version.)\n\nIn my opinion, the recent patch totally fixed most of the RNG problems and a bunch other glitches. About people who said that their character "missed 5 95% shots in a row ". I'm gonna make an arguement. First of all, max level (10) leaders and heros have 9 offense points, which are enough for 4 one-handed hits or 3 two-handed hits. If your heros or headers are using ranged weapon, they could do 3 gun shots or 4 bow shots. A max level impressive warrior also has 9 offensive points, so 4 hits also. So I don't understand where you got those 5 shots.... So why don't you guys be a responsible reviewer and remove those negative reviews that are not true to the current version any more? Plus most of those posters just sounded like they did not know how the game works.\n\nBut anyway, Mordheim is an awesome turn-based strategy game.

Nearly everything that existed in the skirmish level miniatures game is here; and I can't get enough of it. From unit custimization, down to the weapons, armor, skills, and appearances, to the tough-as-nails, "please don't let my veteran die" urgency is represented here. Further, the ability to take your battle hardened crew online to scrap with your friends or other players across the world was not only a necessity, but a welcome addition to an already excellent game. If turn-based strategy is your bread and butter, or even just your soup de jour, Mordheim should have you coming back for more! Old school X-Com fans should buy this game without reservation.

Other player`s opinion may differ, but this was my experience. Dont get me wrong, its not a bad thing. This game was MADE to be that way.\n\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW :\n\n-----This game should have a warning on its label :\nYou are going to get intensely r4ped for the first 10 hours or so. Its totally normal if you feel sad and angry, just accept it...Learning curve ?...No way, you are thrown into it and you are going to drown. Pretty much the reason of all bad reviews.\n\n-----The game also doesnt warn you that its almost impossible to stay with your first ever warband, so dont get attached too soon. You are going to replace them often, disbanding and re-creating at least once. They going to get killed, crippled, ransacked and sick poor again. You are going to want to bash your whole house and family with your keyboard, but its part of the first stage of the game.\n\n-----To be honest, once you get past the " initiation " step, its one of the best bucks$/game ratio I ever played, and I bought it full price so I reccomend you jump on it, especially if its on sale. The game also greatly rewards new warbands, depending on your easily obtainable achievements.\n\nMost of bad reviews come from people with less than 15hrs. Give yourself a chance, you are missing a great gem of a game. The game is still challenging and hard when you gear up and lvl up, but really less unfair. Damn good game.\n\nMy point is : Dont buy if you dont like getting angry on a game. Dont buy if you want a "walk in the park" gaming experience.\n\n\n\nNOW THE HONEST REVIEW :\n\nDont buy if you dont like unexpected and "against the odds". Whole game is based on dice-rolls and odds. Once again, reason of most bad reviews...\n\nPersonally I call that " Challenging" and "Refreshing" ...Mostly "Refreshing"\nBut most gamers nowaday calling that... " Broken"...go figure....And I am not even that old. I am not even an hardcore gamer.\n\n\nPRETTY  SIMPLE :\n\nYou want to win on each tries, you want forgivness on your stupid/rushed plays?\n\nYou want to load a previous save because you ♥♥♥♥ed up?\n\nSteam, Origin, U-Play, name em are full of those kind of un-original games, of any genres. 70-80-90$-DLC not Included, and you will get erected at how much copy-paste/recycled games are appealing and how much dev team doesnt care about you and your elite community. Btw, I got these kind of games on my pc. Some I love, Some I regret. I am no hater, I love games.\n\n\nRogue-Factor`s first game...Not perfect, but damn impressive for a little bunch of devs. Promising future if you ask me, just dont bury em under false bad "under 10 hours game experience" meaningless-seen-better-meh-IamtheShit opinions.\n\nWorst of all, every negative stuff I read about this game is absolutely wrong on most aspects. Too little time into it to make worthy reviews. I have seen about 3 constructive bad reviews, with points I agreed on, but never to the point of calling that game-breaker.\n\nIMPORTANT TO MENTION :\n\n-Great ambiant music and great grim victorian dark atmoshpere. I mean, its dark, and grim. Like the first Diablo compared to Diablo3.\n-...You have to be patient...You have to let time to the enemy to place their warriors, can take several seconds.\n-I never tried multiplayer, due to real life stuff. But from what I heard, its not optimal yet.\n-Dev team often on forums and answering constructive posts.\n-Speaking about the forums, many experienced players are there, always happy to give tips.\n\nlong read, sorry. By the way, I never played the table-top version. I heard there is some inaccuracies. Some people like it, some dont.

After playing a bit I can say I enjoy it, however, it can be annoying at times. With a few corrections and addition of new content this would be an excellent game. My biggest annoyance with the game is the balance. Enemy teams hit much more often than player team. After noticing that I was taking much more damage than I was dealing in the first few games I played I started keeping track. Enemy teams are hitting with about 90% of the time where player team is hitting about 60%. This is off balance and will drive players away when you are facing a team that is supposedly equal (Normal level mission). Particularly when a leader with an 89% hit is beat 1 on 1 by a henchman because of hit rate. Granted that only happened once but you can see the annoyance level.The "random" number generator that governs hits seems to favor high numbers, I noticed that the numbers coming up for hits, ran over 70 very often this is probable but inlikely, which leads me to conclude that it needs adjustment.\nContent - The obvious, more warband types (for me would like wood elves). Missions that are not just fighting another warband would add to the game, go get that cache but oh look there are zombies there dont get scared :)\nAnd the biggest addition for me would be getting rid of ending the mission when enemy warband routes. Makes no sense that it suddenly ends without the chance to loot, gather. I think 2-3 rounds of actions after defeating an enemy warband to allow looting/gathering makes sense. Its not like my warband would just pack up and leave because they beat the enemy, Warbands are there to gather resources and fulfill missions. quite often there is a bed of warpstone and I route the enemy and can not get it as game ends.\nOverall good , enjoyable, tactical game. That needs tweeking and added content.","February 21","true","33.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The DLC might add to this.\n\nLike I said mechanics are hit and miss. The back tracking/movement system is great. How ever mechanics like area of control are a pain in the ♥♥♥. Which might block a unit from taking any kind of part in a fight.\n\nThe game looks great. Mordheim looks spot on. The city looks perfect from what I have read. Units look superb too, there are some alternate looks, but they're slim in choices. More would be great, to actually feel more connected to the troops and get some personality.\n\nThe pricing is crazy though. Over 40€ for the game is over the top.\n\nWhile there are worse games to spend that money on, I would wait for at least >30€\n\nGeneral feel and view of the game is strongly positive.

I see many people complaining about the RNG, but it's all superficial: the RNG is fair. Heck, if you're a Blood Bowl veteran, you won't even bat an eye at the failed high percentage rolls.\n\nAnyway, what is the game like? Take 1 X-Com, mix it very thoroughly with Valkyria Chronicles, and richly season with Warhammer.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Warband Management is immensely satisfying. There are endless ways to build your warband, customize each warrior with skills, stats, equipment , etc. This is where the game really shines. Do not be put off by only four factions, as even with four factions the variety is mindboggling.\n\n2. Combat is fun, and differs quite significantly from faction to faction. While the limited number of maps and objectives might get a little stale after a while, the actual process of chopping your opponents to pieces (or shooting them to tatters) doesn't get old.\n\n3. Seamless integration of Single and Multiplayer combat. So you beat the main campaign, and routinely  trash the AI on every map. You're good, right? So you try a multiplayer battle and get your ♥♥♥ handed back to you on a platter. You lick your wounds, play a few more single player battles to get some money and replace lost equipment and crippled teammates, then you go back into MP and whoop somebody else. Or get whooped. Either way, well done.\n\nCons:\n1. As I said earlier, there isn't a huge variety of maps and objectives. That hurts the game a little.\n\n2. Minor graphic glitches and long loading times. Nothing gamebreaking, but somewhat annoying.\n\nFinal verdict.\nDefinitely get it if:\nYou are a fan of the Warhammer universe, or tactical squad based games or even Blood Bowl.","February 9","true","37.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Your warband has to be resilient, every diligent and most importantly....not too greedy!\n\nAs a long time fan of GW's Warhammer Fantasy this game definitely grabs the atmosphere of the Old World and smashes into your brain while you make a dizzying effort to navigate the streets of Mordheim.  Represented in this game currently are the forces of The Empire, Skaven, Cult of the Possessed, and the Sisters of Sigmar.  With those four factions there is tons of content already built into the game with a lot of replay factor that goes along with it all.\n\nI purchased this game in its pre-order beta rough days and have watched it grow to become quite the diamond.  The devs have used their time judiciously and have listened to a lot of feedback in the process.\n\nI am really hoping that this game grows in popularity, and that other faction's warbands get representation.  Dark Elves, Dwarves, Beastmen, Lizardmen (my favorite), Tomb Guardians, Witch Hunters (Empire), and you can't leave out Orcs!!!\n\nAll in all I give the game 4 out of 5.

I was expecting this game to either me meh or just be another cash in. What I got was a beautiful turn based experience where I feel attached to my men and women, without ever feeling cheated like I do in XCOM and Blood Bowl. Everything you do means something and you need to meet a deadline so it gains quite a lot in terms of down to the wire moments. In a mission I took on because I thought I might be able to handle it when it was higher difficulty, I found myself cut short as I barely scraped out a win and had a lot of injuries and had to wait for them to get better. I wasn't confident in going without a full squad but even when I wanted to, you can't leave to a mission without your leader being healed up. So I had to wait till there was two days left since my leader just recovered his injuries. Since then I keep referring to this moment during dark times as the moment we had to 'Break Bad' and take everything we could of warpstone even if it meant using some units to draw aggro away and perhaps have a chance to save the sacrificial lambs later once we recovered all the warp stone.","March 2","true","46.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As a lifelong devotee to the turn-based classics like XCOM, Jagged Alliance and Silent Storm, I've always wanted the beauty of Necromunda's consequence-laden multiplayer skirmishes brought to the PC - and this game delivers.\n\nAfter two days of owning the title, I've accumulated 17 hours of multiplayer-only battles, and the matches I now have under my belt are without doubt the most memorable strategy gaming experiences I've ever had - even better than playing Necromunda with miniatures. Hell, I'm terrified this game will distract me from my own programming work!\n\nAs everybody will tell you, the third-person movement and control scheme will seem strange at first, but they serve to immerse you more; like how Firaxis' introduction of cinematic shots for dramatic moments did, but better. Warband management is the real-deal Necromunda/Mordheim experience; defeats and victories don't feel so black and white, as even a victor might walk away worse for wear, or - as is the case against a friend - economically poorer for not focusing on resources.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review for a game, but as somebody who's been trying for years to find a multiplayer strategy experience that captures the nuances of the Necromunda/Mordheim systems, and as somebody who's programming a TBS myself, I desperately want this developer to succeed with this product and consider releasing a DLC for some of the fringe-factions.\n\nI implore you to buy it, harass your friends to buy it, and start a small tourney where each of you has a warband that you only pit against each other in multiplayer. You'll have more fun than any other TBS game can offer you right now, at least in the multiplayer aspect.","November 29, 2015","true","160.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

What's not to like?\n\nThis unforgiving game will not hold the punches, and has a learning curve that may cause some players to turn away but in terms of fully customizable Turn Based Strategy I would call this a true gem of the genre and a very fulfilling experience on the whole.  Each battle is tense and demands attention and understanding of your warband's abilities and limitations.  Much of the battle system relies on Random Generated Numbers (So as to stay true to the Game's Origins from Table Top), but in this game strategy is key as you attempt to navigate this deadly city and keep every party member as whole as possible.\n\nIn Mordheim there are no victors, just survivors.","December 5, 2015","true","42.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was originally thrown into the wargaming hobby whilst young and grabbing up a copy of Space Crusade and Warhammer: Quest and I personally always favoured the Games Workshop adaptations that featured tonnes of "fluff", whose being warband campaigns that did not count on you buying the latest or greatest mini's but really becoming immersed into play system that demanded tactics.\n\nOver the years Games Workshop has failed to meet the bar with many of its video game adaptations of its franchises. Blood Bowl was an epic example of how to mismananage, annoy and isoloate an entire sub culture of gamers away from your product by failing to meet basic demands.\n\nMordeim: City of the Damned is however a massive step in the right direction! The gameplay is immersive as ever with rich environments and fantastic graphics, the W,A,S,D controls in third-person rather than a strict "overhead only" approach layer upon another dimension of interactivity and narration. The actions and cut scenes have been carefully crafted to actually look good! The controls are consistent and easy to use, along with being able to grasp the basic rules for the game.\n\nWhat I must commend Rogue Factor on the most is the balancing of the game. Many players threw the Mordheim original rulebook out of the window, because of many broken atrributes, the favoured the fan moderated and constructed 'Coreheim' rules. Rather than using the broken original rules, or further breaking or basterdising rules to fit, Rogue Factor have balanced this gameplay beautifully, making it a pleasure to play.\n\nPlease Rogue Factor, once you have completed this, do Necromunda: Tales of the Underhive.","January 11, 2015","true","11.4"," 40 of 80 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","40","80","0","1"

That first warband you create , use it to learn the basics, but do not get attached. Now ive got a Reiklander band and a Possesed Band and they are life takers!

Take the time to make the adjustments in the options to suit you and have fun ! Im playing on a HP Pavillion laptop that I got a week ago, with no issues . I purchased the two DLC heros and the smuggler is in my  Reiklander warband the " Red Blades". She is a badass! And often saves the day despite twice having Brain damage from combat (one of which times she had an arrow stuck in her head while still fighting, the second occurrence being when she wandered too far at my request, and got jumped by the Sisters of Sigmar, luckily I got her some help in time ) Ive yet to make a Skaven band to use the Globadier with, also Globadiers can work for possesed warbands as well.

After playing a bit I can say I enjoy it, however, it can be annoying at times. With a few corrections and addition of new content this would be an excellent game. My biggest annoyance with the game is the balance. Enemy teams hit much more often than player team. After noticing that I was taking much more damage than I was dealing in the first few games I played I started keeping track. Enemy teams are hitting with about 90% of the time where player team is hitting about 60%. This is off balance and will drive players away when you are facing a team that is supposedly equal (Normal level mission). Particularly when a leader with an 89% hit is beat 1 on 1 by a henchman because of hit rate. Granted that only happened once but you can see the annoyance level.The "random" number generator that governs hits seems to favor high numbers, I noticed that the numbers coming up for hits, ran over 70 very often this is probable but inlikely, which leads me to conclude that it needs adjustment.\nContent - The obvious, more warband types (for me would like wood elves). Missions that are not just fighting another warband would add to the game, go get that cache but oh look there are zombies there dont get scared :)\nAnd the biggest addition for me would be getting rid of ending the mission when enemy warband routes. Makes no sense that it suddenly ends without the chance to loot, gather. I think 2-3 rounds of actions after defeating an enemy warband to allow looting/gathering makes sense. Its not like my warband would just pack up and leave because they beat the enemy, Warbands are there to gather resources and fulfill missions. quite often there is a bed of warpstone and I route the enemy and can not get it as game ends.\nOverall good , enjoyable, tactical game.

Represented in this game currently are the forces of The Empire, Skaven, Cult of the Possessed, and the Sisters of Sigmar.  With those four factions there is tons of content already built into the game with a lot of replay factor that goes along with it all.\n\nI purchased this game in its pre-order beta rough days and have watched it grow to become quite the diamond.  The devs have used their time judiciously and have listened to a lot of feedback in the process.\n\nI am really hoping that this game grows in popularity, and that other faction's warbands get representation.  Dark Elves, Dwarves, Beastmen, Lizardmen (my favorite), Tomb Guardians, Witch Hunters (Empire), and you can't leave out Orcs!!!\n\nAll in all I give the game 4 out of 5.

Seamless integration of Single and Multiplayer combat. So you beat the main campaign, and routinely  trash the AI on every map. You're good, right? So you try a multiplayer battle and get your ♥♥♥ handed back to you on a platter.

I was expecting this game to either me meh or just be another cash in. What I got was a beautiful turn based experience where I feel attached to my men and women, without ever feeling cheated like I do in XCOM and Blood Bowl. Everything you do means something and you need to meet a deadline so it gains quite a lot in terms of down to the wire moments. In a mission I took on because I thought I might be able to handle it when it was higher difficulty, I found myself cut short as I barely scraped out a win and had a lot of injuries and had to wait for them to get better. I wasn't confident in going without a full squad but even when I wanted to, you can't leave to a mission without your leader being healed up. So I had to wait till there was two days left since my leader just recovered his injuries. Since then I keep referring to this moment during dark times as the moment we had to 'Break Bad' and take everything we could of warpstone even if it meant using some units to draw aggro away and perhaps have a chance to save the sacrificial lambs later once we recovered all the warp stone.","March 2","true","46.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was originally thrown into the wargaming hobby whilst young and grabbing up a copy of Space Crusade and Warhammer: Quest and I personally always favoured the Games Workshop adaptations that featured tonnes of "fluff", whose being warband campaigns that did not count on you buying the latest or greatest mini's but really becoming immersed into play system that demanded tactics.\n\nOver the years Games Workshop has failed to meet the bar with many of its video game adaptations of its franchises. Blood Bowl was an epic example of how to mismananage, annoy and isoloate an entire sub culture of gamers away from your product by failing to meet basic demands.\n\nMordeim: City of the Damned is however a massive step in the right direction! The gameplay is immersive as ever with rich environments and fantastic graphics, the W,A,S,D controls in third-person rather than a strict "overhead only" approach layer upon another dimension of interactivity and narration. The actions and cut scenes have been carefully crafted to actually look good! The controls are consistent and easy to use, along with being able to grasp the basic rules for the game.\n\nWhat I must commend Rogue Factor on the most is the balancing of the game. Many players threw the Mordheim original rulebook out of the window, because of many broken atrributes, the favoured the fan moderated and constructed 'Coreheim' rules. Rather than using the broken original rules, or further breaking or basterdising rules to fit, Rogue Factor have balanced this gameplay beautifully, making it a pleasure to play.\n\nPlease Rogue Factor, once you have completed this, do Necromunda: Tales of the Underhive.","January 11, 2015","true","11.4"," 40 of 80 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","40","80","0","1"

If you understand what that means, this should be an auto-purchase.\n+First person turn based works awesomely, I've never seen it done like this before and I think it really fits the game. The developers clearly put a lot of work into those environments (They look amazing) and first person really compliments that well.\n+All 4 Warbands are interesting and fun in their own way.

This game is the latter.. AMAZING. Mordheim takes the combat system of Valkyria: Chronicles, the unit customization of X-Com, psychology system of darkest dungeon, the unforgivability of an Ironman Mode and throws into a interesting story with an immersive atmosphere. As a note, I'm not a fan of 40k/warhammer etc. and have never played the tabletop.. Yet I love this game. I'd write more but I linked a video below that says it all.\n\nTL;DR -\n\nPro's -\nRPG progression\nGreat Combat System\nUnit Movement is intuitive\nIn-game Currency/Management system is well balanced\nPvP is intense\nReal concequences\nGood Story\nAmazing Aestetics\nImmersive atmosphere\nGood Customization of Units\n\nCons -\nAI is stupid\nSteep Learning Curve\nIronman Mode\nContinuous Autosave prevents you from taking back a mistake\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2qe6yY6aL0\n\nThere is a very steep learning curve which may put off the majority of casual players. I went through about 30 hours of loosing my entire warband (4 restarts) and having to start all over before I finally achieved a successful combination of soldiers. Of course once I learned the basics.. exploiting the AI became incredibly easy. 98% success rate on missions. Which leaves PvP for the challenge, and yes it is a challenge with real rewards and real consequences.\n\nThe Ironman mode you will find yourself in is Unforgiving. If your character gets critically hit (your standard high dmg crit in any game) he will suffer a permanent injury. By permanent injury, I mean he will loose an eye and have -10% chance to hit for the rest of the game, or loose an arm and never be able to dual wield or use a 2hander. He could loose a leg and never be able to climb again (Which is really important in this game). You will find yourself becoming the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ company man and firing any worker who gets hurt lol.\n\nThe movement system is amazing, just like in valkyria chronicles. You will recieve strategy points which can be used for certain types of active skills (Parry stance, climb, leap, jump down, etc.) or for movement. Each character has it's own movement radius based on his agility stats and gear equiped. Movement itself consumes 1 point giving you a radius to within, moving past the radius consumes another strategy point automatically. Early in the game you will have 4-6 strategy points while fully leveled up characters will have 7-12 points. Didnt get to the position you wanted this turn? Simply run back through your waypoints and get your Strategy points refunded.\n\nThe combat system is amazing","February 21","true","242.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Do not be put off by only four factions, as even with four factions the variety is mindboggling.\n\n2. Combat is fun, and differs quite significantly from faction to faction. While the limited number of maps and objectives might get a little stale after a while, the actual process of chopping your opponents to pieces (or shooting them to tatters) doesn't get old.\n\n3. Seamless integration of Single and Multiplayer combat. So you beat the main campaign, and routinely  trash the AI on every map. You're good, right? So you try a multiplayer battle and get your ♥♥♥ handed back to you on a platter. You lick your wounds, play a few more single player battles to get some money and replace lost equipment and crippled teammates, then you go back into MP and whoop somebody else. Or get whooped. Either way, well done.\n\nCons:\n1. As I said earlier, there isn't a huge variety of maps and objectives. That hurts the game a little.\n\n2. Minor graphic glitches and long loading times. Nothing gamebreaking, but somewhat annoying.\n\nFinal verdict.\nDefinitely get it if:\nYou are a fan of the Warhammer universe, or tactical squad based games or even Blood Bowl.","February 9","true","37.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Your warband has to be resilient, every diligent and most importantly....not too greedy!\n\nAs a long time fan of GW's Warhammer Fantasy this game definitely grabs the atmosphere of the Old World and smashes into your brain while you make a dizzying effort to navigate the streets of Mordheim.  Represented in this game currently are the forces of The Empire, Skaven, Cult of the Possessed, and the Sisters of Sigmar.  With those four factions there is tons of content already built into the game with a lot of replay factor that goes along with it all.\n\nI purchased this game in its pre-order beta rough days and have watched it grow to become quite the diamond.  The devs have used their time judiciously and have listened to a lot of feedback in the process.\n\nI am really hoping that this game grows in popularity, and that other faction's warbands get representation.  Dark Elves, Dwarves, Beastmen, Lizardmen (my favorite), Tomb Guardians, Witch Hunters (Empire), and you can't leave out Orcs!!!\n\nAll in all I give the game 4 out of 5.  The learning curve is steep, but to be honest, you can download the Mordheim Living manual and learn everything you need to know about game play and then find that the devs have done a great job representing the gameplay and concepts here.\n\nFor Sigmar!\n","February 14","true","22.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After playing a bit I can say I enjoy it, however, it can be annoying at times. With a few corrections and addition of new content this would be an excellent game. My biggest annoyance with the game is the balance. Enemy teams hit much more often than player team. After noticing that I was taking much more damage than I was dealing in the first few games I played I started keeping track. Enemy teams are hitting with about 90% of the time where player team is hitting about 60%. This is off balance and will drive players away when you are facing a team that is supposedly equal (Normal level mission). Particularly when a leader with an 89% hit is beat 1 on 1 by a henchman because of hit rate. Granted that only happened once but you can see the annoyance level.The "random" number generator that governs hits seems to favor high numbers, I noticed that the numbers coming up for hits, ran over 70 very often this is probable but inlikely, which leads me to conclude that it needs adjustment.\nContent - The obvious, more warband types (for me would like wood elves). Missions that are not just fighting another warband would add to the game, go get that cache but oh look there are zombies there dont get scared :)\nAnd the biggest addition for me would be getting rid of ending the mission when enemy warband routes. Makes no sense that it suddenly ends without the chance to loot, gather. I think 2-3 rounds of actions after defeating an enemy warband to allow looting/gathering makes sense. Its not like my warband would just pack up and leave because they beat the enemy, Warbands are there to gather resources and fulfill missions. quite often there is a bed of warpstone and I route the enemy and can not get it as game ends.\nOverall good , enjoyable, tactical game. That needs tweeking and added content.","February 21","true","33.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It took me seven warbands to even get out of the blocks but that is becasue it is a learning experience.  Now I've got the hang of how to bring my squad together and focussing on preparing the battle ground that I want I can make pretty good progress.  That said it is still not a case of rinse and repeat.  If I make a mistake I get punished, and severley.  Yes the RNG can be punitive but it cuts both ways - Hero caught out in the open about to get mashed by a leader and hero from the enemy and then my lowly archer on the roof gets a stun on both bad guys in same round.  Without RNG that could never happen - I think the game gives you more extreme highs and lows as a result but I kind of like that.\n\nMy biggest problem so far is that I cannot for the life of me see how I will ever amass enough cash to be able to skill up - got tons of skill points available but never have any money to be able to apply them.  Maybe it will get better in time.  Always seem to end up in combat very quickly and get a rout before I collect a fraction of the loot.\n\nI don't know the table top game or the Lore surrounding it but I hope we get DLC where I can have Greenskin and Ork warbands.  On warbands I should add that I'm not wild about the warband representations.  I've got a chaos crew who I think look the best of the bunch.  Think the Mercenaries (particularly the starting Hero unit) look like they'd fall over if you sneezed on them and why are there now mixed gender groupings?

The graphics are not super duper but in fact they are good because they chose to use an art style depicting ugly faces and dirty looks rather than a cartoonish shiny clean design such as world of warcraft or lets admit it, bioware recent games. In that regard they remain quite loyal to what you could expect from warhammer fantasy.\nThere aint much customization or cosmetic options lets face it, and there is no open world as such to explore. Instead you got a city in ruins and you make daily runs to gather stones, weapons and scavenge whatever you can while trying to saty alive. A bit like holidays in Chernobyl. With ratmen. And chaos followers, and feminazi women, and some men inbetween (4 factions: skaven ratmen, chaos cultists, sisters of something holy and human mercenaries -the good guys-).\nThe campaign offers an open ending allowing you to continue playing and customizing your ideal warband in whatever way you want (there are  a lot of interesting builds and things to experiment with in the 10 levels each character can get). And this is for me one of the best aspects of the game which made me decide to buy it.\nThe combat itself is completelly turn based, despite some videos showing the typical wasd movement (which is a translation of the tabletop game of your hand moving the miniatures using their available strategy points).\nThe story, while simple (simple is bestest) is quite interesting: you lead a warband and you gather STUFF while putting your life at risk to sell it to rich people who, in exchange, pays you a misery or kills you if you do not get the stone orders in time.  Genius.\nFor me most of the fun of this game, apart of the combat and feeling of total loss when one of my men dies is the histories you can imagine yourself while playing a hard match and managing to survive or at least win marginally to return to your base with a bunch of wyrdstone, and one or two arms less. You get to like each and every one of your mercenaries or ratmen or whatever fantasy fetish stereotype you are into.\n\nI know its a bit messy review but most of the good things have been said in other posts so you can read those too.\n\nAll in all, probably my best purchase of 2015 in terms of raw pure fun and 0 dissapointment.\nTotally recomended as long as you are slightly patient and dont have mental issues with RNG. This is the kind of game you can play and stop whenever you want to do any real life thing or just stay playing telling yourself "just one more turn". It has some ocassional bugs but nothing a reload cant fix (for me at elast).","January 15","true","434.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

That would almost make someone instantly change their mind about buying this game. Why aren't their more positive reviews up front for people to see? And steam, shouldn't the out dated reviews be moved down the list so people can see reviews about the current version? (I know iPhone and iPad app store only keep reviews about the current version.)\n\nIn my opinion, the recent patch totally fixed most of the RNG problems and a bunch other glitches. About people who said that their character "missed 5 95% shots in a row ". I'm gonna make an arguement. First of all, max level (10) leaders and heros have 9 offense points, which are enough for 4 one-handed hits or 3 two-handed hits. If your heros or headers are using ranged weapon, they could do 3 gun shots or 4 bow shots. A max level impressive warrior also has 9 offensive points, so 4 hits also. So I don't understand where you got those 5 shots.... So why don't you guys be a responsible reviewer and remove those negative reviews that are not true to the current version any more?

The only problem im having is that the urge to keep tweeking and playing my warbands is all consuming , and I have to force myself to take breaks from the game. Take the time to make the adjustments in the options to suit you and have fun ! Im playing on a HP Pavillion laptop that I got a week ago, with no issues . I purchased the two DLC heros and the smuggler is in my  Reiklander warband the " Red Blades". She is a badass! And often saves the day despite twice having Brain damage from combat (one of which times she had an arrow stuck in her head while still fighting, the second occurrence being when she wandered too far at my request, and got jumped by the Sisters of Sigmar, luckily I got her some help in time ) Ive yet to make a Skaven band to use the Globadier with, also Globadiers can work for possesed warbands as well. The smuggler can work for the Sisters of Sigmar likewise. To the Devs, thanks for a great game!  I look forward to the upcomming warbands !","February 7","true","90.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Basitins_rule/recommended/276810/","Basitins_rule","The Mad Dok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Basitins_rule/","51 products in account","Mordheim: City of the Damned is a Masochist wet dream.\n\nThis game is possibly the funnest time you will have getting your a** handed to you on a silver platter especially late game. This game has a entire list of just painful factors that'll leave you rage quiting after every game you play, but like an abused girlfriend, you'll just keep coming back for more hoping to pull off those tight decisive victories and bloody battles that make you cheer alongside your warband.\n\nNow Mordheim is a game that doesn't go easy on you and one bad mistake could cause your entire warband to be brutally defeated and lose you the game. Just to list a few, AI is tough and they will hammer as many soldiers as they can into a battle line just to take you down. Not a problem, but you'll be fighting against harsh RNG that definitely favors the AI in most fights. Criticals could knock out warriors leaving them completely vulnerable to even more hits, the AI will dodge what feels like every other hit you make before delivering their own blows that'll have your guys hurting or REALLY hurting. If you think that's cruel, the enemy doesn't have to kill everyone, only enough of your warband to bring your moral down till you route, which can be typicall 3-5 of your guys in a warband of 6-8.\n\nGood news though, the enemy warband can also break, instantly winning you the battle. The Bad news is if the enemy breaks, you lose out on completing any optional objectives that are vital for leveling up your warband. "Complete optional objectives before you fight" I hear you say, which would work except you forgot about the brutal AI enemy that'll block, charge, and murder your warband if you try to run around them, or would route before you could kill enough enemies to get on to completing the objectives.\n\nAfter a battle, you'll have to deal with managing your warband, paying for their service and any medical bills from them getting injured, outfitting them with better gear, customizing them a bit, training new abilities. If a warrior is injured, they could be out of service for days which means you won't be able to fight with them, which is painful if you're leader becomes injured.\n\nAnd to put icing on this hot-tamali cake, you have a timer! Throughout the campaign you will be required to pay your Warbands sponsor/leader/murder-lord shipments of Wyrdstone which you will collect during missions and receive a bit after a mission. And not small shipments, HUGE shipments of over a hundred pounds of Wyrdstone must be filled in the manner of 2 weeks, and every shipment will be larger than the last. If you fail to fill these shipment requests (I believe twice), you lose the game. Game over, Warband disbanded, please try again.\n\n....oh ya. And the game auto saves so no loading an old save if you lose, cheater.\n\n\nNOW for AAALLLL of that...it's still a really good game and very, very rewarding when you win. The RNG is effected by a lot of skills you earn from leveling up that can swing things more in your favor. A clever player can usually lock down enemies and swoop around with faster troops to gather the wyrdstone and I've noticed wyrdstone piles seem to grow more fruitful as the game progresses so fulfilling those requests for your sponsor/leader/murder-lord never trully get's impossible. If you manage skills right and make sure to pull your soldiers out if they're hurting, you can avoid a lot of problems down the line. Optional objectives are still tough but smart planning (and a little luck) can achieve you a decisive victory.\n\nProbably what I have to say though most for the fun factor is that it's tough, but never impossible. The feeling you get from just having enough gold to pay for one more battle, to just barely pay off the request with one more day to go. To pull of a clutch victory from the grasp of defeat  or see you're warriors beat down a powerful enemy who seems so impossing is so satisfying. It's what makes the game so good. It isn't being defeated and restarting from a checkpoint.\n\nThis game isn't about how hard you hit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!","April 4","true","62.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I would love to recommend it to people, but sadly i cannot in its current form.  If your looking for a game that is fair or at the least plays by the same rules you have to, then keep moving.  This game is designed from the ground up to be unfair towards the player.  All because they are unable to make an even remotely decent A.I.  You WILL miss 9/10 attacks, even when they have a 95% chance to hit,  Meanwhile the enemy will roll 5's all day so they get multiple criticals and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hits in a row.  I don't have a problem with RNG.  It is obvious however when playing this game that the deck is severaly stacked.  I wouldn't doubt if there is a 50% chance on every roll to add 30 or more to your roll.  You will NEVER roll a 1 or anything near it.  You will however roll 85-95 on every other roll.  This wouldn't be a problem if they allowed you to choose if you wanted high or low rolls to be good, however that is sadly not the case.  On top of that, every match that you do really well on(complete all the objectives/no one is taken out of action) you will,for no reason, still have 1-3 heros with wounds that have to sit out for several days.   In case you are wondering if im just a baddie at the game, i have yet to lose a round yet.  Despite all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that causes me to curse and scream in fury at this game, it still cant manage to beat me.  Thats how BAD the A.I is.  They will walk the opposite direction of the nearest ally/enemy fighting to go stand in a random doorway and try to ambush something. Despite the fact no one is in that direction.  This means instead of feeling like you had a good match, or that perhaps you made a mistake and could learn from it and improve, you instead just got RNG'd.  The same goes for improving your characters.  You want to put a hero in heavy armor? Well, too bad.  You sure as hell aren't gonna be able to buy it from the shop.  Wanna two-handed sword instead of an axe? Well, F*ck you.  You damn better hope an enemy in one of the upcoming matches has one, and is stupid enough to rush you by himself so that after killing him you can actually loot the body.  Cause if his teamates are around you wont be able to stand close enough to loot it,  Do you want a specific enchant on your weapon or armor? Again, you can just f*ck off.  There is an amazing amount of them to choose from.  To bad they only way to get them is RNG from a mission reward unless you just so happen to want one of the horrible ones offered by the other factions.   Also what the hell is with the RNG time on deleveries?  Sure the last time you sent a shipment to the pit you were paid the next day.  This time?   Well its gonna take about 3 days.  Really?  You will never have enough gold to train the skills and spellls you want.  You will find yourself selling a ridiculous amount of looted treasure and stone, just to pay and heal up the scrubs on your team that get injured from stubbing their toe,  On top of that, why the hell do i have to pay these idiots AND supply the equipment for em?  Can they not supply their own tools/weapons and armor? Maybe the fact i've paid these idiots in the neighborhood of 500g a piece would mean they could pay for their own damn training and weapons?  Also spellcasting is useless in this game, unless you consider risking doing 9999 damage to yourself to MAYBE succeed in casting a spell that MIGHT reduce a random stat.(or other equally uselss spell.)  I kid you not.  Not even the 10th time i try to cast a spell and my only caster,and leader, manages to one shot himself.  I mean come the hell on.  Meanwhile the only negative you will ever see an enemy caster get is the on that just so happens to stun himself and EVERYONE near him.  "Oh, so his spell failed to cast, so my leader and two heros are now stunned,  Great,\n\n\nTl;Dr :  If you ever see a programmer respond to this saying they have looked at the ♥♥♥♥ poor rng, buy the game, Otherwise this is just another Vermintide.  It looks like warhammer, almost feels like warhammer, and is only fun to die hard fans, and even then only briefly,","February 26","false","46.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Then watch them die and become disfigured rendering your whole warband essentially worthless.  You could argue this is an attempt to reflect the Mordheim miniature game, which can be pretty brutal, but knowing it is pretty brutal, in the miniature game you can volentarily rout a mission pretty early on when you see the situation is hopeless and minimize casualties.

The hired swords costing as much as 650 coins at level 3 is completely uncalled for that makes no sense If someone has that much spare money that warband is much past the use of a level 3 character with the constant upholding of payments you're required to do, I realize the developers are going for progression and that feeling of accomplishment but the reason the most voted helpful comment is negative and with many of the same complaints is because that's simply the case and the percentages shown are not accurate, to not factor in the dodge chance or some other factor into the deciding player's action is unfair you're missing shots that are 1/20 consistently because you didn't have the information and now you have to fire a level 10 character because the stupidity checks he now has make him useless more than 70% of the time\nIt simply creates the feeling or helplessness which is the worst thing a player can feel in a game, Some cool ideas could be presented to fix some of these, Mercenaries could use Steam Punk limbs as replacements at a price, Cult could have Skeletal limbs using magic from the "Shadowlord" the Skaven could have re-attached limbs threw sewing like the rat Ogre its just that the Helpless feeling needs a supliment and my gameplay shouldn't be permanently destroyed by some streak of bad luck it simply isn't acceptable because I love the game I've always been a Warhammer fan and I can't tell anyone to spend 40 dollars on something they're going to get that feeling from","January 9","false","51.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Low and behold I'm wrong. I was severly disappointed seeing not once but twice, in a row, my leaders get brutally destroyed. I would be more forgiving had it not blatantly been the OP AI. I can not at all recommend a game that is buffing the AI instead of just adding in a bit more code. My mercanie, using sword shield, is fighting right now with back up. Misses a 73% charg, ok I just came back not like it's going to be like that all the time. Get smacked in the face by a two hander for 48 damage, 1/3 of my health is gone and the enemy didn't even have a buff. Dread instantly sets in seeing the enemy leader now whip a corner, he has a mace and shield. Ok not going to be so bad my guy might still survive this! Get charged, ok I'm in 44% parry stance, charges are usually pretty low with 60-70% of hitting I should be able to parry, I mean, RNG was supposedly re-worked! Nope, 45 damage + stun on a charge. Another attack followed by it and leader already dead on a normal in my FIRST GAME. Oh my guy was able to get ONE hit off, a 22 damage hit. Now the enemy leader was buffed, he had green (not white) damage indicators but for a 100% damage increase buff? ok that's just dandy why bother with this mission. I was literally forced to restart on the first god dam mission. This isn't hardcore, this is just set up for player failure! THAT'S NOT HARDCORE!\n\nSo far, from teh two restarts that I had RNG is still blatantly in favor of the AI as they never once missed out of their 10-12 hits on me while I had a 2/4 chance of hitting majority being 80% of hitting. Difficulty is still blatantly lying to your face about "normal" missions which really just means enemies are tougher, more health and damage. That's not what normal means in most games, normal means a fair battlefield everyone is equal not AI are heavily favored and buffed. I could forgive the game for buffing (even though it's a 45% ♥♥♥♥ing buff) on Brutal and deadly, the ones that are meant to be a challenge and far more difficult. Normal should not though and it makes the game far more frustrating especially when piled on top of the unforgiving punishments and RNG. The die rolls for dodge/parry are different from hit chances. They do not affect each other, at all. It's more along the lines if you rolled a hit but your opponent rolled a dodge, the dodge will over right the hit. I'm going to the feedback forums themselves and see if something might be going on, a bug or glitch mayhap with this RNG since it's supposedly fixed.\n\nAll in All the game is still buggy, hopefully that's the case, or clearly throwing over powering AI at you to compensate for it's failure of "hardcore". I'm still going to play it due to my love and adoration for Warhammer but to recommend this game to someone else is just something I can't live with. I keep hearing it gets better as you survive and play but my question is, how can it get better when I can't even get past the first day?\n\nedit: it's becoming more and more difficult to keep this review from a scathing hate review. The RNG is becoming more notible in just either being "oh my god I can hit everything!" to "I'm missing 95% all the time and my 70% dodge is NEVER dodging!". This will never be in the case of the AI however which is the most infuriating part, they seem unaffected by any form of faultiness, they'll have a miss here and there but it doesn't occur often. If you want a game that's a challenge, fun, and rewarding go play Xcom, this game just offers the challenge but none of the reward or fun.","January 14","false","23.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Low and behold I'm wrong. I was severly disappointed seeing not once but twice, in a row, my leaders get brutally destroyed. I would be more forgiving had it not blatantly been the OP AI. I can not at all recommend a game that is buffing the AI instead of just adding in a bit more code. My mercanie, using sword shield, is fighting right now with back up. Misses a 73% charg, ok I just came back not like it's going to be like that all the time. Get smacked in the face by a two hander for 48 damage, 1/3 of my health is gone and the enemy didn't even have a buff. Dread instantly sets in seeing the enemy leader now whip a corner, he has a mace and shield. Ok not going to be so bad my guy might still survive this! Get charged, ok I'm in 44% parry stance, charges are usually pretty low with 60-70% of hitting I should be able to parry, I mean, RNG was supposedly re-worked! Nope, 45 damage + stun on a charge. Another attack followed by it and leader already dead on a normal in my FIRST GAME. Oh my guy was able to get ONE hit off, a 22 damage hit. Now the enemy leader was buffed, he had green (not white) damage indicators but for a 100% damage increase buff? ok that's just dandy why bother with this mission. I was literally forced to restart on the first god dam mission. This isn't hardcore, this is just set up for player failure! THAT'S NOT HARDCORE!\n\nSo far, from teh two restarts that I had RNG is still blatantly in favor of the AI as they never once missed out of their 10-12 hits on me while I had a 2/4 chance of hitting majority being 80% of hitting. Difficulty is still blatantly lying to your face about "normal" missions which really just means enemies are tougher, more health and damage. That's not what normal means in most games, normal means a fair battlefield everyone is equal not AI are heavily favored and buffed. I could forgive the game for buffing (even though it's a 45% ♥♥♥♥ing buff) on Brutal and deadly, the ones that are meant to be a challenge and far more difficult. Normal should not though and it makes the game far more frustrating especially when piled on top of the unforgiving punishments and RNG. The die rolls for dodge/parry are different from hit chances. They do not affect each other, at all. It's more along the lines if you rolled a hit but your opponent rolled a dodge, the dodge will over right the hit. I'm going to the feedback forums themselves and see if something might be going on, a bug or glitch mayhap with this RNG since it's supposedly fixed.\n\nAll in All the game is still buggy, hopefully that's the case, or clearly throwing over powering AI at you to compensate for it's failure of "hardcore". I'm still going to play it due to my love and adoration for Warhammer but to recommend this game to someone else is just something I can't live with. I keep hearing it gets better as you survive and play but my question is, how can it get better when I can't even get past the first day?\n\nedit: it's becoming more and more difficult to keep this review from a scathing hate review. The RNG is becoming more notible in just either being "oh my god I can hit everything!" to "I'm missing 95% all the time and my 70% dodge is NEVER dodging!". This will never be in the case of the AI however which is the most infuriating part, they seem unaffected by any form of faultiness, they'll have a miss here and there but it doesn't occur often. If you want a game that's a challenge, fun, and rewarding go play Xcom, this game just offers the challenge but none of the reward or fun.","January 14","false","23.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The aesthetics of the terrain/buildings are very nice though, and in theme with the Warhammer world. On topic of animations, the trap and parry/dodge stance animations are a little on the long side, and the stance animations are a little odd looking.\n\nFor the most part though, I very much enjoy this game. The character leveling is fairly deep, actually deeper than the source material I think (I admit, never played table-top Mordheim, but I've got experience with tabletop Warhammer Fantasy, the two being very similar). There could be a lot more variety in mission types, and deployment is kinda clumsy, but game-play overall is fun.\n\nIt should be noted too that the game suffers from XCOM-itis, in that RNG can really hose you from time to time.\n\nWould I recommend? Absolutely. And I am.\n\nI hope that the devs release more warbands.. I'd love to try the Witchhunters and IUndead.

If you are into it, it also offers (limited) optical customization options for your soldiers.\nThe turn-based battles are VERY intense. You always end up thinking about the best placement of your troops. "Should I run back to my cart with my leader or hero and get rid of the warpstones that cripple him in combat? If I do that, then my weaker characters will be without backup."\nDecisions are hard to make and they are always final. Your high level master Skaven assassin might end up loosing an arm in battle, thus rendering him nearly useless in the future (only one one-handed weapon, no shields, no climbing, etc.), and so on.\nBashing this game for too much RNG is absolutely stupid, since it is an adaption of a table top game played with ... tadaaa ... DICE! Saying it is too difficult, because it doesn't allow to "save scum" is also pretty useless. If your people get slaughtered, then it happens in 90% of the cases due to wrong decisions made by the player. In the original table top version you cannot undo your turns, either. It is an honest adaption, although it lacks content compared to the original (a lot of warbands still missing, etc.). This is definitely NOT a game you will finish in one or two attempts in one afternoon and that's exactly what I love about it.\nIt is like playing a Warhammer/X-Com mix with permanent iron man mode.\nIt is glorious!\nGraphics are neat. They are not impressive, but they catch the atmosphere well enough and do a good job. That also means that this game runs on weaker machines with 4 GB of RAM and any 1 GB GPU.","March 30","true","70.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I dont mind a challenge but most of the campaign misssions are impossible even when labeled "Normal". Normal is RARE btw even starting out. As for the the roll system based off of a percent% ...  I would very much like to see what i rolled seeing how i can attack someone with an 80% chance three times in a row and miss every time like the odds were NEVER in my favor. Some hidden thing not accounted for. I wouldnt be saying anything if it wasnt for my guy falling off a wall ment to climb ALSO three times in a row with HIGH chances of success and finially getting up there with half his health missing. wow. This game makes me want to destroy my computer out of frustration and not out of the lack of skill. Am i the only one who feels this way? I once started a mission only for a 300 hp demon to roll out of the door next to my starting area and kill everything while IF my guys hit her at ALL it was for 15points. Oh that was also a normal mission btw had to scout out twice to find something that wasnt HARD or above. Also Second day of the Campaign.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LupusArcticus/recommended/276810/","LupusArcticus","Lupus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LupusArcticus/","153 products in account","If you were expecting a faithful interpretation of the original tabletop game then prepare for disappointment for this is not the game you're looking for. The only similarities between this game and the original are that you're playing a warband management and battle game that has character progression, random loot tables and is set in GW universe's Mordheim. Deeper inspection, however, reveals that even these shared attributes are more dissimilar than they are similar.\n\nI'll start with my number one grievance with the game that is also the main thing you'll spend your time on: combat.\n\nThe combat in the tabletop Mordheim is about odds calculation, risk assessment and careful positioning that aims to maximize the risks your opponent must take while minimizing your own. There's strategic beauty and elegance to this general concept that reveals itself to you when you start to comprehend the multitude of variables and see the matrix open before your eyes.\n\nIn the PC game, however, you have no easy way of assessing how far you can move and you have no idea about the ranges of attacks and abilities. The camera is set behind the character whose turn it is, and despite the function that lets you see the entire map from above, you generally struggle to get an idea where you are and how to get where you want. Often you waste several turns just trying to navigate out of a multi-level house because there are only couple of set points you can jump down from and you can't openly inspect the map to find them. Sufficient information is simply not provided to you, which forces you to adapt a trial and error approach, which erodes any strategic merits the game might have otherwise had.\n\nThe game also uses its own way of calculating hit chance, damage, armor saves, stats and even health that differ entirely from the tabletop game, making the game less accessible for us experienced with tabletop Mordheim.  Fair enough, the tabletop version is by no means perfect, byt why would you replace that system with something alien, more complex, and arguably, even worse?\n\nAs if all of this wasn't enough the developers also added a horrible UI that makes even the simple task of charging an enemy a fiddly process that requires you to move your character back and forth to find the right distance from the enemy to enable the action. Each character also has their own 'bubble' that stops you from taking actions if you enter them, making positioning a constant nightmare, especially since, as mentioned above, you have no sense of ranges.\n\nAnd then we have the A.I... I really don't get it why the devs get this so wrong so often. No, you can't make up for bad A.I. by giving it an artificial advantage over the player in form of better stats and gear. That's the cheap way of doing it and ends up with A.I. that is is incredibly unrewarding and frustrating to face but at the same time easily abuseable. I'd go so far as to say that even if all the other issues were ignored the terrible state of the A.I. alone makes the campaign mode unplayable.\n\nThe final insult to us who now prefer PC versions over the tabletop games because the real life version takes too much time, is make us wait for the A.I. to finish all its moves, slowly, one character at a time, even when the movement is not visible to the player... Why would you make your players wait and stare at the screen for nothing?\n\nThe thing I personally enjoy the most in these type of games is the leveling and character management system. I just love seeing my guys advance, get new skill and stats, better gear etc. Unfortunately, this was also ruined by a stat restricted system that forces you to spend vast amounts of gold and several campaign turns to learn a new skill. You can't exactly go fight without your leader, and each wasted turn makes it harder for you to complete the time based objectives the game gives you.\n\nIf I sound needlessly harsh it's because I am tired. Tired of seeing developers time and time again waste golden opportunities by taking something with good concept and great theme and then, rather than improving on the original games while staying as faithful as possible, proceed to s*it all over it and give birth to an abomination only Clan Moulder packlords could appreciate.","April 10","false","7.0"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","17","35","0","1"

If it does i'll certainly change my review to positive, but at the moment, despite a lot that's good in the game design, good atmosphere and good graphics, there are some annoying design flaws and some basic necessities lacking.\n\nIf i could i'd have given it a neutral review at the moment, as a i like a lot of things about it, despite being frustrated by several others, but Steam only allows positive or negative.\n\nThe atmosphere is good and some design choices are good too - e.g being unarmoured gives less protection from damage if you're hit, but it also gives a higher chance of dodging attacks - and of climbing and jumping successfully.\n\nThe AI is pretty good - not perfect - but about as good as I am at any rate.\n\nHowever some other design choices do not work.\n\nThe amount of equipment characters can lose from being knocked out in battle is excessive, as are some of the permanent injuries. You can play say 8 missions with a warband in the single player campaign, win 7 heavily, then lose so much equipment from one defeat that your campaign is over.\n\n(EDIT : Above not entirely true - once you've played enough of the game, even if you lose campaigns, you get Veteran Skills for all your warbands, which include some giving you a 5% chance over so much time of getting free armour, but still, armour is rarer than it should be imo)\n\nThis is even more so, as , even if you do have money, the shop frequently has literally nothing to buy in it - and even when it does have anything to buy, sometimes very little, and  rarely much armour.\n\nThe penalties for abandoning even a single player campaign mission are often equally campaign-ending. I abandoned one mission and practically my whole gang were injured as a result, even though none had even lost any significant number of hitpoints in the part of the mission i played.\n\nOne hero ended up losing an arm, while my only archer developed megalomania, meaning he could no onger use missile weapons - and he was pretty high level at this point.\n\nThis is made even worse by the lack of any save game function in for single player campaign - so if you get one disastrous mission you can't reload from before it and try again, you have to start the campaign from scratch with a new warband.\n\nThe game has included the variety of set ups from the original tabletop miniatures game, but, while these worked well for the tabletop game, they don't all work in the computer game. For instance when one side is deployed inside buildings in the tabletop game, they can leave them quickly and easily in a single turn. But some of the computer game buildings are confusing mazes that can take a while to get out of at all.\n\nThe overhead map you can switch the view to in battles now makes it a bit closer to the tabletop game - but unfortunately the map is sometimes misleading, showing what are actually rows of houses that can't be entered or crossed to look like they are a drop or have gaps them in - and this can result in defeat in some missions because you just can't find how to get half your warband to where the fighting is.\n\nThe 'ambush' stance in battles allows for "ambushers" to "ambush" while standing in the open. I've even had enemies run up to within two feet of me in plain sight in the open, go into ambush stance - and when i move the two feet to attack them they "ambush" me , attack first and cause my character a "surprised" penalty. This encourages sitting back and waiting over attacking, as if you stand back and ambush, you will almost certainly get all the first blows in, whereas if you attack first, the enemy will often get the first blows in using ambush.\n\nThe zones of control around your own warband's members can often block the movement and attacks of other members of your own warband, which is pretty bizarre and annoying at times in narrow streets. Sometimes you can get round this by climbing up nearby buildings and moving some warriors round to attack the enemy from behind - and this is fine. Other times this is impossible though, depends on the luck of the randomly generated maps.\n\nWhile you can increase the stats of members of your gang by just getting experience, for some reason getting skills from experience also requires crazy amounts of gold that make giving characters skills not practical, which seems like a bad design choice too.\n\nThe interface for equipping your warband members is strange and not intuitive in some ways - e.g to buy armour for a warband member from their equipment screen you need to click on the equipment slot . then on the shop, then the equipment slot that piece of armour or weapon goes in again.\n\nProbably even most of these problems would be ok at least for the single player campaign though, if it had a save game function you could use before a mission.","April 22","false","65.4"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

You can only place your models in the gameplay third person view. So you have to switch between, the gameplay view and the tactical view, about a 30 times when placing your troops. In the third person view you have no idea where you are ofcourse. And it doesn't help that even if know who/what model you are placing, because the UI doesn't really tell you in the beginning.

Literally, at all...\nAnd there seems to be a glitch as to when your player gets to have turns because I just played a game where I didn't get to move one of my guys the entire match and he was just getting hit over and over even though I had parry enabled.\nNo one plays it or is willing to wait for matchmaking (if it actually works I don't know) to come to fruition because I never found a human player to play against and ended up just playing AI.\nThere's no tutorial of any sort or direction on how the GUI or skill tree works or anything like that so you just kinda figure it'll come after you gain experience somehow or something... no real way to know how to do anything until you hit buttons and try stuff out and decide that something did what you thought it was suppose to do.\nPlus one of my players was stuck in a building all by himself.  There was an invisible wall where the staircase was and a door behind that wouldn't open so one of my players was just sitting in a room by himself.  I don't know if the AI could engage by coming to him because I couldn't force myself to play after 15 minutes or so and I realized it was a fruitless endeavor.\nDon't buy it yet.

It's still the same.  Unplayable.\n\nThere is a lot to like about this game:  atmosphere and graphics being the best selling points.\n\nUnfortunately, there is an awful lot to dislike about this game:\n\n1) the RNG is a joke.  The 2nd time I quit it was after 16 consecutive to hit rolls of over 90.  That's 16 in a row, people.  One of the biggest mstakes the dev team made was putting the actual die results on the screen. It simply allowed me to see EXACTLY how awful the RNG truly is.   Over the course of 5 games I tracked every die result for each type of action.  I saw very little difference between action types such as "to hit" vs. "climbing."  But I wanted to track if there was a difference.  After averaging my "to hit" rolls, I found an average roll of over 80.  That's not even an attempt at randomicity.  IF you are the kind of person who enjoys constant failure at easy tasks...then this game is for you!\n\n2)  the variety of warbands is unacceptable.  I am a long time tabletop Mordheim player and loved the variety in the warbands. Here we get 4.  The Sisters have been solely relagated to a melee warband (they removed their sling option) and also removed perhaps the coolest aspect of the Sister...the steel chains.  Oh, well.    The Mercenary warband is one that wasn't even an actual warband in the original game, and here is just a watered down version of mish-mash of all of the other warbands that existed.  The possessed are unplayable becasue the mutations are random and one cannot actually plan/develop a warband because the random mutations ruin warband members so thoroughly that the only answer is to fire them and start over.\n\n3)  skills are just a waste.  Pick a single attack and rank it.  Ranking more than one is a waste of time as you will never use it.  The passive skills are MUCH more useful.  Most skills are completely useless since you have limited slots for skills.  As a result, some skills that you may find quite useful ...such as helping you climb, will NEVER be taken becasue they are not worth the slot they use up.  A a result, at least half the skills could be removed from the game and it would have no significant effect on gameplay at all.\n\n4) the compensation for a good AI is simply the fact that every warband you face is better than yours.  Generally, a lot better.  More hits, better damage, faster; everything.  As many have said in other reviews, the game has a steep learning curve, but is not as impossible (in general) as many here seem to feel.  BUT, the huge advantage the AI has in strength, makes this game a series of gambles more than anything...pull the lever and hope you win and aren't ambushed.  Which leads me to the next thing...\n\n5) Ambush.  This breaks the game entirely.  When you are ambushed, the AI starts in range, usually goes first (due to the fact that they are simply better than your warband) and can take out 2-3 members of your warband before you even get to make an action.  This is essentially the game devs implementing a feature to knock the player down a few pegs by randomly killing some of their warband.  Such fun, let me tell you.   Spend hours upon hours building your warband only to be ambushed and  permanently lose 2-3 members of your warband before you even get to make an action.  Such awesomeness.    Which leads me to the SINGLE RNG factor that succeeds more than it fails...\n\n6)  When your Warband is being utterly destroyed, you have a MUCH greater chance of making your route check than ANY OTHER ROLL YOU EVER TRY.  You will miss attack roll after attack roll and fail all of your ALL ALONE checks, but when it comes time to make that 20% chance to NOT route...you make it.  Thus ensuring you get to hang around for at least one more round and risk losing even more warband members.  The ONLY way I can explain this is that it is a purposeful inclusion in the game to ensure the utter destruction of your warband.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the devs are sadists.  I can only imagine them laughing themselves silly as players continually struggle against their plot to kill them at every turn.  They probably lay bets on how many players have launched their mouse against the wall in utter frustration. Additionally, I think they are lazy.  Dudes, just make a better AI...don't take the cheap way out and simply overpower the player with overpowered adversaries and rigged die rolls, that's such a chicken**** way out it makes me sick to my stomach.  You are expecting people to give you money for your product; have enough respect for your customer to put the work in that is needed to justify the money you are making.  If that's too much to ask, you should find a different line fo work.","March 22","false","945.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","4"

The AI behaves very poorly and the designers compensates by giving the AI unit more health and damage as well as let them know the placement of your units. This makes the game even more random than the dice based concept does. Battles are still easy to win but it just means that every odd game you loose units because the AI is able to bring multiple hero units to focus the same (usually) lower level hero unit that you have hiding in a building out of sight. Once knocked down it will eventually end up suffering an injury which completely ruins the build you were going for (ranged unit cannot use ranged weapons, spellcaster pays double points for casting spells etc.).\nRandomness to this degree (might) work in tabletop games where you play a game an evening with friends, but not when you are playing a "campain" with the intend of levelling and progressing your units.\nStory mode is not worth much and consistest mainly of large blocks of text paired with missions that drag on forever.\nAll in all there are better turn-based strategy games to play than this.","May 9","false","133.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Still, I can't recommend it for now even if you're a Warhammer FB fan. And here is why:\n\nRNG\nBack in release days game was literally unplayable - you could miss 6 times in a row with 95% hit-chance and it was "normal". This horrible dice roll system was, for example, in new X-COM or Blackguards and caused so much rage and back blood, that you could raise a permanent Bloodthirster from it. But we don't need to learn from other's mistakes, right? Frankly, devs heard your cries, so in the current state the roll system was fixed and you will not miss as often, but it still has THIS MOMENTS, when the enemy dodges two of your attacks with 9% chance, when you can't dodge even once with your 40% chance. Or you miss 3 of 4 your 85% attack. Or a Tzeench kills you on a first spell with 9% mishap.\nBut still, now it's much better and I'm hoping for the best.\n\nStupid Strange ideas and overall balance\nLike you can't parry with two-handed sword(!), but you can with a halberd(!!!). Maces and hammers have no armor penetration, but axes do. Hell, even rifles(at least, the hunter rifle) in this game have no armor penetration! Instead of that you have a crit chance or a crit strength! Yeah, sure.\nYou get tired from using two-handed weapon(+1 attack point and - 20% damage for each next attack) or dual wield, but you don't get tired from using a one-handed weapon and shield. Should I tell you, why it's better to do 2 hits with one-handed than 1 with two-handed? Besides that, you're getting tired even from using guns! Even pistols! But it's not the funny part. The funny part is that you don't get tired from using all kinds of bows! WHAT. THE. FFFFFF~\n...and the daggers are just garbage. And you can't shoot in melee, but you can cast in it(really?!).   And you can shoot into melee fight even through your comrades. Ahaha, game, what are you doing, please stop!\nP.S You CAN parry with almost anything. Yes, even with a two-handed hammer. Just not as effective. Just not in this game.\n\nLoading time and Enemy turn\nEvery mission is loading forever. Like windows 95 on your old Pentium. And after that you need to wait when bunch of ugly women do all there jumping and falling, while they're slowly moving throw the map. And it's takes as much time as loading. So get yourself a good FB fluff book and alt+tab, because you gonna wait a lot. If you decide to buy this game of course.\n\nMissions\nThere is two types of missions in this game: story missions and boring missions. Story missions are very good and I don't have much complaints about them, but you will rarely see them. The boring missions are only one type - smash the enemy faces. Yes, you can call them "Warpstone rush" or "Domination", but these are side quests. The major task is always one - make them flee. And it's fun. For a first hundred times. After that it's became a routine, which is not that bad due to an interesting gameplay, but still. The major issue is that often you can't even complete the side-quest because when the enemy morale passes some threshold the battle is over and you stand victorious on a pile of NOT picked warpstones. Ha-ha, too bad, boy, here is your 3 small pieces and get out of my map! Rrrrrrealy annoying. At least give me two extra terns to pick up my stuff.\n\nAI\nAI in this game is dumb and buggy. It will stroll around the map, when you are beating sht out of their comrades. It will choose  the retardiest way to engage or to move. It will stuck in the corners. In close combat with multiple targets it will start randomly shooting comets rather than kill a stunned 2 HP enemy. Et cetera, et cetera.\nAnd it will cheat with onslaught and ambush, I swear it.\n\nAllocation and Minimap\nPlacing you warband in this game is pain. First of all, you can't do it from minimap. Second - you randomly choose the next or previous positions. So you will bounce across the map like a ping-pong ball untill you get sick. Especially on the ambush maps.\n\nPerks\nThe skill and leveling system in this game is really good and has a potential. So much skills, active/passive perks and parameters like a balsam on my black heart.\nHowever, there is a fly in the ointment - there is no perks for a certain weapon. And I can't understand why - we have heavy armour and shield passive perks, but not for exact weapon or even a weapon type? This is a huge variety limitation and it's really upsets me.\nSecond - there is a useful perks for all, and there is never-ever-ever use perks. Same for the spells: 1-2 "must have" spells(like lightning or chaos chains) and garbage. There is not much of variety - use these or be a gay.\nThird - the cost of learning is overpriced. You waste too much money and time on even basic perks. 200 gold for armor wearing, really? I can buy a purple armor for 200 gold! And it's a basic level perk! There is some corruption in this warrior school, investigate it.\n\nDifficulty\nI really like hard games, I really do. And I also like hardcore/ironman run, It makes me feel alive. But there is a line between a hard interesting challenge and BDSM. And Slaanesh sees, devs have crossed it. Even If you're winning, you can get an unpleasant situation, when one of your fallen warriors gets some nasty injuries, but it's fine. Worse when you get some really bad trauma, like arm or leg loss. For some of you, who think that it's cool - no, it's not. Your 5-lvl veteran becomes crippled garbage and there is nothing you can do(waste some of your warpstone for regeneration for example). But this is life, right? Ohoho, but don't even try to lose, you filthy little casual, because game will give you a full-strenght stomach punch and then spit on your writhing body. Half of the team will be dead or crippled to an unusable condition. You will waste tons of money and time to even heal them, not talking about replacing. Or you'll just delete your glorious unbeatable warband, like I did with my 6-lvl warband today. Game did everything it could to beat my leader magister and his patrol(No, I don't want to send a patrols, I'm a commander here god damn it!), including gay RNG stunnes and misses.\nThere is a bright side actually - there is overall progress, which will make every new warband easer to progress, but still. At least make this game less fluky.\n\nWhat is good in this game, you might ask? Well, It's Warhammer in the nutshell - dark, unforgiving place where is no good at all - just less bastart. The atmosphere is great, the maps are looking cool, the customisation of your warband is unique. And like I've said before, this game has so much potential for further development. And I hope the devs will implement it in full.","December 25, 2015","false","21.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

The campaign really is promising in that there is depth and results of each mission will carry to affect further missions (do you have plenty of new people or experienced veterans, how good their condition is etc.).\n\nOne thing that might be good to see is some kind of initial placement of your own warband and/or select their placement. As it is there is sometimes the problem that some characters are in a bad position and before your turn can't do anything about that. Perhaps something is planned already but we'll see.\n\nSo good progress in development. And as said before, there is depth and challenge to keep you interested in the same way classics of the genre keep you interested.\n\nI'll update review as I have a chance to learn more.","March 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

I really do. I gave it a big chance, tried each warband, played it pretty hard.. But it's massively let down by terrible balancing and lack of saving... My game was ruined at Act 1 scene 4, after building a solid gang, I was progressing across the bridge when the Chaos Ogre on next to no health, Stunned the main story character then killed him in 2 blows from full health.. Mission over I lose? all my characters take wounds which ruins them, I lose all my magic equiptment... Seriously 3 BS Dice rolls in a row and may as well start over.. Why would you not give a save option? Seriously it's 2016.. you have an ok game with a terrible mechanic ruining it.\n\nAdd to this... Terrible balancing means camping/Turtleing is by far the best option, kite an enemy, kill them, rinse and repeat.\n\nI await the downvotes from the insane hardcore lovers.. "oh you just don't get it" or some such nonsense.. Terrible mechanics don't equal hardcore they equal terrible design descions...\n\nEdit - It's not even difficult for the developers to fix. Offer a single player mode (so saving can't be exploited for multiplayer) disable the multiplayer for warbands created for singleplayer, and allow the player to save the game, it's clearly saved after every single characters move.  Just add saving/loading in camp. Then people can re fight bad fights.. Suddenly the game is less merciless and enjoyable.\n\nBalancing the battles however might take a bit more work.

When this happens in 'every battle' then it goes beyond a joke, and so I have decided to uninstall this game today.  A shame really - I enjoyed the seeming difficulty to start with.

The graphics are good, as is the combat system.\n\nI did make a negative review after 18 hours play, but decided to delete that and give the game a second chance as it is quite addictive. However I wish that I hadn't bothered deleting the review.\n\nAll that you read about the broken and biased RNG is true and then some.\n\nWarband characters who have 80%+ chance to hit miss 80%+ of the time. Whilst AI characters hit your characters 80%+ of the time and a high percentage of these hits are critical kills or stuns. Your hits do minimal damage, with very few criticals.\n\nThe vast bias toward AI characters can in no way be attributed to stats and buffs or debuffs. The obvious imbalance is too great for this.\n\nIf this were anything to do with gambling the developers would be guilty of cheating by using loaded dice.\n\nIn the 92 hours I played so far I have formed and deleted over 100 warbands, most of them during the first or second mission, because they were put out of action so easily by the AI warband, with resultant loss of items, and treatment costs and cost of replacing items and characters which were out of action or died.\n\nOut of action characters get wounds which need treatment. This treatment is expensive and far out weighs any loot or gold gained from a mission. It quickly comes to the point that you can nolonger continue as you can't treat out of action characters and you can't replace them. If your leader is out of action you cannot continue untill treatment is finished or they are replaced by another leader. With obvious loss of already scarce funds.\n\nOn the subject of costs, the costs of training a character are prohibitive. On the one occasion where I did get a warband to a decent level I had characters with 6 skill points which could not be used as the costs were unaffordable. Most charcters had got to their maximum stats too as it took so many missions to get anywhere.\n\nIn the end this warband was deleted at the library mission still in the first chapter, as charaters were either so badly injured, lost limbs or died that continuing was not possible.\n\nAt high levels the costs of replacing characters who die is so expensive as to be pretty much impossible. This means you can only get low level replacemants who are put out of action the first mission they enter.\n\nThe mercenary warlock is a waist of time and money. His single spell, blinding light, is ineffectual. He is easily killed and not worth the expense of treatment. I soon fired the one I had.\n\nGame load times are appaling. Go make a drink, finish it and go make another. If you are lucky the mission may have loaded. Deployment and AI movemnt also gets increasingly lengthy as the warband members increase in numbers.\n\nI will probably continue playing in the hope that the RNG issues are fixed, but I won't hold my breath on that score having seen the number of comments on this area without improvemnts being made.\n\nI cannot recomend the game until the RNG issues are fixed.\n\nEdit:- 18/01/16\n\nI forgot to mention the constant freezes and crashes. Usually when any sort of action is initiated. Climbing, jumping down, attacking and triggering traps. I have plenty of games which are far more graphic intensive and I do not have issues with them.\n\nThe crashes are particularly anoying because of the lengthy load times.\n\nEdit 8/2/16\n\nGave it another chance.\nAppalingly bad game balance. It seems that not only is the game heavily balanced towords AI warband strength, and hit abilities and defence abilities, the AI warband does not have a limit on the nuimber of characters in the warband or the distance each character can move.\nJust deleted yet another warbdand after 33 games getting nowhere. Hadn't even got as far as the temple mission (second main mission). Warband at full compliment with most characters max'd out on ability points, was overwelmingly outnumbered by characters who could move from one side of the map to the other in one move, and had multiple hits per character.\nI did have the disadvantage of 3 one eyed characters, 2 of them being archers. The ability to gain gold is so limited, and the expenses involved replacing higher level characters so excessive, as to make replacing even one of these 3 impossible.\nAll my characters were put out of action and belongings removed. This left me with all characters needing days of recovery with no weapons, and no money to replace lost weapons.\n\n\nI have now deleted this pile of game from my pc, as it's obvious balance issues are not going to be fixed. It has become far to tedious spending hours getting absolutely nowhere, because the game is so heavily biased in favour of the AI warband. Unfortunately a refund is even less likely than a balance fix.","January 17","false","124.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The Loot system if difficult to use and limited in capacity as to make it impossible to collect the required items to complete missions. Combat is often one sided with the computer controlled faction  making all their doge/parry attempts and you making less than half of yours. NPC characters also on average do about 50% more damage per hit. Games should offer some challenge but one bad mission in this game (which happens quite offten as it turns out) can wipe out a war band that you spent many hours building up with no way recoup the losses.

The graphics are good, as is the combat system.\n\nI did make a negative review after 18 hours play, but decided to delete that and give the game a second chance as it is quite addictive. However I wish that I hadn't bothered deleting the review.\n\nAll that you read about the broken and biased RNG is true and then some.\n\nWarband characters who have 80%+ chance to hit miss 80%+ of the time. Whilst AI characters hit your characters 80%+ of the time and a high percentage of these hits are critical kills or stuns. Your hits do minimal damage, with very few criticals.\n\nThe vast bias toward AI characters can in no way be attributed to stats and buffs or debuffs. The obvious imbalance is too great for this.\n\nIf this were anything to do with gambling the developers would be guilty of cheating by using loaded dice.\n\nIn the 92 hours I played so far I have formed and deleted over 100 warbands, most of them during the first or second mission, because they were put out of action so easily by the AI warband, with resultant loss of items, and treatment costs and cost of replacing items and characters which were out of action or died.\n\nOut of action characters get wounds which need treatment. This treatment is expensive and far out weighs any loot or gold gained from a mission. It quickly comes to the point that you can nolonger continue as you can't treat out of action characters and you can't replace them. If your leader is out of action you cannot continue untill treatment is finished or they are replaced by another leader. With obvious loss of already scarce funds.\n\nOn the subject of costs, the costs of training a character are prohibitive. On the one occasion where I did get a warband to a decent level I had characters with 6 skill points which could not be used as the costs were unaffordable. Most charcters had got to their maximum stats too as it took so many missions to get anywhere.\n\nIn the end this warband was deleted at the library mission still in the first chapter, as charaters were either so badly injured, lost limbs or died that continuing was not possible.\n\nAt high levels the costs of replacing characters who die is so expensive as to be pretty much impossible. This means you can only get low level replacemants who are put out of action the first mission they enter.\n\nThe mercenary warlock is a waist of time and money. His single spell, blinding light, is ineffectual. He is easily killed and not worth the expense of treatment. I soon fired the one I had.\n\nGame load times are appaling. Go make a drink, finish it and go make another. If you are lucky the mission may have loaded. Deployment and AI movemnt also gets increasingly lengthy as the warband members increase in numbers.\n\nI will probably continue playing in the hope that the RNG issues are fixed, but I won't hold my breath on that score having seen the number of comments on this area without improvemnts being made.\n\nI cannot recomend the game until the RNG issues are fixed.\n\nEdit:- 18/01/16\n\nI forgot to mention the constant freezes and crashes. Usually when any sort of action is initiated. Climbing, jumping down, attacking and triggering traps. I have plenty of games which are far more graphic intensive and I do not have issues with them.\n\nThe crashes are particularly anoying because of the lengthy load times.\n\nEdit 8/2/16\n\nGave it another chance.\nAppalingly bad game balance. It seems that not only is the game heavily balanced towords AI warband strength, and hit abilities and defence abilities, the AI warband does not have a limit on the nuimber of characters in the warband or the distance each character can move.\nJust deleted yet another warbdand after 33 games getting nowhere. Hadn't even got as far as the temple mission (second main mission). Warband at full compliment with most characters max'd out on ability points, was overwelmingly outnumbered by characters who could move from one side of the map to the other in one move, and had multiple hits per character.\nI did have the disadvantage of 3 one eyed characters, 2 of them being archers. The ability to gain gold is so limited, and the expenses involved replacing higher level characters so excessive, as to make replacing even one of these 3 impossible.\nAll my characters were put out of action and belongings removed. This left me with all characters needing days of recovery with no weapons, and no money to replace lost weapons.\n\n\nI have now deleted this pile of game from my pc, as it's obvious balance issues are not going to be fixed. It has become far to tedious spending hours getting absolutely nowhere, because the game is so heavily biased in favour of the AI warband. Unfortunately a refund is even less likely than a balance fix.","January 17","false","124.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Cast it a hundred times, realize that it only works HALF THE TIME. Casting chance has no modifiers, int doesn't increase it, armor and weapon enchants doesn't increase it either.\nIts the best way to test RNG.\n\n-Implementation of the RNG.\nThis is my second problem, lets say I'm deluded, I'm just a bad player who makes bad rolls scapegoats. Even with the RNG working as it should the prevelance of it is unbearable.\nIts random when you get a shipment, you can fulfill the shipment just to have once come in the very next day, usually demanding 50 pnds more.\nSecondly the difficulty of the missions you go on AND the deployment is also random, so you can have 10 days to fulfill a shipment only to have awful rolls that makes it so 6/10 days you have are up against tough or brutal missions all with the chance for your group to be scattered.\nWhich means you will end up in a house with one of your units getting gangbanged before you ever get a chance to move.\nMutations are random as well which is fine MUTATIONS SHOULD BE RANDOM, however mutations should not be the saem for EVERY MUTANT.\nThe first Mutant you have excess to has 5 points in ballistic while only 3 in melee.\nHowever you are almost gauranteed to get an arm mutation making any ranged weapons unusable so why the hell do we have a mutant that is your only hero option in the beginning with 2 extra points that could be anywhere else except ballistic?\nThe game is full of stuff like this but more on that later.\n\nUltimately with the RNG you will find yourself ♥♥♥♥ed regardless of how well you play, I have lost one match ONE! However I still often restart with a new warband because of being forced into a bad spot by the RNG.\nFor example I have had my leader unit roll Wrath of Tzeentech TWICE in two matches, both on casting WoD and wearing a blue amulet to avoid this.\nFirst ended with a light wound rest for two days, the other a near death experience which takes 5 days.\nMy shipment was in 7 days so I had only two days to make the shipment.\nSo whatever I have only a couple more clusters to deliver to make my shipment.\nSo I check the missions, I have the choice of Brutal and Tough missions all with scattered deployment for one side or both sides.\nWith only two days I decide I have to take on so I choose the Tough mission, and surprise surprise my luck gets two of my units basically sorrounded by enemies that get taken out before their turns because of their lower initiave.\nWhich is the point I uninstalled the game.\n\n-Balance\nGood god the balance is so poorly figured out no wonder multiplayer is dead.\nSkaven for example are king, they get 3 meters extra movement, which means they can outrange your charges and ambushes even when you have Bullcharge the AI still gets to ambush or charge you on even, you cannot do this.\n\nCoP is the weakest group as they are based entirely on RNG and have weirdly built heroes.\nI already brought up the weird mutant with pointless points in ballistic.\nNow let me bring up the possessed, absolutely worthless unit, Fear checks are almost always passed by the AI meaning he rarely gets the buff that would make him usefull.\nHe has awful dodge unless points are sunk into it which gimps him in other ways. He is incredibly squishy, only clothing allowed.\nHe has incredibly low DPS, only two attacks on start because he is always dual wielding thanks to bracers/mutations only which means he is always going to cost another OP for an attack.\nLOSING AN ARM MAKES HIM BETTER, honestly, if he gets his arm chopped off he gets a bonus in dodge, initiave bonus and can make three hits a turn.\nSo in summary to squishy to tank, not enough DPS to be a glass cannon.\n\n-NPC handicaps\nThese are the worst.\nSkaven which should be a squishy race with high movement is now a terror because the NPC get a large chunk of extra health often given more health then your own units!\nTheir leadership will also rival yours regardless of what your focusing on.\nIt completely skews the feeling of progression.\nHow am I a high leadership warband when EVERY warband has higher leadership regardless of stats invested?\nWhy do I invest into alertness when my units can't ever break ahead of the enemies initiave?\nYou will never have the option for Easy missions, Normal missions is you still facing enemies with higher stats, health, leadership and initiave.\n\n\nIn summary.\nI'm at a loss with this game, I really like its mechanics, I really like how it plays.\nHowever the poor balance that hasn't been fixed, the dead multiplayer, the boosted NPC enemies, the constant RNG ♥♥♥♥ery.\nWhen I sit down and begin a match while the game loads I just think to myself, why don't I just flip a coin and leave it at that?","March 15","false","89.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

On sale it's much, much safer for your wallet, though not on your blood pressure, it will suffer and if you're anything like me you'll break a keyboard or two while realizing that.\n\nIt is an excellent strategy game. As a warband within the walls of Mordheim you are tasked by superiors to retrieve a substance froma meteor that's all over the city, while combating rival bands and improving your troops.\n\nIt's strategy, so you'll move units around a battlefield and combat and pick up items and resources, pay tribute to your benifactor, and upgrade your team. However, given my complaints, it might be better to call it a rouge-like strategy.\n\nYour higher ups will demand some wyrdstone, you will go out to complete the order, and get paid for it.

Over and over and over again. Plan to fail in the face of an awful system of routine pain and suffering if you want to get to the delicious center where all the excellent strategy and gameplay lie.\n\nAn auto save system keeps you from save scumming, which would be a mode in another game, allowing for a variety of people to enjoy the game any way they want. As it stands, it serves only to frusterate as men you pay to fight fail and fall over while trying to complete basic plans. A 90% chance to hit is closer to a 50 in the eyes of the RNG gods. Watch people you've put hours of work and skill into die because they were randomly put next to an ogre. Observe nights of effort put to the flame by lucky crit.\n\nSome people are into that, and that's cool, this game will cater to you, and I can reccomend it.

Let's start with the good: it looks amazing, and does a strong job of capturing the feel of despair that permeates the Warhammer universe.  I approached the game assuming it would be a rogue-like, and on my first playthrough everything clicked well for 8-9 battles and I had a great time.  I won most, I lost a couple.  Eventually, my warband lost a fight badly, my Leader and my Hero both suffered perma-death, so I rolled-up a new warband.\n\nI've rolled up four new warbands since then, and never made it past the second mission.\n\nBecause the AI is so bad, the Devs game it a huge number of advantages.  Some are blatant, others I'm inferring based on AI behavior.\n\n1) In anything that should be an even match-up, it takes twice as many hits for a PC to defeat an AI than it does an AI to defeat a PC.  If the enemy leader runs up out of nowhere and smacks your leader, you will lose about 1/3 of your health in one shot.  When you counterattack, you'll do about 1/6 of his health in total damage.  Also, archers are incredibly underpowered, and only do about 10-15% damage to an enemy.  It's pretty much the same for minions.  This means that in a one-on-one fight, you are generally guaranteed to lose.  The only way to defeat the enemy is to mass combat power on an isolated enemy.  Which brings us to point 2...\n\n2) It's often impossible to mass combat power, because the game frequently scatters your characters' starting positions all over the map.  You will often start with at least one character alone and surrounded by enemies.  Even if you have all your characters make a beeline for a central location, it will take a minimum of 2-3 rounds to consolidate.  In that time period, at least one or two of your characters will probably be dead, because the AI never seems to have a problem bringing 2-3 characters into contact with an isolated character by round 2.\n\n3) The AI always seems to know the shortest path through level geometry.  If I have archers stationed at a high point raining down arrows, the AI can always find a path to get a melee character into close combat in one round.  Meanwhile , a human player without perfect knowledge of the geometry may spend several rounds trying to find a path up to an enemy archer.\n\n4) The only real source of money in the game is Wyrdstone, and you must collect it constantly to please your patron to keep the game from ending.  However, the enemy generally seems to have no interest in Wyrdstone, and makes a beeline for your characters, forcing you to spend all your efforts fighting until one side routs.  If your rout, you receive no Wyrdstone.  If you win, you receive a very small fraction of the total Wyrdstone remaining on the map.\n\nThe one time the enemy IS interested in Wyrdstone is when one of your characters has collected some and is running it back to your wagon.  The AI seems to know which character has Wyrdstone and focuses all effort on bringing down that character to prevent you from collecting any.\n\n5) There is no difficulty setting.  I understand it's supposed to be hardcore, but even after paying for scouts, my difficulty options for battle on Day 2 are frequently a combination of Brutal and Deadly.  In order to make your required payments to your patron, you need to win the overwhelming majority of battles.  Because of the low Wyrdstone collection rate, even the battles you win provide very little Wyrdstone.  Check out the achievements on who has even gotten as far as completing Chapter 1 for each of the factions.  The highest is currently the Mercenaries with 3%.  It's one thing if your game demands intelligent play and well-thought tactics.  But this game is frequently over before you take your first turn.\n\nVerdict: This could be a great game if they smooth the learning curve a bit, stop the deployment stupidity, and reduce the AI's stat advantage.  There's a great game hiding in there.  The people who praise the game in its current form generally talk about how easy it is to exploit the AI.

Like you will lose a character you've been training non-stop since the start to a simple mistake if you are not careful.\n\nAlthough it is hardcore it is a really fun game. The graphics are great and the gameplay is fun, it's just that the hardcore part of the game will make you pull your hair out at times.\n\nP.s. Failed 4 attacks at 95% chance to hit, failed a 95% chance to parry attack and lost my captain, rolled death on the injury table. Mordheim.\n\nStill playing it thou because it's just that addictive, or am I glutton for punishment? :S","December 10, 2015","true","28.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After hiring a new leader and patching up my guys i had one day remaining for delivery, took a mission crushed my enemies got the stones, somehow it all worked out and all was fine for a bit.\n\nSome time later my leader died yet again this time along with one of my henchmen and several others were wounded pretty bad, the loss hurt even more this time as both dead characters had spent skill points 200 gold down the drain.\n\nAfter recovering things were going pretty smoothly, i was making shipments on time doing well on missions and even picking up a few upgrades for my warband, it was looking good...\n\nNext day i do a campaign(story) mission, get horribly recked by demons and fail it, leader died again and my hero also died, my impressive unit got a leg sliced off and now can barly move around on a peg leg.\n\nBasicly playing this game is like riding a rollercoaster, sometimes you hit the high point and feel untouchable, then suddenly you get plunged into dispair and desperation.\n\n10/10 would get leader killed and units horribly maimed again.","December 8, 2015","true","73.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If that sounds good to you than pick it up!  You will not be disapointed.  This game keeps all the stategy element of any other tactical game but instead of moving big clunky squads around you move individual warriors around.  Each warrior levels up, you can pick customizable skills and customize their gear.  As you go you unlock more troops/heroes and troop/heroes types.  Which can be a lot of planning if you OCD about your character builds like me.  You start to get attached to your troops but they can get injured or die which adds a true sense of risk to the game.   The factions are interesting and I love that they put skaven as a playable faction.\n\nThe maps are designed well and the control work well.  To maintain your warband you have to be constantly farming warpstone around the field which makes you split your troop into fighters and gathers most of the time.  The layout is a bit hard to see for the map.  It is hard to tell if an area is raise or if you can climb something until you run your character there but that might be intended.","December 9, 2015","true","167.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
