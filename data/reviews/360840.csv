I really dont know how to discribe this game and put into words for you. But I am just really enjoying it so far, the music is pieceful, Elegent and beautiful. The Lumini are very cute, until I loose 1 to a beast then I feel a bit moved and want to cry. The sounds they make are just ever so cute and adorable. Look I am just enjoying this game, and have no regrets buying the Deluxe Edition, I feel I have earnt it.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511970031\n\n\nThis game certainly is not like Hero of Many, it has its own unique style and it plays really well with the Xbox Controller. I am really enjoying this game so much more than when I played "Hero of Many", but again they are very differant games, and this game Lumini is so much more prettier as well.\n\n( So please as people have done, dont compare "Hero of Many" and " Lumini" as they are both unique and differant ).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511970145\n\nI can only say that I am very impressed with this game so far, from what I have seen and played of the game so far.\n\nIf your a fan of cuteness, elegences, pretty and relaxing games with pieceful and graceful music, then this game is a great addition to your library. All I can say is the store page and youtube footage shares a much better picture than I can share.\n\nBottom line is Im really loving this game, it has plenty of pretty and cuteness in it, and this I really enjoy greatly in a game :)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511994671\n\nGreat job making this game.\n\nDevelopers : Speelbaars","September 4, 2015","true","8.1"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","36","40","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/360840/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Lumini is a extremely relaxing experience that sees you controlling a flock of birds through beautiful scenery.\n\nThe difference with this game as oppose to others is that you control a whole flock of birds instead of just a single one. This I was expected would be difficult. But the developers have managed to nail the controls of movement perfectly. Monouvering the birds is simple and fluid and I never had a single problem. Each bird follows in a kind of trail.\n\nThe game uses a unique control method to make some puzzles. You are able to split your group into 2 different smaller groups. These are used to press buttons in different parts of the level. Some buttons have to be hold down both at the same time to open a door which is why 2 groups are needed. You can also control fans by spinning around them. Controlling the fans was sometimes a bit fiddly to do unfortunately. I really wish they had used this unique system to make some more intricate puzzles because the ones they used in lumini were extremely basic.\n\nLumini doesn't really have a goal as such. All you are really doing is exploring. The world that you are exploring is truly beautiful. The graphics style lumini uses isn't disimilar to the likes of trine 1 and 2. It's like a 3D environment but you only control in 2D. It's called 2.5D. The world is full of colour and depth. There is a lot of variety with environments such as caves, outdoors, trees and rain. This was such a pleasant experience just being able to explore the beautifully crafted world.\n\nInteractivity with the environment is also something that the game uses a lot. When flying their are crystals in the background that light up, vegitation that sways, leaves that fall off the tree and loads more. It really does help to make the game actually seem real. There are always things happening in the background as well such as exploring animals or trees swaying.\n\nWithin your swarm you have 5 different types of birds. Each of them has a different ability. These include abilities like bomb, speed boost and electricity. Although in my playthrough I only used the speed boost and bomb ability to take out enemies. The others I felt were fairly useless. But this does create an element of strategy. You need to try can keep at least 1 of each of the types of birds alive within your swarm so you can use the abilities.\n\nThroughout exploring you will find certain collectables and other pickups. The most important pickups would be energy and health. Energy is used to get more birds at each checkpoint. The more energy you have, the more birds you can get. The health just keeps your birds alive. Other collectables can also be found around the world. They don't actually seem to have a use though. The game doesn't explain what the other collectables are for so I have no idea. I found one that wasn't activtaed so I couldn't pick it up. But I had no idea how to activate it.\n\nIn the basis of the game there is prety much no challenge. You may loose some of your birds, but it is nearly impossible to loose all of them to a point of dieing out. I have no idea what happens in this situation becaue I didn't manage to loose them all. But if you do want a challenge there are some very difficult achievements. These include things like keeping all of the birds alive, not killing any enemy and getting all energy. You also unlock a hard mode after your first playthrough. They will add a tonne of time to the playthrough if you tried to get them all.\n\nOverall the experience was extremly enjoyable and relaxing. It was a welcome break from some other hardcore games. Although if you are a strictly hardcore gamer this game is definitely not for you. The game unfortunately did only take me 1.5 hours to complete though. It isn't a very long length. So some people may consider £7.99 to be a slightly steep price for the amount of content. But I would personally recommend it at that price due to the perfect world you will get to explore. You really won't find the same experience anywhere else.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided a free review key by the developer to make this review.","September 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","3"

Combat and puzzles are very basic, mostly just to break up the gameplay a bit.\nIf you just want to chill and relex it's perfect. Also very kid friendly, could give this to a little child with no second thought. Controls are easy enough that the very young and the very old could have their first gaming experience with it.\nBut it needs a controller. While you can play it with mouse and keyboard, the first screen tells you to use a controller instead.\nI'm not sure it has any replay value, there are some hidden collectibles if you are into achivments but thats about it.\nOverall i would recomend it.\n\nIf you want to see/hear more, i made a short preview video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U6JUyMQhfc","September 3, 2015","true","1.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

At first I was sceptical of it, seeing how it seems to resemble a platformer, a genre I don't really warm up to. However, Lumini pleasantly surprised me. I really love the game, the aesthetics, the atmosphere and the art. The music was soothing, and the Lumini really grow on you. I found myself multiple times deeply saddened whenever I lost one of my flock.\nFrom the atmosphere it reminds me a lot of Journey, with a deep focus on the heroes journey that reflects in the colors and style, the music and the general tone of each level. A lot of the narrative is entirely done through the artistic aspects of the game, many things I did not pick up on until I read the artbook, but much of it was not necessary to understand the general story told in this game.\nOverall, I can really recommend this game. Especially if you're as much an aesthetics junkie as I am.","February 9","true","6.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/360840/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","Presentation\nLumini’s presentation is its trump card. It’s a game made in Unity so of course it’s beautiful, but it has a lot more to it than the typical “beautiful engine look” that can, and has, gotten tiresome as more Unity games have been released. You go to a lot of different environments in this game and it tends to be the reveal of each new area that has that emotional pull for me. They even ripped off Jurassic Park a little bit. The environments are extremely pretty, but on their own they wouldn’t be that impressive; it’s the timing. The music comes in at just the right moments, and the level design is timed with it so that when you pass certain triggers in the level the music does what it needs to. In other words the music is dynamic, and I have to say it’s maybe the best element of this game. But we’re not going to leave presentation without taking a look at another aspect of design that the developers seemed to neglect. Graphic design. All throughout the game whenever text appeared, or when I collected a purple gem, I have to be honest, I cringed. The font is not good, and the collectable overlay is straight out of Crash Bandicoot from 15 years ago. It might seem like a nitpick, but it really cheapened the whole experience and clashed with the otherwise beautiful game.\n\nMechanics\nUnfortunately the weakest element of the game is the gameplay, which’ll be a dealbreaker for a lot of people and I don’t blame them for that. We’ll start with the negative and end on the positive. In this game you are controlling a school of flying.. fish dragonfly things called Lumini. Your health is represented by the number of them you have with you, and if you lose them all you go back to the previous checkpoint. The three colours each have unique abilities and you can switch between them; blue being speedy, red being aggressive, and yellow being… the gem collector. Yellow was really the third wheel throughout this game; it didn’t really have much of a place and I never used it. It does become slightly more useful towards the end when you are collecting gems from inside venus fly traps, and I think you could argue that getting lots of gems is important because that’s how you get more Lumini, but that idea is undermined by the fact the game is quite easy. There’s nothing wrong with that and there is a hard mode that you unlock after beating the game that I never tried, but honestly I think the biggest misstep with the difficulty is making it so that you have to beat the game to unlock hard mode. Assuming hard mode is hard, the difficulty wouldn’t have been an issue at all if I could have played it from the start. The game is already short, and it’s padded out with these unbelievably tedious and easy puzzles that just don’t belong in this game. They stagnate the pace and aren’t satisfying to complete; yet they come up again and again and they always have the same solutions. All that said, I actually did find it satisfying to switch between the red and blue schools of  Lumini to create a synergy and fight enemies in relatively tense action sequences. I felt powerful when I did it right, and it kept the battles fast paced and exciting.\n\nStory\nThe story is simple and things become clearer as you play. It’s not really a story that can be explained in words without using information from outside the game itself. The environment around you tells the story conceptually, with a few dramatic twists in tone throughout that keep it interesting. It has a satisfying but typical conclusion, and the world remains magical throughout the experience. There’s not much else to say about it, it’s really something you have to play and discover for yourself.\n\nVerdict\nI think this game, that I completed in 90 minutes, is worth around 5-7 dollars. Right now, it’s priced at 13 dollars on Steam. I think Lumini is great if you want to scratch that goosebump itch, and if that’s you I’m talking about, my recommendation is putting it in your Steam wishlist and waiting for a sale when it gets closer to that 5-7 dollar mark.","January 12","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You play a small winged creature, somewhat like a dragonfly, the Lumini, whose world is a an array of caverns filled with beautiful and sometimes deadly crystals.  You fly along gathering pretty flowers and further friends to fly with.  There are segments of Runes or ancient symbology covered gates that must be activated in sequence to activate the opening of the gate.  It was during these times that my lack of gaming prowess became evident.  I struggled in using multiple thumbsticks simultaneously to control both main Lumini in order to activate a gate.  Even though I hit these small road blocks this game has you feeling hurt if one of your small fliers is injured/killed and exhilarating joy as you tumble and spin though the underground wonderland.  Let alone the glee that comes from the cute joyous sounds the little creatures in your control make as they gather a flower or fly past illuminating crystals.\n\nIf you are looking for a game to make you smile, but keeps you on point with technical maneuvers of the controller then this is the game for you.  For any gaming newbies out there I say give it a go, the cuteness factor is worth it alone.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please check out http://www.steamified.com/","January 13","true","9.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Restarting and trying again will eventually fix this.","October 11, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cool visauls though I felt like the lighting is a bit two soft in some spots. Gameplay controls were a bit confusing at first seems to be a slight lag in commands with my gamepad (Xbox 360 Controller) The atmosphere and setting of the game almost reminded me vaguely of "Ori and the Blind Forest"\nI really like the flock mechanic, similiar to pikmin as in differenct colored Lumini can perform different abilities. At first I was worried that the enviroments would get stagnant but so far just as you tire with one background you enter a new biome always giving a fresh feel. Plenty of variety in enemies as well. All in all a good Relaxing Indie title, definetly one to play when your winding down for the day.\n\n30 Minutes or Less\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLvmBNRp3Vc&list=PLNtPp4M-LVW-RJYbhJha2iqZ7wSZOZI5H&index=1\n\nThanks for reading my review, hope it helped. Also on another side note the game runs very well 60fps and never has it faltered yet.","September 6, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lumini is so much more than the sum of its parts. It feels kind of like something ThatGameCompany (Journey, Flower, Flow) would make in terms of emotional impact and storytelling, but has gameplay closer to what most people are familiar with. It's one of my favorite games of the year.\n\nMy full review is on  IndieGames.com [indiegames.com]","September 20, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Highly valued its continuous level design that kept me playing without taking a huge s**t until I reached the final level without realising I'd lost the purple lumini from the beginning, which explained why I could only control 3 types throughout the whole game.\n\nThe game is quite soothing but not so relaxing with occasional dropped framerate and bugs like when those luminis splitted into two groups but some of them got stuck in corners, especially in the forest level. At least its gameplay and story line are well-constructed thanks to the whole Speelbaars team. Good work, chaps.","September 6, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Been there done that.. storyline finished within 2 hours, as far as you can call it a storyline. There was non. They promised that you could breed the lumini. If flying by a rock is called breeding. That's all you do. Fly past a rock and "poof"! New lumini. Boring, really realy boring. Not worth the price. More a 2 euro phone game than a 10 euro pc game really. Do-not-buy! Really, just don't.

I played all the way through and what you see with my hours is a full playthrough of it...I did a lot of exploring along with it too. The puzzles are very simple tho they can be kind of a pain trying to make one group go one way and the other another way (controls seem to get kind of weird when you split up your group.) But overall it's a very simple/short game whether you go straight through it or you're like me and explore every nook and cranny of it. Replayability is slim unless you want to get every little thing in the game, but oher than that not really.","September 6, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It kind of reminds me of the game flower (By that thatgamecompany). You just float around as a pack of birds, but there is also an actual point to it. You collect fllowers to increase your bird pack and need to be carefull that your lumini won't get eaten. There are 3 different type of lumini, with all their unique ability. You can make it as easy, or hard for yourself as you like. After you finished the game you unlock hard mode and there are also some very challenging achievement to be earned. It is easily re-playable.The music is beautifull and fits really well.\n10/10 would buy again.","September 16, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
