It was a toss up between a game called H.E.D.Z. Extreme Destruction Zone and this and I bought this. From the outset the game seemed simple, drive around In vehicles fitted guns trying to shoot other vehicles. However the game designers had other Ideas.\nI remember reading the booklet over and over and still not grasping what the point of the game was, it has to be one of the weirdest freakin' games I've played in terms of storyline and strange language. I really liked the graphics everything bar the vehicles looks like its made out of that Magic Sand stuff that stays dry under water and seems to shimmer and flush luminous colours. There are always things crawling over and under the surface like the ladscape is some giant, lumpy moth-eaten rug and you meet these creatures on a seperate screen who you interact with and buy stuff from who just make no sense at all and seem to live inside an advent calendar for no reason. And then you die. Over the years My copy fell victim to numerous scratches and became unplayable, when I saw that this game was on steam I thought I had to play it again. I think I have to agree with the description that mos of the pleasure that is to be had in this game is trying to work out what exactly whats going on and what you are supposed to do. You are kind of learning a foreign language with this game, but I think that's what gives the game it's appeal for me. It is a genuine oddity, a one off freak that you may never fully understand. And that is what has brought me here. Maybe I seek some sort of closure on what has been puzzling me for some time: Vangers, what was that all about?\n","April 24, 2014","true","2.2"," 149 of 158 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","149","158","2","4"

Vangers didn't catch on much back then, because there wasn't any genre it fit. Even if it does some things similarly to GTA (open world top-down driving game with missions and unstructured gameplay), its premise and game world are much more confusing, and most reviewers and players couldn't warm up to it, though some did. (Actually, that probably hasn't changed.)\n\nWhat sets Vangers apart?\n\nVoxels: Vangers has been implemented with a voxel-like world (that was before the prevalence of polygon-crunching graphics cards), which means that the terrain doesn't have a surface made of textured polygons, but is sculpted out of tiny cubes (like square pixels make up a digital photograph, but in 3D). (Think minecraft with finer grains.)  This means that you can deform the terrain: vehicles leave tracks, weapons make craters, you can move under water, through tunnels (sometimes hard to spot in the top-down view) and, with the right equipment, even burrow along like a mole. Unfortunately, this is also the reason why Vangers still runs at 800x600: if you upped the resolutions, either everything would be very small, or the Voxels would appear larger, and everything would still be blocky.\n\nSciFi: Vangers is set in a confusing world, or rather a "Chain" of worlds (do read the "preface" eventually), with seasons that affect gameplay, weird installations, the purpose of which is initially unknown, and strange creatures that talk in riddles. You need to discover much of  the gameplay as you go along.\n\nSo how do you get a feel for the game? Review the controls in the options - you will need to move, turn your vehicle over and use the KiD a lot. Set the game to fullscreen. Then click yourself (somewhat to the right) through the prologue into the buying screen, pick up a shipment of Nymbos, exit the burrow, click on the lower right panel to set your compass for Incubator, and take off. (I set my camera to zoom and tilt, but not to rotate, because  it is very easy to get disoriented.) You'll find that with your small, lightweight car, terrain matters a lot. There are roads, some obvious, some not so much, and unfortunately, you need to stay out of the way of stronger Vangers for the time being. Reach Incubator, sell the Nymbos, get some Phlegma, trade it back to Podish, buy better cars and equipment, ask the councellors about the things you saw, figure out how they work and how to reach other worlds in the chain, take part in races, take down other Vangers and loot them, become a motorized Scifi mercenary.\n\nIf you like off-road driving and can keep going in the  face of confusion (and if you don't mind a time machine trip back to when screens had 15", 640x480 was a good game resolution, and 800x600 looked definitely wonderful - and games had to ask before saving 64MB of persistent world), Vangers will reward you with huge and deep world full of surprises -- and driving.\n\nI can safely say that there hasn't been any game like Vangers since 1998, because if there had been, I would have played it. (Hard Truck Apocalypse, also published by Buka, comes close, but it doesn't have voxel terrain and isn't nearly as strange as Vangers.) I'm very happy that it has been overhauled to run on modern systems.\n\nP.S.: I just found my old Vangers mousepad with the yellow and blue liquid and the floating mechos!\n\n--------------------\nI just wrote the following in a forum post, it may help inform your buying decision.\nSo some people may be thinking, "that's an interesting game, but chances are high I won't like it much" and then conclude that they'll buy it if it ever goes below 4$ or whatever. Those of us who know and love Vangers know the game is worth more to us, but I can understand that people who are curious are reluctant to buy.\n\nIn that regard, if you like top-down off-road racing, with small vulnerable vehicles that can roll over and right themselves and do both small and really long jumps with a built-in spring device that charges up, you probably won't regret buying this for the full price, because if you get frustrated with the alien SciFi, you'll be able to just go and tool around the area some more in your mecho and have fun.","April 24, 2014","true","1.5"," 128 of 135 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","128","135","2","9"

It's not a very friendly place, nor is it safe for an unwary traveler, but those who embrace the spirit of exporation will always find what they need. You assume the role of a Vanger - one of many inhabitants of the Chain, having nothing and no one to rely on except for your armoured mechos and the skills to drive it. Soon, you're being thrown out of the safety of Escave and face the Road that welcomes the new arrival...\n\nPerhaps the best way to describe Vangers experience is "a newborn baby exploring the world for the first time." In the terms of your knowledge about the surroundings, or your relative power to other beings living here, you pretty much equal nothing. There's no one to give you comprehensive information, no one to explain all the laws and principles governing the Chain of Worlds. You can ask, and you will receive some answers, but don't expect them to be clear and on-point - most of the advisors you'll meet talk in riddles. You don't have any goals, other than the little tasks that Escave rulers give you from time to time, so you'll probably feel helplessness in your first hours of playing Vangers. And that's exactly what the game is so good at - the world around you is very complex, very vibrant with life and full of secrets. But you have to work hard in order to comprehend it, making exploration the most important part of the game.\n\nTraveling the roads of Fostral, you'll stumble upon many objects and devices of unknown purposes. Some of them might affect you in different ways, some of them might open up to give you their contents. Cycles change around you, busy vangers on coloured mechoses drive by, following their own goals, and it's up to you to earn enough reputation in the eyes of advisors to get access to more secret knowledge.\n\nThat being said, don't be discouraged by the apparent lack of understanding at the start. The game still has a lot of features and options to help you. Gather some oddities around Escaves, sell them in the shops and receive money to buy upgrades for your mechos. Earn enough, and maybe you'll be able to even buy a new vehicle, faster and better armoured than your basic model. Participate in local races to please the advisors and earn their trust, and surely they won't forget your brave efforts. Most importantly, get to know the Road - it's there that most of your battles will occur.\n\nSoon enough, you'll find yourself travelling across more and more worlds, some large, some tiny, but each with its own riddle to solve. The deeper you pierce the Chain of Worlds, the more options will be available to you, until the moment you'll finally get a glimpse of the true rulers of Univang... But that's still far away, and until then you'd better get used to hauling cargo and doing some passenger runs.\n\nRemember this: no matter how pointless and futile your actions might seem at first, no deed will be left unnoticed, and sometimes you have to keep trying over and over to earn your first results.\n\nIs it worth it? As a person who beat the game thrice already, I say definitely yes. The more you learn, the more interesting it becomes, and those first hours of confusion when you are just starting will be something you'll remember with nostalgy by the time you'll be ready to leave Univang as a mature and experienced King of the Road. Good luck, fellow Vanger! Say hi to Parafin from me.","January 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

There are always different ways to complete goals. If you want money - you can complete quests, trade, or rob secret stashes. If you want to go to the next world - you can complete a difficult race, or prove you are worthy by some other way.\nGraphics look awesome, despite the game's old age, thanks to voxel engine which makes everything look even more alien.\nOn the downside - ingame quests are very difficult. Sometimes you will even get tasks, which are impossiple to complete on the current stage of storyline. Offroad driving is nearly impossible, your car will not just go slower or stop  - it will spin uncontrollably whith the slightest press of a button.","October 9, 2014","true","10.3"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

Everynow and then this is a game you can just pick up and have fun with if your anything like me. This review is all my opinion wich might be slightly biased due to nostalgianess hehe.\n\n\nGraphicly >_> or w.e if I mistyped : This game has aged well if you compare it to indie games from nowadays, It doesnt stutter and the specs you need are uber low. Altho I like the style it is aged so well to me check out some gameplay if your not sure but for me its gotta be: 8/10\n\nGameplay: You have a top view car which can jump, roll, shoot, Go trough motha****** portals to explore diffrent (more hostile) worlds where you can sometimes do a small puzzle or a race for example. You gotta like the gameplay and wittyness that is in it. 9/10\n\nStory: Not a too great FORCED story.... buttttt If you take the effort to read all the dialoge you can get a clearer view, Sometimes you need  to remember a cryptic statement to ease out a later puzzle world, But overall the story is how much you want to be drawn in by it. GREAT ROLEPLAYING GAME if you are into roleplaying, as there is no real storyline thats forced so you are like a blank slate since you start a game.    7/10\n\nAN: I dont have alot to complain about this I hope FIXED version (my original NEVER would let me go trough the LAST FREAKKING PORTAL TO END IT LEGIT) apart from missing the >>>Cheatcodes<<<< and multiplayer in this release While multiplayer I can live without Replaying the game with cheats was a fun thing to do to explore stuff.\n\nVerdict: I love the style, I love the execution even now for this classic. It should still be cheaper(LIKE 2,99 MAX) for the amount of time it would take to fully clear the game on a good run(without cheats sometimes you just get stuck in a run if you cannot find the right artifacts in the worlds) But if you are looking for a Nice racing/shooter with a unique feel that so many games seem to miss nowadays this is deffinatly a good one to pick up:\n= 8/10 TOTAL SCORE!

It was kind of under the radar when it was brand new, but it really captured my imagination as a kid.\n\nAfter playing through it again as an adult, I can say that even without the nostalgia goggles it's still a great game and if you aren't the kind of person who needs photorealistic graphics to have fun, there's a really awesome style completely unique to this game.

Every sidebar command works to aid new players who might not even make it to Incubator for sometime; the Kinetic Device provides both risk and reward with the promise of escaping most early-game combat scenarios. There's more than a few build-out options available for those who trade quickly and often, and the goodies to find even before gaining your first Spiral (like deserted Cirtainers and packages hidden under the cross-hatched scaffolds) make exploration a good investment.\n\nAbove all, the game world is frightening, beautiful yet teeming with odd and deformed entities. All hearsay appears dubious, even what the Advisors tell you! Read the feelies for this game and you'll begin to understand how effective the worldbuilding and game progression for Vangers is.","June 20, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I played the game extensively in the windows os;  I still have the original install disk.  Over the years I managed to get it to work on various flavours of the windows os, although in some versions of windows the graphics did not work.\n\nThen I switched to Linux and you can imagine my delight when I found a Linux version of Vangers on Steam!\n\nThe Linux version is actually a little bit more difficult to play than the windows version.  There is no joystick axis support in the Linux game, and although landscape is deformable, there is no option to save the landscape to disk in the Linux version.  That means that one of the exploits I used to use to get big mechos fast no longer works in the Linux version.\n\nIt doesn´t really matter.  Once you know how to collect beebs efficiently, it does not take long to make enough to get whatever mechos you want.\n\nIf you are a beginner to the game, you might want to find the online manual and you might want to do a google search for vangers hints and tips.  The game will throw curve-balls at you from time to time.  They are avoidable once you know how, but to avoid them you will need experience in the game, or you will need to read a guide.\n\nIn all my years of gaming, Vangers is one of the few games that captured my imagination.  If you would like to get your mind stretched a little bit, if you like exploring, if you like sandbox games then I highly recommend Vangers as a game that might be right for you.  The whole game, start to finish is a learning experience, and even after you play through a couple of times is still an enormous amount of fun.  There is so much to learn, so much to find.  I wish you a very happy  journey in the Vangers Universe.","February 17, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thanks to its Steam re-issue I was once again able to enter this quirky world. Loveable aliens which have little to nothing in common with most sci-fi creatures - they are more mischievous kids than evil overlords. Unique voxel graphics which make the game truly timeless - and still pictures can't capture its charm, it really has to be appreciated live from inside the game.

I did not know what to do and the manual was not helpful(too much text)(too lazy to read). The game mechanics are well rounded, I found the enemy AI to be quite aggressive. For a classic game such as this, I know that there are no updates. But here's the review.\n\nMechanics: Well rounded and very stable. Though it did take me about 1 hour to figure out the controls, and another half hour to figure out how your car effects the environment. Once I figured it out, I could actually play the game. Once playing the game, I didn't neccessarily fall in love with the mechanics, but I'm smart enough to know that they are well built mechanics. I did not run into any glitches in the game, rather the game is very un-userfriendly if you don't know what you are doing.\nMechanics Rating: 7/10\n\nStory: The story is presented in text and didn't seem very interesting to me. Caterpillar people just doesn't ring any bells. But if you can past the absurd setting and characters, then the story is a good story. You play a runner for the caterpillar overlords and do something, I mostly skipped the story because I was having trouble finding out how to play the game. I never got far into the story either so I'm reviewing the front cover of the game storywise.\nStory Rating: 6/10\n\nArtwork: I happen to be a fan of all types of artwork in videogames so the dated looks don't effect my review. This game is in 2.5 D from a top down perspective. I at first did not know the difference between up and down elevation wise in the game but after some time I figured out how the graphics system worked and the hints that are made for up and down and passable through. I want to grade the artwork by 2d and 3d standards but I can't single one portion out. The tone of the artwork is slightly disturbing in a good way that complements the story. The character models are all well built and there is no flaws artistically\nArtwork Rating: 8/10\n\nReplay Value: I personally don't want to play this game but if you like the game, it holds an immense replay value.\nReplay Value Rating: 4/10\n\nPrice to Hours Ratio: $7 : (approx) ~20~\nPrice to Hours Rating: 10/10\n\nTotal Rating: 70/100","March 8, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a lot of positive reviews, but I don't see how it is possible unless they're lies.\n\nThe screenshots look better than what shows on screen, I don't get sick from games or motion but this one gave me a headache and made me want to throw-up. It isn't worth the hard-drive space it takes up.\n\nThe UI is illegible, there are clickable words that fade into the background and the background is green and so are the buttons so anyone that has any type of color sensory deficiency or color blindness will not be able to play this game. When you hover over a word, it becomes a darker green making it slightly easier to read, however it isn't easy to even get the game started to play.\n\nConfiguring your car is a chore; half of the buttons are unlabeled, and the ones that are aren't color-blind friendly ( I have full color range despite males having a high chance of having some color blindness ). There are insect icons which apparently mean Play, etc... There are various slots to put equipment for your vehicle.\n\nWhen you get into the game, which is difficult considering there is no play button, you have to click on everything to figure it out and the ui is completely non-intuitive. If the goal was to create something which is difficult to play or navigate, they've succeeded. They've locked out anyone who is color-blind or who has any type of minor color-blindness from playing the game, etc.. They've somehow found a way to make people sick by playing this.... I think this will be the only game I have on Steam that I'll either remove from my account or hide permanently.\n\nClicking on the alien that says something makes the ui "blink" along with the other green slime slots.\n\nWhen you finally get the game to start, your own same-colored-people attack you while the red targets do not. The controls are alien; ie Activate KID apparently makes you jump, or it was the other one. "Accelerate" is fast-move-forward while move-forward is 'normal"-speed-forward or slow-forward.\n\nThe camera options are dizzying.\n\nSteer clear of this one.","January 18","false","0.4"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","0"

If it had the gameplay to back it up, this might be a worthwhile task, but its basically a clunky combat racer, so even if you struggle your way to an understanding of the games alien language, all you get for your trouble is a below average gameplay experience.
