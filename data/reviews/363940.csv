To summarize:\n\nPro:\n- nice and colorful visuals\n- fast-paced gameplay\n- 'shifting' mechanics adds a very unique twist\n\nCon:\n- enemies and their formations are kinda repetitive, little variation\n- success is heavily tied to quickly finding a sweet-spot on the screen and just sitting still\n- constantly shifting camera angle does not work out all that well for gameplay\n- collision box of your primary ship seems a bit too small, kinda confusing as you have to discover you actually have more room to maneuver as it appears, maybe the model is scaled a bit too large\n\nSince it quickly turns into "repeat last checkpoint until you found the perfect spot to sit for every formation until reaching the next checkpoint", I'll have to give it a thumbs-down.\n\nNot a bad game, but when it comes to arcade shooters, gfx is not my primary concern and the gameplay didn't blow me out of my chair.\n\nMaybe just ignore my ramblings and give it a try since it isn't expensive anyways.","September 12, 2015","false","0.9"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","5"

Impressed with Meridian I had good hopes for this, I was not let down.\n\nFor a scroller, the game has a lot of depth and detail to it.\nWhile it's not a massive bullet hell it is still a challenge with plenty of different enemies on screen.\nCheckpoints are used so you won't lose much progress on the way if you die and the sections can be retried as many times as needed until you get through so it should be possible for everyone to complete the game eventually regardless of how good you are at it.\n\nUnlike most shooters, Solar Shifter Ex makes use of a 'shift' feature which allows you to jump to one of the four locations on screen to help avoid enemies and their shots, where at some points of the game it's essential to use it to survive 'puzzle-like' beam attacks.\n\nThere's 18 levels in total located on or near different worlds which have their own theme and ships that fit in with the design of the world and don't show up anywhere else.\nAs well as looking different they also behave different, such as the Pirates which instead of just firing everything they have at you, they will intimidate you with plenty of ships and restricting your movement.\n\nWith some levels having a lot going on in the background and the use of the camera and the 'track' turning you get a good atmosphere and adds to the short story throughout the game.\nA lot work has been put into each level and ship design and it shows and works well.\n\nIncluded in the 18 levels you get to play 3 mini-levels using alien ships, giving you a break from your standard one, less challenging and more about fun and variety\nYour ship can have its weapons upgraded, while these don't change the gameplay directly, you will benefit from the extra damage dealt. Destroying more enemy ships and collecting the credits will benefit you.\n\nWhile the graphics are really nice and well made it can be a little demanding when there's a lot going on especially for older computers, if this is the case you may need to lower the settings down using the unity menu which can lower the performance of the control input too, a problem for this sort of game, adding unnecessary difficulty/frustration.\n\nFinally, the soundtrack, awesome music and if you've played Meridian: New World and liked its music this won't let you down.\n\nI'm unsure how long it took me to complete, having left the game on whilst AFK, but it still provides a good number of hours of entertainment, for extra replay value there's achievements for completing certain levels without damage and collecting credits/buying upgrades.\n\n\n[Shorter version]\n\nInteresting take on the traditional scroller shoot'em ups\nGood challenge but not too difficult\n18 levels (including 3 mini-levels)\nGood features\nHigh verity of enemy ships\nGreat graphics (may be very demanding on older computers)\nNice music","September 12, 2015","true","28.2"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","20","27","2","0"

Solar Shifter is a shmup with immersive 3D backgrounds and massive battles. You can use your ship to shift out of tough situations, avoid deadly lasers and obstacles.\n\nI enjoyed every minute of this little gem so far, and its only fault in my opinion is that the screen can get a bit cluttered sometimes due to the 3D background. This isn't that much of an issue, and the addictive nature of the gameplay will quickly get you hooked.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonfreek/recommended/363940/","demonfreek","Dean Demon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonfreek/","854 products in account","Solar Shifter Ex is an old school shooter from the developer of the amazing Meridian: New World, based around classic 80's hardcore arcade games such as R Type and Gradius/Nemesis. Solar Shifter Ex (SSE) certainly has a lot to live upto as they are as hard as they come so this is a shooter designed with toughness in mind but with modern gaming standards but does it succede?\n\nFirst thing you will notice when you start to play is the big bold graphics of the enemy and your ship too which is very nicely done although i do wish that the ship you control would be a little smaller as things can get a little hectic and leaves you with little room at times, backgrounds really are impressive and look awesome but sometimes look too awesome as you can get a little distracted. The weapons ingames both for the player and enemy have a really nice glow to them and are nice and bright but on occasion when things are moving fast you can lose sight of them and causing you a death or ten but it's all good fun.\n\nI did notice a few pauses as the end of a level so the transition from end of level to reaching the hanger did look a little odd but it's a minor complaint, when you are in the hanger you can upgrade you weapons etc but the thing is it doesn't tell you in the menu's that there are upgrades so can be a little confusing and you find out by accident really so that could be better. The AI in the game is fairly standard stuff but avoiding them without dying can be an issue until you have learnt the patterns, i did encounter a bug where i was stuck on returning to hanger and i was stuck until i reset the game.\n\nAll in all a good attempt at a classic genre, difficulty will frustrate many that have never played a game like this before but doesn't quite hit the height's of classic shooters of the past, as it stands it's good with a 6/10 from me but has the potential to be 9/10 with more attention to detail, it's good but not as good as it should be but still nicely done.","September 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/363940/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Welcome to day number one of our ten day Headup Gamesathon. We start our journey with their recently released Solar Shifter EX. This title was developed by Elder Games, the same developers of Meridian:  New World which is not a part of our gameathon but is absolutely worth mentioning for fans of RTS games. Elder Games, of course, is a one man development studio belonging to Ede Tarsoly. Meridian was met with mixed reviews and currently, at the time of writing, has 177 positive reviews and 158 negative (52.8%). However, Tarsoly was given a lot of praise for being able to make such a gorgeous looking game single-handily.\n\nThat holds true for Solar Shifter EX as well. To suggest that the game is anything but gorgeous would be lying. The 3D backgrounds are absolutely stunning. It’s truly remarkable that a single person could make not only the game itself but all of the outstanding art work that made up such a significant component of the whole. All of this praise, however, doesn’t mean that there aren’t any issues with the graphics. In fact, it did not take long for me to find a couple of bug bear gripes with them. First, there will be times throughout the levels that what you will perceive to be pretty clear enemies are in fact nothing but part of the background image. This brings the obvious issue of not being certain where you are supposed to position yourself on the playing field and can thus lead to being cheap shotted by legitimate enemies.  Secondly, the action camera moves around throughout each level. The problem with this should be obvious. It changes the angles that enemies will be attacking you from. Each wave can have different angles than what you are originally led to believe that it has and where you want to shoot may not necessarily be where it hits.\n\nGameplay is typical of bullet hell games. You move your ship and take down enemies while making every effort not to get killed by the enemy firepower. You also collect the drops from downed enemies in order to upgrade your ship and its weapons at the end of each level. Most SHMUPs have their own unique trademark that differentiates itself from other titles within the genre. The point of differentiation here is a mechanic that enables you to ‘shift’ away from trouble and to another spot. But be careful, it’s a mechanic that will take you a bit of practice to perfect as you can shift yourself into a worse danger – even to the point of instant death – than what you were in before. However, it is a vital skill to learn so you are best learning from the very beginning. Thankfully the game gives you opportunity to do so. A slight criticism that I have is that the mechanic feels a little hit and miss. I’ll be the first to admit that I am not the most skilled SHMUP player around so I can’t quite tell you whether or not this is a skill issue or a problem with the game. Others who are SHMUP fanatics have, however, reported similar issues so I’m leaning towards it being a game issue.\n\nAn important side issue that I have with the gameplay – even with that of the constant angle changing – is that there will be many times that you’ll be playing and know that your best course of action is to stand perfectly still and to keep on shooting. The best bullet hell games that I can remember playing all have you constantly moving. That’s not the case here and it is to the game’s detriment.\n\nThe game is quite suitable at 18 levels with 8 different environments spread throughout. The game is quite generic when it comes to narrative and storyline but by now most SHMUP fans aren’t going to be playing for storyline. There’s enough to make it interesting but you wont be texting your mother in the next room to tell her to join you in bullet hell as a replacement to her daytime soapies.\n\nI know that I’ve criticized the game a bit more than I normally do but that’s because there’s so much potential for it to be even better than what it is. It is a good game but with a few tweaks it could have been among the best in class. It’s still a solid entry in the genre and one I’d recommend to SHMUP fans.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","February 1","true","18.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It also has issues shifting RIGHT more than left.\n2) The explosions! The explosions are ridiculous, tiny ships blowing up into giant flames that cover half the screen preventing you from even seeing the "bullets" coming at you. This is a big no-no for bullet hell, you can't dodge something you can't see!!\n\nOne last thing I suppose is there there are many isntances where it's not obvious that an enemy isn't actually destroyable by you, or that the projectiles coming at you aren't actually coming at you.\n\n\nOther than these things, it's pretty good.","November 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Used to love shoot em ups in the arcade as a teen.  Games like R-Type and many that I cannot remember the name of.  Not played any in many year, so this feels fresh to me and I am blown away at this.  It looks amazing and is silky smooth on my ancient Phenom II 960T 4X3.0Ghz and Powercolour 1GB HD6950.\n\nSo i have done the first level and two thumbs up so far, if anything changes so with the review, so if you see a thumbs up I am still loving it.\n\nEdit: the further I go in I notice some framerate drops (from a steady 60 to 40 and down to 14 in some places).  it happens when the camera changes angle mostly.\n\nEdit:  Had to change to not recommended.  There is a mission later in the game that is heavy on smoke effect and reduces the FPS to a solied 14.  I set the graphic settings to minimum and get 20-30 on that level if I reduce it to 1280x720.  In a bullet hell type game that is pretty unplayable at times.\n\nNow I know I said my PC is creaking, but it beats the recommended specs and I can play Battlefield 4 at 60 FPS a game like this should be a solid 60.  If it gets optimised I will swtich back to recommended as I was really enjoying it up until then.\n\nFunny how when I had a positive review I had lots of thumbs down, now I have a negative one  people are voting it down too. I guess people on steam just like being ♥♥♥♥♥.  Even though my review says it is a good game just has framerate issues in places people still feel the need to try and discredit me.  The minimum requirements for the game are really really low and I even exceed recommended and the game runs really smooth overall, but the fact there are 2 levels in particular where the framerate bombs is not my PC just unpotimised areas.  IF it was my PC being crap it would run poorly overall.  Like I can run Farcry 3 no problems at all, Battlefield 4, Witcher 2, Shadows of Mordor, Arma 3.  Yet somehow this good but not spectacular looking shmup is really taxing?

You can feel the wallop behind every bullet and rocket and soon enough there's an impressive fireworks display taking place on your monitor. Defeated enemy ships explode with a nice visual effect and an audible "boom". Music is upbeat and fast-paced which is a nice match for the action. I'd definitely recommend a decent pair of headphones or speakers to make the most it.\n\nGraphics and presentation are really nice all-around. You won't be stuck facing 1 direction the entire time, like other shoot 'em ups. The camera has many tricks up its sleeve, panning around you and adding entirely new perspectives to the gameplay. There is a great indoor scene that has you dodging pillars and fighting enemies while the camera moves around you, above you and below you like it's a spaceship itself. At times, you can see other battles raging in the backgrounds until they suddenly overspill and intertwine with your path, zooming around you from all directions.\n\nI don't think the level of challenge here is as high as other shoot 'em ups. When you discover the right places to stick to at the right times, you'll progress well, but it's not an easy game by any means. You will definitely restart from checkpoints quite a bit, which thankfully are not too far apart.\n\nCredits collected from defeated enemies can be spent on upgrading your primary and secondary weapons after each level. They make a nice improvement to your power and the visual effects of your weaponry (some more so than others).\n\nI did find the suggested method of phase shifting (teleporting) a bit strange. I don't know if this is just me but after holding X/Square I have to move the left analog stick a few times until it works, then it will often phase in an undesired direction, probably because I'm using the left analog stick to fly the ship at the same time. I got used to keeping my right index finger on the fire button and my right thumb on the right analog stick, which you can simply flick in the direction you want to teleport.\n\nGraphics are quite resource-intensive so you'll have to scale them down a bit for older machines, but it will still look pretty good.\n\nI'm having a lot of fun with this game and I would recommend it to those even semi-interested in the genre.\n\nIf you want a quick preview of some of the levels, take a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ECfy5QSWkQ\n\nGiveaway here (Ends December 28th 2015): https://www.bobmanbob.com","November 27, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","2"

Also I am greatly dissatisfied with the controls in the game. The ship you drive has a "teleport" ability. So far this is good, howevr, it is quite buggy.\nSo overall as a gaming experience I would not recommend it.","October 5, 2015","false","6.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"
