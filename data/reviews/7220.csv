"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/7220/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Well... Here is the continuation to Runaway series, Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle, made in 2006. Aside that little bit of factual definition, there is not a single good thing to say about this game. If you've played the first game and declared it a tasteless, tacky and overcomplicated little adventure full of character stereotypes as I did, be warned: This is way worse than the first game. At least, the first game was working properly!\n\nAdventures of self-acclaimed genius Ken doll Brian Basco continue from where we left him: on a vacation in Hawaii with the oversexualized bimbo stereotype Gina who he ended up as lovers beforehand. Thanks to a series of unfortunate - and mindlessly obvious - wrong choices, Brian ends up surviving a plane crash to only get stranded on an island invaded by military forces, missing Gina without a clue to her whereabouts. How...very...convenient. As before, his story will start with a destined accident and progress to become ridiculous, fast pacing and needlessly complicated over a short period of time. Buckle your seats, and be ready for alien conspiracy theories.\n\nFirst and foremost, I really have a problem about the story execution in this game. In the first game, we went through a series of absurd events and got blessed with miraculous luck so random strangers with extraordinary talents and means ended up helping us regularly to get a happy ending. Brilliant. Here in this continuation, the same dynamic applies - but the game is needlessly extended to present the illusion for the presence of a game time. The first 3 chapters that take place in Mala Island are somewhat consistent with the main story if not harbored with annoyingly superficial humor and aroused teenage level sexual remarks. The rest of the game is an unbearable story anchor for situational comedy purposes mostly. The whole chapter 4 is only there to serve as a situational comedy during a supposed intergalactic emergency! Look, I can appreciate absurd humor, I loved every single moment of Monkey Island series, but there is nothing funny about deliberately feeding a complete stranger to a polar bear's sexual frustration, just because Brian decided to icefish at the spot the bear's standing! It's plain disgusting.\n\nAside a slight improvement on graphics and in-game animations, the game uses the same character design, 2D environments and a combination of 3D modeled cut scenes alongside 2D dialogue sequences among characters. Gosh, even the design choice is over complicated here! Fair warning: 3D cut scenes where Brian talks to Sushi, beginning from the start of the game, are spastically slow for some reason. Speaking of bugs, first 3 chapters of the game work fine, but the game gets unbelievably slow when you reach 4th Chapter. It takes a couple seconds to even move the mouse from one point to another. I think it's a problem with the snowing animation. I tried everything in my ability but couldn't find a way to mend it so I ended up closing the game and finding a YouTube playthrough to watch the rest to learn the story. This bug occurs with both Windows 7 Pro and 8.1 Pro. Be warned.\n\nAs before, game logic is flawed - not letting you go for the obvious solution before trying everything else to be rejected properly is our main thing. But ask yourself this: what kind of dimwit of a protagonist gets snow shoes to his inventory in a tropical island and leaves first aid kit behind, after a plane crash??? Such is our game logic. Puzzles are somewhat simple, but story progression and dialogues are a pain to go through. I'd vote for "nope, surely there is something better to do".\n\nIf you enjoy crass humor and are fond of "It was aliens!" skets - and able to forgive not being able to play half the game - sure, go for it. Otherwise, avoid it. Yeah, I will still play the last part of the series to get done with it and write a review. I know, I know. I love my community...\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","February 23","false","5.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

If you enjoyed the first game, I'd pick this one up for sure, but I probably wouldn't recommend approaching it without. The first half of the game is set in beautiful tropics and the colour and art is actually really nice. Some... interesting writing and a few annoying puzzles, but the last half hour will be some of the most frustrating that you will have ever experienced.\nIt is probably best as a buffer between Runaway: A Road Adventure and Runaway: A Twist of Fate, but if you like Pendulo adventures, this is clearly one.","August 8, 2012","true","7.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

Those games are made in the typical point and click adventure styles which was made famous by classics like Monkey Island or day of the tentacles in the 90s. Those games with some others made in the 90's are seen as the pinacle of adventure games, with their smart puzzles, great stories and humour, a golden age which is gone. Although adventure games are not as numerous or famous as they  once were, they are still around in the new millineum with various grades of quality and enjoyment.\n\nRunaway , Dream of the Turtle, developped in 2006 is made in this spirit, a new take on adventure games with better graphics and newer functionality . I liked Road adventure , the first Runaway, well enough and it seemed Pendulo which developped the game had even more ressources to make this game, with better graphics (2,5 D animations some places) , nice, cartoony and longer cutscenes, more characters and longer story than before.\n\nBut I rather think this game is inferior to the first for several reasons:\n\nThe characters:\nWhere to start? the main character, Brian Basco, which was sympathic if not very interesting in the first installement, has become a arrogant douchey prancing in eurotrash cargo pants with a goatee on top of being boring and annoying. As a main character, he is also not a very nice person. During the game he basically two-times his girlfriend (who he is supposed to save) with the local bimbo on an island, then he litteraly pimps out his newfound lover in order to advance the plot, very classy. On another instance he  throw a character who actually wanted to help him litterally into the arms of an lustful polar bear, for an unclear destiny of either being maimed or violently violated. He might have gone away with it if the scene was funny, but it wasn't , my reaction was of pity and discuss mainly...\n\nHe get a little less annoying by the end of the game, but it's too little too late...\n\nThe other characters which help or counter our "hero" are not much better,it's a mixed bunch of annoying and forgettable clichè characters , some of them are bearable. in a few instances they might bring a smile on your lips, but don't expect much. The ones that are really annoying like Joshua will make you cringe, just think of something nice while they are in a scene...\n\nThe Graphics:\nHonestly for a game from 2006, they're pretty good, the backgrounds are colourful and diverse and save the whole game from being a complete chore. The characters if you look away from their personality are cartoony and nicely done, my main critic is how frozen they look and how unnatural they're moving around. You could get away with it in 1994 when everything was pizelated, but I kind of expected better animations from the 2000's. The sounds and music are forgettable but ok.\n\nThe puzzle.\nNothing revolutionnary here, the normal point and click routine. While some of the puzzles are ok both in complexity and logic, some others are really hard and arcane, and you end up trying all kind of combination or to save time and your nerves, check a walkthrough.\n\nIn few instances I manage to solve a puzzle by luck , I couldn't help but feel bewildered by the unlogic solution. Other times , the whole setting didn't make sence, like when you have to solve a rather complex chains of events to get a measly notebook from another character while roaming in a huge and expensive multimillions dollars yacht full of expensive stuff.\n\nTo be honest the puzzles in the game are no worse than in many other middle of the road adventure games, but they're not better either, if you put on top of that a rather unlikable main character and annoying surroundings, it just makes thing worse.\n\nThe story and dialogs\nThe story is rather forgettable and not especially intersesting, which would have been ok with good characters and nice and witty dialogues, but Runaway , The Dream of the Turtle has none of that. It could have been if the writers had put more time in designing their characters to be more interessting and put some humour in the game through the dialogues. But instead we've get one liners that aren't even remotely funny and strange situations that don't make sence, since they were intended to be humourous but weren't.\n\nThe creative minds behind this game this put some effort in putting most of the poor female characters in vaguely sexy skimpy outfit , probably to appeal to the more juvenile segment of the player with a bit of softcore . But it end up giving the game an almost mysoginistic feel since most female characters end up being just eyecandies at some level.\n\nConclution:\nIt's definitively not the worse adventure game out there, but it's really not among the best, it's barely mediocre. I didn't hate playing it, but I definitively won't repeat the feat. The sad thing is that it could have been a lot better if they had put better writers to bring up more interesting characters with better and humourous dialogues.","July 15, 2015","false","31.4"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","31","46","0","4"

If you like immature sex jokes and rampant racism, and don’t mind horrific plot dump dialogues, you may have some fun, but otherwise just skip it. (It’s not even needed for the third game.)\n\nLong version:Runaway: A Road Adventure was a beautiful, but overcomplicated point ‘n’ click with ridiculous puzzles, terrible voice acting, and a story that eventually turned out to be quite nice in the very end. The Dream of the Turtle has no redeeming factors other than better graphics; everything else is worse.\nMuch, much worse.\n\nThe voice acting will make you cringe, especially after you meet Joshua, who is the most offensively racist stereotype you will ever see in a commercial video game, ever. And, again, this is the smaller issue.\nThe larger problem is the plot, which is beyond stupid. Not because it is about unravelling a government conspiracy about aliens– real, actual, tinfoil suit wearing, bug-eyed aliens–, but because it has no direction or story structure: things just happen out of nowhere without rhyme or reason. Also, the humour is mostly sex jokes. Very childish sex jokes.\nThe insane, but entertaining characters are also replaced by one-dimensional clichés. Brian is now a goatee-wearing muscular douchebag who cheats on his girlfriend while she is being held in captivity. One of the antagonists is a military operative dominatrix with spider fetish. And don’t we ever forget Joshua, whose entire role is to extend all puzzles by ruining your initial solutions.\n\nOn the topic of puzzles: get a guide. Don’t even attempt to play this game by yourself. None of them make any sense, and they are so overcomplicated even walkthroughs can get entangled in their stupidity.\n\nIs there anything good in this game besides the graphics? No, but the final Runaway title will redeem the series, if you manage to stay on board…","October 6, 2015","false","10.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

This time around Brian finds himself crashed on an island filled with secrets and it's up to him to find Gina before something bad happens to her.\n\nTo be honest I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first but it was alright, I prefer the Brian from the first game and it almost feels like the two are completely different characters during the game. This was my least favorite of the trilogy but it was still a fun playthrough for the most part.\n\nI reccomend buying this only if it's on sale and only if you have all the other adventure games on your to do list crossed off as this game although fun isn't as good as some of the bigger named titles in my opinion. Also although it isn't required that you play the first one to understand I reccomend buying the first before this just on the fact that I felt it was a better game.","January 7, 2014","true","16.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The characters' 3D models blend better with the 2D scenery, the animation is more fluid, the talking animation looks decent (but is still choppy when cut-scenes zoom in close), characters' conversations & reactions are written better, and the puzzles are still fun.\nHowever, compared to the first game, the plot is silly (downright sloppy at some points), and obviously written for the sake of pumping out a sequel. The game's plot stresses (and then snaps) suspension of disbelief, after which unlikely characters from the first game make a return, and then the game continues to get goofier until the ending.\nI recommend The Dream of the Turtle ONLY if you grab the entire trilogy. This is definitely the weakest of the series.","January 1, 2015","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/7220/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","NOTE: I had a lot of trouble running this game on my Windows 7 64 bit PC. It was unplayable even after attempting every fix I could find. Apparently this is due to an issue with AMD video cards. I had to run it on my laptop and use the new Steam In Home Streaming option to play on my PC. However, I still had issues with crashing, especially towards the end of the game. Keep this issues in mind when choosing whether to purchase this game.\n\nRunaway, the Dream of the Turtle is a point and click adventure game by Pendulo. It is the sequel to Runaway, a Road Adventure, and the second in the Runaway trilogy. In this adventure, Brian and Gina are continuing their island vacation shown at the end of the previous game. Things go awry, however, and Brian must become the hero once again.\n\nMechanics in this game are exactly the same as the previous entry in the series. You can switch between looking at and interacting with objects using the right mouse click. Double click on scene transitions to switch quickly to the next scene.\n\nI did not notice much of a change from the graphics of Runaway, a Road Adventure, so my same critiques apply. Backgrounds look great once again. There are more of a variety in backgrounds as well this time, which is a nice addition. Character models could use some improvement. The voice acting is mostly similar, so serviceable without any major complaints.\n\nThere are some story concerns this time around. Once again, almost zero interaction is had with Gina through the majority of the game, so it's hard to feel an attachment to her. Brian must feel this way too, since he jumps at the first new girl he finds on his adventure. I do have some issues with one of the characters, Joshua. He feels a little too much like a stereotype for my liking. The man character also dabbles in some light racism through the use of blackface while in disguise. The main character, Brian, comes off as very punchable during the first half of the game is in island attire. I believe it is the combination of soul patch and spiky hair that does it. The humor overall is funny at times, corny at others. There are some problems with pacing, with some areas done in a flash and others taking a very long time.\n\nThe puzzles are very similar in style to the previous game in the series. You will have to spend some time trying to pick up everything in the scene to see what works. There is a fair bit of combining objects to complete puzzles. Some use the dreaded adventure game logic, but there are no unwinnable scenarios or deaths so you really just need to keep plugging away.\n\nOverall, I see Runaway, the Dream of the Turtle as on par with Runaway, a Road Adventure. There are some positive developments, such as variety, and some negatives. I would have given it the same score and my recommendation if there had not been a problem running the game. Since performance is spotty for AMD video cards, and I even had some crashes with my Nvidia based laptop that caused me to lose a good deal of progress, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nScore: C-","August 14, 2014","false","9.1"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

The main character is an idiot, the story is awful and it gets worse as it progresses. The game becomes an endurance test, like a real bad movie that you foolishly decide to see to the end just because you already started watching it.

The second and third chapter pick up steam and you're much more easily able to figure out what to do while the fourth chapter has one puzzle that is not intuitive at all (at least...to me). The fifth chapter has a really fun math puzzle that I greatly enjoyed figuring out on a piece of paper. With regards to the "not so intuitive" puzzles you can sometimes find yourself clicking and re-clicking objects to see if they interact or give you clues as to what to do next when you get stuck. As with the first game you sometimes have to research an area or talk to a person AGAIN to move the story forward but the game is pretty good at letting you know when to do that.\n\nOverall, though, I had a lot of fun playing. The story is fun and there are quite a few throwbacks to the first Runaway game which made me laugh. The different chapters were varied enough that I never got bored with the scenary and the dialogue almost always drives the story forward. LOVED the "dumb" soldier who kept helping out and the beach chapter was probably one of best puzzles I've played in awhile.\n\nIf you like point-and-click adventures I definitely recommend you try this one out. It's on par with the Sierra adventure games we all remember and love. You may have to check out a walk-thru once of twice but it's definitely a "recommend".","December 20, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I still liked it even more than the first. It's true that there are many annoying parts, such as not being able to skip animations, or having to repeat the same action many times. In this way, The Dream of the Turtle is perhaps worse than the first game. Despite these potentially major problems however, I think it's still possible to fully enjoy this game. The story and characters make you want to keep playing, even if you have to use a walkthrough for a significant percentage of the puzzles like I did. Besides, there is a lot of humor and crazy situations to keep things interesting.\n\nTo get the best experience, I would play Runaway: A Road Adventure first. That way you'll be more invested in the world of Runaway, which will make it easier and more enjoyable.  Overall a very good adventure game with many laughs and references that really got me pumped for Runaway 3 (which was truly amazing by the way).","April 27, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Brian, the protagonist has taken a turn for the worse and instead of the nice nerd guy from the first game we have a guy that thinks that he is cool but really isn't and is pretty unsympathetic at times. Other recurring characters have also taken a turn for the worse. The art is nice, the puzzles decent although there are plenty pretty inexplicable solutions. Not worth your time (especially so since the plot points from this game is extensively explained in the sequel).","October 4, 2015","false","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
