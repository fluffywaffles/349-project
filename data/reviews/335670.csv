"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheShapeShifter/recommended/335670/","TheShapeShifter","鵺 Rem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheShapeShifter/","265 products in account","A tale of a broken man in a land of perverts and Joy.\n\n\nCrude,Rude, and lewd. Lisa stars a man who's been broken for many years, incapable of forgiven himself for the loss of his sister long ago, both beaten and abused by their father. Brad Armstrong grew up protecting his friends and teaching karate in his dojo. Envied by his friends, hated by his father and deeply traumatized by the loss of his sister Lisa Armstrong he soon resorted to painkillers to forget and wipe away his regrets.\n\nThe world erased in a white flash, everything changed and everything destroyed. Mankind had its females seemingly removed from existance and the world crumbled into a inhospitable place, mutants, gangs, perverts, murderers and psychopaths rule the world now. In the middle of this is Brad who'd become addicted to Joy a new drug in this destroyed world now using it to kill his past. One day when taking a hit of Joy a baby all of a sudden appears in his arms, not only that but a female one.\n\nBrad taking this child to his friends rejects the idea of giving her up for a better living to the local gang leader Rando, Instead he sees this child, now named Buddy as a secound chance. As his daughter or maybe just a means to put his past to rest. Wether its either is up to the player since not all of the cards are on the table.\n\nThe only thing known is that you will suffer and your actions will cause suffering.\n\n\nAll in all Lisa is a strong RPG, the roster is amazing, the story is blank enough to allow speculation.\nThe soundtrack is unique and amazing. The art style is off the walls and the whole world is a perverted joke and will have you cringing and creeped out by its warpedness. The game is a clear shoutout to Mother and Earthbound and Mad Max so old school gamers and RPG lovers with adore this game.\n\nHowever due to its limited side scrolling the map can be confusing at times, cliffs can easily be jumped off of to your death, bugs and glitches do occur, enemies can permanantly kill allies and the amount of status effects can be confusing.\n\nIts probably one of my most favorite games on steam right now and in existance, The story made me feel for Brad and Buddy aswell as making me feel the weight of losing an arm or a party member to one bad move or choice on my part. You will feel hurt playing this but in the end the game does what it wanted to, to make you feel.\n\nHonestly whats a good game? One that makes you feel for what its created. Wether you on purposely play as a selfesh person or a selfless one, or something in between you will feel like you made a impact in this broken and beautifull world.","June 22, 2015","true","149.2"," 540 of 566 people (95%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","95","540","566","20","0"

I was hooked on the world of LISA with the slight taste given by the prequel, LISA: The First, which had me eagerly awaiting this title. The developer cites Mother as a key influence and that shows, but even more than the abstract game OFF, LISA has taken the wacky humor and surreal style of Mother into a dark and very adult place. Dingaling is able to take simple, old school pixels and work them into truly disturbing imagery. Lately, we have been inundated with post-apocalyptic settings that are xeroxed and re-sampled at will: zombies, plague, fallout and bad weather. All of those settings, done to death, are fairly grim, but none of them can even touch the misery suggested by LISA. Here we have a world where women are extinct and the surviving men, seeing no future for humanity, have transformed the society into a sort of prison yard where hopelessness is drowned in drugs and alcohol, and memories seem uniformly sad. The main protagonist, Brad, is driven by a past filled with abuse and grief, and literally sets himself against the will of the entire world. The player will be forced to make tough decisions in this game and to eventually think about and judge the outcome. Even as we laugh at sight gags and endless pro wrestling references, one cannot ignore the uneasy slithering quality of LISA. My greatest hope is that the game does well and Dingaling games develops more titles where the heart of the game is a great story, not the ability to snipe someone in multiplayer.

The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times.\n\nAnd the gameplay?\n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments.\n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked.\n\nBut I can't help asking myself, "Did I make the right choice?"\n\nHighly recommended.","July 7, 2015","true","28.8"," 431 of 455 people (95%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","95","431","455","18","6"

Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it.

There is a unique world presented in LISA that's both heartwarming, terrifying, and altogether tragic.\n\nFor every single moment of laughter, there's a moment that comes where a decision you make permanently affects the denizens of the world. Whether it's your own character, a character you've come to enjoy, a character you despise, or an entire town of strangers you'll more often find yourself resting your chin in your palm and scratching it until the moment passes and you've made your final decision. Even once I did, I still found myself asking if what I had done was right.\n\nThat said, the gameplay will not be for everybody. It's incredibly difficult to get started and quite often you'll reach decisions that seem deliberately designed to royally mess you up, and even then it's possible to keep pressing on. There's also a deliberate pace and VERY unsettling subject matter and atmospheres, however the game never feels like it's forcing you into bad situations for the sake of it, despite a handful of cheap shots that get pulled you quickly learn this world cares nothing for you right until the very end.\n\nIf you enjoy Shin Megami Tensei's punishing difficulty, Earthbound's quirky and often heartwarming but sometimes dark humor, and a decent turn-based experience loaded with interesting moves and decent status effects. LISA is just the game for you. However, if the thought of losing characters, making heavily burdened decisions, or extremely mature and unsettling subject matter leaves you shaken, this may not be the title for you.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game enough, it truly stands as a paramount to what people can achieve when giving it their all with RPGMaker. Not all games need a happy story, but it doesn't take a happy story to provide an unforgettable experience, and I feel that's something worth exploring in the realm of gaming. LISA can proudly stand next to titles like Mother 3 and NieR for boldly exploring darker themes and handling it all in a mature manner.","December 19, 2014","true","30.7"," 202 of 208 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","202","208","8","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/9368533/recommended/335670/","9368533","Queen-Roger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/9368533/","88 products in account","LISA is a game that's intentionally polarizing by design, and simply playing through it's introduction alone is enough to give you an understanding of why so many people never finish or play it at all. The plot is a pitch black, grim, and hopeless affair filled with only occasional forays into light hearted and humorous territory. But the catch here is that these moments are designed to make the inevitable fall back down into the blackest pits of human cruelty imaginable even more devastating and impactful. You see, while LISA is a deconstruction of many common JRPG tropes, it's main deconstruction is that of a trope found in many forms of media, not just videogames. That trope is the notion of protagonist centered morality. What this trope means is that in a story, when the protagonist causes innumerable amounts of death and destruction in their quest, they'll still be a hero and still be loved and praised by the populace, because although they've caused all this, their goal is noble so they're relieved of consequences or responsibility for their actions. LISA disposes of this folly almost immediately. The main character, Brad, is not only suffering because of the awful events that have happened in his life which he has no control over, but by his own decisions and actions as well. Brad has a noble enough goal right? Save his surrogate daughter Buddy from the people who kidnapped her. Except the things he does to accomplish this start to get increasingly worse as the games plot unfolds. Not only that, but the regular people of this world do not look at Brad as if he's some divine hero that must be showered with praise, most of them look at Brad and see this sad old washed up has been and loser, whose just another nobody and a drifter, and then they proceed to ignore him, harass him, try to rob and kill him, make fun of him, and just treat him like garbage in general. And as his actions grow larger in their notoriety and scale, Brad becomes a sort of an infamous demon to the world. So much so that people either attack him on sight out of pure hatred, or retreat from him out of pure fear. And all the suffering that befalls on his companions and loved ones during the games events are all at least somewhat Brad's fault as well, and at many times Brad will be made to pay for it with mortal injury and failing at all his goals. In the end, this is not a story about someone conquering their demons and becoming a better person, this is a story about how someone is completely consumed by them and not only destroys themselves, but those around them as well.\n\nWhile I for one never found LISA's gameplay to be outright impossible even on Pain mode (the hardest difficulty) I can see why many are repelled by it as well. Unlike most JRPG's, you have a large pool of party members (30 to be exact) that are not only fragile and expendable, but are actively encouraged by the game to be used up as resources in decisions and situations that are either dangerous and risky, or ask you to give up some of your protagonist Brad's strength or items for the life of a party members. Another feature that is in LISA is one you usually don't see outside of rogue likes, certain strategy games, and CRPG's. And that is permanent death. Whenever you are fighting a particularly powerfull enemy, sleeping at campfires, or being faced with a decision, there's a random chance or a conscious decision on the players part as to whether or not a party member will be killed off forever. There is one thing that makes it all easier on you. There is no grinding required whatsoever in LISA. How is this possible? Simple, you gain enough exp from exploring and fighting pre set enemies you can actually see and walk into. Consequently gameplay is now spent venturing into as many new areas as possible instead of fighting the same enemy in the same caves or same forests for hours. After all, the largest  amounts of exp will only be found by exploring and fighting enemies that are well off the beaten path.\n\nWhen all these things combine, they form an experience that's both foreign and strange, and yet so human and relatable at the same time. For those of you who are easily offended or disgusted, or for those who subject matter like this brings back unpleasant memories or experiences, you will most likely not enjoy this at all. But if your willing to try something that's truly unique and impactful despite everything mentioned here, you might just have an unforgettable ride ahead of you.","May 9","true","63.2"," 82 of 83 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","82","83","0","0"

How can I talk about this game in a way that would make any kind of sense..? Well, keep reading to see me try. At it's core, I can describe LISA as Earthbound's side-scrolling creepy uncle. The game at the time of this review of mine has not recieved nearly as much attention as I feel it deserves. It's equal parts touching, funny and heartbreakingly tragic. Gone are the JRPG tropes or teen-young adult pretty boys and loli girls, in are Middle-Aged men, Luchadors and Fishmen (to name only a few replacements).\n\nWith a very powerful opening that tackles bullying and an abusive father, we're thrown into the shoes of a middle-aged balding man named Brad Armstrong and his battles with substance abuse, where the game jumped forward an unknown number of years to a post-apocalyptic reverse of the comic "Y: The Last Man" where men are the only group of people who have survived whatever incident has occured. That's when our unconventional hero Brad, comes across a little baby all wrapped up and seemingly abandoned, but in this world of only men, this child turns out to be a female. Where is the woman who gave birth to her? What is Brad to do, hand her over so when she grows up she can help repopulate the world? Protect her and let her live her own life? And that's as far as I will go with our story, as it takes many many twists and turns till we reach our end.\n\nGameplay wise, LISA is a turn-based RPG with an optional combo input system along the lines of Xenogears, with a large cast of recruitable characters with their own little stories and personality along the lines of Chrono Cross and Suikoden-- which is something this game has in droves, personality. The battle system is handled in a first-person perspective when selecting your moves like Earthbound, but when you active your attacks, your character will appear next to your target and strike them with the attack. You can ride around on a bike like Pokemon, there are puzzles and mini-games galore. There are events that can occur while you rest at bonfires, notes can be left for you, characters of yours can be kidnapped, mags (your currency) can be robbed from you-- there is a very small underline of survival in the game, that doesn't feel tacked on or overbearing, with more inventory management than some of the more recent survival-horror titles that have been released. The game does have some fairly tough battles that require some strategy and knowledge of the system.  I also have to note that much like older games of the same cut, there is next to no hand-holding, and there are times where you might be unsure where to head next.\n\nLISA is also absolutely jam-packed with references and love letters to many different things. The RPG genre, Lets Players and Pro-Wrestling to name a few. The game's references resonated with my love for classic JRPGs, Matt and Pat from Best Friends Play on youtube and WWE references up the yin-yang. Things that I adore. If you love WWE, JRPGs and Crazy LPers, you'll get a kick out of the little references sprinkled throughout the game.\n\nI've only gone through the game only once, but it begs for multiple playthoughs due to some choices that you can make during your journey, and if you've fallen in love with the game as I have, you'll want to absorb every little piece of dialogue and alternate path you can.\n\nLISA snuck itself into my Library at the end of 2014 to crown itself game of the year in a year which featured many fantastic titles both indie and AAA alike.\n\nIs LISA for you..? Do you want a thought provoking story? Do you want a game that will make you feel something? Do you want to laugh? Do you want to re-live the glory days of the JRPG genre? Do you want something fresh done with the JRPG genre? This game is for you.\n\nIs LISA NOT for you..? Do you want to invest some time into a game? Do you just skip through speech to mow through a game? Are you homophobic? Do you not want to play the role of a 40-something bald man and his team of freaks and weirdos? Do you have troubles with games that don't hold your hand?  This game is probably not for you.\n\nClearly, the game is a 10/10 for me, and it's certainly not for everyone. LISA is my game of the year for 2014.","December 27, 2014","true","17.8"," 83 of 96 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","83","96","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/335670/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","A story-driven JRPG-ish game about a withdrawn, addicted and kinda tortured middle-aged man trying to save a young girl he had once found abandoned in the barren land and raised with a few friends of his in secret for some years. That secret got out though, and since the world knows no women anymore everyone tries to get his hands on her, either to sate sexual urges or to make sure she'll be used to breed children and thus save humanity from the otherwise inevitable extinction.\n\nLISA's world is kinda post-apocalyptic. Could be America, could be not - not much is said here. Sometimes memories of the past flicker in front of the eyes of some characters showing a world that was once intact. Since there are no women around anymore most men apparently saw no reason to take proper care of what we would regard as civilized: Many people sleep in tents, caves or other derelict make-shift-ishy structures; gangs roam the area, people fight each other over gasoline, "dirty magazines" (which is the world's currency) or other stuff; joy is - for example - being found in playing Russian roulette, abusing drugs (most favorably a blue pill called "Joy", which the protagonist consumes as well), or reliving old sports and habits like overly-dramatic wrestling. Unless people still find more to their lives than hanging around aimlessly, that is.\n\nThe protagonist, Bradley Armstrong, follows a pretty violent path. In the old world he used to teach martial arts, and he doesn't hesitate to use his skills against others. His father never having been very caring towards him adds to it (and is shown in the very powerful, subtle introduction cinematic). A few people leave him a choice, many others do not. It's not seldom that you need to run down rather helpless and apathic people or nutcases who merely block your way. The game tosses pathetic weaklings or overpowered, unbeatable foes at you if it serves the story. Antagonizing Brad and relativizing the evilness of your opponents is quite an important topic in this game even it may be a little behind it's true potential because you are rarely having any true choice, for the worse or better your path in the story is narrow and tight.\n\nAt specific points you're forced to make critical choices which have bad outcomes one way or another. You'll often either lose items, get Brad mutilated or his gang members permanently killed. These are individual characters with very short stories of theirs. They have skills and stats according to what they are, used to be or would love to be (drunk, playboy, wrestler, casanova, cross-dresser, ...) and losing them can feel like a genuine loss, but there are plenty of them joining you along the way, you pick them up during all kinds of situations. Sleeping at open places can even result in some of them getting kidnapped by local gangs or abandoning you "just like that". They will level up through combat, four of them are battling at a time in a very classic, turn-based JRPG-ish manner. New members have a level depending on which part during the game they are recruited. Focusing on leveling up the same four people too much and losing them to some circumstances could be grave mid-/late-game. I never had such issues because there are just so many gang members and because I grinded a bit around the middle. Most battle encounters are fixed, some enemies can be "seen" before you actually fight them, plenty jump you by surprise, some can be escaped from (story-relevant ones apparently not). A few areas have generic enemies randomly attack you endlessly if you're willing to stick around, allowing to grind.\n\nWhat makes this game very special is it's morbid, dry, crude humor. It's quirky, full of subtleties and manages to capture a sense of constant wonder what to expect around the next corner. The situations under which Brad and his gang ge  captured and threatened can feel forced at times, and earlier in the game I had a few moments of light frustration when I tripped over the edges of cliffs into sudden "game over"s forcing me to load back to one of the fixed saving points in the world nullyfing some of the battles or item-grabbings I had done along the way. But that could very well be intended to create suspense, to punish too much carelessness and to actually give you some feel of depression and hopelessness in a mostly barren, dry world. I think the game does well in creating an ambiance of this kind. It has some strong, heartrending moments too and doesn't shy away from making fun of the world and it's characters at times. Even I, the player, felt mocked on several occasions. These were funny parts and they add to the strong charme and cleverness of this game. Everything seems thoughtful, like all would serve a proper purpose and nothing was wasted during development. I don't think there are too many games that have this kind of precision in design.\n\nThe music is pretty great too. It can feel dry, odd, crazy, pumping, serene - it's really all there and hits the themes, the style and visuals of the game on the spot.\n\nA little on the negative side: The game had a prequel. Some things can be confusing/are left unanswered (like what the crazy mutated creatures you sometimes encounter exactly are, and how women came to disappear in the first place, or what world this is at all - apparently it's a fictional one inspired by America or American lifestyle, but I'm not sure) and some references that are made are apparently directed at that earlier game. This isn't clear to anyone who doesn't look a little deeper. It's still a very strong game in it's own accord but this could catch some people off-guard.\n\nSometimes I had visual glitches. Like models of story characters I had met earlier appearing in one place or another for no purpose. They didn't move, they didn't react, they did nothing, nor did my character react to them anyhow. One guy just floated a few spaces in thin air. Later he was gone from there again. The game doesn't seem to have any graphical options even if it scaled fittingly to my screen when going from windowed to fullscreen. In combat some characters allow you inputs to execute certain moves in a row, but even when using my XBox controller the game is showing me   the control hints as if I was using my keyboard ("WASD" instead of "XYAB"). These are rather trivial aspects as far as I'm concerned but I don't want them left unmentioned.","August 19, 2015","true","38.9"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","60","66","0","2"

The game plays as a side-scrolling RPG, with visuals inspired by the Nintendo game Earthbound. Revolving themes of the game are survival and sacrifice as the player must make dire, game changing decisions throughout Brad's journey in LISA. Although the subject matter of the game can be heavy handed, they are complimented by a plethora of quirky characters, hilariously bizzare dialogue and colorful pixel art; all of which make for the perfect dark comedy that LISA is. That said, the story is the game's strongest point and I guarentee you will be enamored with its twisted, little world.\n\nI can easily see this game becoming a cult classic amongst the indie game scene as well as the RPG genre. I definitely reccomend it if you're a fan of old school RPGs or just want to try something new.","January 2, 2015","true","20.2"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","51","55","2","0"

I will try to avoid spoilers.\n\nLISA without a doubt is a very special game. It is one man's passion project. (scroll to the end for TL:DR version)\n\nTHE PRICE:\nSpecial games such as this are rarely made to completion, and when they are, their nature is such that it demands concessions.\n\nThis is a technically weak game for what people might expect from a commercial title, options are scarce, controller setup highly counter intuitive, resolution non-adjustable, and full-screen mode hard set. It has all the issues you might expect from a game made on a RPG-maker platform, such as an antiquated battle system and very rigid platforming.\n\nIf technical shortcomings of a game turn you off, I would like to suggest that they shouldn't, as a game is not a car or a tool judged upon its specs primarily, however if you are not willing to make some concessions to a game over its technical aspect LISA is not for you.\n\nTHE VISION:\n"The state of nature is such where there is <...> no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."  -Thomas Hobbes\n\nSuch is the view of life we find in LISA, it is cheap, plentiful, yet brief and ends ignobly in violence. The game mechanics work in concert with the narrative splendidly here, by offering plenty of wonderfully varied and interesting companions to recruit, all with a distinct look and behavior, you could even swear each has a deep and sorrow filled backstory even when they don't, it is all to easy to get attached to these men before they die permanently.\n\nPeople almost act like a secondary currency, you soon find out that your allies are just another resource that you expend to get where you need to go, but thankfully they never feel like that, making each death at least somewhat painful.\n\nWhile gameplay and narrative work together great, LISA's story is its greatest asset  hands down. What at first seems like a regular "save the damsel" story, is actually so much more. Some minor spoilers coming:\nThe only girl character- "Buddy" is a messiah character, she is the only known female, and is seen as someone who can "save" the world. However, you (as Brad) want to save HER from the world she is meant to save.\n\nThe game asks, what is the dignity of a child? Should a world that can produce nothing but misery be allowed to perpetuate at the price of yet another innocence? The answers that emerge through gameplay are often truly shocking and makes decision making very hard.\nThese themes of tragedy are suggested to be rooted at the core of all characters you meet,  through encounters like with Horace and understanding the backstory of Rando. The villains and allies you have are often more like you than is often comfortable and everyone partakes in a brotherhood of misery.\n\nAs you play you may choose to go with this world's depravity or constantly struggle against it, with more or less success, while becoming more enmeshed into this world as it builds on you, thematically and narratively, with its punishing gameplay. It culminates in one of those rare satisfying endings, which was the only video game ending to truly make me cry.\n\nI can not commend and recommend this game enough. Also the game has a gorgeous soundtrack, and tons of secrets, even whole large areas/towns that you wouldn't otherwise find casually playing the game.\n\nTL:DR: The fact of this games existence is worth celebrating and forgiving the inevitable vices it had to possess to ever be made. This game is excellent not for polish, but for its grand, bleak vision and meaningful story, that together make for a truly painful game. [Pain/10]\n\nAdvice: I suggest not abusing the "reload feature" if someone dies, or you make a choice live with it, what is the point otherwise?","December 16, 2014","true","34.0"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","52","59","2","2"

This game deserves your attention.\n\nLISA's surreal, insightful 'man's world' takes you to bleak, scary places but keeps you truckin' on with sharp black humour and just enough dangerous hope. Consequences are explored cleverly; consequences of the strange apocalypse, of your own decisions, of plain old rotten luck. The audiovisual design and deft game-mechanical touches elegantly create moods; of alienation, doom and fleeting beauty.\n\nThis may sound over-the-top for an RPGmaker side-scroller, but it isn't. LISA is honestly one of the best games I've seen in years. I'm not going to spoil the story for you; just play it, you won't regret it.\n\n~\nUppers: A creative, daring story in a well-realised setting that uses its dreamlike quality brilliantly. A wealth of fun characters to grieve for and misplace. Catchy music. Thought-provoking situations. Surprisingly fun combat. Genuine humour and understanding of the human condition. Replay value that'll bring you right back like a kicked dog. Flashes of virtue and hope that only hurt you more.\n~\nDowners: Quite laggy in some areas which may necessitate a quick game restart. I think there's one very minor mechanical limitation that won't bother you if you don't notice it, so I won't reveal it. I permanently lost Terry early on and now I can't stop crying.\n~\nThe Bottom Line: LISA grabs your mind and bites down hard. This game puts much more expensive developments to shame in its intelligence, thoughtfulness and sheer fun factor. Do yourself a favour and give it a go.","June 24, 2015","true","63.9"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","39","42","3","0"

It has become a word that’s to be used exclusively with a sarcastic tone, mocking the tryhards that would use it unironically to describe their supposedly daring and incisive new thing.\n\nSo what is LISA? A game with the unofficial subtitle of “The Painful RPG,” that touts a post-apocalyptic setting defined by amorality and violence, that features amputation and drug addiction as game mechanics—it’s edgy, certainly. But LISA is an effective reminder that “edgy” doesn’t always have to be said with an eyeroll and a scoff. Developer Dingaling has put in the effort to present a game that varies wildly in tone and charms, that does all it can to dodge the fatal one-note nature of so many other games that have tried and failed to claim edginess. LISA is a Venn diagram of “disturbing” and “silly” with a surprising amount of overlap, making its tangents purely into either side all the more effective.\n\n(Read more on Deadshirt[deadshirt.net])","January 20, 2015","true","19.0"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","48","57","0","1"

There are drugs that take away all of your pain. There are gangs that violate and murder whoever they want. But, there are no women, and there is no hope in this world. Until a drug addicted loser finds Buddy, a baby girl. The wasteland is unforgiving.\n\nI think this game is best played with nothing but a brief description in mind, so after reading this paragraph, I recommend you stop reading. Comparisons can easily be drawn to Earthbound: the music and aesthetics of Lisa certainly recall Earthbound, but moreso than that, Lisa is willing to be bold with its gameplay. Where other games will treat death or a dark setting seriously in a cutscene but then have the game just rely on killing and ignore its setting, LIsa does not. There is some humor, mostly dark, but more than that Lisa is warped and sinister. It is easily one of my favorite games. It's a different kind of RPG experience that offers something both refreshing and depressing. Lisa has a rich setting and story, with great aesthetics, and solid gameplay (in the style of JRPGs with agility deciding turns).\n\nThere are lots of colorful characters, some nice humor, and fun music. But, above else, Lisa is a miserable game, that is engrossing and moving.\n\nstop here to avoid spoilers*\n\nLisa follows the distorted story of Brad and his attempt to save his "daughter" Buddy. Grief haunts Brad, with repeated images of death, and menacing figures from his past challenging his sanity. It's a tragic story set in a terrible world.  The gameplay and story bleed over into eachother, and this game does not let you forget that its world is terrible. You will be forced to choose who of your party gets executed and is lost forever. You will have to decide between mutilating your own body, making yourself weaker and forcing you to use drugs more, or leaving your party to die. Sleeping out in the wasteland is free, but you might wake up to find your party has been kidnapped by a gang. You have to question if there is anything morally right in the world of Lisa: what life is she supposed to have? Do you get decide her fate? are you the hero? Questions are left unanswered, and that's for the better. Lisa is enticing until the very end.","July 7, 2015","true","52.1"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","35","39","3","0"

Sure, I have 70+ hours on Warframe, but this was the first time I've been emotionally invested in a game and the first time that a video game has haunted me in every aspect.\n\nWorth it.\n\n\nAnyways,\nLISA: The Painful, or simply just LISA, is a beautifully crafted RPG that resembles Yume Nikki, Earthbound, and OFF. This game may look like it's a piece of trash created by a developer in order to sate his own pathetic, perverted, violent urges, but it really is beautiful.\n\nPeople can and will compare this game to Undertale, but I wouldn't. Undertale has charm because it gives you a semi-negative, semi-positive story and then gives you some closure at the end, but LISA's charm comes from the fact that there is no catharsis. No escape, no happiness. This game is hell.\n\nThe grim and depressing feel this game gives off is incredibly damaging, especially if you're an empath. Good thing I'm not much of one. In LISA, you will kill your friends, kill your acquaintances, kill people blocking your path, kill people because you need porn mags, kill people just to kill people, and kill people because you're terrified of what they'll do if you don't. You will sacrifice everyone and everything you love. You will cry, you will scream and you will damn near break your keyboard because this game will destroy you. Much like the blue-pill shaped drug seen constantly throughout the game, LISA is addicting.\n\n\nThere is little wrong with this game. Some lag here and there that I experienced, but ♥♥♥♥ that, lag doesn't stop you. People will tell you that the story is monotonous and drags the game down, but I found that to be untrue. People will say that the game is repetitive in the sense that you have to walk everywhere and not many things about walking are different, but isn't every game? Many of the negative reviews bash on this game because the people who wrote the review disliked the repetition.\n\nThe wind didn't blow in their favor. They walked away from that one.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and everything related to it. Get it all, because at the end of the day, you'll find that the only Joy in your life is LISA.","January 18","true","43.0"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

It's also one of the best indie RPGs made in a long, long time.\n\nComing off as the love child of Earthbound and Dark Souls, LISA puts players into the shoes of a man who has been beaten down so thoroughly that he has virtually nothing left, but still perseveres in order to rescue the only woman in the world. More than any other game in a while, LISA forces you to weigh the consequences of your actions and continue on in the face of nonstop tragedy and tough decisions. Make no mistake - this game will leave you drained by the end of it.\n\nLISA may not be the flashiest RPG out there, but it is a masterwork on how to effectively build tension and uncertainty while utilizing various gameplay elements to the fullest. Every step feels like it could be your last. Enemies will routinely wreck your party, even with planning. Sleeping at a campfire runs the risk of a permanent injury, or worse, one of your companions bailing on you. There is no loyalty between anyone, not even between Brad and Buddy. A choice between chopping your arm off or permanently sacrificing a companion is one of the easier decisions forced upon you. Give something to an innocuous pair of NPCs and an entire village could be wiped out.\n\nSomewhere between the game insinuating that a major character was molested and a decision where I had to choose between sacrificing my current party members or chopping off a minor body part, I had to put the game down and step away for a while. The subject matter is unrelentingly dark, and even the few moments of levity the plot and characters provide aren't really balanced with the grim nature of the world Brad and everyone else inhabit.\n\nThe game will flip between moods on a dime - one minute, you're taking part in Russian Roulette that can (and will) cause permadeath for your companions, and the next you're in a village where an amateur magician is asking you to find some playing cards for him. You go from a hilarious wrestling sidequest that riffs on the WWF to a pair of decisions that easily qualify as the darkest moment in the game.\n\nStill, LISA does have moments of humor and amusement. The various companions you meet throughout the world all have quirky backstories and interesting little comments after battles (which makes it all the more difficult at the end of the game, during a certain cutscene). There are interesting and funny little notes written throughout the world, and some of the ambient locations you run across (like a McDonalds parody, where fast food meals are gifted from the "heavens" above) are quite unique.\n\nThe battles are pretty straightforward, but do rely on a lot of strategy, especially if you're playing in "Pain Mode" (where you can only use savepoints once). There is a definite degree of strategy, and even with overleveled characters, you still have to figure out the weaknesses of bosses and attempt to counter them. The game also does a great job of encouraging replayability through multiple endings, alternate choices and different party configurations.\n\nAlso, there's a really great fast-travel system that allows you to get to one of the main hubs instantly. It's always something I harp on about longer RPGs not having, but it was pulled off very well here.\n\nIf there's anything I didn't like in the game, it's the fact that a certain character that administers the decisions comes off as a bit too "deus ex machina" for my tastes, and some of the bosses either force you to grind or counter them with a really-overpowered companion. I also didn't feel that many of the companions warranted being part of my active party, and they don't do much of consequence after being recruited.\n\nStill, I was more than satisfied after a single playthrough of the game. LISA is a title that will leave you emotionally drained and weighing the consequences of everything that leads up to that final, nihilistic ending.\n\nAnd I wouldn't have it any other way. Highly recommended.","November 1, 2015","true","15.6"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","36","41","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmaElma/recommended/335670/","AlmaElma","Alma ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmaElma/","217 products in account","★★★★★ Graphics and AudioThe Artstyle is almost perfect for this game. It's inspired by the cult classic Mother, but still maintains its own sense of style and personality, setting it apart from other games entirely. I instantly fell in love seeing it for the first time. The world itself isn't the only thing that's beautifully crafted, the battle system is still quite charming. When you preform moves and combos, your characters will actually do animated attacks, instead of just effects. Enemies do not, but that's a minor issue, it feels natural. The only issue I had was that the background of the battles feel a little uninspired and not very colorful, just sort of bland.\nThe music is perfectly crafted to fit to the theme of this game. Often I would find myself leaving the game open just to listen to the slick tunes. The sounds tie together the feeling of this game, neither being boring or intrusive.\nThis game is both visually and soundly a treat to anyone who enjoys retro rpgs and sidescrollers.\n\n★★★★☆ GameplayMuch like Mother, this game doesn't let you spam attack and win. Every character is unique though, some of them preform moves based off a combo system, some characters work off a resource called "Technique Points" which build up by preforming standard attacks and taking damage, while other characters keep the standard "Special Points" casting like Magic Points. It keeps fights from feeling mundane and keeps you on your toes. This game isn't a pushover, either. It's initially a bit scary, as the world doesn't entirely restrict you from running into dangerous areas. Over time you will develop strategies that can break the game, but this is part of the fun of it. The status effects are entirely original, ranging from '♥♥♥♥♥♥' to 'weird' to 'drunk', in addition to your standard 'poison'. The enemies isn't the only thing out to get you though, as you will run into thugs and thieves looking to take your buddies, mags, and even your arms! Choices have permanent effects that you must live with. This game also allows you to set up your own party", picking from 30 total characters to roll with on your journey, allowing you to play exactly how you want.\nIf the game is too easy for you, you can also play the much harder "Pain" difficulty, only letting you save once per savepoint, adding more difficult bosses, and even bonuses.\nMy personal gripe is that a lot of the moves feel very "samey" and fail to explain very much.\n\n★★★★★ StoryThis game has a perfect mixture of lighthearted humor and dark mature themes. It's not afraid to jump from one to the other in a moment. This is definitely the strongest point in the game and will keep you wanting to go on. This is difficult to talk about without spoiling anything, because this is an experience that has to be felt first hand. The choices feel real and the danger feels real too, the entire game will leave you asking yourself "Did I make the right choice?".\n\n★★★★★  OverallIf this game was released on the NES or SNES, it would be a legend. It stands out from other indie games by both being quality but also well written. There are a few bugs and hitches from the RPGmaker engine, but anyone could overlook them and forget about it because of how well put together this game is. I recommend it with all of my fury, it's the best RPG I've played in a long time. The devs are also very helpful and active, please give this game a chance so they can make more wonderful content in the future!","January 8, 2015","true","35.3"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/335670/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Human civilization was never perfect, and the same applies to Brad. He had to live with abusive father, he had to get over his sister's death; he had to fight it, so he become a martial artist. Drugs maybe helped him to survive through the hard times, but they actually made everything harder.\n\nBut the thing that made living really harder, was the apocalypse. Don't think of demons or a meteor, something weirder happened - women weren't able to survive. Welcome to the Earth where testosterone overflows. But, like a God's gift, there is one little baby girl that survived. Coincidentally, Brad finds the baby and hides her from all dangers of outside. They lived a happy life until she decided that she finally wants to see the world, no matter how bad it is; so she runs away from Brad. And there begins LISA: The Painful RPG.\n\nIt's a game made in RPGMaker, but there isn't a classical world grid, there are platforms. Yes, it's a platformer made in RPGMaker with well known JRPG battle style. But there's an exception, besides classic turn action where you select attack, spell or an item, you use a combo system with Brad (and few other characters) to do few attacks and a skill in one turn - that requires you to remember the key combinations for combos, which are not more than 5 keys long.\n\nLevel design wants you to get lost in a ostensibly big world. The game itself is splitted into several areas, from which every area has many sublocations accessible from the centre. There's always more crossroads, and even more secrets.\n\nThrough your gameplay, you will meet many characters that will want to join your group. And as many people you will meet, even more you will lose. The game features a lot of gags and black humour, but it also plays a lot on you with depressive motives and hard decisions. If you will ever get attached to any of your party members, prepare that you can get really sad, as permanent death is something relatively normal in LISA. There are several special events, like Russian Roulette, but even if you try to ignore those as much as you can, there are enemies that can just kill your characters with a single attack without prior warning (even though they have full health). Stunning, blinding or some similar strategy against your enemy may help, but not always.\n\nThe overall atmosphere gets tougher with the fact that you aren't even safe at the campfire where you are restoring health and energy. You can awake in the morning without a friend, or deadly posioned, for example. This is the Dark Souls' player nightmare, right? Don't forget that the Brad is also still addicted to drugs (blue pills), so you will have to give him a hand or he won't be much useful on battles.\n\nThe main story itself offers about 7 hours of gameplay, but add many more hours if you are going to play through all optional content and the other endings. You can pick a difficulty for your gameplay, but even the normal one can get pretty hard in the pre-final area - just don't think that you'll slide through just with pushing attack button.\n\nGraphics of the game may look poor, but they are fine and they do its job. All the blood, masculinity, monstrosity and grotesque looks great this way, trust me. You may have also noticed that LISA is tagged with "Great Soundtrack" on Steam. That's definitely right, the soundtrack is so weird but unique, it deepens the atmosphere and makes you remember and hum some melodies later. Iconic.\n\nConclusion:Overall, if you don't mind the graphics, RPGMaker engine and typical JRPG turn fights, you'll love it. It feels like more adult and depressive Undertale, where all cute stuff was turned into muscles and gore. The story and gameplay has really affected me, my emotions went to the depressive state for a while - I take it as a part of the experience that I have definitely enjoyed. Recommended!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 12","true","15.8"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

With RPGs like Dragon Age:I, Banner Saga, and Wasteland 2, it's good to go back to a much simpler time to have a few laughs and even shed a tear or two. Taking a large amount of inspiration from the Earthbound/Mother series, LISA is a much more surreal and darker take on the genre.\n\nSet in the post apocalypse with a men only world driven by unwholesome amounts of sex drive, you play as Brad; a broken man on the hunt for his adoptive daughter who is the only known female since the apocalypse. Your journey leads you into generally unwelcome terriorty filled with quirky characters chocked full of bizarre humor at every turn. With combat working like a traditional RPG style with an added combo system which can be controlled through the players input to preform special attacks.\n\nThe game is a roller coaster ride of emotion, morals, and choices, both which have a dark side to them. So much that you'll choke up on the many curve balls the game throws your way. These curveballs include sacraficing party members for your own skin or even the other way around;  where you yourself are offering an arm or an eye to save them at the cost of losing your combat prowess.\n\nOverall it's a great game with a lot to offer and plenty of content. If you're a fan of the Earthbound/Mother series, you won't be disapointed!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbiejnr/recommended/335670/","arbiejnr","Arbie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbiejnr/","232 products in account","A solid RPG videogame, LISA is packed with 10-20+ hours of good humour, discomfort and uncomfortable humour.\nThe game plays like EarthBound (albeit with a 2d side scrolling view) and the battle system also resembles it too. But be prepared for a lot of customisation as unlike the Mother series, you get to change party members from a large selection that's essentially the size of a miniture Suikoden cast.\nThere's 3 major HUB areas in LISA that lead to other areas filled with content. Your decisions and outcomes matter in this videogame so expect some things you wouldn't find in a conventional videogame. For example; at one point you're forced to survive 3 full games of Russian roulette to progress the plot. It can be a very unforgiving experience, but even when it screams "screw you" it finds a way to make it hilarious.\n\nThe theme and story of LISA is as unsettling as it is funny, it's set on a world where everything went to crap akin to the Australia portrayed in the original Mad Max trilogy except without women. The dumb, crazed and depraved acts of men trying to entertain themselves in a dead world can sometimes turn from funny to depressing when you're reminded of their bleak future or the happier pasts they might have had. There's a lot of scenarios in the game and I heavily enjoyed the fun or depressing character arcs that the game puts you through. I struggle to explain any direct example from the setting, plot or themes as I don't want to spoil the smallest things but I can gurantee LISA is compelling from the very start.\n\nMost of the time the music is intentionally weird but there's a few genuinely great tracks that are very easy listening or funky. The bathhouse's theme may be my favourite out of the lot.\n\nIt's one of the better videogames I've played in recent years and I'd like you to consider purchasing it. LISA is likely going to appeal to you if you're a fan of Mother series, Yume Nikki or Mortis Ghost's OFF as it presses all the weird buttons fans of those games have. Game creator Austin Jorgensen should be proud of this title and I hope he finds time to make another videogame (similar to LISA or not) if he can make a viable career out of this.","December 21, 2014","true","47.1"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","2"

I've explored every single thing possible in this game and I plan to do a third playthrough not only to 100% this game, but also to extend my time in this amazing world and change up the possiblities as 1 playthrough can vary a lot from another. The game also comes with a 'Painful' difficulty which does a lot more than just give enemies more health. Painful mode gives you a new ending which adds more to the story, new enemies, and tougher bosses. Oh, and the game has a kickass soundtrack. With 30+ different companions all with their own personality, hard decisions which can sometimes result in permanently losing your best abilities, companions, or items, and an engaging storyline, LISA has brought itself up to one of my favorite singleplayer games of all time.\n\nI'd recommend picking up this game now as the next installment is coming this summer.\nYou won't regret it.\n\n\nPros:\n- Great Story\n- Tons of variety\n- Lots of items\n- A lot of unique companions\n- Vast world to explore\n- Lots of secrets and achievements\n- Memorable Characters\n- A hard mode that actually changes gameplay\n- Great Soundtrack\n- Fun turn based combat\n\nCons:\n- Controls are a bit unclear at first","July 18, 2015","true","40.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MistressSpitfire/recommended/335670/","MistressSpitfire","Mistress Spitfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MistressSpitfire/","358 products in account","It's a damn shame that games like these will forever be overshadowed by games like Undertale, that got oodles of media attention. Hell, after the game was released and people were saying 'If you liked Undertale, you should play LISA! It's even better', people flocked to play this and the positive review percentage dropped like a lead balloon. These games are not similar, and people need to stop comparing the two. But I digress, on with the review.\n\nIn comparison to Undertale, which takes inspiration from the themes of Earthbound, LISA follows the source material much closer. LISA is a much more traditional, turn-based RPG where you play as a man called Brad, living in the barren world of Olathe as he finds the last girl left on earth, and swears to protect her with his life.\n\nStory: 11/10. I'm not even joking, I don't think I can pop this thing any higher. When it comes to 'masterpieces' in video game storytelling, some either tell an epic tale with in-depth lore and feel, or some hit your emotions hard, and this is one of those games in which mixes a balance of lore and a deep, underlying meaning on the concept of masculinity.\n\nJust please, don't spoil it for yourself, whatever you do. This is something that has to be played entirely blind.\n\nGameplay: 8/10 - Where some people say the gameplay behind LISA was repetitive and dull, I found the amount of creativity in the battle system incredibly engaging, and loved the use of story telling through subtle actions and notions done by the characters during certain battles.\nLike many RPGs, LISA is your typical four-man party member turn-based game, recruiting party members with different roles to help your team. Where LISA differentiates from the rest, however, is how the combat is executed. There are lots of creative buffs and debuffs that you'd realistically think would occur in a world containing only men, such as depression, being drunk and even smelling pretty bad. Everything feels fresh and new, while keeping to a traditional RPG format, and that's something I can really appreciate with a battle system like this.\nLISA's world is another thing that really helps the game stand out, as unlike most games that rely on a 3d perspective, LISA's overworld plays out like a 2d platformer, with certain areas being unreachable without certain items. This is used very well in a few gimmicky segments to help mix up the gameplay progression, but I won't be spoiling those here.\nThe game also comes bundled with a hard mode, entitled 'PAIN Mode', in which after using a save point, it cannot be used again, as well as the game in general being more difficult and having new encounters. This is really the mode that the game should be default to, in my opinion, as many of the game's features like the expendable party member roulette are seemingly meaningless in emotional value when you can simply savescum your way through it.\n\nPresentation: 9/10 - Although the art style might be outdated, it stands out as being unique and different to other RPGs on the market, while still retaining that feeling of familiarity from its Earthbound inspiration. Every character looks and feels unique, with everyone having their own personality and traits.\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10 - The composition work is truly a treat to behold with this one, with excellent use of leitmotifs and bizarre themes used throughout to further enforce that feeling of being alone in a strange place. It's exactly how I'd see a game like Earthbound's sountrack being made in the current era of games, and it really hits the feelings it needs to well. Not one song in the game is forgettable, and for that, I can praise the soundtrack with everything I have.\n\nAside from a few technical limitations due to RPG maker being what it is (Some slower load times in areas, which for how intensive the game should be, is abysmal to experience), the game is a must-play. People may complain about the gameplay, but you really only play RPGs for the story, right?\n\nAnd it's not like you'd want to play it twice for how emotionally devastating the story is, anyway.\n\n10/10 masterpiece, and I look forward to Austin Jorgensen's future endeavours.","February 22","true","40.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","1"

Why? They both are great games and share (some)\nsimilarities.\n\n\nMUSIC: It can't beat Toby Fox's soundtrack for Undertale, but it has some good beats here and there.\n\nUndertale = 9/10\nLISA = 6.5/10\n\n\nGAMEPLAY: LISA has a lot more variety to gameplay. Better puzzles, fighting is more stratigic, not to mention the challenge of just getting around (which can be annoying at times)!\n\nUndertale = 6/10\nLISA = 7.5/10\n\n\nSTORY: Undertale has a pretty good story. So does LISA. Although LISA's is more dramatic and dark than Undertale's which for me is a good thing. That doesn't mean neither story is awesome however. Both have their plot holes and other negitives.\n\nUndertale = 7/10\nLISA = 8.5/10\n\n\nHUMOR: Both games have humor that don't really get a huge laugh out of you (or atleast me). It's funny, but not hilarious. Although LISA's humor is much, MUCH more dark.\n\nUndertale = 4.5/10\nLISA = 6/10\n\n\nDIFFICULTY: Undertale is quite easy. It's not really challenging unless you go down a certain path (even then it's mainly just finding out the puzzle of how the enemies attack and then your good to go). LISA can be quite difficult without proper planning, and the Hard Mode is outstanding!\nUNDERTALE = 2/10\nLISA = 6/10\n\n\n\nCONTENT: Undertale will last you about 13-15 hours (depending on how fast you go through the game) to explore all the content. LISA will last you about 25-30 hours including the DLC.\nUndertale = 4/10\nLISA = 7/10\n\n\nOVERALL: Both are great, and I strongly reccomend both, although I personally enjoyed LISA more than Undertale. It just hit me harder with emotions, and lasted much longer.\nUndertale = 7.9/10\nLISA = 8.5/10","January 16","true","33.2"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","29","38","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/podeistaken/recommended/335670/","podeistaken","ポッド","http://steamcommunity.com/id/podeistaken/","146 products in account","To preface: I feel like a large draw of this game is to collect as many party members as you can before the decisive lategame. I had a decent amount, about half. Am I still allowed to write a review? Maybe a short one? Lisa is the Mother 4[www.mother4game.com] we didn't know we wanted. The game is one big love letter to EarthBound while still remaining very much its own thing. I'm not going to give away any ending details, but it follows the story of a defeated man named Brad and a quest to find his adoptive daughter, Buddy. You could've gathered half of that from its Steam store description. Complete with sidescrolling and black humor, Lisa is the rebranding that would have pushed Mother back into the spotlight had it been a Nintendo game. "Rebranding," that is a large part of this game's appeal for me.\n\nThe RPG gameplay, infamous for being a large grind, was never so with this game. 90% of the enemies you encounter appear on the screen beforehand. Enemies are fresh, given their own first and last names, and actually keep the play from becoming stale. There are a multitude of status effects possible in this game; among them is perma-death, have fun with that. From what I understand, "pain mode" features added story elements and is much less forgiving than the already uncompromising and decision-oriented normal mode. Music is tinny, fun, all very EarthBound. Lisa, which works between juvenile and disturbing, has the correct amount of "serious plot" needed to keep this title far away from that territory of rogue indie ♥♥♥♥. It all makes for one polished experience. With the talk of spiritual successors lately, I'm surprised that this game, as far as I can tell, remains outside the discussion. If you enjoyed the Mother series or JRPGs in general, you'll love Lisa. 10/10","June 24, 2015","true","15.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","1"

LISA is a game worth the money I put into it.\n\nThe game's humor and characters are well designed and each of them have their own quirks and those quirks end up being used in battle a lot.  For example, one of the characters talks a whole lot and that quirk is used in battle.\n\nThe art style and world design is completely different.  Instead of a top-down view you would see for most RPG Maker games this game uses a side view where you can jump up and down platforms and climb up and down ropes.  Falling damage is also in this game depending on height.\n\nThe game's choices are, in a way, a little harder than you would see from other choices.  One such example is the choice from losing your party member or lose all your money and items.  Either of them carry a certain weight that has to be taken to perspective.\n\nAll and all I would wholly recommend this game to anyone looking for something weird and entertaining.","December 30, 2014","true","67.3"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

This game didn’t really do anything for me at all and I barely put any time at all into it (probably the reason why I didn’t enjoy it as much as others seem to have), but I can certainly see why so many people loved it. I tried my best to review this as objectively as possible and have used that to decide that this game deserves a “recommended” review.\n\nLISA is set in a post-apocalyptic setting about a man called Brad who stumbles upon the last girl on earth. After keeping her safe from the rest of the men on the planet for many years while raising her as his own daughter, the secret is out and leagues of pervy men arrive to kidnap her. While the story is interesting enough, it never really caught my attention. It’s sarcastic humour and meta jokes combined with the depressing, hopeless and sometimes boring background story or characters left a bad taste in my mouth, though I can certainly see how it could be equally as amazing for another person.\n\nThis game doesn’t really bring anything new to the table, but it doesn’t do too many things wrong either. It’s an average, 2D-plane, occasional platformer with turn-based combat. While I like the added depth of special combo’s Brad and the other members of his party can use to inflict extra damage on their enemies if the player can remember the right combinations, as the game progresses you don’t get to do anything new. One thing I really dislike about the combat system is that there isn’t an enemy health bar at all. This can cause issues when in a particularly difficult and long fight, leaving you to feel like it might never end.It’s very vanilla and seems to be modelled after the classic model RPG, so if you’re into that, this game is for you! The platforming is mostly there to flesh out the scenery or reveal a little comedic scene. If you’re not careful though, you’ll continue on a cliff to the side of the screen, only to discover that it ended without any warning and you’ve just lost 500 HP.\n\nOne thing I really liked about this game are the choices it makes you take as you play. These choices will alter how you play the game, and definitely personalize the whole experience. For example, you could bribe an enemy instead of fighting him, sacrifice party members instead of your own arm, or even partake in optional mini-games (like russian roulette) that could either make or break your gaming experience. These choices really help the player realize exactly how hopeless and desolate this world is.\n\nThe art style and music choices of this game were very clever. The scenes and backgrounds are very beautiful, colourful and vibrant, and the music is invigorating and upbeat yet somehow do not clash with the macabre feeling of the story\n\nOverall, I can see why this game is as loved by many as it is. There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the game, the story is interesting, the game is playable, the art style is both beautiful and yet depressing and it certainly has enough gameplay hours for the price of it. If you’re a fan of RPG’s and hopeless efforts, I would recommend this for you as long as you’re sure that it’s something that you’ll love.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","October 2, 2015","true","7.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","18","22","3","4"

I picked up this game for 5 bucks on sale and after finishing it, i think it would have well been worth 20 euros.\nWhile the game is less gameplay focused and more of a story-teller it still has some solid turn based (pokemon style) combat. And with that basic design you may soon find yourself beating a really hard boss after 13 tortorous attempts to then just accidentally press [->] once too often and walking down a cliff into your death.\nI couldn't help but be reminded a lot of Earthbound (which is also like pokemon is some ways) only that every now and then something REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed up happens.\nAs far as the story goes, we find ourselves in a really surreal unforgiving world where anything that could be labeled as "♥♥♥♥ED UP" might happen.\nThe aforementioned gameplay is solid, somewhat balanced and easy to understand. Another thing to mention is the soundtrack, as this game has an amazing soundtrack (might not be everyone's thing though) with really funky beats and tortured parts. (I recommend you buy this with the Soundtrack if you're into alternative weird music)\n\nNow let's get to the real part:\n\nPROS:\n-Gripping Storytelling\n-Solid Gameplay\n-Nice Characters\n-Amazing (altough, weird) Soundtrack\n-Humorous\n-Really Unforgiving\n-Unbelievable Detail in Storytelling\n\nCONS:\n-Writing and Design are a bit wonky at places (nothing major though)\n-Has there ever been an intuitive Inventory-Screen?\n-Really Unforgving\n\nIf your heart can take a beating every now and then, accompanied by a solid all-round gaming experience, I definitely recommend this game for this laughable price.","July 19, 2015","true","40.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","13","14","5","0"

I think I found the best game ever made. I'm not even joking, I seriously love this game. It's so hard to sum up in simple words how much on an absolute masterpiece this is. When I first purchased LISA I had no idea what I was in for. I only thought it look a little interesting and decided to spend my money on it, and boy was I glad I made this decision. The game is moving, funny, and dark all at the same time. Think of it as a more "adult" Earthbound. Shame it's not as popular as some other gaming titles, it seriously deserves it.\n\nWell, enough of my boring rambling, time to do the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\n-Brad Armstrong. Has a more realistic man even been made in the history of gaming? Brad is the main "character" of this game. Notice I didn't refer to him as an antagonist or a protagonist? That's because he isn't really either. The game isn't going for the simple "good guy" "bad guy" aspect that most games go for. Brad's role in the game is left up to the player. Do you approve of his choices, or do you think Brad deserves all the terrible things that come his way?\n\n-The tone and story. There are a lot of "edgy" games out there. Some will focus more on gore and fighting, while others may tend to tell more of a story. LISA falls into an area that includes both. The game treats its tone the way it should, in a serious way. While some games like GTA may take the concept of drugs and violence as a sense of entertainment, LISA approaches these topics the way they really are. But at the same time it doesn't go too over the top with its points. The tone is the same way, constantly shifting between both humorous and serious at just the right moments in order to keep the players sanity in a balanced state.\n\n-Characters. Even the most simple of party members can have a deep and enthralling backstory. They aren't your run of the mill characters either. They are the most diverse group of characters I've ever met, all with their own story. The game also likes to establish that there is no real "good guy", this also applies to your allies in the game.\n\nCons\n\n-I really can't think of any. Other than the fact that this game covers topics that may upset many people, it has nothing really wrong with it.\n\nI can safely say that LISA the Painful is the best game I've ever played, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep and meaningful story.","December 9, 2015","true","415.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

I'm here to illuminate you(or not).\n\n\nFirst of all, and I want to get this out of the way ASAP, both of the games have amazing character development. By the end of everything, you'll care for them more-so than your mother. You will LOVE THEM!!!, y'hear? However, might I say Lisa and Undertale take different approaches on this, but both work just fine. Now that this is done, moving on to the story.\n\n\nHave you ever wanted to cry deeply from an emotional train wreck of a sentimental wild ride? Well if you're saying yes, which I know you are saying no right now you ♥♥♥♥ing liar, then Lisa is the game for you standalone. For maximum experience, play the Joyful afterwards, but I warn you, it's got boring gameplay. We'll get to that in a second. B-B-BUT WAIT, I hear you screaming with your Alphys emoticon in place, UNDERTALE HAS A GREAT STORY TOO!!1!1! Did I say anything about that yet? Then hold your horses. Undertale's story is not NEAR as sad as Lisa's. Unless you're doing Genocide, but by the time you get there, you'd have defeated "the easiest boss" and you'd be fuelled from the rage accumulated from your deaths more so than anything. Overall, the story gets a 10/10, no spoilers, don't ever get Fly Minetti if you want to ever face a challenge.\n\nOnto the gameplay, this is the point that separates the two games: Lisa got a slightly modified Earthbound combat system, which goes on turns, whilst Undertale is more bullet-hell live action. There are some changes to the system, of course, let's say the "WASD" mechanic, where the character not only does extra damage this way, but can perform special moves too! I found this pretty damn awesome. In Undertale, you are all alone and can face up to 3 enemies, while in Lisa you can have a party of 4(including the main character of course) and you can confront up to 7-8 enemies at ONCE. A thing I forgot to add about the characters, every single one is unique, it's got something to keep him worth your time, giving you the the option to try again and again new combos of party members, adding up big time to the replayability. Speaking of which...\n\nUndertale is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing short, a full nooby playthrough would take 6 hours to complete and all the other ones from that point ~4 hours. Now Lisa, hehehe, took me more than 14 hours to do the first playthrough standalone, all the other hours you see is from 2 other ones and a pain mode run+extra from The Joyful dlc. So yeah, quite a lot to do.\n\nThe exploration in this game is huge, there's a lot of secrets out there that require multiple playthroughs to see everything there is left to see. And this game is a platformer, no less, the last thing when thinking about one is huge.\n\nAs much as I like Lisa, its soundtrack(made by Widdly-2-Diddly btw), as really good as it is, it cannot compare to Toby Fox' masterpiece. However, I can safely say that W2D succeeded in creating atmospheric music, while Toby purely dominates every single boss battle theme ever. That's all I can say, really.\n\nThe choices, holy ♥♥♥♥, the choices. There are few games out there where choices actually matter. What do I mean by this? First off: Undertale's choices consist of "you killed said thing, it stays dead". Other wise, the story remains unchanged, sure, you will not hear anything from said character, but what's the point if it changes nothing in the end? Second off: Lisa = sell dynamite to these 2 chaps for lotsa cash? *Sure. Later you find out a whole area has been raided and 2 potential party members have disappeared forever. WHOOPSIE! Yeah, those kinds of choices.\n\ntl;dr Bottom line: Lisa is an amazing game, and if you read all of my review 'till here, I don't want to put Undertale under(irony) a bad light, par none, I actually support it! I just made the comparison between the two so you can understand this game better and silence some of your questions, if any. Overall, this game is worth a solid 10/10, I bought this at full price and I have no remorse or regrets about it. I strongly recommend this if you want an RPG closest reassembling a full Earthbound experience. That b- OH ♥♥♥♥, FORGOT THE HUMOR PART\n\nUUUUUUUH,UUUUUUUUUUH, GOT IT:\nUndertale: spagitii loel xDDDdDDDDD\nLisa: le middle finger u mad loel xDDADDDdDdDd\ndo did done\nkek","March 27","true","42.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","2"

I got this game for free for reviewing purposes >\n\nLisa is without a doubt one of my most favorite Rpg maker games ... I still am so shocked that this was created by that engine, Because its unlike any other Rpg maker game I'v ever played.\n\nSuch a brutal experience I had playing this, Its gruesome .. Sick ... Twisted ... and just Hilarious.\nThis game is not for kids.. thats for sure, I personally think its 18+ not 16+ but what do I know.\n\nSo now for the game itself.\n\nThe game starts with an interesting story, That slowly progresses into what your character is, Revealing bits and parts every now and then.\nAn interesting concept is that you can slightly control how it goes with the (Choices matter) Thing.\nAnd the story is really dark and good.\n\nThe game-play certainly is something to notice, Because its a good platformer with many platforms to platform on ...lol\nThe battles are fast, They are unique and fun but being fast is an admirable feature because thats what you usually aim in an Rpg game, To not have to waste so much time watching your character do the attack animation.\n\nThe dialogues are so funny, The type of ( HAHA..ha...wait .. thats so EVIL ..HA HAHA .. I feel so wrong for laughing at this )\n\nEverything in the game is so twisted, And the difficulty is something to count for,  Trust me DO NOT start the game with ( Pain mode ) From your first try,.\nWhat pain mode does is , Gives an extra ending/boss/area and when you save at the savepoint it disappears so you cant save there again, So you need to go to the next one, Which is an actual pain because you'd die a lot in the game.\nSo its recommended to try after finishing the game once.\n\nCharacters are all over the game, There are a lot to find and get to join your party. ( And let me just say they are all pretty weird, Don't think I met any sane person )\nSome wants money(magz) and others some certain stuff, But know that you'll lose a lot of them I will explain why.\n\nMusic is really good, And sound effects are good, Level designs are spectacular and characters looks great, The part I really cant deny is the animations... they're just so great.\n\nSo how the game works.\nYou get choices to choose from that effects how the game goes.\nAnd one of those choices are whether to sacrifice one of your party members to keep your items, Or the opposite.\nThere are a lot of annoying scenarios where you'd be forced to pick between stuff like that or ( Your arm or this random party member), Later in game you'd be able to afford to lose a few party members because you'd have too much that you wont use anyway.\n\nResting at tents is really scary in this game, Because there are a lot of things that could happen to you after you wake up, A party member could get kidnapped, You could lose items, You'd all get poisoned or sometimes nothing happens.\n\nI don't exactly know how deep your choices effect the game's story, But I do know you need to do your best to keep your party members alive at first because if you keep losing them, Then battles and bosses are gonna be tougher to vanquish.\n\nShops, Secrets, Weird events, Bikes to ride And much more content to encounter, Didn't feel bored at all.\n\nAlso a good note worthy part is the fact that this game is quite long and has some replay-value, And the achievements are really well-done.\n\nI know you might see the disclaimer and see the review for this game being too positive you'd think I'm biased.\nThe only thing that could be biased is the fact that I enjoy Rpg maker games, But I dislike those that has no creativity or originality and just abuses the basic RTP library, When this one made its own design, And became a platformer unlike any other.\n\nSo the not so good parts.\n- At certain parts the game felt extremely frustrating with pain mode, Making a small mistake and falling off a cliff and dying then having to restart from a long distance, So I felt like certain save points are close and others are just too far from each other.\n- This is considered a con to some but it contains spoilers !!  So the fact about when you get kidnapped and forced to play Russian roulette with your characters, And it is all by chance, So you could either lose 1-5 members or none at all, And I was forced to lose a strong party member and had to load the game... which set me back a lot\n- The platforms in the game are great, But considering this is RPG MAKER made you can feel some slight slow downs while jumping with your character, But when its on the bike its pretty smooth.\n- In most parts, The game leads to you to the next area that is basically 5 different places to go to, Which you'd need to do by order to carry on with the story, I had to use a guide a couple of times because I got lost, I mean yeah there are clues on what to do most of the time, But it was designed to be hard and I got lazy after dying so much in pain mode, And used the guide which was a really informative steam guide.\n- It crashed once for me, Which did not annoy me because thankfully it was a little bit after I saved, And there is this bug I encountered after saving at a tent ( Like all rpg games, Screen goes black when you sleep ) But then stayed black forever got stuck there, Had to close game and load.\n\nSo\nLisa, Is a game every big fan of RPG maker games should own.\nBecause it has so much originality and creativity in it that makes it standout between all those games.\n\nWELL if you are not into platformers then this game is not for you because it focuses a lot on that, But don't forget it has a lot of rpg elements, And a really good story and the game keeps it fresh with those hilarious dialogues\nRating -> 8/10\n\n\nThis review was written while i was a part of the original traders group OTG, however you can trust that the review was not effected by that fact, I was not forced to lie or anything, you can read it and judge for yourself, all my reviews are honest and I am no longer a part of the group.","March 18, 2015","true","7.9"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","2"

With 'Mother 3' inparticular coming to mind in reguards to all of that. But it also has a air of a Alejandro Jodorowsky movie; with it's surrealistic/psychadelic nightmare worlds, blisteringly dark humor and it's depths of probing the human soul (the pancho doesn't hurt either).\n\nI am impressed and staggered by this game; it forces you to evaluate the difficult decisions your characters are often forced to make, making me more than once pause to consider all the ramifications. It's a hard game, with a sharp learning curve that changes on a dime, and while that can be frustrating, it makes sense in reguard to the story.\n\nThere is so much I want to say about this game; it was a strange personal journey I took with these characters that I can't really explain in a short review. But it was depressing, funny, mind boggling, crippling, it was so much to me and I think a lot of other people got their own experiences from it. I don't think anything short of playing the game will help you understand that.\n\nThere are tons of strange characters to choose from, and it's often hard to decide on what team you want, but for me, when I made that decisions I stuck with them for pretty much the whole game. If I have any tips beyond making sure to carefully think out your decisions, it's save often, wrestle a lot and cry when you need to.\n\nI can't reccomend this game enough. But, I don't think it will be for everyone and that's a good thing.","December 21, 2014","true","53.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The subject matter is pretty dark, and for the most part is handled well. You'll definitely want to atleast look up a synopsis of Lisa: The first to really "get" alot of this game, but it's not mandatory.\n\nThe game's atmosphere and OST are great. The writing is solid. Gameplay wise it's just a turn based RPG with some side scrolling platformer elements at times, but the way you perform Armstrong style karate is satisfying. Typing "♥♥♥" to do damage was never unsatisfying.\n\nI really dislike dumb meme reviews that just quote the game and tell you to play it, but at the same time saying too much about the game can really give it away. LISA was flavor of the month a while back, and I definitely think it deserved it.  I don't think the game is quite as hard hitting as other games it's lumped in with (I've seen it compared to Spec Ops and NieR) but it is absolutely worth playing through.\n\nThere are alot of RNG elements that really tarnish the experience in my eyes, (There's a russian roulette sequence that is literally chance, and can cause a game over among other punishments.) The platforming part of the game also has alot of frustrating deaths from accidentally walking or riding off cliffs.  With that said though, if you can handle the subject matter and deal with just how bleak the game is, it is entirely worth playing through.\n\n9/10 tbh fam","May 14","true","23.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/recommended/335670/","76561197983662248","TechieRefugee","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/","714 products in account","To start: I used to add a longer header to these reviews which explained my reviewing ethos, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.\n\nGameplay: This game has been described quite a lot by now as a darker Earthbound, and that's not the worst comparison. I'd call it a sort of hybrid of the classic Shin Megami Tensei style of team setup where there are many people throughout the world which you can recruit into your team (unlike Shin Megami Tensei however, you can't recruit enemies) and the combat formula of Earthbound without some minor things like gradually decreasing health bars. There's over thirty members which you can recruit over the course of the game, and as the description of this game says, there is indeed perma-death, albeit not in as harsh of a manner as you may think.\n\nRunning out of health in this game results in you getting KO'd, not dying. Characters can die either through scripted story events or random enemy attacks; the latter of which I don't find particularly good. While it did force me to use other characters than my powerhouse team, it did feel frustrating getting punished just because of RNG. Unless I've completely missed something, there is no way to counter or predict killing moves; a design decision I feel would benefit the game. While it is funny that characters can just get their heads bitten off, it can be rather frustrating when that character is your powerhouse. Since it is RNG-based you can save-scum the game (in fact, you can scum the scripted sequences as well, but I'll let you figure out how to do that). However, if you choose not to scum up everything, you'll find yourself actually facing some pretty challenging decisions. Talk about these decisions, however, will come in the story portion of the game.\n\nThe comparison to Shin Megami Tensei earlier wasn't just one made to compare party systems; this game is pretty hard as well. Combat isn't as in-depth or tactical as something like Nocturne or Digital Devil Saga, but as far as the challenge goes, it is on the level of Digital Devil Saga's normal mode, with the aforementioned unavoidable lethal attacks included in that comparison. If you're looking for a relaxing RPG, this game ain't the one for you. It's not gonna blow your face off or anything, but it definitely has some expectations from you as a player.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty good time with Lisa. It's about eight hours long (for me; I also know I missed a fair bit of stuff), so the $10 price fits the bill IMO. It's also the kind of game I could see myself playing sometime down the road, mainly for using different characters and seeing the other endings. This probably won't be for a while, but hey; at least it does have me interested in replaying at all. That's a lot better than other games have done for me. 8/10.\n\nStory: From the trailer, I was expecting this to be a schadenfreude-laden adventure in which we enjoy partaking in the misery of this man named Bradley Armstrong. What I didn't expect was for the game to actually get kinda dark and heavy on me. This game walks a damn fine rope between dark comedy and just plain dark, frequently tilting to one side but never falling off. If you're looking for a happy game, go away. Now. If you're looking for a game in which teenagers go out to save the world from [Evil Entity X], you're in the wrong part of town.  If you're looking for a story that wraps itself up conclusively, well... sorry to disappoint you, but there's a lot of interpretation that you can have for this game. The funny bits in this game are great, the dark bits can be downright upsetting at times, and the ending could get a little too real for some. If you're interested in a dark and macabre tale about a man potentially ruining the future of humanity and in the process stepping on about forty rakes in a row for a cheap knockoff karate scroll, this game is for you. 10/10.\n\nGraphics: Well, it's not gonna tax your system; that's for sure. If you can run Steam, you can run this game. As for the art style, I could see it being a love it or hate it kind of affair. Some of the enemy designs can get downright grisly at times. Other times, you're kicking the crap out of/headbutting an adorable deer. The art does a pretty good job of conveying the mood for the area. There's a lot of silly stuff and a lot of gory stuff. The stage design does leave a bit to be desired IMO. Often, it just comes down to a reskin of a generic mountain, and it all would look exactly the same if it weren't for variants in the palette. I don't know if this game engine has the capability for slopes, but it would help the game world look a lot better. Plus, there are a few unfortunate areas in which vital things like doorways are obscured by foreground elements (namely in the motorcycle race toward the end of the game, ramps and the doorway to exit are hidden by grass). Despite some disappointments which may just be incumbent on the engine, the game does look pretty darn alright. 4/5.\n\nSound: Man, this game has a trippy soundtrack. If you liked the weirdness of Earthbound's OST, you'll be right at home with  this one. In fact, it almost feels like you could switch the battle themes around and they'd work just as fine on each other's games. It's definitely one of those games where I'd suggest getting the OST if you're into it; you should play the game first just to see if you like it or not, of course. The sound design is pretty good as well; hits feel punchy, meaty stuff sounds juicy, and it's just all-around a good job on that front. Of course, there's no voice acting, so there's no point in going over that. Overall, a once again very good effort. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/10/4/4; cumulative score of 8.7/10. It's darker than what you'd expect from the trailer and lighter than what you'd expect from the intro. Definitely worth the purchase if you can stomach a sometimes very brutal game.","December 17, 2014","true","13.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Though the developer of the game is on my friends list, I added him after learning of and playing LISA. Do not think that I have any ties to the game beyond having played it.\n\nLISA is a story about Brad Armstrong, a single father of the last child on Earth. Our hero's quest begins when his daughter is kidnapped. During Brad's journey to save his daughter, he will encounter, battle against, and recruit many denizens of post-apocalyptia. There are over twenty unique followers, and party configuration will change depending on the player. The game allows much freedom in moral choice, survival, and friendship, and no two playthroughs are likely to be the same.\n\nThe moral choices in LISA are abrupt, intense, and weighty. Each choice forces the player to question himself, and just how far he is willing to go to survive. Would you hack off an arm to save a friend? How about two arms for your precious supplies? Again and again, the player will be forced into difficult ethical dilemmas, and the solution is often subjective.\n\nParty perma-death is also a factor to consider when exploring LISA's vast and open world. Many enemies can instantly kill party members seemingly without warning, and it will take ingenuity and cunning to survive encounters. Scrounging for items and supplies can often be vital, though it isn't wise to stock them up for long periods of time, seeing as they could suddenly be snatched away by an angry biker.\n\nThe combat system is original and classic at the same time. Whilst combo moves are available to some characters, and status effects are a force to be reckoned with (unlike many other recent RPGs, I might note), the general feel of combat and the layout of battle is more like a throwback to Earthbound.\n\nIn fact, the entire aesthetic of LISA is essentially an unadulterated, mature version of Earthbound's. The humor is similar as well, with many objects and enemies spouting hillarious text that brilliantly juxtaposes against the disturbing, violent art and brutal, intense music.\n\nIf this doesn't interest you, than the story will. Whilst its concept is basic (and slightly cliched), the emotions and characters portrayed in the game are relatable and imaginative. When Brad suffers through drug withdrawal and immense pain to save the one he loves and wants to protect most, the player feels with him. This is the only game I have played to date where the player shares in the misery of his/her virtual counterpart.\n\nThis may all sound rather harsh, but it is made up for completely with the fun navigation and smooth combat. Finding secrets feels good, and destroying a group of enemies is satisfying. Combining moves to do ludicrous damage, and traversing chasms aboard a speedy bycicle, is enjoyable. LISA's fun is difficult to deconstruct, but it works.\n\nThe soundtrack is both unique and progressive, and it completely fits the atmosphere that the game so perfectly creates. The often chilling (and sometimes beautifully melancholy) audio tracks are unlike anything previously created. Tracks in the soundtrack often encorporate metallic clangs, haunting chorus, and retro beeps to create funky, catchy, and unforgettable beats that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's that there are some technical limitations of the RPG maker engine. But honestly, this game pushed the engine to a place that seemed unreachable, so minor technical faults can be forgiven.\n\nLISA will likely make you cry, seethe, and pump your fist in joy (it certainly did that to me). It is an emotional rollercoaster that makes the player beg for more. It is a completely fresh, fun, and intelligent experience. It is an indie masterpiece.\n\nI highly recommend that you pick LISA up right now. Set aside some time to play the game. Support the awesome developer that created this title. Do yourself a favor.\n\nI hope that soon you, too, will have joy down in your heart.\n\n-Mipple","May 17, 2015","true","16.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibcob/recommended/335670/","kibcob","•","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kibcob/","242 products in account","- LISA -  (Scroll to bottom for tl;dr)\n\nThis game is digusting. It is horrid. It is not pleasant, nor fun, or entertaining. but it is addictive. It's a drug.\n\nLISA is my new favorite RPG, let alone one of my favorite games on steam, and it pierces your heart with a painful story, disturbing imagery, and emotionally manipulative sacrifices.\n\nSetting\n\nI wanted to start off with the setting since it is so orignal and so neccesary to the story; I just love how it is hidden from the store page but it is so original and fascinating.  LISA takes place in a world heavily inspired from Mad Max. The world has become an unihabitable wasteland, clans and barabarians roam the plains searching for blood - and worst of all, all female humans have gone extinct.\n\nStory Setup\n\nLISA starts off with a man named Brad Armstrong, who was traumatized by his sister Lisa's death and his abusive, drunk father, Marty Armstrong. Brad has resorted to the drug Joy to ease his emotional pain, but soon he finds something that would change the world forever; a baby. And not just a baby, but a baby girl. Brad raises the child under the name Buddy and keeps her a secret from the world. One day, after meeting Terry Hintz, Brad finds out that Buddy has run away and the whole world is after her.\n\nGameplay\n\nLISA's gameplay isn't too unique, but it it still pretty fun to play. It's an RPG that is heavily inspired by Earthbound. Some people confuse it for a platformer, but it barely is a platformer. Some of the mechanics are quite unique to gaming, that can be a tassle to deal with. For example, one of my favorite mechanics is Joy Withdrawl in which Brad performs poorly in withdrawl, but if you don't give him Joy his withdrawl goes away and his addiction starts to diminish. On the other hand, if he gets Joy, he would perform significantly better than in withdrawl or stable, but his addiction becomes heavier and harder to handle since Joy isn't found around every corner.\n\nConclusion\n\nLISA takes the cake for RPGs on Steam. Its emotional hardships and sacrifices make it ruin you, paired up with great humor that is often well-cued. Disturbing creatures, gory imagery, and lands crawling with perverts make this a diamond in the rough that doesn't get enough attention. Its soundtrack can be menacing, upbeat, or eerie. It can pair up perfectly at some point, but not at all points. I believe this is a  Must Buy  for all people who love RPGs, emotional stories, Mad Max fans, or all in between.\n\n\nTL;DR: It's like Mad Max and Earthbound had a child, But the TWD games took it and raised it themselves.","July 10, 2015","true","47.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demi-fiend/recommended/335670/","demi-fiend","FBI Cave Explorer Agent Agentson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demi-fiend/","903 products in account","I've been meaning to review LISA The Painful RPG for a while, but I felt like I couldn't do the game justice. Now that I've completed the game and extracted as much as I'm going to extract without resorting to a replay to watch the additional ending scenes, I feel it's about as good a time as any. (Steam also denied me from posting this review for something like a week, I've went through a handful of versions, so bare with me if it has any errors.)\n\nLet me preface this review saying that I am an experienced JRPG player. Having both played and completed a large amount of them, both in my youth and in recent times, I feel that I can complete any game that decides to follow the format without much difficulty, although LISA does build upon the JRPG genre by adding its own flair to it, which might or might not remind you of Adventure games of old, such as those made by Sierra, as well as a 2D enviroment where you can go left and right, climb up as well as jump down cliffs (although be warned as falling damage does come into play and is even a fairly interesting and rewarding mechanic).\n\nThat said, LISA is a hard game. It will not hold your hand, and it won't think twice about killing the characters you've grown to love. It makes you think about your decisions, and every turn can be the difference between having your party wiped or a glorious victory - save-points being far apart enough that it can be a challenge - and if you want to keep your party intact through loading a previous save, you will likely have to replay content (especially if you've decided to play Pain Mode, the game's hard mode which only lets you save once per point, although the game does give you enough of them that it is not an issue.)\n\nI've played Pain Mode the first time around, and I feel it is the way LISA is meant to be played -- it makes a game that is an already very memorable experience even more so. I recommend it if you're up to it, but you should be warned: it can become very annoying, very fast.\n\nLISA's 'Mad Max'-ian post-apocalyptic world is well-written, full of character and color. It lives and breathes, and through it, the storyline conveyed bit by bit, keeping you guessing until the very end, although it can be cryptic at times, and it's a slow build. The gameplay will often take a backseat to storytelling, which can be a problem, but I was hooked by the story before I could care (this is more noticeable at the beginning of the game, where they set a lot of the ground for the story).\n\nSpeaking of character and color, LISA has tons of it. The landscapes while very simple, can be beautiful and moody, which is fairly hard to convey in a 2D game -- although most of the time you'll be looking at dusty mountains and cavern systems which can be a bit daunting at first. What shines most in LISA are the characters: There are tons, and so many of them interesting enough for you to want to know more about them and how they and the world came to be. It can almost be a problem, as they'll leave you wanting, and the game can be very lean on dialogue at times. Most characters will have plenty of lines, but some can join your party without as much as saying a word, and that's a shame.\n\nNow, I've gotten pretty much everything I wanted to say out of the way, but I want to just take a moment just to appreciate the soundtrack. Oh, the soundtrack. It is, excuse the french, abso-♥♥♥♥ing-lutely incredible. I don't think I've ever been as moved by a game's soundtrack as I have by LISA's before. It adds so much to the game, and I don't think it'd be half of what it is without it -- it's comforting, creepy, upsetting, wacky, lovely and just straight-up badass. It can be anything the game needs it to be, and that's fantastic. It makes soundtracks the likes of Silent Hill 2 proud.\n\nIn the end, LISA knows how to pull your strings. It will annoy you, it will make you laugh, and it'll probably make you cry. It knows how to move you and break you, and knows how to build you back up. It is absolutely worth its asking price, and will leave you wanting for more if you do manage to complete it, and completing it? Now that's a hell of a journey.","July 15, 2015","true","16.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

The combination of tight, simple gameplay, excellent writing and varied encounters have created a deeply engaging world, and difficult choice and realistic consiquence excel the player engagement that much more, while never feeling frustrating or jarring. I like to compare LISA to Fallout 3 because along with the obvious comparisons like being a post-apocalyptic world with a variety of strange and scary inhabitants, all with their own motives and reactions to different scenarios, it's also a game where a large spread out world has been designed first, and a great story has been laid softly on top afterwards, which means players will get a lot more or less from the story and world based on what they put into it, and that works really well.\n\nHighlights\nOne of the great things about LISA is the fact that the game is so simple that all the design elements are clearly assertainable and you can identify why the developer has chosen to do certain things, and what they've added to gameplay as a result. As well as a great players game it's also a reviewers dream.\n\nThere are honestly things that are mediocre here. Combat, for example, is fair, it adds a bit of strategy and works well, but I'd be lying if I said it hadn't been done better elsewhere. Platforming too, has some very well designed intuitive learning and progression moments, but otherwise isn't anything special or better than in stand alone competitors titles. But they all do their job pretty well, and they serve the core design principles which are where the meat of the game lies. The characters throughout the world are all unique, interesting and fun to interact with and the progression system is particularly well made because it doesn't rely on grinding, in fact it's nearly impossible to kill more than a couple of the same enemy types, and even those occurrances are rare. Instead, you progress by exploring and defeating everything in an area, which not only adds to your desire to explore and interact, but even rewards you with new items and party members.\n\nThen there's the story, which has been dusted over the game afterwards, and while no means is easy to ignore, doesn't add as much as it would to any other game. This is because, regardless of what the story was going to be, the world and gameplay would serve it from the start and only the writing and art style would have needed to been changed. But the story fits well and when bolstered by the weight of realistic choice rather than the usual black and white Good/Bad system other games tend to have, brings out the desperate nature of this post-apocalyptic world full of horrible human nature. It forces you to invest emotionally into the game, and then to sacrifice to progress. It's often troubling and downright heartwrenching.\n\nMistakes\nThe majority of annoyances with this game come from its use of the RPG Maker engine, which both limit its capabilities and cause a few annoying problems. Cliffs, for example, are often very easy to walk off after entering a new screen area, text boxes can cut off text, etc.\n\nThere are also plenty of technical issues, particularly in early releases. Fortunately the developer is still extremely active and proactive, which serves the future of this game. There's also a legacy release which, while it has some issues, helps to reduce the scope of technical problems.\n\nRecommendations\nAvailable for £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 on Steam, and with a good 12 hour play time on the main story, this is a very fairly priced title and should probably be played by almost everyone at least once. Completionists and achievement hunters can expect at least another 6 or 7 hours of gameplay and the personal choices and alternative story approaches give this some great replay value too.\n\n* Lisa "The First" has a much more vague story and is still available for free[rpgmaker.net], definitely worth a play through","July 9, 2015","true","9.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It also does an excellent job of hitting you hard, becoming increasingly more melancholy as it progresses. Heck, I was sobbing uncontrollably throughout the entirety of the ending. "The Painful RPG" indeed.\n\nLISA also has a great artstyle and very nice soundtrack, full of both tunes that I'd willingly listen to outside of the game and others that help set the creepy and depressing tone very well. Though, what I'm most fond of its extensively wide and unique cast of characters; not just the 30 recruitable party members (offering a fun amount of variety), but also the fact that nearly every enemy in the game has their own unique design and name.\n\nI would recommend LISA to anyone, whether or not they're into RPGs.

It combines tight writing to push painful moments and excellent comic timing to relieve that tension to produce a compelling narrative about failure, trauma, desperation, etc. But all that aside, it's also a very satisfying traditional RPG - the diversity of characters provides enormous flexibility in playstyle, the mechanics are complex enough to reward mastery while simple enough to be mastered. There's also plenty of side-quests, which add depth but aren't necessary to complete the game.\n\nThe setting is compelling enough that it'll itch at your mind for a while after you finish the game. I'm very much looking forward to the next game in the series.\n\nBeating LISA took me about 13 hours of play-time, accounting for save-scumming.

The writing is top notch, balancing horror and humour with ease, it has quite engaging, turn-based gameplay, and a lot of secrets to find! Be sure to play it on normal difficulty though, cause the PAIN mode basically adds one quick scene at the end of the game,  and one throw-away location in one area.

It's sad that Undertale had overshadowed this wonderful game because of it's massive popularity. Probably the reason why was because of it's dark story and humor. Not a lot of people can get behind LISA that easilly compared to undertale. Of course a lot of people would talk about how LISA would be "misogynistic" (I'm looking at you tumblr) and how it has innapropriate humor.\n\nLISA is only for people who can absorb a deep and dark story.\n\nFor starters, this game takes place after it's prequel "LISA The First". Lisa The First shows the struggle with Lisa (Brad's sister) and her Father. Abuse. Abandonment. Neglect. Lisa suffers what Brad had suffered before he ran away. That's what was predicted. The timeline during LISA The First shows that Brad is absent during most of Lisa's childhood.\n\nFollow by the current LISA The Painful.\n\nNow it's not much but my prediction is that Buddy is Lisa's daughter, which whom Brad adopts.\n\nAfter that the story progresses through Brad's journey to find Buddy and rescue her from Olathe's perverts and freaks. The humor stands to difuse any depressing moments, but maintains the constant beat of what is Brad's purpose throughtout the game.\n\nThe companions have there own charming personaility that makes you remember each and everyone one of them.\n\nAnd the moments and events in the game is all humorous and quirky in their own way. That's the magic touch of the Dingaling.\n\nThe combat system is intuitive, making you remember patterns of WASD to execute skills and while adding extra damage. It keeps you engaged rather than you sitting back and pressing a few buttons and wait a turn.\n\nThe more I play LISA the more I go deeper into it's own story making me want more of it.\n\nDingaling is the magic man and I'm feeling the magic.\n\n-Terr Bear","December 31, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/recommended/335670/","atypicalchuck","AtypicalChuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/","389 products in account","This review is sans-DLC, but I did read up on the meat of the DLC to see what I was missing out on.\n\n**Vague spoilers below read at your own risk**\n\nI think LISA had a ton of promise. With the bizarrely crafted world and well crafted, unsettling imagery the story could have come back around really tackled some serious issues; instead it skirted around the subtexts of abuse/addiction in favor of a juvenile madmax-ish mutant... whatever. Just because everyone feels like this game is the best thing ever isn't important.\n\nSo why the positive review? Well, the game captured my interest the entire way before letting me down. The unacceptably large number of characters you amass is not justified given there are 5 parts of he game with so-called "grind spots". Each character is fun and unique but only a couple are really solid.\n\nThe world is huge and well-crafted. Each area looks great, the character/monster artwork is on another level (even with the rediculous pervy angle they approached the game with).  The music is also charming and unique but highly experimental.  It does fit the game.\n\nCombat is OK. The way the characters land on the enemies with their own flare for each attack was my favorite part. When the main character loses limbs combat aptly changes for him which was a fine detail. Also it was funny watching him ride a bike that way.\n\nThis game, in my opinion, was crafted to confuse and disorient. Mission accomplished. Each sub-area has a bunch of doors, each going to other sub-areas and the player gets to stumble around trying to figure out where to go. It added a lot of time to an already lengthy RPG. The game is supposed to be thematically heavy but it could still be more... fun.  The entire game felt like a ♥♥♥♥ing chore to play.\n\nWhile the first LISA game was about how abuse (be it sexual or physical) is inescapable and hanting. Even though it was over exaggerated and fantastic that game took place in reality.  I could see how that kind of trauma would scar a psyche.\n\nThis game is arguably about guilt, abuse, addiction and trying to project those problems on another person who doesn't want to be helped.  So the fact this game is literally taken play in the apocolyypse is ♥♥♥♥ing rediculous.  Had it come back to the poor kid and possible offered insight as to why he took his mental journey, well, at least I could buy into that. If this game is really post-apocalyptic it really screws itself over as that is just too dumb to get behind. Too wacky. Too "omg pervert mens is everywhere, shocking lol".\n\nI did enjoy how the character's pre-apocolypse backgrounds/stories wove together by the end that much seemed deliberate but that was utilized the least of all the elements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/recommended/335670/","atypicalchuck","AtypicalChuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/","389 products in account","This review is sans-DLC, but I did read up on the meat of the DLC to see what I was missing out on.\n\n**Vague spoilers below read at your own risk**\n\nI think LISA had a ton of promise. With the bizarrely crafted world and well crafted, unsettling imagery the story could have come back around really tackled some serious issues; instead it skirted around the subtexts of abuse/addiction in favor of a juvenile madmax-ish mutant... whatever. Just because everyone feels like this game is the best thing ever isn't important.\n\nSo why the positive review? Well, the game captured my interest the entire way before letting me down. The unacceptably large number of characters you amass is not justified given there are 5 parts of he game with so-called "grind spots". Each character is fun and unique but only a couple are really solid.\n\nThe world is huge and well-crafted. Each area looks great, the character/monster artwork is on another level (even with the rediculous pervy angle they approached the game with).  The music is also charming and unique but highly experimental.  It does fit the game.\n\nCombat is OK. The way the characters land on the enemies with their own flare for each attack was my favorite part. When the main character loses limbs combat aptly changes for him which was a fine detail. Also it was funny watching him ride a bike that way.\n\nThis game, in my opinion, was crafted to confuse and disorient. Mission accomplished. Each sub-area has a bunch of doors, each going to other sub-areas and the player gets to stumble around trying to figure out where to go. It added a lot of time to an already lengthy RPG. The game is supposed to be thematically heavy but it could still be more... fun.  The entire game felt like a ♥♥♥♥ing chore to play.\n\nWhile the first LISA game was about how abuse (be it sexual or physical) is inescapable and hanting. Even though it was over exaggerated and fantastic that game took place in reality.  I could see how that kind of trauma would scar a psyche.\n\nThis game is arguably about guilt, abuse, addiction and trying to project those problems on another person who doesn't want to be helped.  So the fact this game is literally taken play in the apocolyypse is ♥♥♥♥ing rediculous.  Had it come back to the poor kid and possible offered insight as to why he took his mental journey, well, at least I could buy into that. If this game is really post-apocalyptic it really screws itself over as that is just too dumb to get behind. Too wacky. Too "omg pervert mens is everywhere, shocking lol".\n\nI did enjoy how the character's pre-apocolypse backgrounds/stories wove together by the end that much seemed deliberate but that was utilized the least of all the elements. The whole mutant angle was just dumb to me and didn't do the game any favors.\n\nSo, in short, great pixel graphics, music and bravery to approach heavy themes. Not so great handling of combat, length of game, story and themes.\n\nShould you play it? It's weird enough to satisfy the curious just don't go in expectly anything that will make you glad you took the lengthy journey.","January 30","true","17.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazed_Cholo/recommended/335670/","Crazed_Cholo","Crazed Cholo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazed_Cholo/","160 products in account","This game is brillianlty written. LISA combines great humor and a good, dark, deep story into a great game. LISA touches on subjects such as: abuse, struggles of woman being used, the struggles of being a parent, drug addiction, and loss. LISA is about a man named Brad who loses his sister, was bullied as a child, and abused by his father. Not being able to grasp the loss of his sister, he resorts to using "joy"(a drug thats suppose to make you happy) to try to forget about his sister's death. Brad also has a deep hate for his abusing father and can never forgive him for all the pain and suffering he has caused him. LISA can be a very funny game as it makes many great jokes, but at some points it turns serious and can probaby make your heart feel weak.\n\nLISA is a turn base RPG that make you want to play it over and over again after completing. One of the best parts of the game is that there is none to little amounts of having to grind to beat an enemy or boss. There are many varieties of characters you can run into in the game, my favorites being (DON'T LOOK IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANY NAMES) Harvey Alibastor The Fishmen Lawyer, Queen Rodgers The Boss of The Prostitution Ring, and Fardy Hernandez The Sex Slave of the Men's Hair Club. Their are 30 companions (all being great chracters) that can join you on your adventure through the weird world of LISA. There are also choises in the game (pretty tough choices) that can change the gameplay of your character. The only complaint I have about this game is just having to reload your saves if you mess up because some save points can be pretty far from where you were, so make sure you save often.\n\nI truly love this game and I highly recommend it.","October 31, 2015","true","15.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

One day, You suddenly met a baby out of nowhere. Turned out that baby is the last human female. You shelter her from the outside world yet she want to know about it, few years later someone kidnapped her and killed your friends. And the adventure begins.\n\nLisa has a lot of dark story and humor which is exactly my taste. The story is depressing and amazing at the same time, the character is naturally likeable, whether it's the main character or the companion that doesn't have that much dialogue overall. I usually don't like the kind of story that doesn't explain all the mystery, But Lisa's story is presented by subtlety that i don't mind it. It actually creates a lot of interesting theory about the game.\n\nThis game is made in rpg maker, where it doesn't have the option to make a side scrolling game, yet Dingaling did. Lisa is basically telling you that engine limitation means nothing. The gameplay itself is old school turn based rpg with unique touch on it. I personally enjoy it with the variety of skills that Brad and the companions have. The best part about it is that you don't need to grind at all. Dingaling is an amazing guy.\n\nIn the end, Lisa is an amazing rpg that combines good storytelling and gameplay.\n\nYOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA.","December 25, 2015","true","20.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I cried.\n\nLISA the painful; Absolutely incredible. An easy 10/10 for me. This game has a perfect amount of everything, moral conflicting choices, humor that doesn't weaken the plot, incredible characters and among the best written games I've ever played.\n\nThe game engine is RPG maker(Ace, I believe?), yet you wouldn't be able to tell first glance. The music and art are both absolutely amazing, and express themselves along the story side by side. You couldn't ask for higher emotional quality than this. The only actual negative thing I can say isn't even a bad quality of the game. This game is extremely potential to upset you if dark themes are much. A spoiler-free example is the main menu background, it's a girl hanging from a rope.\n\nMy absolute favorite quality in this game is something extremely unique. True consequence. You make your decisions, and you adapt to them as best as you can. They put your true morals at work and help you pave the way for Brad, our incredible yet broken.\n\nLISA the joyful is an excellent follow-up to our ending in Painful. -Spoiler alert-\n\nPlaying as Buddy was something I craved for after completing Painful. I wanted her perspective, I wanted to see what she does, who she becomes. That, too, was expressed in the best possible way. If you love LISA like I do, you'll love Joyful.\n\n\nLISA the first is a free RPG maker title this game branched off of. It's very unlike Painful/Joyful, but it's excellent for some backstory of several characters before LISA.\n\nNOTE: Liking Undertale does not mean you will like this. They are entirely different games, so don't come expecting that.","January 1","true","23.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

It is built upon the the same foundation - deep rpg elements, quirky graphics, and self-referential humor. Yet Lisa's form is infinitely darker and nihilistic. This game earned my runner up for best games I played in 2015 for its ability to affect my emotions.\n\nNarrative\nLisa: The Painful takes place in a world without women. In this void, men have taken up male prostition, murder and thievery to slake their lusts. You play as a troubled man named Brad. The discovery of a lone swaddled babe marks the beginning of his conflict - Brad has found the last girl in the world. After promising to protect her with his life, he hides her in his house and takes care of her with a few close friends for many years.  Tragedy strikes Brad when one of his friends abducts the girl and takes her away. Suddenly, Brad finds himself against this twisted world in an effort to save the one thing he truly cares about...  From the moment I started the game, until the moment it ended, I felt completely absorbed into the world of Lisa. At points I even felt abused. This is truly a painful game and something I would not recommend to everyone.\n\nGameplay\nLisa: The Painful is a 2D sidescroller with an rpg focus. Throughout your journey you will need to recruit different party members with varying abilities and powers. The gameplay feels natural, fun and intuitive. The developer has given you plenty of tools to customize your party orientation in whatever way you feel is best. However, where the gameplay truly shines is in the choices you will make.\n\nSensory\nThe graphics are simple, but used to effectively to create a powerful canvas of sorrow and despair. Blood is strewn around the world with a liberal hand and the entire visual is one of rampant destruction and anarchy. The style completely engrossed me. In addition, the musical score also complements the game perfectly. One of my favorite moments of the game is when I  was traveling through a decrepit town and entered a lone house. Inside I found a figure dressed with some sort of astronaut helmet dancing to a loud, moody song with disco lights shining frantically. The strange figure would not say anything to me so I left after enjoying the music with him for a moment. Later on, after I had explored more of the zone, I returned to the house to check on him. The music was still blaring but the sad creature was hanging lifeless from a rope attached to the ceiling.\n\nConclusion\nDo not let the initial quirky presentation fool you: this game is entirely mature, entirely twisted, and entirely  hopeless .","January 6","true","13.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also while the story is simple and to the point, the world contains hidden bits of lore that helps build the story (similar to Dark Souls). I cant recommend this game enough, more thought has been put into this game than every Bethesda RPG ever and clocks over 8 hours and is so much more memorable. The only crime is there are too many party members so it can be hard to decide whom to use and level up, but there is a fantastic steam guide that solves that problem.\n\nIf you are a firm believer that video games are an art form, do yourself a favour and play this game.\n\nFox","July 8, 2015","true","13.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Lisa is unlike any game you have ever played. This game has a story that will draw you in whether you want to be or not, it demands your attention. The story of Lisa is a heart wrenching experience that few games have come close to offering. The gameplay is stellar and the graphics although somewhat confusing initially, I had fallen in love with after about an hour of gameplay. This game has many characters and personalities you will come care about as your story through Lisa progresses, and the game is aware of this and will take advantage of such things. When games say you will have to make world changing desicions, I often find myself rolling my eyes, but Lisa has desicions that will really push you to the limit; Many of these you will not want to make at all. This is game is the epitome of what a small developor is capable of, all games should thrive to achieve what a game like Lisa has. this game is simple and straightforward on the surface, but once you start that journey into the world of Olathe, be prepared. Lisa is an outstanding game and I cannot recommend this enough.

This slow start allows players to get hints at the overall world they will be diving into, hinting at a much darker story then what is originally presented in the first 20-30 min.\n\nThe story itself pulls no punches: You play Brad Armstrong, a washed up druggie who used to be a martial arts instructor to make up for his inability to protect those he cared for.

At first glance LISA looks like another 'oh-so-wacky' indie retro cash-in, but the game goes so much deeper than that. Put together from the ground up by Dingaling, LISA tells the story of an aging Martial Artist, Brad, journeying through a post-apocalyptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to rescue his adopted daughter who just so happens to be one of the only women left in the world. The gameplay isn't too special, but it's enough to set it apart from the rest of the RPGMaker swill flooding the internet. Reminiscent of Mother 3 and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, you and your stable of buddies can unleash hell on enemies using guns, weapons, special techniques and, of course, martial arts combos chained together with your keyboard. When you aren't fighting to survive you're solving puzzles, getting into trouble, and making game-changing decisions that'll cost you an arm and a leg (and THEN some!).\nThe story, artstyle, and soundtrack (also made by Dingaling) add a metaphorical cherry to the already appealing cake. There's music to pump you up, music to freak you out, and music to feel the moment. Though it frequently juggles comedy and tragedy, LISA's plot tells one hell of a story in a way that hasn't been explored before. Sappy as it sounds, I think Lisa has one of the best stories I've seen in an indie game. I know that doesn't say much, but I guarantee this one will feel special to you.","August 26, 2015","true","16.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And with tons of tongue and cheeck humor on top of it.\n\nThe story is intriguing, complex and has several layers. The dialogue is absolutely weird when it has to, emotional when it has to and clever when it has to. The turn based combat system has variation, humor and a learning curve.\n\nListen, it´s not gonna be a pleasent ride, but is certainly one that leaves a mark.

It's intended as the finale to this game "Lisa: The Painful" I haven't played Joyful at the time of this writing.\nTLDR\nThis game is worth playing if you're tired of bad storytelling in video games and want something eccentric and unique unto itself.\n\nIt's hard to write about the game without spoiling some of it, but I won't name critical points. It's a RPG with a 4 slot party system, EXP, levels, and mixing and matching party members as you discover them throughout an apocalyptic world populated entirely by men and all that entails.\nIt's a very *human* world, twisted through a bizarre tone that expresses itself through experimental and sometimes grossly unnerving music, the art, and the mechanics especially.\n\nGreat care's taken in making every single party member have their own theme and flavor. Even mechanics tied to resting in the wilderness speak to the game's theme of pain and hostility. To say this game is quirky and bizarre is an understatement though. I felt a constant sense of tension and unease as I played, but I think that was largely the point.\n\nPlenty of humor kept it from beating me over the head with constant reminders that the world's screwed, and my main character's drug addiction getting in the way and tempting me to feed his demons. There is a drug called Joy that gives party members, and your permanent player-character, massive bonuses and chases off the heavily penalizing withdrawal status effects.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game to anybody who loves quirky humor and darker, adult themes. It truly was a horror, and there are very few heroics to speak of except for the silly boys that made up their own rules in a traumatized wasteland that's both horrific and playful.\n\nIt's our Earth alright?\n\nI could go over every little detail on why this game is more human than the trite Good vs Evil nonsense that typically plays out in other stories, but the sweaty wonderland is best experienced with an open mind.\n\n\n---\n\n\nOther boring notes:\nDidn't 100% the game, don't plan on doing a Pain-Difficulty run.\nDid read spoilers post-ending.\nTook about 15 hours blind on Normal difficulty, missed several areas in that time.\nSome of them are very well-hidden, so if you like mystery and exploring the overworld based on NPC hints, you'll probably feel pretty clever for your experimenting!","June 5","true","14.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While mostly being a hilarious game there are many depressing themes and situations that made me feel the same way The Last of Us made me feel at certain points. The combat system is really enjoyable, you press WASD in certain orders to do combos and a lot of moves have hilarious animations too (like Terry Hints falling over and sliding into enemies). There are just too many secrets dotted around the world and so many unique characters to unlock from a man sitting on a stool telling stories and firing a lazer from his finger, to a bra and thong wearing bearded man with beautiful blonde locks who suffers from drug withdrawal. The last moments of the game were really painful to play through as I really felt my heart breaking every time I pushed Brad towards his final goal.\nI sit here having finished the game feeling so guilty.\n9/10\nThe only improvement that could be made is including button prompts during combos for controllers (XYAB instead of WASD)","January 9, 2015","true","38.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

I have to say that Lisa the Painful is one of the few games that have struck a strange cord for me. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in quite awhile to be honest and with the recent release of Lisa the Joyful, only continued the journey for that much longer.\n\nTo keep it brief, the whole series itself has a great but exceptionally dark story, granted it has great balance with the simple but loveable characters and side stories you can partake in so it isn't such a sob fest the entire way through. That being said though, Lisa the Painful has a great story, awesome characters and overall decent replay value. You can even get added content in Pain mode I've found which is pretty awesome. I really do hope there will be more content for this game.\n\nLisa the First was a rough play but Lisa the Painful and Joyful have just the right mixture of elements to make up for it.\n\nStickin' to my original note: Joyless or bust.","March 5, 2015","true","56.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I honestly can't even remember the last time I've played a game that left me this... Satisfied. Yes, it can be difficult in some areas, some fights are harder than others, so it definitely earns its title of "a painful RPG"! (Nothing a little grinding could not fix, though) "Painful" is just the start of it, honestly. You think you're safe to have a rest in this little tent a stranger so generously offered to you? Think again! A multitude of things might happen - you might get beaten, harassed, molested, or a secret admirer might leave you a present. Decided to take a break under the starlit sky, after that one difficult fight? Well, I hope you'll be glad to hear that one of your comrades got kidnapped for ransom. What will you do now? Pay the ransom? Or abandon your battle brother to the tides of destiny? It's all up to you.\n\nThis game, while unforgiving in some aspects, almost always gives you a choice. (Some of these so-called "roadblocks" can be a bit disheartening, but they add to the overall plot quite nicely) Each area is unique and filled with a different cast of characters! Some depressed, some angry and aggresive, some down-right weird and perverted. While some recruitable characters do not have a lot of dialogue tied to them, they're all unique in their own way, with a little backstory behind each of them.\n\nExploration is always rewarded. Of course, it depends on your definition of "reward" - a worthy enemy to test your mettle against, or perhaps a hidden treasure in one of the darkest recesses of a cave? Who knows, you might discover something you'd never have expected to find! It's just so pleasant to see a lot of small, intricate details dotted around the different locations.\n\nThis game also gives off a very nice Earthbound-esque vibe - from the characters and the presentation of the areas, down to the music. While the soundtrack is probably not something you'd listen to on any given regular day, it adds to the game's atmosphere incredibly well.\n\nSo, all in all, don't be afraid! Put on your time-worn poncho, gather your most trusted allies and embark on a painful quest of self-discovery, violence, perversion, drugs, craziness and most importantly - skin.\n\n\n\n","December 28, 2014","true","51.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I’m considered the greatest historian of our time… I’ve gathered a wealth of knowledge about Olathe and what happened… Many tales… Would you like to hear?\n>Yes I totally care\n> Booooring.\nHmmm. I wish you were more enthusiastic… Oh well I’ll tell you anyway. Let’s see… Oh right! It all started with what I like to call THE FLASH. I was sitting with my wife, god rest her soul, sipping on sweet lemon tea. I believe it was homemade by my sweet wife, God rest her soul. Or wait… maybe she bought it at the store in a bottle . You know, like a plastic bottle?  Well hold on now, that would be ridiculous to buy a bottle of sweet lemon tea, then transfer the contents into a glass. Why not just drink it from the bottle? I guess maube so she could put ice in the glass? But then again making tea homemade would be just as time consiming if not more! That sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥… anyway I’ll save that story for later! So, I’m sitting on my porch drinking sweet lemon tea. From a glass of course ho ho! When suddenly… A great strangeness fills my body… something was wrong… I’ve lived many years, and I’ve never felt something like this before. Do you know what it was? … Yup! It was my rocking chair! That son of a gun stopped rocking! so I look down and realized a little rock had gotten caught beneath my rocking chair! A rock under my rocking chair! What a day! I decided it was time for bed, I had a little bit too much excitement for one day! Hoho! I slid into my jammies, brushed my teeth, and said my prayers. As I was climbing into bed I noticed my wife, god rest her soul, brushing her hair in the bathroom. As I peered across the hall my body swelled with emotion… “Why can’t I be married to an attractive woman?” “Is it me?” “my money?” I’m a tall guy, I workout forty minutes a week… Is that not enough? Now my neighbor at the time, Tom Forknight, was very short. His wife Karen Forknight-Plateburger. Yeah one of THOSE women. Well, she was more attractive than my wife, i’d say she was a soft six, whereas my wife was a hard four. What’s the deal? I thought women liked tall men? Why was Karen with him? … Anyway my horse of a wife, god rest her soul, crawls into bed next to me. She decided to leave the beside light on so she could read her book. It was one of her romance novels again.. Give me a break… As if I don’t already feel inadequate enough… Not only do I have to compete with Tom, Now I have to deal with these fictional hunks! Aye Yai Yai! At this point I had suppressed the urges of intimacy, I rolled over and tried to sleep. Her bedside light was only of minor annoyance. I was able to drift off.. Then I woke up to a big flash of light. That’s about it.\n\nI can tell by the way you’re walking away that you don’t want to leave… If you really want to hear another story I’ll tell you\n.\nOnce upon a hot summer night. Sometime in July. … Was it July? My local grocery store sell really good eggs in July. I don’t know why. Do chickens operate better in heat? Fireworks maybe? I don’t know I don’t want to get off topic. Point is, the eggs that summer were marvelous! Anyway, My wife and I, god rest her soul, went to a BBQ that night. It was held at Dale Spooner’s house, well his backyard… Conny Spooner doesn’t like people in her home, I think she’s just an uptight ♥♥♥♥♥. So at this BBQ I see none other than… that’s right, Tom Forknight...Now earlier in the day my wife, God rest her soul, had made potato salad for the BBQ. Personally I hate potato salad, I’m more of a mashed kind of fellow. Hoho! So I sat in the TV room avoiding her till the BBQ. Once we were at the party I made sure to distance myself from my dumb potato ♥♥♥♥♥ wife, God rest her soul, I just didnt want anyone to think I would associate myself with someone that would bring a potato salad! Anyway Tom and his above mediocre wife were akready there. And get this, They brought a fruit salad! With Whipped Cream! The nerve of those Forknights! Needless to say I gave my wife, God rest her soul, a couple of choice words! About whipped cream! Versus Potato Salad! Son of a ♥♥♥♥♥! A real Tongue Lashing!\n\nWell Hello again! Funny seeing you here! What are ya following me or something? Hoho! Anyway… I often wonder what all happened here. What was that big flash? Why are we here? Even our day and night cycle is odd… Sometimes days last ages and nights come rarely. And these clouds… so strange… What’s happened to our earth? … Oh well. Enough of that boring stuff. I once had a real kooky day at the doctor’s office! I was in the waiting room reading a teen magazine. Normally I don’t indulge myself in adolescent publications, but I couldn’t resist! I had recently heard the new artist on the radio, Ulysess Utensils! She’s some young woman maybe a boy, I don’t know. Either way that child can really grasp my attention! So I’m reading this magazine because I saw Ulysess on the cover. I still wasn’t able to identify if it was a man or woman. But as I’m reading I notice something on the ceiling… I look up to see that there is some water damage. You’d think a doctor would make enough money to maintain his office… I guess he cares more about his cool jetskis than his patient’s comfort… And assumably big house and hard bodied wife.               I wish my wife was like that…                       Big ol’\nMelons…           Just then a droplet of water falls from the ceiling! My eyes trail it all the way down to the ground! I stared at the floor for sometime watching the carpet absorb the water.  Suddenly my attention is caught by a small child. The child was glaring directly at me. I saw the devil beneath his eyes! I got nervouse and quickly stared directly at my feet as not to aggrovate the child. And that’s when I realized something…    I was wearing two different kinds of socks! Golly I’m all revved up after these thrilling exchanges! To be fair you’re a bit of a bore but beggars can’t be choosers! I think I’ll stick around.

There are plenty of disturbing things to see if that is your sort of thing. The game also seems to love messing with you in every way it possibly can, which may be a turn off for others. People will try to sell you useless crap, assault you, kill you, cut your limbs off, force you to watch your friends kill themselves... Then sometimes it will mess with you simply by having you climb up a long rope, only to very literally find a giant middle finger waiting at the top and nothing else. Or having some random guy fart on your main characters face after sleeping. A lot of this is based on luck and not scripted. Truth be told, it is a bit annoying in this regard. One can find it to be amusing, but others may just sigh as they find themselves being screwed over in a way which forces them to restart from the last save if they want to continue, knowing that they may have to restart again if they are unlucky.\n\nThose are the negatives. If you're willing to put up with that, I can't suggest this game strongly enough if you want an insane, dark, well told story presented in the form of a typical JRPG.\n\nThere is also continuity between this game and another called Lisa: The first. It is free to play and can give you some general backstory information and help you solve some of the puzzles that is the story of this game.\n\nIn short: This game is definately worth playing if you like grimdark and can tolerate the game being an ♥♥♥ sometimes.\n\nMade revisions after playing the game to 100%","December 22, 2014","true","83.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And I've played a lot of games this past year. Everything about it is amazing to experience, from the music to the gameplay, to the characters, to the story.\n\nWhen you first start, the introductory story segment draws you in to the point where, when the gameplay was being introduced, I worried it'd suck, since the story was so good. It didn't. The gameplay's fun as ♥♥♥♥. The battles are challenging, especially so on Pain mode (the hardest difficulty), and the events of the game that can seperate you from your most valued party members are brutal. By the way, those events aren't scripted. Olen can get his head bitten off, or Nern can be kidnapped. Or vice versa. Really, no one is safe. Be ready to lose those you value most.\n\nThe battles run a little like the Mother/Earthbound games. The characters in your party lack the typical class of Fighter/Mage/Rogue, and instead have abilities based off their actual character. For instance, Nern, a really chatty fellow, has abilities that involve around talking. Telling Ghost Stories to spook your enemies into not acting-- insulting them to make them go berserk. Discussing health with an ally to recover HP.\nThese quirks help flesh out these characters, and you'll quickly find yourself favoriting some over others, based off their skillset/character setup.\nAs for the diversity of these characters-- there are around 35, if I remember correctly, each with skills unique to themselves. There can be some similarities between them, but nothing that makes you think they're a copy of another character. Roles can overlap, though this isn't a problem due to how sparesly that occurs, and how many options you have for your party.\nRecruiting these characters can be as simple as buying them a drink, to holding their lover hostage so they join you.\n\nThe story. Holy ♥♥♥♥ the story. Depending on the choices you make, you'll either feel awful about yourself, or you'll feel oppressed by everything around you. I won't say how (it'll be obvious when you encounter it), but it's possible to complete the game with no arms-- just kicking, biting, headbutting, and tackling everything in your way. The story is one of the best in any game I've ever played. I'll just leave it at that. The atmosphere while playing reminds me of the tense darkness, and the maddening overlay that Hotline Miami has. That depressed, insane, vibe. The music also is reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and fits the game's style great.\n\nI've already bought this game for two people, and I'll probably buy more copies for others. It's a shame this game isn't more well known, it's amazing. For 10$, it's a steal. I completed the game in 13 hours on the painful mode, and I still didn't do everything I could've. About to start my second run after I finish this review.\n\nBuy it.","January 8, 2015","true","52.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A very kind individual gifted me this game for the sole purpose that I play it, give it an honest review, and spread the word of its existence if I enjoyed it.\n\nI haven't finished the game as of yet. I'm doing my best to experience every nook and cranny this game has to offer. If my opinion of the game changes by the end I will edit this review accordingly.\n\nI don't care for most turn based rpgs so keep in mind this is from that point of view. I think the combat in most of them is downright boring as all hell unless it's got a unique gameplay mechanic or appealing visuals. *wink* if you catch my drift *wink*\nGAMEPLAY\nMovement in this game is very limited, it can become a pain in the ♥♥♥ to travel between towns or landmarks sometimes. Somehow I can't help but feel that this is intentional and really adds to the feeling of despair, hopelessness, and even the comedic value of the games atmosphere. The only reason I think this, is because later they give you the means for traveling between areas yet not towns. The long trekking really builds up whatever emotion is supposed to be conveyed at the end. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nCombat in this game is very similar to that of other turn based rpgs. You got your items, skills, hp, mp, exp, etc. The game mixes it up by giving you a combo system that your character can use instead of using skills that take up your power, making it feel very interactive. But what actually makes me enjoy the combat the most in this game as apposed to others is the attack animations of your gang. It never gets old watching your bros ram, shoot, moon, or run over your enemies and making them cry. The dialogue of you posse after battles alone is worth fighting for. You can have 3 other jabronis besides you in a posse at a time. All the other jabronis that you aren't using stay in an inventory that you can access at certain wanted posters. You can heal ya bois by either using items for sleeping at a camp. This game is mostly about making choices and the outcome will mostly be negative in some some way. Even if you feel like you got away unscathed you will have still lost something whether you deemed it valuable or not.\n\nSOUND DESIGN\nThe soundtrack and SFX in LISA really add to the its atmosphere. I really feel a sense of dread when I get into combat with an abomination and hear music that perfectly matches the absolutely horrifying appearance of the thing in front of me. LISA's music (and sometimes even lack there of) exceedingly contributes to how you will feel while playing it. It really plays up what's happening and is easily one of my favorite parts of the game.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe artstyle is like Road Warrior meets Earthbound and it is kept consistently throughout. I personally enjoy the artstyle and color palette of the game but you can determine that for yourself by watching the trailer on the store page.\n\nOVERALL\nEverything about this game is so well crafted, from the story and dialogue to the characters and gameplay. I hope some day this hidden indie gem finally gets the attention it deserves. This game will tear your heart out with its tragedy and sew it back together with its wonderfully dark humor. LISA provides players with a suffering that can only be quelled through the joy of playing the game.\n\n10 sweet lemon teabags/10","May 21, 2015","true","13.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Tells a fairly sad and deppressing story with a sad and depressing world in a completely joking and sarcastic tone. The RPG gameplay itself is a bit dull and can seem a little grindy, but I think it's a flaw you can look past hopefully. The world is fun to explore and lets you piece together the story yourself for the most part. You will generally actually feel bad for the character/characters too probably.\n\nIt's really just a well written story that doesn't take itself too seriously most of the time. Example being, in one scene you have to choose to either cut off your arm or kill a party member.

A very kind individual gifted me this game for the sole purpose that I play it, give it an honest review, and spread the word of its existence if I enjoyed it.\n\nI haven't finished the game as of yet. I'm doing my best to experience every nook and cranny this game has to offer. If my opinion of the game changes by the end I will edit this review accordingly.\n\nI don't care for most turn based rpgs so keep in mind this is from that point of view. I think the combat in most of them is downright boring as all hell unless it's got a unique gameplay mechanic or appealing visuals. *wink* if you catch my drift *wink*\nGAMEPLAY\nMovement in this game is very limited, it can become a pain in the ♥♥♥ to travel between towns or landmarks sometimes. Somehow I can't help but feel that this is intentional and really adds to the feeling of despair, hopelessness, and even the comedic value of the games atmosphere. The only reason I think this, is because later they give you the means for traveling between areas yet not towns. The long trekking really builds up whatever emotion is supposed to be conveyed at the end. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nCombat in this game is very similar to that of other turn based rpgs. You got your items, skills, hp, mp, exp, etc. The game mixes it up by giving you a combo system that your character can use instead of using skills that take up your power, making it feel very interactive. But what actually makes me enjoy the combat the most in this game as apposed to others is the attack animations of your gang. It never gets old watching your bros ram, shoot, moon, or run over your enemies and making them cry. The dialogue of you posse after battles alone is worth fighting for. You can have 3 other jabronis besides you in a posse at a time. All the other jabronis that you aren't using stay in an inventory that you can access at certain wanted posters. You can heal ya bois by either using items for sleeping at a camp. This game is mostly about making choices and the outcome will mostly be negative in some some way. Even if you feel like you got away unscathed you will have still lost something whether you deemed it valuable or not.\n\nSOUND DESIGN\nThe soundtrack and SFX in LISA really add to the its atmosphere. I really feel a sense of dread when I get into combat with an abomination and hear music that perfectly matches the absolutely horrifying appearance of the thing in front of me. LISA's music (and sometimes even lack there of) exceedingly contributes to how you will feel while playing it. It really plays up what's happening and is easily one of my favorite parts of the game.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe artstyle is like Road Warrior meets Earthbound and it is kept consistently throughout. I personally enjoy the artstyle and color palette of the game but you can determine that for yourself by watching the trailer on the store page.\n\nOVERALL\nEverything about this game is so well crafted, from the story and dialogue to the characters and gameplay. I hope some day this hidden indie gem finally gets the attention it deserves. This game will tear your heart out with its tragedy and sew it back together with its wonderfully dark humor.

Everything that was put into this works so well together to make an experience that is worth playing at least once (even if there is more than enough reason to play multiple times).\n\nThe game's art and soundtrack are amazing and go hand in hand. Both are relatively weird but so enjoyable that you want to keep going just to see what's next.\nThe World the devs made is awesome and filled with amazingly enjoyable characters, especially the party members. Each of them has their own distinct appeal and abilities that make them all so wonderful and distinct. Some highlights include (SPOILER)  The Lord of the tutorial, a lovably annoying historian, and the most badass drag queen. . These characters, and more, you will meet and find the ones you appreciate the most.\nThe story is also one of the best I've seen. Without going into too much detail, it is a rollercoaster. It can range from light hearted happy moments to AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WTF and everything in-between. There is never a dull moment in the story of The Brad. And as I'm typing this, I'm trying to think of one moment I'd share with someone who was reading this, and debating if they wanted this game, but I can't think of any that wouldn't be better seen through playing the game.\n\nSo please, get this game for yourself. It is really worth every cent.

This game brings to the table a plentitude of funny and original characters, amazing soundtrack and very unique bosses, locations and jokes. The game made me laugh, cry, unnerved and scared and the transition between each emotions was executed with extreme precision and skill. I praise the maker of this magnificent game.\n\nI chose Pain mode as I wanted to extra bits of content as well as the extra challenge with the new bosses and luckily, it wasn't impossible for my first playthrough but caused me a lot of distress as I found myself restarting often because of a silly mistake but I didn't mind that as the pain it caused me was well received. It is the painful rpg after all. What bothered me though is the fact that you don't get a lot of room to test characters and build your dream team, especially if they are under-leveled. The 3 first characters that I got in my game were the same three I kept during the whole game as I could not level up the newer and cooler characters as I knew the lack of save points and the potential game over right around the corner could wipe away hours of gameplay.\n\nIn my opinion, if you want to truly enjoy your experience and get to choose the team you want, do not choose Pain Mode unless you want to feel true pain in which case, I invite you to do so. But otherwise, you aren't missing that much without Pain mode as the extra bosses, cutscene and dungeon don't bring much to the story and you can easily get the information online.\n\nI highly recommend this awesome and painful game!","June 8, 2015","true","21.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay is great. The music is great. The characters are great. The story is perfect. I'm not a big fan of RPGs due to annoying random encounters and grinding. Guess what? This game doesnt really have that. (other than in like. 4 small parts) It has alot of "mini bosses" where other than more fights less rewards, it's less fights more rewards. And I love it for that. I can't really put into words how perfect this game is. Sucks its overshadowed by other lame indie games like Super Meat Boy, Fez, ect ect. my only two complants is that its a little pricey and the game's world is easy to get lost in. The game has a nice replay value with the new pain mode (adds new bosses, cut scenes, but makes the game harder) but I cant say its loaded with content.

Super depressing with some black humor.\n\nPreface: If you are going to play LISA, you should look up LISA The First. You do not necessarily have to play it, but just read up the story on it, even if it's creepy.\n\nNow for this LISA: Go buy it. Further, make sure you buy LISA The Joyful as well, meant to be played after you complete the main game.\n\nThis game is one which is best played going in blind, so I do not want to say much about what happens. But if you are alright with witnessing some pretty terrible events and having to make some pretty terrible, screwed-up choices, then seriously get this game. Even if you are afraid of having to make bad choices, still try the game out - open yourself up and don't be afraid to give it a shot.\n\nThe game has its ups and downs, but the environment and story was just so strange yet organized in a way that it kept me focused and playing it all for a good long while. I never wanted to stop playing LISA despite what bad events kept occurring (exception: there is 1 single point in the game that is bad random number generation and really annoying).\n\nThe game is certainly not an easy one, especially because there are difficult RPG battles, which I did not know about when I first started it out. But I have more than enough experience with RPGs so I lived through it all. And if you play it right without wasting some items, you should have enough luck to make it through, or grind if you need to. Just read up on some of the guides.\n\nBut really, you should just give the game a shot - go in blind, and just push yourself through it. Make sure you get LISA The Joyful because you really need it to "wrap up" some parts of the storyline more. In fact, LISA The Joyful turned out to be a great culminating point for everything.\n\nI got so connected to this game way beyond what I imagined. I got extremely angry at the characters, happy when certain obstacles were passed, and well, really sad when a ton of the bad events occurred.\n\nIt had me hooked from the beginning.","May 4","true","27.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I've been dead for 35 years. Today is the day I live."\nTL;DR: The best way to categorize LISA is this: it has the gameplay and humour of EarthBound(it  figuratively literally ripped it off), with the setting of Mad Max and Fist of the North Star, with the plot line of The Children of Men. This game is as surreal as it gets. It has a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome soundtrack, and the storytelling is masterfully done. I cannot recommand this game enough.\n\nI can't even begin to talk about LISA: The Painful RPG and how amazing it is. No game ever existed has leaved me with such emotional devastations. While I have never cried watching/playing a work of fiction, LISA got damn ♥♥♥♥ing close.\n\n\nThe game starts off with Brad Armstrong, a formal martial arts teacher and now a drug addict. This is a world where a certain incident known as The Flash has wiped all women on Olathe(the name's from a real city in Colorado and pronounced 'o-layth-uh'), and has turned it into a wasteland. Brad and his buddies finds the only baby girl in the world, and while Brad's buddies think it's good to bring her to Rando, the most powerful warlord in Olathe, Brad sees her as his 'second chance', as he had an abusive father and a little sister called... well, Lisa. And she killed herself and all that, so Brad feels guilty. Brad names the girl 'Buddy' and starts raising her. Events transpire and Rando eventually gets ahold of Buddy. This is where Brad starts his journey.\n\nThe world of Olathe is surreal. Really surreal. The surrealism in this game is out there, and to the max. There's a character that just says 'I like big butts... They never lie.' and serves no other purpose whatsoever. There are so many great moments in LISA that happens because of this surrealism. LISA really is heavily inspired by EarthBound in this aspect, and its turn-based gameplay. Only thing that this isn't inspired of by EarthBound is its much more mature humour, and the absence of the rolling HP thing.\n\nLISA isn't all fun though. It's called The Painful RPG for a reason. Throughout the game, you will be given harsh choices like A. Get ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥. B. Get ♥♥♥♥ed in the mouth. C. ♥♥♥♥ yoursef. What's better? Well, C seems better, but it actually just gives you both A and B, or just gives you a game over. Than B sounds better, but it only SOUNDS better. Having your arm chopped off definitely SOUNDS better then killing off one of your party members, but it still ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. LISA transits this moment of surrealism and 'wat just happned m8' to 'oh... ♥♥♥♥... ♥♥♥♥... that was... oh god' pretty well. You can never tell if the game is trying too hard.\n\nThe best part of LISA, bar none, is its storytelling. It's a RPG Maker game, yet it still tells its story in a way that lives such impact. The game does such a great job at telling a story by not telling. It never forces the story on you, instead you see it and understand it. There are many 'battles' that are just meant to be something where the game will try to tell something to you, but it just tells it in a turn-based RPG battle. THIS is how you tell a story. Take advantage that it's a video game. Push narrative into the gameplay.\n\nAn example. Brad suffers from drug addiction, more specifically to 'Joy'. It's a drug that 'makes you feel nothing'. Because of this, Brad suffers from the 'Withdrawl' status effect now and then, which decreases all of his stats tremendously. ...does the game ever tell you this fact? "Brad suffers from Joy addiction! You better take some Joy, ♥♥♥♥♥!"? No. It does say 'Brad took some Joy.'. Does it tell you what it is? It tells you that it's a drug. But the way it emphasizes that Brad is indeed ADDICTED by it by telling it in a gameplay-form, and forces you to take them yourself was done perfect.(you shouldn't take them though... why? just don't.)\n\nThere are about 30 party members in this game. ♥♥♥♥ing 30. All of them have their advantages and their weaknesses, and sure as hell are funny. You can meet Harvy Alibastor, a Fishman lawyer, or Nern Guan, a self-proclaimed 'historian'. There are some OP characters(psst psst birdie psst), but trying out different combinations of them are definetely very fun. This aspect you could say was inpired by Chrono Cross, where there are also many party members that just says 3 or 4 lines then joins your party. Like Chrono Cross, most of these party members are completely optional.\n\nOh God the soundtrack. Don't even get me STARTED on it. Just buy it.\nwiddly2diddly.bandcamp.com. 8 bucks. BUY IT. ♥♥♥♥ING DO IT. Two hours worth of just amazing pieces. It keeps on tone with the whole surrealism theme, but has diversity as well. 'Brawlin'' is a hip-hop sounding track, while 'Burning Sunset' is a classic RPG Maker-style 8-bit electronic track. Then there's 'Die! Die! Die!', 'Boy Oh Boy' and 'Work Harder' and their surreal-sounding tunes, and 'Praise Wally' and 'Blood for Sex' for some creepy ♥♥♥ shit. My personal favorite is 'Goodbye Baby' and 'Goodbye'. 'Goodbye' is a much darker-sounding remix of 'Goodbye Baby', though both conveys the entire tone of the game well.\n\n\nAre there even anything bad about LISA? Kinda. The game is two-dimensional outside of battle, and of course, you get to climb many many ropes. But those many ropes are often placed right near a cliff where you can fall into a pitch blue 'GAME OVER' screen. This ♥♥♥♥ is definetely annoying in the 'Pain Mode', where you can only save at checkpoints once. You also move pretty slow without your Bicycle, which you get probably about 2 hours into the game. A lot of people were put off by this.\n\nThe game is pretty open-world. At least for a JRPG inspired game. There are four 'main-areas', with them having mandatory 2-3 other 'side-areas' and 3-4 optional side-areas, with the exception of the the final one which is pretty linear(the game also gets really dark at that point). Because of this, there is never a sense of direction, and while I though that was cool, people who are pretty bad at directions were kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by this. You also get to backtrack sometimes to get optional party members and events, which just confuses them even more. Also, if you're not fond of RPGs in general, the gameplay can get really repetitive.\n\nLastly, this game is made on RPG Maker. RPG Maker games are kinda notorious for being really easy to make, and for being pretty bad. And by that, I mean ♥♥♥♥. The technical limitations were pretty bad here. The fullscreen support is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and in general, the game squeezed out everything that the RPG Maker had. Austin Jorgenson(AKA Dingaling. also goes by the alias of Widdly 2 Diddly), the sole creator of LISA, has 8000 ♥♥♥♥ing hours on RPG Maker VX Ace on his Steam profile. This man over-worked, I can tell you that.\n\n\nThe real theme of LISA is abuse, addiction, and "Did I do the right thing?". The story of this game will be stuck on your mind for good few weeks. If you weren't satisfied by this adventure, LISA: The Joyful, a sequel/DLC is a must buy. It follows Buddy after the events of The Painful RPG and explains many of the plot holes and such.\n\nLISA is a hell of a journey. Literally, it's a 'hell-hole RPG', as Austin puts it. This game is in my opinion, the game that shows how far come we've come for storytelling in video games, and in fiction in general. It will live a bitter taste in your mouth, but you will still laugh along with it in many other parts anyways.\n\nThis game is a MUST BUY for anyone who can tolerate this kind of surreal and kinda offensive type of humour. Watch the trailers, and maybe a bit of gameplay and also on EarthBound, and you can get a feel for this game. If you look like you can tolerate it, just buy it.\n\n9.99 is a STEAL for this title. I give LISA: The Painful RPG a 9.6/10, it's a masterpiece. I look forward to anything that Dingaling makes after this. Apprently it's about ninjas and racism. Oh boy.","September 13, 2015","true","28.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/335670/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Lisa is a 2D RPG set after an apocalyptic event that destroyed all the females. We play as a drug addict named Brad that stumbles across a baby one day and to his surprise it is a girl. Brad, along with two friends decide to raise and protect that baby which they name “Buddy” to keep her safe from the outside world. As you can imagine things eventually go wrong, she is kidnapped and you are off to save her. One of the first things you may notice is that the game is locked in a 4:3 ration annoyingly enough and there is no way to stretch it. This game has a very strange sense of humor and nearly everyone you meet is completely insane, making it so you never know who is going to try to murder or rob you and who is friendly. Along your journey you will meet a ton of potential party members and be able to take up to three with you at any one time.\n\nCombat is a pretty normal ordeal that has you slugging it out in a turn based duel with your foes. You will be able to pick from skills, items or a chance to escape from battle. It is a pretty typical system with one of the few undue things about it being a 5 button input when you select to attack that allows you to pull off special moves. You can pull off these moves by clicking on the skill menu as well so it is pretty pointless. Brad is a junkie addicted to a drug called joy so if you don't take some every once in a while you will have a withdrawal effect in combat that seriously cripples his ability to fight. Winning a battle can grant you a multitude of items like cigarettes to heal poison and magazines which is the currency for the game. If you have ever played an RPG there is nothing really all that different here other than how insanely weird this game is and deciding how much you value yourself over those fighting by your side.\n\nThe world of Lisa is as cruel and violent as it is weird making you have to make some pretty difficult decisions such as losing an arm making you lose your sweet hadouken skill as well as making you weaker or sacrificing a friend in your stead. It sounds like a hard decision but the companions in this game are so numerous and outlandishly insane that you'll be missing their ultimately replaceable skill set more than anything. It's never an easy decision to make however and trying to resist your captors can lead to more disastrous results. Losing tons of your party members is nearly unavoidable since even during non-scripted events they can get kidnapped and murdered. If they fall in battle you can simply go rest in an inn or by a campfire to heal them. Resting by random campfires is as very risky gamble with someone possibly getting kidnapped, your party being poisoned by a random spider, your stuff can get stolen and much more I'm sure but at that point I'd sooner walk all the way back to the inn than find out what other nasty surprises lay in wait.\n\nIt is no doubt a very dark game that is masked by its weird “humor”. I'm hesitant to call it humor since very rarely is it funny and relies more on insane randomness that will have you wondering what “just happened?” from beginning to end. Nothing seems to make a lick of sense and you start questioning if it is real or if it's a hallucination in Brad's drug filled mind. In that regard Lisa does an excellent job as you will never have enough time to plant your feet on the ground and feel like you understand this world. It's not an easy game either, if you have been robbed of all your belongings don't expect it to pull back any punches, your decisions have consequences and even the snowmen want to kill you. Yes there are snowmen in the desert and that may be one of the least weird things about this title. To save the game you must find a crow and if you pick hard mode in the beginning of the game it will explode once used. Hard mode really should not be attempted your first time playing Lisa since it is difficult and unfair to begin with.\n\nWhen not in combat you are free to explore the environments which are pretty open ended though you ultimately have to visit most locations nonetheless. There are no maps, the level design is really confusing and there are no reminders to what you are meant to do so it's best to make time for when you play Lisa as playing it a bit one day and a bit another day can easily get confusing. You can jump up small ledges and objects giving it a bit more variety than simply walking left or right. Rather early in the game you will unlock a bike that allows you to move much faster and jump from higher locations without taking damage. Be very careful though as there are endless pits all over the place and you can easily ride right into your doom if you are not paying attention. Riding a small red bike too fast was the lead cause of death for me in a world full of violent psychopaths as sad as that may sound.\n\nThis game only features few random battles in certain caves and in tall grass. You can grind for magazines and items though it will take a very long time as well as making it sting much worse when you get robbed again. Scattered around the world are stores, bars and vendors where you can exchange your magazines for their services. A risky thing to purchase is equipment for your party since they die off so rapidly, making them a potentially really bad investments no matter how much it may help you out in combat. Lisa is all about potential risk and rewards. The strange thing is that I've never felt I was having fun playing this game but for some reason felt compelled to keep going. It can be frustrating to be so helpless as you are repeatedly mugged, beaten and humiliated but it is a far more effective method of making you feel like the world is dangerous instead of simply being told it is, grind a bit and becoming the unstoppable king of the world like in most other RPGs these days. Sadly Brad's motivation of rescuing Buddy is something we the player most likely will not care about since she does not say a single thing before being kidnapped and all we had to base her character around is a short cutscene.\n\nThere is no voice acting and everything is told via text. Strangely enough the text is slightly cut off in the corners of the speech bubbles and while it's nothing gamebreaking it never stopped being annoying. Graphics are nothing special but it does its job decently to convey all the weird or disturbing things like mutants, someone's head being bashed in and random rave parties. The real star of the show here has got to be the great soundtrack. It is both weird and catchy enough to make you stay in an area for a bit longer just to listen to it. Lisa is not a title I'd recommend for those that like to feel in control or even understand what is going on while playing video games but for those that can enjoy a game that kicks them when they are down and can handle dark humor. As twisted as this game is it always has an almost surreal type of wackiness such as your childhood bully riding around on a small deer and proceeds to murder your friend or a random body building club with people bench pressing refrigerators. While not a fun game it is without a doubt a very strange and brutal experience that you will not likely find anywhere else.","March 9","true","11.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Filled with equal parts chuckling at a denizen of the post-apocalyptic world just trying to get through his day, and regret and remorse at the lengths the protagonist, Brad Armstrong, will go to to get back his daughter, Buddy, LISA is very much a game about "pain" and the emotional response the player has to various trials and tribulations and overall wackiness that will occur.\n\n"Stylized" is another word I'd use to describe LISA. One glance at the game and the visual look of the characters portrays a slightly off-beat, darkly humorous nature about the people that inhabit the landscape. The music is equally brilliant, as ecclectic and diverse as the people you'll get to know and possibly recruit into your ragtag party. I've found myself many times listening to the game's soundtrack, and as of right now am listening to "Live in Joy" as I type this review out. Tracks range from pulsing electronic beats to catchy hip hop montages, to some pretty sinister and darkly pieces that pepper the game's world. Perhaps the master piece of music is "Summer Love" that seems to play in different measures and times throughout the game's many villages, that signifies just another day in post-apocalyptia.\n\nAs mentioned, the game draws heavily from Earthbound's well and that's no different when it comes to combat. Even though damage isn't represented by rolling numbers, it does feature a similar artistic aesthetic in both background design and the interface. More than once I've found LISA to resemble games such as Paper Mario or the more recent South Park: Stick of Truth from the unorthodox ways to inflict status effects on an opposing enemy.\n\nLISA is very much a game about pain. It really is a painful experience, but there's a lot of laughter and a lot of charm as well. You'll probably end up hating one or two characters, but you may just find yourself attached to one or two characters as well. And you may regret becoming close with any of them at all. In short, "don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody."","December 22, 2014","true","43.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you may expect, a human is a difficult secret to hide; she eventually gets kidnapped, so Brad goes in search for her and the story starts.\n\nThe main, overarching story is told a bit slower, really coming more to the forefront at the end of each hub area, but it's very interesting when it does. There exploration in between the story segments is still extremely interesting though, since it's filled with plenty of events and things to see, many are very quirky and humorous (and the humor is excellent, very reminiscent of Earthbound), though some things can be pretty unsettling (the game constantly walks a fine line between these two distinct types of emotion, and pulls it off surprisingly well). There's also the backstory of the game world and main character, which are also hinted at in various ways as you explore many of the areas, so even between the bigger story sections, there's still a lot to hold your attention and get you continually more interested and invested in the game world and characters.\n\nTrue to the game's tagline of "The Painful RPG", things can get downright dark and painful at times, especially with some of the choices the game forces you to make. I'm not going to spoil those, but you're not going to come out of this game feeling like a saint. It's an interesting contrast to the choices of many other RPGs, where there's often an obvious "good" and "bad" choice. While LISA's choices tend to affect the gameplay (for which the consequences can be pretty big) more significantly than the overall narrative, there is a degree of story impact from some of these choices.\n\nGameplay: I enjoyed Lisa's battle system quite a lot. It's fast paced and frantic, and as soon as you're done issuing commands, moves execute quickly, rapidly, and with a lot of nice but quick animations for each move. Some characters, like the main character, Brad, also have a combo system of sorts, where you input commands with the WSAD keys to pull off a combo, which I found pretty fun (you can also automatically use these combos through the skill list, but they'll do less damage that way). Unlike many RPGs, status ailments are also extremely useful, even in boss encounters. This is partly balanced by bosses often being durable and hitting hard, and status ailments not being completely reliable, since they may fail to activate, and can sometimes wear off quickly (especially the more crippling ones).\n\nThere also aren't many spots to grind. It's possible, but very ineffective until one point very late in the game. I see this as a good thing though, since the game is well balanced around this aspect, and as long as you explore the different areas, your team will quickly grow powerful enough to tackle the ensuing obstacles.\n\nThe game also has a very survivalist feel: Consumable items are often harder to come by (some are available to buy, but it's a very limited selection for the majority of the game), and money can be pretty scarce, so you need to use your resources wisely. Exploring can help a lot in accumulating items and gear, speaking of which, the exploration in this game is pretty fun, since there are a lot of secrets to find, and you'll constantly be running into little events and interesting characters along the way.\n\nThis game also has some things that can cause you to permanently lose an ally, like permadeath moves (these are rare, and mainly used by certain bosses), and the chance for a party member to walk out or get kidnapped while you rest at certain camps (there are a couple safe resting spots that cost money, too). While perfectionists can potentially avoid these through caution and savescumming, the game also has a total of 30 allies to recruit, so as long as you aren't overly careless, you should be fine with a couple casualties here or there. It still hurts to lose a favorite member of course, so that danger can really keep you on your toes, and motivates you to be careful. The large amount of allies can also make replays more fun, since it gives you a lot of different party setups to try out.\n\nSoundtrack: Absolutely wonderful. Lots of tracks that range from loud and bombastic to more subtle and mellow, so there's a lot of variety, and they're all utilized very well throughout, totally nailing the atmosphere of the different scenes and locations. It's also impressive just how little repeat there are of the tracks; I honestly lost count of how many battle themes there were (and all were awesome), and most areas have their own BGM (with the exception of smaller connecting areas, like caves). There's also a very definite Earthbound influence throughout, so fans of that game's soundtrack will likely feel right at home here.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are very nicely done, often quirky, nicely stylized, and vibrant, yet fairly gristly and and gory with the darker parts of the game (the cartoonish style somewhat balances this out, but it can definitely be unsettling, especially to someone unaccustomed to horror). The art is also very consistently polished; this isn't like some RPG Maker games with an awkward mix of default resources and custom assets; everything here is original, and you can tell the creator was both very talented and knew exactly what he was going for.\n\nAll in all, LISA is a very well made game that I deeply enjoyed from start to finish. It may not be for everyone (especially with how dark and disturbing it can get at points), but it's very polished and packed with content for a game that costs only $10, and I've honestly gotten more enjoyment out of it than many games that cost much more than that.","December 21, 2014","true","112.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Halfway playthrough I knew I would love the game and after this review I'm going to lauch a new run. Game appearently has two very different difficulties, and supporting characters and team variations enough for several playthroughs.\n\nSo what's bad about this game?

With LISA, you just can't. I also would love a longer story, now that it's once actually VERY GOOD. Other than that, I can't really give you any complaints.

First of all, if you're thinking about buying this game, but are easily offended and/or cannot handle very mature (and rather dark) content, I would definitely recommend looking elsewhere for a game to satisfy your personal tastes. However, if you are like me, and enjoy a good dose of dark humor with some very solid RPG elements mixed in, this game is definitely for you. To make this a bit simpler, I'm going to break this review down into sections. Oh, and I must warn you, the story section contains some minor spoilers, though I tried to cover up those that you do not find out within the first few minutes of the game.\n\nTL;DR If you're a fan of dark humor and/or old fashioned RPG style games, I highly recommend giving LISA a try. The story elements come together nicely without being completely overbearing, and the world itself is an incredible (though pretty p*rverted at times) place to explore. If you're on the fence like I was, definitely give it a go. Underneath the humor/grotesque imagery lies a deep and memorable story with very solid RPG style gameplay.\n\nStory I want to start by saying that, despite the copious amount of humor, LISA manages to weave together a tale that both makes you think, and makes you sad. The game stars Brad Armstrong, who finds a second chance in life in a baby girl he finds one day in an apocolyptic wasteland where females have (supposedly) ceased to exist. Brad,  wishing to redeem himself from the suicide of his sister, Lisa,  takes in this baby girl and, with a few of his childhood friends, raises her as his own daughter. But one day, I believe while he was passed out in a drugged up state  having taken Joy, a euphoric painkiller of sorts, attempting to suppress the memories of his abusive father and the death of his sister  Buddy, his adopted daughter, is stolen away by the lonely men of the world (who, having not interacted with a female in many years, are rather hell-bent on real female intimacy, if you know what I mean). The main plot of the game centers around Brad's attempt to rescue his daughter, a daughter who may very well be the only female remaining in the world. Throughout the story you must make many tough decisions and sacrafices, and by the end you're left wondering whether or not your journey is even the right thing to do. The background info is slowly gathered throughout many flashbacks triggered when Brad enters certain areas. All in all, the story is very well done, and by the end, you can't help but feel bad (which, ironically, is what makes the story so good).\nStory: 9/10\n\nGameplay Honestly, this is the part of the game that impressed me the most. With so much emphasis on story (and the world), I was afraid that the gameplay mechanics might suffer. Boy was I wrong. The game turned out to have very solid RPG style mechanics, with the fights done in the classic RPG turn-based style. The character progression is wonderfully done, with almost every single companion having a specific niche to fill. Also, the companions play very well off of each other, with specific companions fighting very well alongside each other with highly complementing move sets. Being a big RPG fan, this was the part of the game that I was most worried about when originally deciding whether or not to purchase LISA. After playing the game though, I am incredibly impressed at how well this game managed to stick to its RPG roots.\nGameplay: 9.5/10\n\nSound/Music Overall, the sound helps quite a bit in adding to the atmosphere of the game. The music helps quite a bit in getting into the world of the game. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of variety, as many times the same few tracks seem to be played in numerous areas with just a slight change in tempo. Even so, I never really got sick of it until the very end of the game, and I never got so sick of it that I muted my game (the tracks were enjoyable, just too often repeated).\nSound/Music: 7/10 (though see general atmosphere section for more on the positive aspect of the music)\n\nGeneral Atmosphere This is an area that the previews/store page promised would be excellent, and I believe that the developers delivered quite well on that promise. The mood is set right from the beggining of the game, and the sort of dark and gloomy atmosphere is maintained throughout the entire game without the game trying too hard to achieve it. However, this bleak, gloomy atmosphere is quite often lightened a bit with a touch of humor (usually right as it's needed), as well as numerous references to popular culture that can be picked up on. The humor does tend to be a bit dark and edgy at times, but (at least for me) that's exactly how I like it, and I believe it suited the game very well.\nAtmosphere: 9/10\n\nConclusion If you're a fan of dark humor and/or old fashioned RPG style games, I highly recommend giving LISA a try. The story elements come together nicely without being completely overbearing, and the world itself is an incredible (though pretty p*rverted at times) place to explore. If you're on the fence like I was, definitely give it a go. Underneath the humor/grotesque imagery lies a deep and memorable story with very solid RPG style gameplay. I would recommend LISA to anyone with a dark sense of humor, those who like a story that makes you think, and all generic fans of RPGs (who can handle or enjoy dark humor).\n\nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nSound/Music: 7/10\nGeneral Atmosphere: 9/10\nEnjoyability: 10/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nI highly recommend this game!\n\nP.S.

The game thrusts the player into Brad's tormented world as he sets out into a bizzare and hellish wasteland on a rescue mission.\n\nThe player is forced to make exceedingly difficult choices throughout the game. The turn-based combat, as well as artistic design, takes heavy inspiration from Earthbound. LISA distinctly carves out its own niche, however. It's difficult to explain the range of emotions the player will experience when playing through this game.\n\nThe game suffers from some very minor performance issues at times, though it doesn't detract from the game very much at all. The difficult choices all feel compelling save for one unfortunate event around the middle of the game. To be clear, this one particular event  just feels cheap. You'll know it when you see it. However, I'd argue it's a very much forgivable misstep.\n\nLISA is absolutely unashamed and relentless in its delivery of heavy, mature, and disturbing themes. This only makes it all the more essential to play in my opinion.","July 5, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/335670/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","It's one of very, very few RPG Maker games that are actually good. LISA sends you into a miserable world populated solely by men who have lost all hope for the future. Life is cheap, those who live long enough suffer horrible mutations, and your character will be made to suffer. Like many Earthbound-inspired games, there is much disturbing imagery within, with music designed to unsettle as well. Although the game isn't all that dialogue heavy compared to other RPGs, it does a great job of telling a story with its wide variety of original, clever and imaginative visuals. The characters are pretty deep, deep enough to warrant multiple playthroughs just to have a full understanding of why the last hour of the game played out as it did.\n\nThere's a lot of permanent consequence in this game, so beware. From my perspective I find it to be kind of annoying and save-scum bait, but honestly that aspect of the game just isn't made for me. The Russian Roulette portion did feel like the RNG constantly cheating me, though. I actually had to save scum once I lost 4 characters to the enemy's one...geesh.\n\nTwo things worth noting: You'll get a bit more out of the game if you play LISA: The First, which is a <60 minute free RPG Maker game, before playing this game. The other thing is the game can be annoyingly grindy -- but RPG Maker save files are pretty easy to hex edit. (just be aware that values are always the minimum byte width necessary to store said values, i.e. exp will be 1 if under 256, 2 if under 65536, or 3 [not 4!] if >= 65536)","January 7","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First of all, if you're thinking about buying this game, but are easily offended and/or cannot handle very mature (and rather dark) content, I would definitely recommend looking elsewhere for a game to satisfy your personal tastes. However, if you are like me, and enjoy a good dose of dark humor with some very solid RPG elements mixed in, this game is definitely for you. To make this a bit simpler, I'm going to break this review down into sections. Oh, and I must warn you, the story section contains some minor spoilers, though I tried to cover up those that you do not find out within the first few minutes of the game.\n\nTL;DR If you're a fan of dark humor and/or old fashioned RPG style games, I highly recommend giving LISA a try. The story elements come together nicely without being completely overbearing, and the world itself is an incredible (though pretty p*rverted at times) place to explore. If you're on the fence like I was, definitely give it a go. Underneath the humor/grotesque imagery lies a deep and memorable story with very solid RPG style gameplay.\n\nStory I want to start by saying that, despite the copious amount of humor, LISA manages to weave together a tale that both makes you think, and makes you sad. The game stars Brad Armstrong, who finds a second chance in life in a baby girl he finds one day in an apocolyptic wasteland where females have (supposedly) ceased to exist. Brad,  wishing to redeem himself from the suicide of his sister, Lisa,  takes in this baby girl and, with a few of his childhood friends, raises her as his own daughter. But one day, I believe while he was passed out in a drugged up state  having taken Joy, a euphoric painkiller of sorts, attempting to suppress the memories of his abusive father and the death of his sister  Buddy, his adopted daughter, is stolen away by the lonely men of the world (who, having not interacted with a female in many years, are rather hell-bent on real female intimacy, if you know what I mean). The main plot of the game centers around Brad's attempt to rescue his daughter, a daughter who may very well be the only female remaining in the world. Throughout the story you must make many tough decisions and sacrafices, and by the end you're left wondering whether or not your journey is even the right thing to do. The background info is slowly gathered throughout many flashbacks triggered when Brad enters certain areas. All in all, the story is very well done, and by the end, you can't help but feel bad (which, ironically, is what makes the story so good).\nStory: 9/10\n\nGameplay Honestly, this is the part of the game that impressed me the most. With so much emphasis on story (and the world), I was afraid that the gameplay mechanics might suffer. Boy was I wrong. The game turned out to have very solid RPG style mechanics, with the fights done in the classic RPG turn-based style. The character progression is wonderfully done, with almost every single companion having a specific niche to fill. Also, the companions play very well off of each other, with specific companions fighting very well alongside each other with highly complementing move sets. Being a big RPG fan, this was the part of the game that I was most worried about when originally deciding whether or not to purchase LISA. After playing the game though, I am incredibly impressed at how well this game managed to stick to its RPG roots.\nGameplay: 9.5/10\n\nSound/Music Overall, the sound helps quite a bit in adding to the atmosphere of the game. The music helps quite a bit in getting into the world of the game. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of variety, as many times the same few tracks seem to be played in numerous areas with just a slight change in tempo. Even so, I never really got sick of it until the very end of the game, and I never got so sick of it that I muted my game (the tracks were enjoyable, just too often repeated).\nSound/Music: 7/10 (though see general atmosphere section for more on the positive aspect of the music)\n\nGeneral Atmosphere This is an area that the previews/store page promised would be excellent, and I believe that the developers delivered quite well on that promise. The mood is set right from the beggining of the game, and the sort of dark and gloomy atmosphere is maintained throughout the entire game without the game trying too hard to achieve it. However, this bleak, gloomy atmosphere is quite often lightened a bit with a touch of humor (usually right as it's needed), as well as numerous references to popular culture that can be picked up on. The humor does tend to be a bit dark and edgy at times, but (at least for me) that's exactly how I like it, and I believe it suited the game very well.\nAtmosphere: 9/10\n\nConclusion If you're a fan of dark humor and/or old fashioned RPG style games, I highly recommend giving LISA a try. The story elements come together nicely without being completely overbearing, and the world itself is an incredible (though pretty p*rverted at times) place to explore. If you're on the fence like I was, definitely give it a go. Underneath the humor/grotesque imagery lies a deep and memorable story with very solid RPG style gameplay. I would recommend LISA to anyone with a dark sense of humor, those who like a story that makes you think, and all generic fans of RPGs (who can handle or enjoy dark humor).\n\nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nSound/Music: 7/10\nGeneral Atmosphere: 9/10\nEnjoyability: 10/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nI highly recommend this game!\n\nP.S. This is one of my first reviews (ever). I hope it was at least a little bit helpful! :)","August 1, 2015","true","50.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game plays with your emotions so much that I almost had trouble completing it. At times you feel sorry for the main character, Brad, and other times you hate his guts. You can laugh at the goofy jokes and the occasional breakage of the 4th wall, and you can be disturbed by oddly shaped mutants and mounds of corpses. This game made me laugh, squirm with discomfort, and honestly made me cry. Quite simply it hits you right in the feels.\n\nIt is a fairly long game and it has a large world full of interesting and diverse characters, scenery, and events. You are routinely forced to make choices that permanently affect the game and your experience. These choices can get you new party members or cost you your arm. The enemies are diverse and interesting, and you never know what you will be encountering next.\n\n10/10 would cry again","May 8, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

LISA is a turn-based RPG in the style of Earthbound, set in a post-apocalyptic world in which women, and by extension, humanity, are on the verge of extincition. The story follows Bradley Armstrong, a gruff, bearded man, who, in spite of his appearance, is not some typical action hero, but a deeply troubled and unstable individual. Finding a baby abandoned in the wastes, Brad finds himself faced with deciding between his own desperate need for redemption in caring for her, and the potential salvation of humanity in the hands of others.\n\nNo matter what decisions you make, it's a tragic narrative, and as such, moments of humor are often present between major story beats so as to keep it from becoming too depressing. It pulls off this balancing act stunningly, simultaneously poignant, and hilarious. All while immersing you in a deep, rich world, better realized in 2 Dimensions than many other games' are in 3. With a huge cast of memorable characters and a fantastic soundtrack,  LISA stands out among it's peers as a both a bold new IP, and a love letter to a handful of existing ones. I couldn't recommend it more.\n\n10/10","August 15, 2015","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Hell yes, but not to everyone. LISA is an acquired taste. You've gotta have a taste for the weird, the creepy, and the wrong.. and you definitely can't be feint of heart.\n\nBefore I start, I'll just say, 10/10, hands down. Dingaling has created one of my favourite games to date. LISA's story is very refreshing and original, and definitely something not anyone could have thought up. There are secrets o' plenty, and the playstyle is very old-school. Of course, there are plenty of perverts, mutants, and substance-abusers as well, but they make it interesting. LISA hits all emotional buttons; you'll laugh, cry, rage, get the weirdest of boners, and most of all, cringe. It's one of the most original, well-thought-out, and intriguing side-scrollers I've seen in a really long time.\n\nThe soundtrack is created by Widdly 2 Diddly, which is actually just the same guy who makes up the one man show that is Dingaling. It's perfect; eerie and cheerie. Some of my favourite tracks include "Beehive", "All Hail the Fishmen", "Work Harder" (because of the hilarious area in the game in which it's used), and of course, "Summer Love" (all of which can be found either in the DLC soundtrack on Steam or on Widdly 2 Diddly's bandcamp page).\n\nI found very few bugs. I think I found a grand total of one, and it wasn't even really a big deal. There was an invisible ledge and I somehow got onto it. I doubt many people managed to do it. Some of the caves do lag because of a candle here and there, which use dynamic lighting. That's it. Otherwise, completely smooth. Combat is turn-based and it works like a charm. Really easy to get used to if you're not usually into that.\n\nAll-in-all, LISA is a morally challenging game as well. I can't mention anything without spoiling it, though, so you'll have to see for yourself. If you're a pervert, a broken man, or you just appreciate the weirder things in life, this is for you. If you just appreciate a really well made old-school type game and want to support an indie developer, this could be for you too. Like I said, it's an acquired taste, but if it tastes good to you, you'll get the joy.. joy.. joy.","August 10, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rayfist090/recommended/335670/","rayfist090","Rayfist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rayfist090/","157 products in account","A humorous yet depressing post apocalyptic RPG about surviving a world completely void of woman, filled with perverts and weirdo's, this a sequel to the very lesser known RPG Maker game, "Lisa The First." You take control of Brad Armstrong who stumbles upon a female baby named "Buddy", who is the last hope for this humanity. Being the last female on Olathe, Brad wants to protect her from harm's way. As she grows older, her curious mind lets loose after years of being sheltered, and she inevitably gets captured. Brad set's out to save his adopted daughter, while the Painful journey begins.\n\nLiving up to it's name, Lisa "The Painful", is a game all about sacrifice. Being an Earthbound inspired RPG, the humorous tone is very apparent. Lisa crosses boundaries that not many other games have crossed, some moments you'll laugh, but some you'll be gravely upset with.  There are a lot of instances where you don't know what to think, along with sometimes being outright disturbed. I believe this is one thing I really enjoyed about Lisa, it really crossed those boundaries that too many games shy away from these days. It's important to note the sacrifice in this game that I mentioned earlier, you'll have the choice of sacrificing limbs, killing off party members, or maybe ditching all your items. These can end up being legitimately difficult decisions that will affect the gameplay no matter what choice you choose.\n\nWhat seperates Lisa from other RPG Maker games, is that it's set on a 2D plane. You'll eventually obtain a bicycle which will make for faster transportation. You could call it "Metroidvania" in the sense where you'll have to backtrack to some areas with your newely accquired items, though it's a lot less complicated, with each crossroad consisting of 4-6 areas you'll be able to visit, making it easier to backtrack to areas without it being a hassle. It's also important to note how Lisa always gives you this feeling of being unsafe. Sleeping at campfires overnight can cause negative effects the next day, such as being poisoned. With over 30 recruitable party members comes with a price, some can leave you over night while resting, and some can end up getting captured. The battle system is your typical RPG stuff, although with few neat things added in. For one, Brad can string together combo's while bursting a special move (that drains MP), to finish it off. Secondly, your "TP" meter, which raises the more you get hit or deal damage. This allows you to perform some deadly special moves. Last thing that shoud be noted here is that unlike most RPG's, Lisa REALLY encourages exploration rather than grinding for you to level up which I think is a really good approach.\n\nLisa's soundtrack really is... something else. I can't go too in-depth on it, without saying it's really undescribeable, yet still really awesome and very worth checking out.\n\nOf course there are a couple negative points that should be addressed. Being able to save and load constantly can sometimes draw away from "The Painful" feeling of the game. If the game forced you to save after sleeping overnight, or making a crucial sacrifice, this definitely would have lived up to it's name a little more. I'm aware the "pain" difficulty allows you to only save once at every save point, but it doesn't change the fact you can still load to prevent some of these. Sometimes text boxes can't even fit the whole text, it's not a huge deal, but it's really strange when I see a bit of text cut off.\n\nI'm aware I've left out few important details such as "joy", and who exactly "Lisa" is. But I can't recommend this enough to anyone whose a fan of "comedic" RPG's. Be wary though, Lisa make's damn well sure to poke fun at you for some decisions and not hold back on making you feel like ♥♥♥♥ all while being really unsettling. It's important to note, Lisa eventually got a DLC sequel titled "Lisa The Joyful". While it lacks the charm of "The Painful", it's still very worth buying in the complete package. Any RPG fan who wants to see an interesting approach on the genre should definitely pick this up, especially while the complete package is still on sale.","January 3","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Excellent gameplay.  Excellent artwork.  Excellent soundtrack.\n\nStory:\n(MINOR SPOILERS)\nThis was a very artfully executed RPG with a masterfully told story.  The opening alone is one of the strongest openings I've seen from a game in a long time.  The main characters had interesting backstories which I felt compelled to figure out.  I've not had a game make me feel as much as this one did in such a short period of time.  All that being said, I felt a bit railroaded in my playthrough.  I was forced to make horrible decisions (which is fine), but I didn't feel that what I chose affected the story very much.  I remained very much an anti-hero though I did my very best to play the "white knight."  Not the worst thing in the world, but that's where I think there could've been some improvement.\n\nGameplay:\nThe battle system is reminiscent of Earthbound.  It is turn-based and filled to brim with interesting status effects and skills.  The combo system used by the main character (and a spattering of others) was very visceral and felt quite fulfilling.  I was also impressed by the massive roster of pickable characters to choose from.  Finally, one of the coolest elements of the game is the overworld exploration.  Lots of traditional pixel-based RPGs are viewed top-down, but this one is a sidescroller with platforming elements.  It made for engaging exploration.\n\nArtwork:\nThe art of this game was what drew me in initially.  Most old-school RPGs go with the traditional JRPG/anime theme, but Lisa stands apart with its gruff biker-types and washed-up middle-aged drug addicts.  The art isn't beautiful.  It's quite ugly...in the best way possible.  If you're looking for a game that ventures off the beaten path in terms of artwork, I highly recommend Lisa.\n\nMusic:\nLisa had one of the most bizarre soundtracks I've ever heard from a game.  That being said, I loved it.  Widdly 2 Diddly managed to add wonderful atmosphere to a very unusual game.  It even played off of old RPG tropes (success music sounding less than successful) that managed to make me laugh from time to time.  And when the music wasn't making me laugh, it was making me feel more intensely the painful moments of my protagonist.  Excellent soundtrack.","June 24, 2015","true","94.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While some of these techniques (anything involving tripping, oil+fire attacks) will turn most battles into a cakewalk, it's offset by the ridiculous brutality of many of the bosses.\n\nHowever, the story and writing is the best part of the game. The creator toes a fine line between absurd, often crude or sardonic humour and extremely serious moments that will have you on the edge of your seat. Many times you will have to choose between two horrible decisions, and the consequences will impact the rest of your game. There are no happy endings in The Painful RPG and the game will always remind you of the awful choices you made.\n\nA twisted and groovy soundtrack tops it all off.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrryan/recommended/335670/","mrryan","Mr. Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrryan/","265 products in account","Lisa is a fantastic game. On its own, the spoon-fed plot is enjoyable, but the real joy comes from exploring the world and putting story elements together. The dialogue alone makes Lisa a game worth purchasing. It shifts wildly between the poles of childish light-hearted toilet humor and poignant dark psychology. There is an entire area in the middle of horrific violence that is completely dedicated to professional wrestling memes. It is wonderful. The music is heavily atmospheric and has neat tie-ins with the story (especially whenever you hear a horn). The combat system is one that's been done before (kind of a mix of Xenogears and Earthbound), but battles aren't tedious as they are in other RPGs. More attention is given to exploration and dialogue than combat, so getting into constant fights and grinding is never a worry. There are a few areas (five in total throughout the entire game) that have infinitely-spawning random encounters, but the time spent in them is short enough to not become repetitive. The remaining fights are all either scripted or completely avoidable based on choices.\n\nThe character development is somewhat lacking for certain party members in the game. For Brad, Buddy, certain party members, and the main antagonists of the game, character development is strong - especially if information on them is sought out by the player. For other recruitable characters, it isn't as much. While this is to be expected from a game that both relies on its humor for character recruiting and one with a large recruitable roster, there should be a little more backstory for certain party members and enemies. Information on a lot of them is available through the artbook, but it's not in the game itself. In pain mode, there are some added enemies that don't really add anything to the plot, but who one would think would be important.\n\nThe rest of the gripes are fairly minor. Navigating menus can be somewhat tedious. If Brad uses a bottle of soup on a character, it exits the menu to display text that the bottle is now empty and it is necessary to navigate back to the item menu again. That could probably be streamlined better.\n\nThe combat UI can be buggy at times. There are times when a party member will receive a status ailment and the text on the screen will never disappear. Sometimes enemies will just disappear from view. They are still there, and reappear when they're selected, but their sprites will just vanish momentarily.\n\nThe UI to set controls is awful. Thankfully the game defaults to controller settings that are present in most console RPGs, but trying to set up custom controls is very difficult unless the player is very familiar with the game beforehand.\n\nMost of the characters are useful in their own ways save a few. The Joy withdrawal mechanic on Brad can be annoying, but it isn't game-breaking; however, a significant portion of the recruitable party members are also Joy addicts, and withdrawal symptoms happen so often that keeping Joy addicts in your party is a significant liability. Some really interesting recruits rarely see use because their Joy addiction is such an annoyance that other non-addicted party members are much more preferable.\n\nThe stengths of Lisa far outweigh the weaknesses. It is a hilarious and emotional journey that encourages exploration and strengthens its storytelling through gameplay. It is wholeheartedly recommended.","August 16, 2015","true","44.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But you'll still love it.\n\nLISA is a bizarre game.  You need to know that going in.  This is the kind of game that will make you slap your forehead as the game wrecks you and your player character with little warning while still giving you a fair amount of time to prepare for the hit.  It's also the kind of game where all of the characters are weird, sometimes lovable, oftentimes disgusting, and completely expendable.  Don't get too attached.\n\nThe gameplay is an interesting combination of genres.  On one hand, it is a side-scrolling adventure game with similar philosophy (but far different feel) to Flashback or Another World.  On the other hand, the game's combat system is handled as a turn-based RPG that brings to mind Earthbound.  All of which is very balanced, though a small gripe is tht screen transitions in the side-scrolling sections can occasionally cause players to blunder off cliffs resulting in damage or even instant Game Overs.\n\nThe graphics also easily bring to mind the Earthbound asthetic, especially the feel of Mother 3.  Don't be fooled though!  This game is not childish at all and will use its cartoony style to create an unsettling dissonance (which is helped greatly by the soundtrack as well) with all of the dark subject matter.\n\nThat's the final part of the game that I wish to comment on: this game covers very dark subject matter.  There is betrayal, ♥♥♥♥, extreme violence, needless murder, suicide, sex-crazed wastelanders doing anything to get off, drug abuse... the list goes on and on- and it's not exclusively the villains who partake in this behavior.  It all comes together to make an excellent story with beautifully flawed characters who try to get by in this bizarre, barren, ridiculous, and harsh world.\n\nThe reason why I bring this up is that, while I love how the subject matter is handled (oftentimes like a screwed up joke that cracks up the joker but leaves the rest of the room uncomfortable), it isn't for everybody.  If you find yourself easily offended or unable to cope with uncomfortable subjects like the ones I listed in the previous paragraph then this game might make you squirm too much for you to enjoy it.  If you think you can handle it, however, this game is definitely worth your time.\n\nOne of the best and most interesting games that I've played in a while.  It continues to amaze me what creative people can manage to do with RPG Maker.","April 9, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has enough humor to leave you wanting more, and a large amount of sorrow that allows you to take this game seriously. As said, most of this game is depressing and at times very harsh, but is balanced out to the point where your emotions will contrast each other constantly, never staying the same. The story is very intriguing, and its basic art style is still pleasant on the eyes. Every character you meet will shock you, make you cry, or make you cry for a completely different reason. The soundtrack is done perfectly, although at first it seems repetitive and annoying, it slowly builds on you and really sets the tone for the insane world you're forced to survive in. I still listen to it occasionally for its originality. The game's difficulty is challenging in some areas more than others, seemingly without a pattern, but that all depends on your party members, luck, and the items you're carrying. There's another difficulty in the game known as 'Pain Mode', which severely hinders gameplay, making it almost impossible to finish first try. I'd reccomend it to people wanting all acheivements, or people who are ok with getting angry often.                              If this game was a rollercoaster, it'd be one without a seat, and no speed limit.

As you travel through the desolate wasteland that used to be the world and interview some of the colorful characters here, you'll be asking yourself "wtf could happen to the world to make it like this?"\n\nUnlike Earthbound, the game plays out as a side-scroller RPG rather than a top-down one, but plays well and feels like an RPG. NPCs are authentically disgusting, miserable, cruel, pathetic and pointless - the worst side of humanity is well portrayed here. Combat plays just like in Earthbound, with enemies just as absurd. Graphics are simple, cartoonish, and pleasant.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty atmospheric, conveying feelings ranging from constant pointlessness (God's Call), to a Lovecraftian feeling of dread (Devil's Bath Boys), to even the peace of a sunny afternoon in an isolated village (Summer Love).\n\nThe plot will require you to make choices, and your choices will have impact in the plot. It's a cruel story, I will say that much. It has some great twists, some of which will require deep digging into the game. But it's not for everyone. If you like everything to make sense, you better avoid this game. While I have no complaints, can't say I fully enjoyed the direction the DLC went by its end.

The game is an emotional rollercoatser from start to finish, with an ending sure to leave a pit in your stomach as deep as the myusterious backstory. For a ten hour game it has a lot going on and makes a smart choice not to shove it in the players face but instead make the player ask questions and give them enough information to piece together something for themselves. I have only a few criticisms for the game: real combat is a bit scarce with many fights meant to be cinamatic or as jokes, and when the game forces you to make decisions that the player may not agree with it can be a little frustrating. That being said the game is easily worth the ten dollars, and with extra content promised on kickstarter may even be worth an arm or a leg. 7.8/10","January 12, 2015","true","38.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

You won't find this quality of story-telling in a AAA title. A sick sad world is presented to us filled with comedy gold. Every decision impacts your game, and very often you will have to make some tough ones, sacrificing limbs or allies. Although I'm not really into sick ♥♥♥♥ like that, the game rightfully earns its reputation as "the painful RPG".\nIn an era where every game takes you by the hand and rewards players for accomplishing very little, this game turns the concept on his head; the developers remembered punishment is part of a game experience, and it executes it harshly yet effectively until the very end.

"Unique" seems like a watered-down adjective at this point, because these days it is used to describe every single game with a metascore over 80, just because of one aspect that wasn't in the last game of that genre. LISA is a (deep breaths, everyone) sidescrolling platformer post-apocalyptic RPG with randomized elements that cause permanent changes to your character, over 30 party members all with their own uniqueness to them, and a battle system occasionally reminescent of DDR. Sound familiar? Didn't think so.\n\nLISA is an RPG with soul, the likes of which I haven't played since EarthBound. Every single enemy has a unique name and sprite. Every single party member has advantages and disadvantages to using them, and the fact that there are 30 unique characters is absurd alone. As for story, it starts off strong and gets stronger the more one goes on. The main story is touching by itself, but if one goes off the beaten path little things about the LISA mythos are revealed slowly and confusingly. The game doesn't hold your hand in understanding its world, I've actually spent a couple of hours on forums discussing what certain parts mean or represent, something I haven't had to do since Silent Hill 2.\n\nThe atmosphere of LISA is something that grew on me. At first I thought it was a little clunky, it flipped between trying to provide humorous dialogue (wearing its EarthBound influences on its sleeve), to very strange, Space Funeral-esque interludes of horror and bizzare visuals. After a while, I began to realize that the thematic shifts were intentional and complimentary: the humor kept me listening to dialogue and talking to every character, and the horror kept me playing just to see how off-the-rails the game would go. Not to spoil anything, but the game's story definitely reaches a creschendo at the end of the game. It was incredible, and it left me satasfied with the ending.\n\nIn short, LISA is dark, poignant, and painful. Scroll up and buy it now. In fact, this is one of the few times I would tell someone to buy the soundtrack/art-pack too. Anyway, this is my favorite game of 2014, and if you like RPGs it's is a breath of fresh air after the industry's repeated failures to produce something as good as the SNES/PS1 titles.","January 18, 2015","true","16.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/335670/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","LISA is a post-apocalyptic RPG. I find it good but not very fun, and I will try to explain why.\n\nI will start with what got me into playing the game: the graphics are simple, but the art style is rich and very evocative (special mention to all the different monstrously mutated humans). It translates into the scenes visited: a lot of variation, twisted stories, but with a simple delivery and charm. This is mostly what kept me going, knowing that each area would reveal new characters and stories with their own personality that bring something new to the experience. While it is impressive that all these scenes can hint at much more depth while being so short, it also disappointed me that there was little follow-through to any of these stories and characters. Especially regarding all the many players that can be recruited to the party of the player. Only a little bit more follow-through for the main quest, but new elements that concern it are so far from each other that it feels disconnected from the experience. At least there are moments with terrible choices to make, and some of those will stick to the player's mind even after the game has been closed!\n\nWhile I appreciated the variety in locations, I found it very hard to appreciate the core gameplay that would get me from one place to the other. The game looks like a platformer, but there is no way to jump so moving up requires cords. There are many platforms to climb, so exploring is both tedious and dangerous as falling in a pit can lead to a game over. And the framerate can occasionally tank so much that navigating the levels becomes even more painful. I would have stopped the game after a few minutes if there wasn't quickly a bicycle to move faster, but even then navigating these mountains and having a hard time remembering where each door among many goes really put me off. And that is where I could also see that despite its limitations the game was well designed, as backgrounds were hugely different for each place, or sometimes annoying enemies would serve as a way to remind the player which direction had not been explored yet.\n\nTalking about combat, this game is similar to a jRPG as the player chooses the different attacks, and then everyone attacks in turn with no movement involved. There are some moments with surprise encounters, but thankfully very rare or it would have convinced me to stop the game as well. It is not really necessary to grind either, so the usual reasons as to why I hate jRPGs are largely mitigated here. And even if I do not like jRPG combat logic (why can my character heal during a battle but not outside?), the combat system was not a complete bore due to the original attacks and effects (can make someone feel weird, cry, trip and so on). So not especially enjoyable, but not too taxing while having depth and enough variety in the enemies encountered to prevent too much repetition.\n\nAnother question is: are the save locations frequent enough to prevent frustration? I would say that it is alright, there are enough save points to not have to walk long distance over and over. However, the rest camps can be quite annoying as there are high chances to treat the player very unfairly by kidnapping a party member, poisoning the group, stealing the in-game currency. I get it, Lisa's world is harsh and it has to be painful for the player as well, but I would just load the save and try over and over until my party has been healed. And waste my time. Because I don't want to waste my time looking around for a kidnapped party member, or having to grind experience to upgrade a new one if the previous one decided to abandon me.\n\nIn Lisa, every design decision makes sense and has been well thought. The game could have been so horrible to play if the developer didn't know what he was doing! But as it is, playing is alright. Not fun, but with enough variety to push me to seek the next deviant scene I will encounter and yearn for more. And the music kicks ♥♥♥. I do not know if I can recommend Lisa as I did not enjoy most of my time with it, but I still find it a good and interesting game with a lot of depth under its simple appearance.","October 28, 2015","true","20.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The narrative is cool, the combat animations are satisfying, and it's the only game that I've ever played that actually made me regret a decision that I made through game mechanics rather than sad elf faces.\n\nThere's a character who sucks that you can sacrifice your items to save. You think that he's going to get better, but that doesn't happen. There's a point later in the game where you can make that character compete in a game of Russian Roulette. I did that and three rounds later the plucky nutcase walked out unscathed. While he still sucks and I'll never use him in combat, there's something magical about me discovering that a useless party member's secret power is his ability to not get murdered in Russian Roulette.\n\nI have no idea what goes into the game's Russian Roulette simulation. He could have just gotten lucky for all that I know. All of that is just a narrative that happened because the developer lets you make choices that have consequences and feelings attached to them. There is no Jesus/Hitler binary here and it's great.\n\nMy only complaint? The game's overworld is a little confusing.\n\nAlso, this game's writing is incredibly good. I bought Dragon Age Inquisition and I got Joss Whedon tropes and bulls whom I can Romance, but Lisa gives me funny and heartfelt moments with porno mags as currency.\n\nProof of an uncaring universe","December 23, 2014","true","16.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Don't get it twisted - this is not one of those short little indie titles - this is a full blown RPG with one of the best storylines you will ever experience. It seems simple on the surface, but there are layers of complexity here.\n\nIt is absolutely worth full price. And there is a sequal in the works, which is just awesome. Just stay off the forums for fear of spoilers.\n\nPros:\n+Artwork is brilliantly done - its subtle but you will catch on\n+Music is absolutely outstanding, and I will certainly pick up the soundtrack\n+Choices really do matter (e.g. I made choices that ended up killing off an entire town)\n+Character avatars are modified due to different choices\n+This game is emotionally charged (some consider it dark), and keeps me coming back\n\nCons:\n-Some of the platforming can become tedious if you are not sure where to go.

The gameplay is solid (although the movement system takes a lot of getting used to, but that's understandable given the engine limitations), the characters are diverse and interesting, there are many different events and finally a complex moral choice system, through sacrifice and general actions, which all have a lasting effect on story, the world around you, and even core gameplay mechanics. The soundtrack is great. I have spent many an hour listening to Widdly 2 Diddly's rad beats. (boy oh boy is the best song btw)\n\nBut as much as I would like to proclaim this a perfect game, sadly it has a couple of drawbacks.\nFirst up, the aformentioned movement system. Now, I will admit, I fell prey to the movement system more times than I'd care to admit, often many times over on the same location, but really it's an understandable drawback. Since the game is  made using a top-down square based engine, having a 2-D adventure platformer-ish game is going to be a little odd, to say the least. If you can get used to it though, it becomes very easy to navigate, especially in Joyful.\n\nThe second main drawback, for some people, is the high difficulty. Now, this wasn't really a problem for me, but I did get stuck on a couple of bosses, and some of my good party members abandoned me for next to no reason, but if I'm being honest here it adds to the whole "miserable journey" thing.\n\nMy favourite part of the game would have to be the disturbing fights with the mutants. Oh, there might be some minot spoilerage ahead, so yeah. Fights with the mutants like Baby and Chester in the Joyful expansion really bring with them a creepy atmosphere, and that really helps add to the tension of these potentially party destroying enemies.\n\nAll in all, LISA is a sometimes hilarious, sometimes soul crushing experience, with a high difficulty curve and a deeply interesting world that is full of lively NPCs and is affected by the choices you make throughout your gameplay.\nAnd the feels, man. The FEELS.","April 12","true","26.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay has a lot of flaws and some places (+ their fights) can just annoy you (damn Marty spiders!).\nAlso it's kinda fun to 'collect' playable characters but in the end they don't really mean anything. I would have rather liked fewer of them but with a bit bigger part in the story.\n\nAnyway, its shortcomings couldn't keep me from enjoying the f**k outta this game. I just loved its dirty, cynical perv vibe. There's just not many games out there which are this uncompromising. I was actually surprised I liked it so much, because, to be honest, I'm a little tired of all that Southpark-HappyTreeFriends-FamilyGuy-kinda cynicism, because it always works the same way and has become too predictable to be able to shock or amuse you anymore.\nI guess it's this game's personal color and the fact that one person put all his s**t into it, so the graphical style, the music and the story harmonize perfectly. And I mean, just take a look at this Austin Jorgensen's Facebook profile. That guy is just delightfully... strange. Looks like someone dug him out of a part of America where there has been no internet until recently and only TV shows and films from up to 1993. I hope they consider him for the new season of Twin Peaks.\n\nAlso, what I really liked about this game is the uncompromising consequences you have to live with. This game should have an iron man mode with only one save which is automatically updated after each decision. I have to admit at one point I just didn't want to take the brutal consequence of my decision, loaded my save and decided otherwise. Yeah, I know, I'm weak! But it's not my fault - the game shouldn't have let me do it ;)\nStill, there's so many mean f**ks you have to take in this game (some literally) that you WILL BE SORE.\nI was also a lot into the story. Unfortunately, the end was a little disappointing and 'thin'. The setting and plot had a lot more potential.\n\nStill, this is one of those games that are so quaint it'll stick with you. The soundtrack, too. I'm still waking up every day to the tune of that trumpet player in my head O_O\n\nI've heard the guy is already working on his next game (between Kung-Fu lessons, acting, making music and greasing his hair) and I'm reeeeally looking forward to it :)","February 3, 2015","true","15.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You are forced to make hard decisions. You will lose, again, and again, and again. There are dozens of companions in this game, and each and every single one of them can die permanently. Or they might just decide to abandon you. Your main character can lose all he has, including his limbs.\nThis game is absolutely nuts.\nIt's not quite "rocks fall, everyone dies," but at one point, it gets very, very close to that.\nAbsolutely loving the game just for that aspect alone already.\n\nThe story is gripping, dark, and you always know that anything can happen. I absolutely couldn't let go off this game, because I wanted to know how it was going to end.\nBut all in all, I've got to say the story's actually what I like the least about this game. A few times in the game, your player character will do terrible things to others. He'll just do what he wants, basically. It always takes you out of the game a little bit, but it's mostly forgivable. However, at one point in particular, towards the very end of the game, it just completely took me out of the game. I'd been there, captivated by the plot, longing to know what happens next--but then, I ceased to feel with my player character. Simple as that.\nAbout one hour before completing the game, I was actually concerned that I wasn't going to be able to sleep easy, no matter how the game would end. But now, I just don't really care.\nAnd when you look at it, the story is just bleak and depressing. Things don't really get resolved at all, and there's a bunch of open questions.\nApart from the last thirty minutes of the game, the story is perfect, though. Absolutely phenomenal, especially coupled with the permadeath mechanics. I can't emphasize this enough: Hard decisions have to be made in this game.\n\nI've actually had to wrestle with myself whether to hit that thumbs up or thumbs down button at the bottom of this review. Ultimately, I went with a recommendation, because this game is just so unbelievably imaginative, daring, and provocative. Does the game go too far? Definitely.

That's LISA. LISA is the type of game that doesn't come along often, especially from an indie developer. Having just scratched the surface of this game with only 8 hours of gameplay, I am confident to say that it holds its own amongst indie superstars Braid and LIMBO. The introduction alone is worth the price of admission, as it weaves a convincing story in the first five minutes of (near silent) game play than all of Twilight does throughout three films. As the player follows LISA's protagonist through a heartbreaking adventure full of perverts, drugs, and combat, he or she will find it hard to pull away from both the narrative and the gameplay.\n\nIf I had anything remiss to say about LISA it would be that sometimes the combat can seem repetitive, or the side scrolling back and forth to make sure you have explored every possible route can become tedious for the neurotic gamer, but LISA manages to mix up the perfect concoction of humor and unique combat to spin a dark and twisted post-apocalyptic tale unlike many modern games have ever done.","May 11, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enough to get me to actually write a review.\n\nOne of the best things about LISA is its ability to deal with dark subject matter without straying into the dreaded eye-rollingly "edgy" territory so much other media has. AND!!! It has moments of abosulte rediculousness and hilarity to balance the crippling despair you might feel at other parts of the game.\n\nGreat story told without mountains of exposition dialogue, and players are rewarded for exploration with more hints and tidbids as to what's really going on.\n\nI generally judge how much I liked a game by how often I think about it in the time after I beat it, and LISA has stuck with me, heavily, ever since. SO, If you're like me and love a good SOUL-CRUSHING STORY and FEELING BAD ABOUT VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS, you should definitely check this out.","August 24, 2015","true","37.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had read an article about this game some time ago and I thought the premise was interesting enough. I'll be honest, I actually wasn't expecting too much from this game. Indie hasn't really been my thing. It came out and I never really heard anything about it afterwards. Not sure why though. The game is ridiculously good. The developer created a world that is really interesting and its populated whacky characters that had me continuously moving forward. I wanted to see what insane thing was on the next screen and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nDespite all the craziness, the world ties together really nicely. You might meet an npc that gives an offhand comment that you don't get the full implication of until later in the game when you get more context. This kind of attention to detail makes the game great. The world is a blast to traverse through. Maybe a few too many caves but they're short and normally used for transition. They often contain some event that prevents them from being too bad anyways. The mood of all the areas is lended a hand by the music. The music is great and really helps to establish sense of an area. Also that workout song? Beautiful.\n\nThis game isn't all whacky though. There are some genuinely creepy elements to the game and a sense of unease is cultivated that often has a rather horrifying pay off. You also are forced into tough choices. I didn't really struggle on the first couple but the later choices are rough and will leave you wondering if you should of done that. I can harp on about the world the game created for a while but how is the gameplay? Its pretty good. A bit standard if I really want to nitpick about it. You pick your attacks/skills and the turn plays out based on who has priority. The combat is helped along by the allies you pick up during your journey. The variety of characters really kept me from getting bored.\n\nThey all have their own skill sets that are fun to experiment with. You can find some pretty fun combinations of allies in the game. I will say that the joy addiction system wasn't my favorite thing in the world. It pretty much makes some characters completely worthless due to withdrawals. I ended up avoiding them because, while they CAN be strong, I felt that the withdrawals was a bit too annoying to deal with. Especially considering that the non-addict teammates seemed just as strong to me. I also didn't find much joy in my playthrough but that could of been on me. I really wanted to use Bucket after what I went through to get him, but alas...\n\nIn the end, I really enjoyed this game. I would recommend it regardless of price. The ten dollar price tag is more than worth it. If you're a bit leery then do like I did and pick it up during a sale. I managed to beat it after ~11 hours and I can say it was a blast to playthrough. I'm even considering going through it again on the hard difficulty.\n\nTLDR: Great world\nGreat soundtrack\nGood combat\nGreat story\nGreat game","June 26, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A tale of love, abuse and loyalty.\n\nYou play the part of Brad, a broken man known as an accomplished martial arts instructor, deeply tormented by grief and abuse.\nYour life changes the day one of your drugged up afternoons are interrupted by a baby girl lying on the ground in front of you - a seemingly impossible event in a ruined world inhabited solely freaks and deranged men. The future of humanity is now literally in your hands and you will be forced to go to great length and make crushing choices to protect it.\nWho will you be at the end of all of this?\n\nThe story, writing and soundtrack are the absolute highlights of this tale. Many of the tracks from the soundtrack stand on their own, even outside of the context of the game. The dialogue is impressive, moving from pitch black darkness to absolute hilarity with ease. The disturbing visuals adds greatly to the experience. The aesthetic looks like something Ralph Steadman would conjure up if he was less talented and into pixel art.\n\nIt is not without flaws, however. The game has some mechanical issues of major proportions and the limitations of the game engine are often apparent. It's not bad enough to detract from an incredible experience but one can't help but wonder what the game would play like with a bigger budget and a custom engine.\n\nLISA is definitely not for everyone. If it is for you however - and if you read this far it quite possibly is - you will laugh, be disgusted, get angry and maybe even shed a tear or two when you experience this piece of art. It will make you feel something and that's a rare thing in gaming.\n\nSeriously recommended.","August 29, 2015","true","27.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TisforTopher/recommended/335670/","TisforTopher","Misha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TisforTopher/","70 products in account","So, before I begin, I would like to thank Dingaling for providing a fresh and fun entry into the indie genre, one that has affected me and many others greatly, and hopefully will endure the test of time.\n\nI feel that the first thing I should do is address the drawing of parallels between Undertale and LISA. These games may share quite a bit, but it is absolutely NOT worth comparing the two, as they share completely different themes and gameplay focuses. Undertale's focus is more on gathering friendships and the value of those friendships. Undertale likes to be fair(so long as you are going pacifist), and will reward you for playing along. LISA is a take on how everything can be taken away from us in the blink of an eye, even if you DO play along. Choices you make will be difficult, they will have an effect on you in the moment, and will make your journey significantly more difficult, as you cannot avoid these decisions.\n\nIt's unfair.\n\nLife is unfair.\n\nI will now break down LISA into pros/cons like the good little reviewer I was born to be.\n\nPros:\n-Great soundtrack, I still listen to a few of the songs on my own time, and each area has it's own little (widdly2)diddly as you walk about and absorb the atmosphere.\n\n-Incredible atmosphere, LISA is hopeless, you will feel hopeless, but that's part of the enjoyment, the comedy given to you in the form of characters and wacky situations help raise your spirits to give you the motivation to continue on regardless.\n\n-Story(?), LISA easily has one of the most dark and inhuman storylines of any game I've ever had the pleasure of playing, it will destroy your sense of being and bring you back to the light only to send you back to hell. It makes you feel things. It's good.\n\n-Combat(?), Although many would say combat was the shortcoming of LISA, I actually found it a bit fun, it works on a basic WASD dial combo system to dial in skills for extra damage. If you were too lazy to learn the combos yourself, you could simply circumvent the dial combos and go straight to the skill menu. This feature was a blessing and a curse, the latter I will explain later.\n\n-Art, The art was nothing special to be honest, but it was definitely really good and the earthy tones really helped convey the tone Dingaling was going for.\n\nNow, onto our cons.\n\n-Difficulty Curve, LISA's main selling point may just be it's downfall. It's hard. This game was incredibly hard in it's beginning stages, albeit it becomes easier as the game goes on, it almost turned me off and has actually turned off many other players from continuing the game. Anyone who buys this needs to understand that you'll need to push past that first crossroads before the game picks up and you can actually fight things.\n\n-Combat(?), LISA's combat is a real crapshoot, you either like it or hate it, or who knows, you might be fine with it, but it definitely wasn't anything revolutionary and ESPECIALLY in the beginning stages it's tedious as hell and can really get frustrating to fight anything. It gets better later on, but as I said, the steep curve of this game turns players off right from the beginning without showing them a light at the end of the tunnel\n\n-Story(?), LISA's story is ♥♥♥♥ed up, and for the most people, hardly relateable. It's really dark and depending on your life experiences you will either become enthralled in it's world or be completely turned off by it's harshness. Really a matter of preference.\n\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ING CLIFFS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T\n\nOverall, I rate LISA:The Painful RPG a 8/10, could have been better on the mechanics side of thing, but overall an amazing title and a great addition to anyone's library.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

People with 30 minutes of gameplay say some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for no reason without reasonable arguements.\n\nAnyways, like everyone has said the game is inspired by Earthbound. If you're familiar with Earthbound then you'll quickly grasp the combat system. The game is kinda difficult, I struggled at some certain parts but in my first run I did way better than I expected. The story is amazing and really emotional. Austin (the developer) has done an amazing job with the plot and apart from all the emotion the humor in this game is just ... amazing.\nThe game isn't gonna go easy on you. I realised that in the first hour. You're gonna need to make choices, important choices. You need to think of the correct choices that benefit your main character and that was harsh for someone like me who likes to have many companions.\nUp so far, Lisa is for me the best game I've played in 2015 (We will see if Lisa the Joyful can top this game). You should buy this game and you should go through the emotional rollercoaster I went through. 10/10","July 10, 2015","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Dialogue is generally disturbing and/or hiliarious\n2. The Combat and character abilities are very interesting\n3. The currency is nudie mags\n4. You can get the crap beaten out of you in a thousand different ways\n5. The decisions you make are intense\n6. The soundtrack is by far one of the wierdest and most amazing of all the games i have played\n7. Everyones an addict of some sort or a drunk\n8. Actually suprising plot twists and terrifing WTF moments\n9. For better or worst you can reload your saves if times get tough\n10. The story at times, makes no sense but somehow that only improves the game\nBOTTOMLINE: I HIGHLY recommend this game, Would go insane after mistaking a truck driver for a woman, repeatedly throwing myself off a cliff for a guy i dont know, climbing a rope for two minutes for nothing, and sacrificing limbs  as well as party members for various reasons again in a heartbeat 100/10","July 9, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chainsauce/recommended/335670/","chainsauce","Chainsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chainsauce/","261 products in account","The best way to describe this game would be 'Dad who loses everything simulator'. You play as Brad Armstrong, a sad, broken man looking for his missing daughter in a post-apocalyptic world where he hates everything and everything hates him. Touches on some very dark themes such as child abuse, drug addiction, prostitution, and professional wrestling.\n\nGameplay: Heavily Earthbound inspired and is pretty much typical JRPG combat. However, even as someone who normally dislikes that sort of thing, I found the combat rather enjoyable. Certain characters have very different playstyles, such as one who can only inflict status effects, and another who attacks through button combinations to do combos. Status effects have actual meaning, as opposed to other games in which it's better to go for straight up damage. In LISA, the status effects will work on every enemy, even the bosses, so there is variance in combat as opposed to just spam one move. Additionally, there are a bunch of party members spread around the game who play very differently, allowing for very varied playthroughs.\n\nWriting: A very good blend of both drama and humor. Powerful and sad story with bits of dark (VERY dark) humor spread throughout. I don't laugh at a lot of games but this got me laughing out loud a couple of times. Lots of very likeable characters. Lots of very tough decisions must be made throughout the game. I believe the developer said at one point that he wanted the choices to be difficult instead of just an obvious THIS IS THE GOOD PATH CHOICE AND THIS IS THE BAD ONE, and it really shows.\n\nSound: The soundtrack is very well made, conveying emotion very well during the serious parts, and being rather silly during the funny parts. Some of the tunes are really catchy as well.\n\nOverall, one my favorite games I've played. I'd say it's my 2nd favorite of all time, right behind Dwarf Fortress which will forever be the best. At only $10, I'd recommend picking it up, it's great. By the end, this game will have you saying, "Did I do the right thing?"","November 25, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some teams are obviously better than others and some might be even a bit OP, but it's always tempting to put on a talking Fish with legs on your team over your OG Terry. The punishing aspect of the game is in full force as well. Don't choose Pain Mode for a first run unless you are some sort of masocist like me.

Brad sets out on a dangerous journey to find a girl who may prove to be crucial to the survival of the species.\n\nPlot, in my opinion, is the strongest point of the game. It makes one think and consider various options, as well as theories. One could say that it provides some serious food for thought, and this wouldn't be an exaggeration. Choices that one makes on the way affect the gameplay and the game world in a few different ways. After all, this is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, you never know what lurks around the corner. The story is very dark, but there are also plenty of wacky, downright comical moments in the game.\n\nWhat is more, this game has a pretty unique art style. It is very charming in its own way. Pretty much every character looks different and has personality. It reminds me of Earthbound (and rightfully so - supposedly, Earthbound was one of the dev's biggest inspirations). The soundtrack is also excellent - it features both quirky and serene pieces, and so everyone will find some appealing songs in it.\n\nAll things considered, I think that this is one of the strongest indie titles from 2014. A sequel/DLC is due in 10 days, so hopefully it will wrap-up certain characters arcs. I can sincerely recommend this game, it is definitely worth the asking price.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Step into the world of Olathe and have fun. :)","August 15, 2015","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it even rivals the Hotline Miami 2 soundtrack...\n- Has many funny easter eggs and references\n- Solid RPG gameplay; you'll get to level up characters, buy them gear, etc.\n- The dialog the characters have is often super funny yet kinda ♥♥♥♥ed up\n- Painful Mode is PAINFUL (don't play it on your first run like I attempted to do...)\n- The combat is quick but flashy enough to make it fun. It seems complex at first, but it's really not\n- The artstyle ranges from quirky and cute to creepy and disgusting\n- Forced to make choices that matter while simultaneously make you feel like a worthless subhuman\n- The main character, Brad, is someone you'll hate and love throughout the story\n- The story is probably one of the best stories I have ever encountered in a video game. It's weird, dark, depressing and touches on subjects that not many games have attempted to approach. Now, that would make it seem pretentious... but it's not. The story is presented in such a blunt way that it makes you empathize with the characters instead of rolling your eyes at them.\n- Be prepared to be punched in the feels ALOT\n- This game made me depressed\n\nNeutral:\n- In a way, this game is a sequel to LISA: The First. Many people say you don't need to play LISA: The First, but I honestly feel like you do in order to understand the depth of the story.\n- ♥♥♥♥ Buzzo... this actually has nothing to do with the review, but I just wanted to get that off my chest: ♥♥♥♥ that piece of mother♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.\n- The controls are confusing at first, but that's mostly due to this game being made in RPG maker. However, you can view the controls by pressing F12 and rebind them in anyway you please.\n\nCons:\n- Cliffs ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off at times because if you fall off a cliff (which is likely to happen sooner or later) it's game over. Now, this isn't too much of a big deal in normal mode, since there are save points everywhere. However, in Painful mode, you can only save at a save point once, then it blows up and you can't use it again. Therefore, save points are precious and rare... and you're gonna lose a ton of progress by falling off a cliff.\n- The intro is important and sets the tone of the game, but I feel like it dragged on for too long.\n- Satan, an optional boss (and the hardest in the game), is disappointingly easy.\n\nGet this game if you like video games.","July 26, 2015","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My definition of good is always gauged with the question, "did it make me feel anything"?  If the answer is yes, then generally that game is pretty bad ♥♥♥.  It has and will always be my favorite aspect of gaming, but I digress.\n\nLisa made me feel, a lot in fact.  I sit here, a week out from playing it still thinking about it, and how in some ways I'm like that disgusting person, surrounded by those terrifying people, trying to find redemption for great regrets.\n\nIt's deep, it's terrifying, it's beautiful, it's atmospheric, it's witty, it's unrelenting loss, and it's freakin' hard.\nIf you've forgotten how to RPG, you’ll either figure it out here or you won’t get through the game.\nYou'll likely die a lot, and you may lose things at a moment’s notice, significant things.\n\nThis game isn't one of those "pretty good for an rpg maker" games, it's a must play as game period.\n\nThe artstyle in general is an Earthbound meets acid kind of feel.\n\nOutside of combat looks and plays like Super Mario Bros 2.  Stupid cliffs...\n\nInside combat is like Earthbound, with flashes of character animations which are really well done.\n\nThe music might be one of the most impressive things, not only was it completely unique, but it set the atmosphere better than most AAA games that I've played.  Kudos.\n\nc in an incredibly heavy story.\n\nThe only real gripes I had with the game was a lack of tutorial (I didn't know you could use truck keys until I was 3/4 into the game, so I had to do a lot of back-tracking), the controls are stuck in an awkward way, and some people might think the battles are a little drawn out, but I think it adds to the challenge and tension.\n\nI recommend this game 100% if you are in the right state of mind.\n\n10/10 Would lose everything again.\n\n","September 6, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My personal favorite was Dandy Boy, which honestly made me jive a bit in my seat. There isn't a song that I didn't like in all honesty, and each one is used effectively, especially towards the end game.\n\nThe game's story was very enthralling and kept me coming back for more and more, ending up in long, long sessions where I'd just plow through areas in hopes to find even more quirky allies for my party. Don't grow too attached however, because this game has perma death. If you're like me then you'll retry the Russian Roulette section over and over until everyone in your party survives. And of course the game is very twisted in some aspects, but there are chunks of dark humor spread about like sprinkles on a scoop of blood flavored ice-cream.\n\nIt's good. Really good. I got it on sale for $5 and played it for 13 and a half hours, so I'd say I got my money's worth on this one.\n\nIf you like RPGs, dark humor, and an overall crushing atmosphere of despair and misery, then this is the game for you.","July 12, 2015","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You form a party, you travel around various areas, you take turns beating enemies. There are bosses and semi-secret areas. There are branching paths. You've played games like this before.\n\nWhat makes LISA special is not gameplay but narrative. It is unrelentingly dark. If Cormac McCarthy and Quentin Tarantino got together to write a video game, LISA would be it. You have to make choices that will genuinely upset you. Bad things will happen, sometimes randomly, sometimes because of something you did earlier, and all you can do is face the music. Humor shines like an oil slick on the ceaseless tide of suffering that the game presents. LISA is a study in misery, redemption, sacrifice, and betrayal, and yet it is deeply engaging and worthwhile in a way that few games today manage. It's the game everybody who grew up playing the same JRPG over and over again as a kid realizes that they deserved to be playing all along.","July 23, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The humor is a bit inconsistent in how it meshes with the story though.  Sometimes it can make an emotional/serious moment come across as a little odd, other times it blends really well with those moments and makes them stronger.  It's easy to get attached to any character you meet really and all of the characters are portrayed in a grey/neutral light which I really like in a post-apocalyptic setting personally.\n\nThe combat is good and the party members you meet all feel unique in their abilities.  The animation for combos and skills are all really nice and fun to look at (especially Rage Ironhead's LUCHA combos).  The game isn't too challenging, but it's hard enough to put some pressure on the player in key moments.  Mutants are designed really well and are actually pretty intimidating to fight.\n\nWhat really surprises me about LISA though is the music.  In all the talk of LISA I've witnessed, nobody ever mentioned the music.  This ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent and really creates a sort of unique atmosphere during fights and during exploration.  it gets you pumped up in different ways or it creates a sort of wary, uncomfortable feeling that you probably won't like (see all the mutant fights).\n\nOverall I'd highly recommend this game to just about anyone.

Not in a diffuculty sense, unless you play Pain Mode, but in an emotional sense.\n\nIn a story standard, better have a box of tissues nearby.

Then play this game, then Pain Mode, then the Joyful DLC. Or you could just...watch it on YouTube.\n\nIn a gameplay standard, it's amazing! Even though it's just an RPG, it's one of the most original ones I've encountered. Instead of an open world, you're limited to a 2D platformer, such as ones like Mario or Megaman. And with that 2D feature, there's different depths, adding to that platforming aspect. This world is very large; and if you don't know what you're doing, you're bound to get lost. With that open world comes a wacky cast of helpers, some serious, other just...weird. The fighting system is just like any other RPG, except, sometimes, your basic attack can input combos, which can lead to special moves!\n\nThe music is fantastic, too! It helps set the mood for whatever is happening in the game, and does it really well!\n\nThis game also requires patience. There's a lot of ways to die. And I mean A LOT. Brad moves kinda slow, but you'll get some faster way of transportation pretty early on.\n\nOverall, buy this game, the soundtrack, the artbook, and the DLC.

Manages to pull so many emotions, making a very sad and disgusting story with interesting characters while also pulling off very clever and humourous writing.  Over 30 Unique party members that each offer something different with strategy-heavy gameplay (There is no OP or broken party memebers). Most of the choices that are made throughout the game are not for some excuse for showing one of many endings; but rather alter the gameplay, by taking away combos and decreasing the main characters attack or permanently killing off a crucial party member with no prior warning. There is no right or wrong in this game when it comes to choices. To summarise, LISA is a game with a very impressive atmosphere; It'll tell you a joke, make you laugh, then kick you in the balls. It'll force you to make choices that'll leave your stomach trembling and never goes easy on you. This game is incredible, and the fact that it was made in RPG Maker really goes to show that it doesn't matter how limitting the software or engine is, there are people that are creative, bold and willing to create something unique and near flawless.\n\nArt Style - Amazing\nMusic - Amazing\nStory - Amazing\nGameplay - Amazing\nWriting - Amazing\n\nIf you haven't bought this game yet, do yourself a favour and pick it up, if you are even remotely interested in RPG's than it will not dissapoint.","February 24, 2015","true","84.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will play as Brad, Lisa's brother, who feels a great sense of loss and responisbility for the death of his sister.

Decisions can have brutal consequences and will have long term impact on you and your party. Humor is dark and quirky, if nothing else, although occasionally things the game finds amusing may cause the player to cringe.\n\nBefore playing this game please be aware that the work contains STRONG themes of violence, ♥♥♥♥, abuse, suicide, amputation, drug abuse, addiction, death, loss, and ♥♥♥♥ (I know I said it twice, but it is a serious running theme).

Even though it's on sale right now I would buy this game for the full price with no question. This RPG is like nothing you have played before. It's a dark, yet hilariously written story with so much charm and attention to detail that I can't wait for anything this developer puts out in the future. To be honest I was just curious because of some of the reviews I read, but I thought it was just going to be a lazy side scroling game I'd try and stop within a couple hours. It seemed like my prediction was coming true for the first hour or two of the game, but man was I plesantly surprised to keep on playing.\n\nI'll start with my only cons: It's short, it can be difficult to learn or play if you're not paying good attention, and the inventory system and lack of any kind of map can make you feel lost at times.\n\nThe Pros HIGHLY over shadow its cons: Dark gritty humor, incredible soundtrack, brilliant writing, deep emontial connections with child abuse, addiction, loss, and many topics I have not seen in video games to this date. If your a gamer like me, this really is a must play. You will make difficult decisions with outcomes you probably won't expect.\n\nThis is now one of my favorite RPG's I've played and that's saying something. Especially for being a 2D side scroller.\nDO NOT give up because of the pace of the game until you get the bike! And by then you'll be hooked.\n\n10/10.

Don't expect the game to hold your hand in terms of story telling or level progression as grinding feels required for certain segments.

After the almost starwars-esqe introduction, you fight perverts, mutants, and your own inner demons.  All the while leaving the most memorable story from all the very strange people and places you end up visiting.\n\nThe characters lack a bit of plot, but add to the rediculousness of the whole game.  Many additions to the team are like, "oh hi I'm going to join you" or need to be hired by using the in game currency of porno mags.

Really.\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely amazing and will definitely evoke a little nostalgia for those who were fans of the Mother series. My personal favorite was Dandy Boy, which honestly made me jive a bit in my seat. There isn't a song that I didn't like in all honesty, and each one is used effectively, especially towards the end game.\n\nThe game's story was very enthralling and kept me coming back for more and more, ending up in long, long sessions where I'd just plow through areas in hopes to find even more quirky allies for my party. Don't grow too attached however, because this game has perma death. If you're like me then you'll retry the Russian Roulette section over and over until everyone in your party survives. And of course the game is very twisted in some aspects, but there are chunks of dark humor spread about like sprinkles on a scoop of blood flavored ice-cream.\n\nIt's good. Really good. I got it on sale for $5 and played it for 13 and a half hours, so I'd say I got my money's worth on this one.\n\nIf you like RPGs, dark humor, and an overall crushing atmosphere of despair and misery, then this is the game for you.","July 12, 2015","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My definition of good is always gauged with the question, "did it make me feel anything"?  If the answer is yes, then generally that game is pretty bad ♥♥♥.  It has and will always be my favorite aspect of gaming, but I digress.\n\nLisa made me feel, a lot in fact.  I sit here, a week out from playing it still thinking about it, and how in some ways I'm like that disgusting person, surrounded by those terrifying people, trying to find redemption for great regrets.\n\nIt's deep, it's terrifying, it's beautiful, it's atmospheric, it's witty, it's unrelenting loss, and it's freakin' hard.\nIf you've forgotten how to RPG, you’ll either figure it out here or you won’t get through the game.\nYou'll likely die a lot, and you may lose things at a moment’s notice, significant things.\n\nThis game isn't one of those "pretty good for an rpg maker" games, it's a must play as game period.\n\nThe artstyle in general is an Earthbound meets acid kind of feel.\n\nOutside of combat looks and plays like Super Mario Bros 2.  Stupid cliffs...\n\nInside combat is like Earthbound, with flashes of character animations which are really well done.\n\nThe music might be one of the most impressive things, not only was it completely unique, but it set the atmosphere better than most AAA games that I've played.  Kudos.\n\nc in an incredibly heavy story.\n\nThe only real gripes I had with the game was a lack of tutorial (I didn't know you could use truck keys until I was 3/4 into the game, so I had to do a lot of back-tracking), the controls are stuck in an awkward way, and some people might think the battles are a little drawn out, but I think it adds to the challenge and tension.\n\nI recommend this game 100% if you are in the right state of mind.\n\n10/10 Would lose everything again.\n\n","September 6, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

LISA will ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nLISA is the most emotionally and morally challenging game I have ever played. It will confuse you, make you laugh and make you cry like a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. I like playing games that force you to take moral decisions, but while in other games all you often get is a finger wag and the game telling you you're a bad person, LISA actually makes you feel the consequences of your decisions throughout the whole game.\n\nThe story of Brad, the protagonist in LISA, is the saddest story I've ever played, read or seen. Never have I felt so much pity for a fictional character.\nThe developer, Dingaling as he calls himself, proved that he is very talented when it comes to story writing and I am already eagerly awaiting his next project. The same goes for the OST, the music is among the best I've heard in a game, it fits the situations you find yourself in perfectly. It pumps you up in one moment and brutally throws you into existential dread or pure nostalgia the next.\n\nHonestly, I cannot recommend this game enough. The more I think about it, the more it's becoming one of my all-time favorites.\n\nPS: I would also advise everyone that wants to know more about the story to play the free game LISA: The First, it's not available on Steam, but it can be downloaded on the game's website. It´s very short but it gives you a lot of important information about the story that is only implied in the LISA: The Painful.","January 21","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Over 30 Unique party members that each offer something different with strategy-heavy gameplay (There is no OP or broken party memebers). Most of the choices that are made throughout the game are not for some excuse for showing one of many endings; but rather alter the gameplay, by taking away combos and decreasing the main characters attack or permanently killing off a crucial party member with no prior warning. There is no right or wrong in this game when it comes to choices. To summarise, LISA is a game with a very impressive atmosphere; It'll tell you a joke, make you laugh, then kick you in the balls. It'll force you to make choices that'll leave your stomach trembling and never goes easy on you. This game is incredible, and the fact that it was made in RPG Maker really goes to show that it doesn't matter how limitting the software or engine is, there are people that are creative, bold and willing to create something unique and near flawless.\n\nArt Style - Amazing\nMusic - Amazing\nStory - Amazing\nGameplay - Amazing\nWriting - Amazing\n\nIf you haven't bought this game yet, do yourself a favour and pick it up, if you are even remotely interested in RPG's than it will not dissapoint.","February 24, 2015","true","84.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obscenity can get bogged down in being too stupid, too shocking, too crass. In order to make obscenity into something meaningful, it needs coherence. Enough coherence to counterbalance the revulsion of the content. LISA, remarkably, navigates this balance beam.\n\nIt offers plenty of strange, dirty, cruel content, but all with context. The comedy's juxtaposition with the tragedy isn't just for contrast, it's works thematically as well. The lighthearted fantasy alongside cutthroat survival, both in world building and in gameplay, mesh entirely with the narrative's ultimate goals.\n\nBut this isn't a visual novel or something, it's a game too. And it's a fun, surprisingly balanced game, especially considering the single-man production. There are a ton of party members, and most of them feel distinct in theme as well as in gameplay. You can set up a team with lots of fun, powerful combinations, and there aren't too many ways to go wrong. Equipment upgrades are infrequent and expensive enough to feel meaningful. Resources both feel tight because of scarcity, and loose because of anticipated demise. Other than the occasional dark cave or grassy field, all battles are satisfyingly non-random. This kind of gameplay balance is tough for bigger games to manage, so it's a bit wondrous how well it works in LISA.\n\nI waited to buy LISA on sale, because we all have a backlog of games now. But I put it at the top of my que, and it was worth the favoritism. LISA was well developed enough, meaningful enough, and satisfying enough that I'd freely recommend it at the full $10 price tag. I have spent $10 more poorly many, many times.","August 21, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is hilarious, sad, uncomfortable, and terrifying, but always great and rarely goes too far with its subject matter (though be warned, it still goes far). Battles are simple, but satisfying with a combo system that allows some additional flexibility with battle strategy, a varied cast of party members to play with, the occasional looming threat of instant and unavoidable permadeath for your companions (don't worry, there's not *too* much shame in save-scumming), and an absolutely killer soundtrack to accompany it. The soundtrack is stellar all around, really; if you get this game, be sure to grab the Deluxe edition if only for that.\n\nIf you're looking for a light-hearted game, you might want to skip this one; even the humor is often firmly on the dark side (though it will give you a good fart joke or two).

Speedwagon","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048161849/","376 products in account","*WARNING* THIS GAME IS A SEQUEL TO A GAME CALLED 'LISA: THE FIRST', A MAJOR PLOTPOINT WILL BE CONFUSING AND MAKE NO SENCE, SO GO PLAY THAT.\n\nLISA is on the same par as classics like MOTHER 3 and FFVII, and this game is sure to go down in history as one of the greatest RPGs ever made. This game is brutal in every sense of the word, the game can be soul-crushingly challenging, gut-bustingly hilarious, and unfathomably depressing and somber. The game's strongest aspect is the fantastic story that  takes you on a grand quest to save your adopted daughter and shelter her from the cruel and unforgiving world that seeks to use her for its own gain. The game will constantly be throwing very heavy descisions at you, and unlike games like Mass Effect or The Walking Dead, your actions have very serous immediate and long term effects that change gameplay, the story, and the world as a whole. There are over 30 different followers for you to recruit on your journey, and it is incredibly easy to miss out on meeting new allies, and it's also incredibly easy to permanently loose them. Combat in this game is your somewhat standard turn-based RPG affair, but there are plenty of clever twists that make fighting more fun and memorable, like characters that input combos, build up a special meter, and characters who buff and heal the party. This game is somewhat bipolar, and the constant switching between (incredibly funnycomedy and tragedy makes the game a very surreal experience, and the mood whiplash can leave you completley flabbergasted. If i had any real problems with the game it would be the lack of a map, although you gain the ability to warp to and from specific zones, which somewhat help the issue. People who are easily lost or have no navigational abilities what-so-ever will have trouble navigating the world, and will end up very frustrated.\n\nPrepare your feel hole for complete and udder destruction. this is the single saddest experience i have ever felt, and ihave spent long sleepless nights staring into my ceiling, lost in thought. If you are emotionally unstable, this game WILL break you.\n\nTL;DR, I would give this game a 10/10, it is a masterpiece, and nearly every sprite has tiny cute nipples.\n\nTERRY HINTLORD IS BEST CHARACTER, CONFIRMED BY DEV","July 24, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

To keep this brief, LISA is a relatively short and brutal game that manages to surpass some of the greatest video game stories out there.  The faint of heart and easily offended need not apply.  Many, many risks were taken in the creation of the world portrayed in LISA, and in my opinion, those risks paid off bigtime.  I will support any future titles by Austin in the future, and would be overjoyed to see any new content in the LISA universe, even if it may not pick up where Brad's or Buddy's stories left off.  Absolutely 100% recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a deep and interesting story, a challenging game, or anyone who is looking to enjoy a game which captures the SNES-esque 16-bit pixel aesthetic perfectly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TisforTopher/recommended/335670/","TisforTopher","Misha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TisforTopher/","70 products in account","So, before I begin, I would like to thank Dingaling for providing a fresh and fun entry into the indie genre, one that has affected me and many others greatly, and hopefully will endure the test of time.\n\nI feel that the first thing I should do is address the drawing of parallels between Undertale and LISA. These games may share quite a bit, but it is absolutely NOT worth comparing the two, as they share completely different themes and gameplay focuses. Undertale's focus is more on gathering friendships and the value of those friendships. Undertale likes to be fair(so long as you are going pacifist), and will reward you for playing along. LISA is a take on how everything can be taken away from us in the blink of an eye, even if you DO play along. Choices you make will be difficult, they will have an effect on you in the moment, and will make your journey significantly more difficult, as you cannot avoid these decisions.\n\nIt's unfair.\n\nLife is unfair.\n\nI will now break down LISA into pros/cons like the good little reviewer I was born to be.\n\nPros:\n-Great soundtrack, I still listen to a few of the songs on my own time, and each area has it's own little (widdly2)diddly as you walk about and absorb the atmosphere.\n\n-Incredible atmosphere, LISA is hopeless, you will feel hopeless, but that's part of the enjoyment, the comedy given to you in the form of characters and wacky situations help raise your spirits to give you the motivation to continue on regardless.\n\n-Story(?), LISA easily has one of the most dark and inhuman storylines of any game I've ever had the pleasure of playing, it will destroy your sense of being and bring you back to the light only to send you back to hell. It makes you feel things. It's good.\n\n-Combat(?), Although many would say combat was the shortcoming of LISA, I actually found it a bit fun, it works on a basic WASD dial combo system to dial in skills for extra damage. If you were too lazy to learn the combos yourself, you could simply circumvent the dial combos and go straight to the skill menu. This feature was a blessing and a curse, the latter I will explain later.\n\n-Art, The art was nothing special to be honest, but it was definitely really good and the earthy tones really helped convey the tone Dingaling was going for.\n\nNow, onto our cons.\n\n-Difficulty Curve, LISA's main selling point may just be it's downfall. It's hard. This game was incredibly hard in it's beginning stages, albeit it becomes easier as the game goes on, it almost turned me off and has actually turned off many other players from continuing the game. Anyone who buys this needs to understand that you'll need to push past that first crossroads before the game picks up and you can actually fight things.\n\n-Combat(?), LISA's combat is a real crapshoot, you either like it or hate it, or who knows, you might be fine with it, but it definitely wasn't anything revolutionary and ESPECIALLY in the beginning stages it's tedious as hell and can really get frustrating to fight anything. It gets better later on, but as I said, the steep curve of this game turns players off right from the beginning without showing them a light at the end of the tunnel\n\n-Story(?), LISA's story is ♥♥♥♥ed up, and for the most people, hardly relateable. It's really dark and depending on your life experiences you will either become enthralled in it's world or be completely turned off by it's harshness. Really a matter of preference.\n\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ING CLIFFS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T\n\nOverall, I rate LISA:The Painful RPG a 8/10, could have been better on the mechanics side of thing, but overall an amazing title and a great addition to anyone's library.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are addicted to drugs but you love your baby and want to cover it from the world because there are no womens left on the world.You think this story is solid?Of course it is,and it's even more solid when you go further.I want to knowledge whole story of this game,I always care more about mechanics then about story because I like crafting,free world and stuff that are not included in this game but I love this game even if it don't have what I love.Why?\n\nHere are the Pros:\n+++very very very solid story\n+++humour is dark but in that way you will love it\n+++world is kinda open.It's not closed,you can back to certain locaction even very back or even back to beginning.World is huge,sometimes you will lost in this huge world.\n+++nice animations how you attack with characters in battles\n+++great,awesome soundtrack.You will not get tired of music because it's always changing,only in two or three locations the music is the same but every location have like own music.It's great,you not get tired because you listen to one dump song,you enjoy music because it's always changing and music fits the atmosphere of apocalypse-trash world.\n++if you jump from too high you will take a damage with is nice because it's realistic\n+nice platforming jumping system from higher to lower location.\n\nSo here are minor cons of this game:\n-sometimes you will fall down because you go too fast on a vehicle and need to repeat something because you don't save.\n-you need to back to certain location like 2-3 times.\n-you will lose like 6 companions after 7 hours of playing but you will have like 8 so it will be little pain.\n\n\nI rate this game 20/10 because I don't like this type of games but this game changed my point of view on this type of games.\n\nEdit:\nOk,so I end this game after 12 hours and must say it......For the first time I cried because of a history in a game.I hate games what makes me cries but w/e,I can cry if history is that good.","June 19, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It sets the player in the shoes of one Brad Armstrong in his morbid, fairly depressing voyage through a world of men. It's dark, but there are still plenty of moments of light to be found; little moments of humor, life, and hope that keep you from throwing your computer and yourself out the window. The atmosphere is desolate but rich with strange and interesting character and more possible gang members than you can count on one hand. It's a tragedy where the only ending is sorrow, and one can't help but find themselves caught up in the strangeness of the land of Olathe.\nLisa: The Joyful, on the other hand, takes place as a sequel; it comes off as a bit more emotionally mature throughout and darker in tone, but still managed to keep me invested throughout. You play as Buddy, the young girl Brad searches for throughout the previous game, on her quest for... freedom, I suppose, would be the best word. Freedom from anyone daring to control her, freedom from anyone trying to shelter her, freedom from a vicious cycle passed down through a thoroughly messed up family. In the end it helped deepen my understanding of the characters and the world while still leaving me with questions, both for in the game and out.\nOverall, I'd recommend getting LISA if you're a fan of well-made RPG Maker style RPGs, deep moral thoughts and issues, dark storylines, and a fascinating world after an unusual apocalypse.","December 23, 2015","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

LISA will ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nLISA is the most emotionally and morally challenging game I have ever played. It will confuse you, make you laugh and make you cry like a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. I like playing games that force you to take moral decisions, but while in other games all you often get is a finger wag and the game telling you you're a bad person, LISA actually makes you feel the consequences of your decisions throughout the whole game.\n\nThe story of Brad, the protagonist in LISA, is the saddest story I've ever played, read or seen. Never have I felt so much pity for a fictional character.\nThe developer, Dingaling as he calls himself, proved that he is very talented when it comes to story writing and I am already eagerly awaiting his next project. The same goes for the OST, the music is among the best I've heard in a game, it fits the situations you find yourself in perfectly. It pumps you up in one moment and brutally throws you into existential dread or pure nostalgia the next.\n\nHonestly, I cannot recommend this game enough. The more I think about it, the more it's becoming one of my all-time favorites.\n\nPS: I would also advise everyone that wants to know more about the story to play the free game LISA: The First, it's not available on Steam, but it can be downloaded on the game's website. It´s very short but it gives you a lot of important information about the story that is only implied in the LISA: The Painful.","January 21","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obscenity can get bogged down in being too stupid, too shocking, too crass. In order to make obscenity into something meaningful, it needs coherence. Enough coherence to counterbalance the revulsion of the content. LISA, remarkably, navigates this balance beam.\n\nIt offers plenty of strange, dirty, cruel content, but all with context. The comedy's juxtaposition with the tragedy isn't just for contrast, it's works thematically as well. The lighthearted fantasy alongside cutthroat survival, both in world building and in gameplay, mesh entirely with the narrative's ultimate goals.\n\nBut this isn't a visual novel or something, it's a game too. And it's a fun, surprisingly balanced game, especially considering the single-man production. There are a ton of party members, and most of them feel distinct in theme as well as in gameplay. You can set up a team with lots of fun, powerful combinations, and there aren't too many ways to go wrong. Equipment upgrades are infrequent and expensive enough to feel meaningful. Resources both feel tight because of scarcity, and loose because of anticipated demise. Other than the occasional dark cave or grassy field, all battles are satisfyingly non-random. This kind of gameplay balance is tough for bigger games to manage, so it's a bit wondrous how well it works in LISA.\n\nI waited to buy LISA on sale, because we all have a backlog of games now. But I put it at the top of my que, and it was worth the favoritism. LISA was well developed enough, meaningful enough, and satisfying enough that I'd freely recommend it at the full $10 price tag. I have spent $10 more poorly many, many times.","August 21, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knoche/recommended/335670/","knoche","Rasputin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knoche/","90 products in account","Easily one of the best games I've ever played. It has an unique style, and it sure delivers. It can be really sad, terrifying or downright hilarious, but it's always deep. Even in funny moments, dark humor, satire or grotesque situations make you laugh and think at the same time, nothing pass unnoticed. It really touches some REALLY (and I mean REALLY) complicated issues, like child abuse, abusive parents, heavy drug use and how it affects relationships, and even some really twisted stuff. If you like this kind of game and are up for a rather odd yet amazing journey, this is most definitely your game.\n\nIf you care about it, I can point the pros and cons:\n\nPROS\n>Superb story\n>Nice level design, really original sometimes. Even landscapes makes you laugh sometimes!\n>Amazing humor, seriously if you love dark humor this is a most buy\n>Great soundtrack, similar to Hotline Miami (just not as good)\n>Complex moral issues, touched in a really humane and sensitive way. Everything happens seen through the messed up eyes of the diferent people in this world, everyone with some really intense lifes, to say the least.\n>A lot of companions and diversity in general\n>The art style was odd at the beginning to be honest, but its so well made that I love it now.\n\nCONS\n>Edges are completely non forgiving, and ropes are near edges sometimes. There is no quicksave nor autosave so it can end bad. And it will of course, but I reckon it was made on purpose just to mess with you just a little more. It's really rage inducing tho.\n>Just as a warning: yes, it can be really hard, unforgiving and tedious sometimes. All I can say is: get good. Don't be defeated by a game you pleb, you are better than that.\n\n\n\nNow, it IS true that the ending is kind of cut into a DLC. But I personaly don't agree with that because this game in particular is Brad's journey with his problems, completely diferent to The Joyful story plot. So, its more like the global ending is a DLC but this game alone isn't focused on nothing more than Brad.","January 1","true","45.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Painful is right, as you adventure with Brad to save his adopted daughter you'll struggle with addiction, meet characters who have been through hell, maybe even watch some of your favorite ones die before you. Worst of all you'll feel like a lot of it will be your fault as LISA forces you to make tough decisions with no right answer; dismemberment or death? Sacrifice all your items or sacrifice your only friend? The story is a simple and personal one. There's no world to save, just a very important girl. It hits hard and it's wonderfully engaging. You'll always want to know what happens next. Having said that, it isn't always so downtrodden in tone. LISA also manages to work a lot of humour into its setting and characters. A bunch of middle aged men doing bad Power Rangers impressions, the Mexican guy whose main attributes are crying and hitting enemies with a truck and so much more.\n\nThe story is complimented by a soundtrack that is often sombre and occasional lighthearted, thus it fits the mood of the environments and the events perfectly.\n\nOf course there's more to the game than the story. The gameplay is great for those who like turn based RPGS, especially Earthbound as this game is heavily inspired by it. Though there is more to the combat than just "choose enemy, choose attack." The different character, and there are a lot of different characters, have different combat styles. For Brad's attacks you have to input button combinations for example. Outside of combat the gameplay is very simple. You mostly just move left and right without any platforming. Moreoever the story and combat are meshed together very well. Certain choices you make will affect how characters behave in combat. It's difficult to say without spoiling it. One example is that  you may chose to save a friend or have on of Brad's arms removed. After the amputation Brad loses a lot of his powerful combos, since he now only has one arm.\n\nTo summarise, LISA is a tough experience that'll make you laugh and maybe cry. It'll make you feel like ♥♥♥♥ at times but you'll always want to come back for more because of the endearing characters that yuo'll no doubt want to see succeed.","May 8","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the almost starwars-esqe introduction, you fight perverts, mutants, and your own inner demons.  All the while leaving the most memorable story from all the very strange people and places you end up visiting.\n\nThe characters lack a bit of plot, but add to the rediculousness of the whole game.  Many additions to the team are like, "oh hi I'm going to join you" or need to be hired by using the in game currency of porno mags.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TisforTopher/recommended/335670/","TisforTopher","Misha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TisforTopher/","70 products in account","So, before I begin, I would like to thank Dingaling for providing a fresh and fun entry into the indie genre, one that has affected me and many others greatly, and hopefully will endure the test of time.\n\nI feel that the first thing I should do is address the drawing of parallels between Undertale and LISA. These games may share quite a bit, but it is absolutely NOT worth comparing the two, as they share completely different themes and gameplay focuses. Undertale's focus is more on gathering friendships and the value of those friendships. Undertale likes to be fair(so long as you are going pacifist), and will reward you for playing along. LISA is a take on how everything can be taken away from us in the blink of an eye, even if you DO play along. Choices you make will be difficult, they will have an effect on you in the moment, and will make your journey significantly more difficult, as you cannot avoid these decisions.\n\nIt's unfair.\n\nLife is unfair.\n\nI will now break down LISA into pros/cons like the good little reviewer I was born to be.\n\nPros:\n-Great soundtrack, I still listen to a few of the songs on my own time, and each area has it's own little (widdly2)diddly as you walk about and absorb the atmosphere.\n\n-Incredible atmosphere, LISA is hopeless, you will feel hopeless, but that's part of the enjoyment, the comedy given to you in the form of characters and wacky situations help raise your spirits to give you the motivation to continue on regardless.\n\n-Story(?), LISA easily has one of the most dark and inhuman storylines of any game I've ever had the pleasure of playing, it will destroy your sense of being and bring you back to the light only to send you back to hell. It makes you feel things. It's good.\n\n-Combat(?), Although many would say combat was the shortcoming of LISA, I actually found it a bit fun, it works on a basic WASD dial combo system to dial in skills for extra damage. If you were too lazy to learn the combos yourself, you could simply circumvent the dial combos and go straight to the skill menu. This feature was a blessing and a curse, the latter I will explain later.\n\n-Art, The art was nothing special to be honest, but it was definitely really good and the earthy tones really helped convey the tone Dingaling was going for.\n\nNow, onto our cons.\n\n-Difficulty Curve, LISA's main selling point may just be it's downfall. It's hard. This game was incredibly hard in it's beginning stages, albeit it becomes easier as the game goes on, it almost turned me off and has actually turned off many other players from continuing the game. Anyone who buys this needs to understand that you'll need to push past that first crossroads before the game picks up and you can actually fight things.\n\n-Combat(?), LISA's combat is a real crapshoot, you either like it or hate it, or who knows, you might be fine with it, but it definitely wasn't anything revolutionary and ESPECIALLY in the beginning stages it's tedious as hell and can really get frustrating to fight anything. It gets better later on, but as I said, the steep curve of this game turns players off right from the beginning without showing them a light at the end of the tunnel\n\n-Story(?), LISA's story is ♥♥♥♥ed up, and for the most people, hardly relateable. It's really dark and depending on your life experiences you will either become enthralled in it's world or be completely turned off by it's harshness. Really a matter of preference.\n\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ING CLIFFS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T\n\nOverall, I rate LISA:The Painful RPG a 8/10, could have been better on the mechanics side of thing, but overall an amazing title and a great addition to anyone's library.\n\n","November 12, 2015","true","49.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFreakinLonah/recommended/335670/","TheFreakinLonah","[TTRASHB] Lönah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFreakinLonah/","306 products in account","LISA is a Kickstarter RPGMaker game by Austin "Dingaling" Jorgensen, and it fargoes typical RPG gameplay and presentation.  You play Brad Armstrong, a drug addicted ex-martial arts teacher who finds the last female on the planet in the form of a baby girl.  Years pass and she gets kidnapped by raiders, who are going to "use" her to save the human race. So it's up to Brad and the 27 party members who you can recruit (and lose) to find Buddy and bring her home.\n\nI've played a lot of RPGs and LISA brings a lot to the table for me, a lot of people point out the obvious influence of Earthbound had on this game, in terms of the graphics and silly humor and it really adds to the charm of the game for me as both of them contrast the darker parts of this game so much. The pacing and delivery of the story in this game are both expertly done, the story really kept me invested for the whole ride, the story takes many twists and turns, and makes you question if you really ARE the good guy in this story. The presentation is great as well, the music is strange, bizarre, and great, the soundtrack is one of my favorite things in this game, and all the party members have their own quirks and unique sidequests to unlock them, my favorite being entering a wrestling league with the "Shocklord", based on Fred Ottoman from the WWE, who is a wrestler famed for screwing up his dramatic entrance every time. All the other enemies and characters have charm of their own, such as the Karate Masters hidden throughout the game, and a group of Power Ranger cosplayers.\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat reminiscient of Barkley, Shut Up and Slam: Gaiden, it has a similar combo system for some characters, you can use the WASD keys in certain combinations to use various basic attacks, followed by the respective move, all these moves are easily viewable at any time by going to skills, as it will show you the combination to use, other characters use abilities by just selecting the ability, should they not have combos. On top of combos, party members can have TP, which regenerates as they take and deal damage, or addiction, which requires you to feed their addiction of Joy or else their stats are reduced. The fights flow very well and there isn't any need for grinding, which is a real breath of fresh air, there are only 4 areas in the game with random encounters, and the mobs there aren't worth grinding, the way fights are handeled is very similar to Chrono Trigger, you're able to see the enemies, and fight them as such.  It's a very streamlined, polished way of handeling encounters in general.\n\nAs for complaints, I don't have much, the party members are reduced to one-note in terms of personality, like "The Guy Who Talks A Lot" and "The Football Player".  The humor can be a bit disjointed as well, for instance, you find a man trying to poop, but is terrified by a spider, then right after that, you're forced to choose between chopping your arm off and saving a party member's life, and then, again, right after that, you get attacked by a man with no eyes, making eye puns to the death. But as far as complaints go, that's it, I really enjoy this game, and I'd recommend it to RPG fans, or just people looking for a great story.\n\n","August 20, 2015","true","29.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Brad Armstrong is one of the greatest protagonists in video game history simply due to his raw emotion. Brad is a human, and isn't just some macho space marine, or an action hero. He is the epitome of a broken man. Lisa the Painful, if I had to give it any rating is a perfect 10 out 10.

Don't expect the game to hold your hand in terms of story telling or level progression as grinding feels required for certain segments.

First off, if you have no idea what this game is about and want to find out more watch the trailer. Don't go to the negative reviews. People with 30 minutes of gameplay say some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for no reason without reasonable arguements.\n\nAnyways, like everyone has said the game is inspired by Earthbound. If you're familiar with Earthbound then you'll quickly grasp the combat system. The game is kinda difficult, I struggled at some certain parts but in my first run I did way better than I expected. The story is amazing and really emotional. Austin (the developer) has done an amazing job with the plot and apart from all the emotion the humor in this game is just ... amazing.\nThe game isn't gonna go easy on you. I realised that in the first hour. You're gonna need to make choices, important choices. You need to think of the correct choices that benefit your main character and that was harsh for someone like me who likes to have many companions.\nUp so far, Lisa is for me the best game I've played in 2015 (We will see if Lisa the Joyful can top this game).

It is hilarious, sad, uncomfortable, and terrifying, but always great and rarely goes too far with its subject matter (though be warned, it still goes far). Battles are simple, but satisfying with a combo system that allows some additional flexibility with battle strategy, a varied cast of party members to play with, the occasional looming threat of instant and unavoidable permadeath for your companions (don't worry, there's not *too* much shame in save-scumming), and an absolutely killer soundtrack to accompany it. The soundtrack is stellar all around, really; if you get this game, be sure to grab the Deluxe edition if only for that.\n\nIf you're looking for a light-hearted game, you might want to skip this one; even the humor is often firmly on the dark side (though it will give you a good fart joke or two).

To keep this brief, LISA is a relatively short and brutal game that manages to surpass some of the greatest video game stories out there.  The faint of heart and easily offended need not apply.  Many, many risks were taken in the creation of the world portrayed in LISA, and in my opinion, those risks paid off bigtime.  I will support any future titles by Austin in the future, and would be overjoyed to see any new content in the LISA universe, even if it may not pick up where Brad's or Buddy's stories left off.  Absolutely 100% recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a deep and interesting story, a challenging game, or anyone who is looking to enjoy a game which captures the SNES-esque 16-bit pixel aesthetic perfectly.

It seemed kind of "out there" and just didn't seem like something I'd be interested in. I'm glad that I decided to keep going after playing through the tutorial, because I became hooked very quickly after that point. What I initially expected to be a shallow experience turned out to be a surprisingly deep game.\n\nThe setting of the game is post-apocalyptic, which has been done time and time again, but the thing that makes Lisa interesting is that it takes the concept of a post-apocalypse and adds a twist to it that makes it pretty unique as far as game settings go. The entire world is seemingly devoid of women. As the story progressed and I began to learn more about the characters, I was hungry for more and I found myself unable to stop playing.\n\nThe story alone would've kept me going, but the combat is also surprisingly fun. There are a large variety of unique party compositions you can choose from, which gives the game great replay value. I'll definitely be playing it again to try out different combinations of characters.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that I found interesting, though I can understand why some would not like it, was the inclusion of perma-death. There are certain enemy abilities, though used rarely in most cases, that can and will permanently kill your companions. Terrible things can also happen to your party while you sleep, which to me makes the setting seem more dangerous and mysterious, adding to the grim atmosphere. It isn't often that I become immersed in games, but I did with this one.\n\nIf you like RPGs, definitely play this. Even if you aren't normally a fan of RPGs, I think this changes the formula up enough to be interesting to non-RPG fans as well. It's fairly short, so it doesn't drag on at all and there is minimal to no grinding.  It's a great game, and it definitely deserves more attention. Totally worth the price.

On the surface, it seems like yet another RPG but the story is incredibly disturbing. This game does not pull punches; talking freely about tough subjects like cross dressing, ♥♥♥♥, suicide and other dark topics. When one of the minigames is Russian Roulette where you must sacrifice a party member for potential money, you can't help but feel like an enabler. The game revolves around an apocalpyse with no women around and no way to humanity to survive. The sudden mention of a girl being alive sparks a war where brothers are willing to kill one another for a chance of their genes being passed on.

All women have gone extinct, leaving humanity to rot as the world slowly crumbles. All women, except the baby that fell into your hands. Once she goes missing, you vow to do whatever it takes to get her back, even if it means your life. And then, the game starts.\n\nOne of the only times in a video game where I laughed with utter amusement and choked up a little within 20 minutes of each other, it is truly an experience that can't be missed.

The purpose is clear but when I say "what the f**k is going on" my meaning is this crazy, spiralling out of control world with its many freaks and weirdo's. With progression, we are met with some of these colorful people and I am left in a state of utter intrigue, the thing this game does so very right is imaginative characters brought to life by the developer.\n\nAs I am driven forward by this singular purpose, I find myself growing attached to this protagonist, a shadow of a former man, much like the world and it being a shadow of its former self. He is a sad life, one of great loss, but is possessed almost to push forward in the bleakness of what he searches for, the last thing that tethers him to this world.\n\nOnly one other thing can match this compelling story and imaginative world and that is the music within it, each new section we are greeted with a new and original piece of music, which indirectly aids me in continuing on and is delightful to be heard upon entering a new unexplored place.\n\nIt is rare that a game compels me into playing it for such a span of time where I find myself losing track of it, this game manages to do just that. LISA the painful has its dark and humorous moments often intertwining the two, ultra-violent and explicit content, but if you are like-minded and see beneath the mask that covers LISA the painful and know that the deeper story is one of purpose and devotion, then this game will not disappoint. These are the components that make up the world of LISA the painful and without them, the game would fall short of the masterpiece it is.\n\nI cannot convey to you how creative this world and story is, that's something you must experience for yourself.","January 13","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

LISA is a game about sacrifice in an insane world filled with less than pleasant things. Nobody's really the good guy or the bad guy, death is everywhere and the only real constant, and things may not be getting any better no matter what you do.\n\nSo just ride with it, do what you think should be done, try to stay true to something and have it be your choice. Even if it's a terribly sucky choice that you have absolutely no control over and will end badly. Because that's what LISA's all about. Choices, but often forced by those who really should have made better ones earlier.\n\nGameplay-wise, LISA is a turn-based quirky game filled with humor both surreal and pitch black. Lots of replay value in the many many party members you have allowing you to take different folks through the game where necessary to make different choices from your last run. If you choose to experience every possible route. Though that said there aren't many huge differences from each route, and despite the ethical feelings these choices can lead to, ultimately they're just different kinds of sacrifices that don't lead to some kind of end all golden ending. It plays well and is super challenging, forcing you to adapt quickly and not focus on just grinding things out but instead exploring as much as you can while confronting the insane denizens around you and probably killing them all horribly in the process.\n\nStrongly recommended unless you have a weak stomach, this is a game that will stomp all over you even if you're ready for it. The title screen is of the titual character Lisa already dead and hanging, it's just going to get worse from there. Much much worse.","December 27, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are one of these Joy takers, a man named Brad. Brad finds a baby, the baby is a girl. This is where the story and obscenely\ndifficult choices to protect her innocence begin.\n\nSounds depressing? It is, this games ending broke me. It was beautiful and left me with many emotions days after playing. Why do I recommend this game? Mostly the fantastic dialogue melded into the story using both dark humour, and weighty choices.\n\nThe gameplay is very simplistic but organic enough to encourage multiple playthroughs, sporting a challenge mode and many recruitable followers. The overworld gameplay is platforming, both walking and riding a suprisingly durable bike will help you traverse the terrain, the battle mechanics are the simplistic turn-based battles seen in the Earthbound series. The combat never got old in the 9-14 hours of gameplay mostly due to the imput of certain keys to create powerful combos with certain characters.\n\nThe music, while somewhat repetitious in a few places is fantasic, yet it almost feels ill fitting of the game you are playing due to the strangeness of the world; yet at the same time it somehow comes together to create something absurdly beautiful.\n\nThe game is stylised in a matter very familar to Earthbound players, yet I would say it works a lot better here. Brad is a warped individual and this is often shown in flashbacks and hallucinations leaving you not knowing for sure if the many characters are always what they seem to be. Colourful, creative and often frightening, they do their job very well.\n\nThe game does however have a few minor flaws. The options and key binding menu is a little ugly and unintuitive, some of the bosses can feel luck based at times leading to some frustratiton.\n\nThank you for reading this review, I really hope it convinces you to buy this fantastic game!\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a Joy addict.\n\nI lived a life with my abusive father, and my sister killed herself.\n\nThe women have gone. All of them. We do not know why or where.\n\nI live with my three friends, and we would drink and take Joy and try to wait out the end. However, one day, I found a child. A young girl. With black hair. My little buddy. We agreed between the four of us that we would raise her alone, away from the men who would take her and hurt her and destroy her for their own selfish reasons.\n\nWe were happy, I think. One day I went to go and take drugs and Buddy was gone. Someone had found out. My friends were either gone or dead. I will not let anyone hurt her, I will not let anyone take her from me.\n\nI begin to find friends in this world; a man obsessed with his chickens, a tiger man looking for a better master, a man who missed his wife, a magician who joined me for a deck of cards and a man who drank to forget the world, and others.\n\nI would later met the Devil and kill him. My innocent actions would murder many. I would have to choose between my flesh and my needs. I weighed each pill I took in my misery. I would become a wrestling champion. I would meet the Red Skull.

Take the role as Brad Armstrong, a broken man who's addicted to a drug known as "Joy," and try to survive in what the world has become after the extinction of female humans, trying to find your "daughter," who has been kidnapped by the Rando Army. Make a band of allies, motorcycles.\n\nI really liked this game. It's your standard turn-based RPG, but with the feature of dial combos with other characters. Lots of companions to have on your side, story that gets pretty deep and dark, and very well-made soundtrack. All of this for 10$... I would honestly say it's not worth it. If it were to go down to 5$-7$ instead, then it is totally worth it. Expect 8-15 hours of gameplay\n\nTHINGS TO FREAK OUT ABOUT:\n-Using Joy\n-Your decisions\nTHINGS TO NOT FREAK OUT ABOUT:\n-Losing companions\n\nIf you're getting this game because everyone is saying "It's like Earthbound," then you're making a mistake. I'd say it's actually VERY different to Earthbound, in fact. It doesn't have any of the RPG mechanics or even worldlayout like Earthbound. If anything, LISA: The Painful is like Earthbound trilogy wise. Yes, this game has three games: "LISA: The First," "LISA: The Painful," and "LISA: The Joyful (DLC Sequel)." I only recommend "LISA: The First" if you liked Yumme Nikki","January 30","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hell, any media like this is impossible to find it seems. It is what it is, it's very plain about that. It refuses to tell you what to feel. It does not coddle your feelings. It will ♥♥♥♥ you up, and you will enjoy every bit of it.\n\nFor me at least, where other story-rich games fall short is their utter dishonesty about humanity. This game tells a story that, with an adjustment of setting and situation of course, could be found in the real world. A story of perversion, of addiction, of violence, of insanity. It is relatable because of that. Undertale displays humanity through the mind of an immature 13-year-old: it is always good in the end, there is good in everyone, etc. And that is a blatant lie.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is something I have never encountered before, the utter insanity of it was comforting, in a weird way. It did so well with so little that you can't help but smirk when finding a few select areas. The artstyle of the game contributed to this immensely, being uneasily cheery given the situation.\n\nThe story of the game is barebones, but impeccably done. Brad is, as stated by the game, a broken man. A childhood of abuse lay behind him, and the haunting visions of his past consume him. He looks for redemption, gives his body and life for it, and still he gets nothing. There is something to be learned in that.\n\nThe music was pretty damn good. It is something of a drug-laced version of rave music and just works so well with the overall direction of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is this games shortcoming, however, as it is an RPG-Maker game. If you have decent experience with computer gaming however those aren't that much of problems. The game itself is a bit clunky, the controls can really ♥♥♥♥ you off, especially in Pain mode. Nothing like spending an hour in game then losing it all after walking off of a cliff.\n\nOverall, this is an EXCELLENT sophomore production from Dingaling, and even more impressive considering that this was made by one person. I give it a solid 9/10, and worth anyone's time if they have it to be spared.\n\nOh, and joy is never what it seems.","January 24","true","48.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has some dark and deep subjects matters. But for those who can enjoy a thought provoking game with dark humor, this is a must buy. Lisa the Painful is a game about a man named brad. He's a recovering drug addict  who lives in a post apocalyptic world that lacks women. One day while out on a daily stroll brad comes across a baby. After checking the baby's gender brad realizes he's come across the last girl in existence. One of his friends recommends that he give the baby up, but he decides to keep it and raise it as his own. One day after a walk brad finds that his adopted daughter  had been captured by a group that plan on repopulating the earth.\nGame play wise, battling is your average RPG affair, but what Lisa changes is your party member's, there's a lot of them, and they're all really expendable, when you start to feel an emotional attachment to a character, there's nothing more sad than seeing them die.\nThis game also has a lot of eater eggs, like a lot of them. I mean after 3 or 4 play throughs there's still a lot to see.\nI'll have to give Lisa a 10/10. It was one of the best games of 2015.

LISA is a game about sacrifice in an insane world filled with less than pleasant things. Nobody's really the good guy or the bad guy, death is everywhere and the only real constant, and things may not be getting any better no matter what you do.\n\nSo just ride with it, do what you think should be done, try to stay true to something and have it be your choice. Even if it's a terribly sucky choice that you have absolutely no control over and will end badly. Because that's what LISA's all about. Choices, but often forced by those who really should have made better ones earlier.\n\nGameplay-wise, LISA is a turn-based quirky game filled with humor both surreal and pitch black. Lots of replay value in the many many party members you have allowing you to take different folks through the game where necessary to make different choices from your last run. If you choose to experience every possible route. Though that said there aren't many huge differences from each route, and despite the ethical feelings these choices can lead to, ultimately they're just different kinds of sacrifices that don't lead to some kind of end all golden ending. It plays well and is super challenging, forcing you to adapt quickly and not focus on just grinding things out but instead exploring as much as you can while confronting the insane denizens around you and probably killing them all horribly in the process.\n\nStrongly recommended unless you have a weak stomach, this is a game that will stomp all over you even if you're ready for it. The title screen is of the titual character Lisa already dead and hanging, it's just going to get worse from there. Much much worse.","December 27, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though it's on sale right now I would buy this game for the full price with no question. This RPG is like nothing you have played before. It's a dark, yet hilariously written story with so much charm and attention to detail that I can't wait for anything this developer puts out in the future. To be honest I was just curious because of some of the reviews I read, but I thought it was just going to be a lazy side scroling game I'd try and stop within a couple hours. It seemed like my prediction was coming true for the first hour or two of the game, but man was I plesantly surprised to keep on playing.\n\nI'll start with my only cons: It's short, it can be difficult to learn or play if you're not paying good attention, and the inventory system and lack of any kind of map can make you feel lost at times.\n\nThe Pros HIGHLY over shadow its cons: Dark gritty humor, incredible soundtrack, brilliant writing, deep emontial connections with child abuse, addiction, loss, and many topics I have not seen in video games to this date. If your a gamer like me, this really is a must play. You will make difficult decisions with outcomes you probably won't expect.\n\nThis is now one of my favorite RPG's I've played and that's saying something. Especially for being a 2D side scroller.\nDO NOT give up because of the pace of the game until you get the bike! And by then you'll be hooked.\n\n10/10.

The art, crazy music, and combat system is a throwback to earthbound days and it manages to also grab your heart and throw it in a pit, stomp on it repeatedly, then make you laugh again with a dark joke or two just after.\n\nAs great as the game is, it does have it's shortcomings, combat can be extremely repetitive, you can beat the entire game with just Brad if you want, but where is the fun in that? This game encourages you to explore all of your options and to really dig for the details, just be wary of the repetitive combat.\n\nAnd the developer, Austin, props to you for managing to come up with a wide array of memorable characters and that unique as hell soundtrack.

Interface problems aside (controls are kind of cumbersome, controller support is... not great), this is an experience worth having.\n\nThe designer was really creative with the scenarios and situations the game puts you in - there are lots of interesting choices and dark moments. The "setpieces", if I can call them as such, were really effective. One great positive is that the game don't bind itself to rpg "rules". There are unfair moments, there are moments where the difficulty curve kinda doesn't make sense (both to the easy and to the difficult side), but all of it contributes to the opressing atmosphere.\n\nThe amount of curveballs, traps, wrong decisions you can make is staggering, and the game doesn't become impossible or unbeatable because of it, which is a great achievement.\n\nIf you really want a dark story and a heavy experience (I can't even play long sessions, the atmosphere really becomes exhausting at points), I absolutely recommend LISA.","March 24","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Among the many different games I played, Rpg's were always around since the beginning of time. This game reminds me alot of dragon quest combat with other mixed features. The gameplay is good, the combat plays out like it should, but it is the type of game that punishes the user severely for making bad decisions. The boss fights are hard and I would not reccomend it to anyone who has no experience with old school Rpg formats. SAVE FREQUENTLY\n\nSecondly this game really shines for me with the writing. Dude-man-guy who wrote the story for this game, you are a legend. Its funny, its sad, its angry, its brutal, LISA is a powerhouse of ♥♥♥♥ing emotion and disaster. The game has many easter eggs and hidden quests/ things to find and do. The further I got into it the more I got sucked into the characters. The game has a really wide array of party members you can recruit. I have to start over 5 more times just to try all the party combinations I considered.\n\nFor the love of LISA try this game, its a throwback to the greats but with added bravado and a bizarre, amazing story to tug you along.","February 12","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Painful is right, as you adventure with Brad to save his adopted daughter you'll struggle with addiction, meet characters who have been through hell, maybe even watch some of your favorite ones die before you. Worst of all you'll feel like a lot of it will be your fault as LISA forces you to make tough decisions with no right answer; dismemberment or death? Sacrifice all your items or sacrifice your only friend? The story is a simple and personal one. There's no world to save, just a very important girl. It hits hard and it's wonderfully engaging. You'll always want to know what happens next. Having said that, it isn't always so downtrodden in tone. LISA also manages to work a lot of humour into its setting and characters. A bunch of middle aged men doing bad Power Rangers impressions, the Mexican guy whose main attributes are crying and hitting enemies with a truck and so much more.\n\nThe story is complimented by a soundtrack that is often sombre and occasional lighthearted, thus it fits the mood of the environments and the events perfectly.\n\nOf course there's more to the game than the story. The gameplay is great for those who like turn based RPGS, especially Earthbound as this game is heavily inspired by it. Though there is more to the combat than just "choose enemy, choose attack." The different character, and there are a lot of different characters, have different combat styles. For Brad's attacks you have to input button combinations for example. Outside of combat the gameplay is very simple. You mostly just move left and right without any platforming. Moreoever the story and combat are meshed together very well. Certain choices you make will affect how characters behave in combat. It's difficult to say without spoiling it. One example is that  you may chose to save a friend or have on of Brad's arms removed. After the amputation Brad loses a lot of his powerful combos, since he now only has one arm.\n\nTo summarise, LISA is a tough experience that'll make you laugh and maybe cry. It'll make you feel like ♥♥♥♥ at times but you'll always want to come back for more because of the endearing characters that yuo'll no doubt want to see succeed.","May 8","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Among the many different games I played, Rpg's were always around since the beginning of time. This game reminds me alot of dragon quest combat with other mixed features. The gameplay is good, the combat plays out like it should, but it is the type of game that punishes the user severely for making bad decisions. The boss fights are hard and I would not reccomend it to anyone who has no experience with old school Rpg formats. SAVE FREQUENTLY\n\nSecondly this game really shines for me with the writing. Dude-man-guy who wrote the story for this game, you are a legend. Its funny, its sad, its angry, its brutal, LISA is a powerhouse of ♥♥♥♥ing emotion and disaster. The game has many easter eggs and hidden quests/ things to find and do. The further I got into it the more I got sucked into the characters. The game has a really wide array of party members you can recruit. I have to start over 5 more times just to try all the party combinations I considered.\n\nFor the love of LISA try this game, its a throwback to the greats but with added bravado and a bizarre, amazing story to tug you along.","February 12","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
