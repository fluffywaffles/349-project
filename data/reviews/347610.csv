However for the price you can't go wrong with this bundle with 4 Hog games for one low price.\n\nEternal Journey - Good game with decent graphics, also a travel map with hints to what locations have stuff to do in them. Also good soundtrack and pretty good voice overs.\n\nDark Strokes-Sins of the Father- Decent graphics and the storyline is pretty good. I have played this game before and am enjoying it again years later. There is a map but no fast travel or hints to tell you where to go next.\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors-The Palm of Zorcaster- I did not replay this one as I have it in my Steam library from a while ago ( I have the Collectors Edition which is still available on Steam). It is a great game with a good story line. I have always loved the House of 1000 Doors Games. Can't comment on map travel or location hints due to not replaying it.\n\nStray Souls-Dollhouse Story- the graphics in this one are really outdated. It comes across on my widescreen as a bit pixelated but still playable. The story is interesting and again no map or location hints.\n\nOverall a good bundle for the price. However no achievements are available for any of the games adn none of them are Collector's editions with bonus content such as extra chapters.","October 7, 2015","true","10.9"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","52","63","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/347610/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","After the 5 in 1 bundle, Alawar released anoth batch of hidden objects, though this time, they released only three new games on Steam. Indeed, House of 1000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster was already released as a Collector's Edition. It means that for anyone already owning it, it's not a complete surprise. However, for the rest, it's a nice addition.\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster\n\nKate Reed is called back to the House of 1000 Doors: a gem spread a plague in it and every resident, particulary Gabriel, is in a grave danger...\n\nYou understand, this game is the second in a series of four (the first is also on Steam) but you don't need to play the previous one to understand the universe.\n\nWhile the game is pretty standard in terms of gameplay, what's great in that game is the universe itself: you're travelling between different worlds, through the house. And this time, you'll learn more about Gabriel, the guardian of the house. The graphics are very good too, which is pleasant.\n\nFor more information, read this review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/302120\n\nEternal Journey: New Atlantis\n\nAfter an accident, you're waking up into the future, thanks to new technologies and because your knowledge was important. You don't know what happened to your fiancé, making you sad about your new life. Sent to a mission in space, you're crashing into a planet... How will you manage to save yourself? And will you discovered what happened to a previous crew of the base?\n\nWhen the game is showing clearly a sci-fi adventure in space, you don't understand why you're beginning in the present, with an underwater experience. However, given the twist at the beginning of the story, I feel like this part could have been avoided. However, the rest of the game is very faithful to the sci-fi theme. You're arriving into an abandoned base and your journey will be full of dangers, though at the end, a familiar face will appear. The gameplay isn't innovative as it's the same as any other hidden games.\n\nIn other words, you search for items, you use them, you clear hidden objects scenes and you solve puzzles. Everything is pretty easy. You can search also memory cards, explaining about the future. And with all the video cards around, you can also know more about life on New Atlantis and the secrets hidden there.\n\nHowever, what I loved with this game is the graphics, very sci-fi, with some sounds making me think about Doom.\n\nAnyway, it's my favorite among the three (I don't count House of 1000 Doors, as it's already a favorite of mine) new hidden objects in this bundle. If anything, I wouldn't mind to see this one as a collector's edition.\n\nDark Strokes: Sins of the Fathers\n\nEthan and Clair are visiting the young man's father but she's kidnapped by The Faceless One. Ethan, decided to save her from them, is making his way into a decimated city. However, all the kidnapped persons are tied to a tragedy and the death of a boy on a boat...\n\nThe game is also a good one: the plot is really well-written and I didn't realize the truth before nearing the end. While it's shocking to discover who the Faceless Ones are, the title make a reference to Ethan's father and to the boy's one. The graphics are also good, as you're navigating through a city that is diving into darkness progressively. The gameplay is still the standard one: hidden objects to find, puzzles to solve, etc..\n\nStray Souls: A Dollhouse Story\n\nYour husband is in danger and you need to save him. However, the town seems to be the home of a terrible spirit and the orphanage may be the key to stop it...\n\nStray Souls has an interesting plot: your husband being the "damsel" in distress, a young sad boy, a sad clown and a mysterious woman, everything related to your man's past. Besides, what's good is that you have a little companion: a doll that can talk and can help you to discover the truth behind everything. Besides, the concept of cleansing some rooms of the evil is very nice as you can discover new items in them.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is still the same as any other hidden object game: find items, use them, clear hidden objects scenes and solve very easy puzzles. The hidden objects scenes are kinda reminiscent of the early era: with objects being in the same tone of color as the background or with a very small size.\n\nThe graphics are what I like generally: a town plunged in darkness, with everything around making you understand that evil is watching you. However, I wished that perhaps, the locations were a little more original than the mandatory cemetery or police station.\n\nThe soundtrack was also good.\n\nI enjoyed the game, that's a fact but I feel like something is missing. I don't know, maybe more interactions for the doll?\n\nAnyway, this is also a good pick for the bundle.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis bundle is way more worthy than the 5 in 1. I can't judge for the 6 in 1 as it's a new release and that I'm in the first game. Anyway, for the price, it's a very enjoyable experience, as I wasn't disappointed in any of the three games that I discovered. And as I was already convinced by House of 1000 Doors, I can easily recommend this bundle, more than the previous one. Every game has good graphics, good sountrack, a gameplay, while being standard, polished without too much brain frying.\n\nAny lover of HOG can buy this bundle and any person wanting to discover the genre can too, as there are no "weak" games like in the 5 in 1. Go ahead!","March 18","true","11.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Fun and challenging if you like those types of games. Consisting of a storyline with side mini-games and several avenues of searches to complete puzzles and goals. As is standard with hidden object games, it consists of a lot of rooms or areas with several objects to collect, as well as puzzles and gadgets that you need to find parts for to activate or build so you can move to another level, room or location.  Search areas may be inside structures, outside, in walls and through alleys. The artwork looks nice with great background sound effects, some background annimations and music. If you stop playing,  it auto saves to the point that you left the game, so you will start back where you left off. I say this, because I could not find a users option to manual save, or a quick save option in the menu at the time I started playing.\n\nNow if you like this type of game, Enjoy playing for fun, and is satisfied with Steam giving you some playing cards on the game,  I believe you will like this bundle. If you are an achievement hunter on the other hand, and you only play games to secure as many achievemnts as you can or are a 100 percenter, then you may not like these games. At this time, they offer no achievements or badge other than the cards through steam.\n\nI have played two of the games so far and now starting Eternal Journey : New Atlantis.  So far I have not run into any glitches or problems. I have seen where some people found glitchy areas or even had a problem with the games playing correctly after a bit of play. Now, as with any game that saves locations, maps, movements and start points, you should make sure your system has enough memory, and always do a disk cleanup from time to time. As I stated, so far, I've had no issues, glitches or hangups.\n","October 30, 2015","true","13.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The story is fantasy style, with magic and fire spells and a very classic construction. Also it's a sequel and I didn't play the previous game(s?) so it felt a bit awkward. The characters and the cutscenes are nice. The ending was a total let down though: the cutscene lasted 3 seconds! It's the game I liked the least in the bundle but it's still a good game and I do recommend it.\n\nEternal Journey: New Atlantis\nYou're an archeologist exploring an underwater city, then end up exploring the future. This one is more original than the usual run of the mill: you'll dive underwater, repair solar panels, use space suits etc. There's also 18 collectibles to find and the map is very handy. The graphics and the music are nice and the future is clichéd but well done. The mini games are very good. I liked it a lot. The best game in the bundle IMO, the most innovative and the Sci-Fi setting is pretty rare within HOGs.\n\nStray Souls: A Dollhouse Story\nCreepy and so well done that I've already replayed it a second time. There's a lot of good ideas in this one, like a live doll clone of Number Nine, a creepy doll house, with creepy dolls, a creepy little boy and 36 morph objects to collect! If you like horror theme then you'll surely like it. The only con is the res that seems lower than the other games, so the image is a bit blurry. The second best game in the bundle IMHO.\n\nDark Strokes: Sins of the Fathers\nI had already played that one previously but I enjoyed replaying it. Graphics and characters are gorgeous, music is okay. Didn't like the mini games much, tedious and not original at all. The HOG scenes offer a bit of challenge, being dark and cluttered. Again there's a boat model and you find little dolls to fill it but it only unlocks videos, no small featurettes with the dolls like in Stray Souls. The videos you unlock are rather bland. And no special collectibles to find. A dark setting but all in all it's rather classic. But I liked how the story unfolded and how the player is guided toward the next scenes. Third best game in the bundle.\n\nConclusion: all the games are good and you won't be deceived! Each game lasted 4 hours (5 for a leisure playthrough) so it makes this bundle really worthy.","March 24","true","33.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much from it but I've played a little of each so here's what I'll say.\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors seems like it's a sequel because everyone is talking to me like I've come back to the house. It's pretty good but there's a lot of backtracking and it gets annoying. There are cutscenes that are almost all the same with a fireball flying around in the new room you've unlocked so feel free to skip. Haven't finished it yet.\n\nEternal Journey New Atlantis couldn't hold my attention for longer than 10 minutes. The weakest one in the bundle.\n\nDark Strokes Sins of a Father is the first one I played. Art is the best out of all of the games maybe the best game overall in the bundle. The story is good but it's pretty easy to see the ending coming when you collect figurines.\n\nStray Souls Dollhouse Story actually surprised me. At first I thought it was cheesy. It plays spooky music to give spooks. After you get over how hard it's trying to be scary there's a fairly decent story. The actual hidden object parts can be difficult because of the puke green color in most places.","March 14","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/347610/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Hidden Object Bundle 4 in 1 is a collection of four fun games for a bargain value, three of which are not available on Steam outside of this bundle. This is a great collection to pick for fans of this genre.\n\nDark Strokes: Sins of the Fathers\n\nThe first game in the bundle that I played was Dark Strokes: Sins of the Fathers, I was attracted to the title’s name and the preliminary artwork of the protagonist Ethan and his fiance Claire. The story starts off with the two of them being summoned by Ethan’s father to come visit, simple enough. Though, as soon as Ethan utters the words “Everything will be fine” players are thrust into a world of supernatural mystery and family secrets. Claire soon finds herself kidnapped, shock, and Ethan must save her from the clutches of a mad man.\n\nThe game itself plays like a basic hidden object game. Finding items in a variety of different scenes with puzzles and mini games thrown in. One feature I enjoyed was that you could find more than one useful object at a time during the hidden object scenes. So instead of having to replay a scene countless times you could say pick up the knife and puzzle piece needed in one go through. Artwork was lovely in the game and the audio was good as well, voice acting was a bit on the cheesy side though but that added to the charm.\n\nEternal Journey: New Atlantis\n\nI next jumped into Eternal Journey: New Atlantis again, based off the title. I was expecting a mystical journey through the lost city of Atlantis, instead what I got was a space odyssey. The story starts off with Amrite, a famous archaeologist, going to explore the newly discovered ruins of a temple from the fabled city of Atlantis. However, tragedy strikes as the excavation site is destroyed taking all mortals with it. Fast forward over a century later, Amrite is on her way to a Martian archaeological site to lend her expertise. After being suspended in cryogenic sleep, it’s time for her to use her skills to help mankind find a new home as they flee Earth.\n\nThe game’s story is rather far-fetched but refreshing as Amrite wanders around a deserted space station with only a kitten as company. While I wouldn’t look for deep inner monologue or reflections of the emptiness of space itself, the game does present a very good mystery element as you try to figure out what happened to the crew. The artwork is alright, I feel it’s a bit weaker than the other titles in the bundle but not bad at all, it certainly feels other worldly along with the music. The game also has voice acting which is a plus, and it’s not bad either. The game plays smoothly but be prepared for quite a bit of backtracking, thankfully there is a map.\n\nStray Souls: A Dollhouse Story\n\nIn my opinion the weakest of the four titles, I played this one last because it had a creepy clown in it. You play a woman named Danielle who has just witnessed her husband Sam being kidnapped. A talking pin cushion doll instructs you that you must return to the town that Sam grew up in to find him. As is the case with many protagonists in these games, Danielle shows the minimal amount of shock at her current situations and rushes to find Sam. The story is weird, involving magic, orphans and clowns. The story is also slightly predictable, many twists being obvious before they happen. The biggest example being the clown, never trust a clown people.\n\nWhat the game lacks in a compelling story and interesting characters it makes up with good gameplay and artwork. The artwork matches the setting of the story, it’s dark and moody along with the music. The visuals draw players in and the puzzles and hidden object scenes keep them there. Tasks move from one to another smoothly and it’s usually easy to figure out your next step, the game also isn’t too difficult either which can make it a little short. I wasn’t even prepared for the sudden ending of the game as things seemed to wrap up very quickly despite the slower pace of the rest of the story, though I found the ending to be one of the better parts of the entire game.\n\nHouse of 1,000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster\n\nI saved this one for for last because it’s the only one of the four games available on Steam separately. The difference being that the separate version is the collector’s edition which has bonus content as well as a bonus chapter for more gameplay. I played the game again to see if there were any other differences between the two but there are not. The issue with this game is the story, you play Kate who is returning to the House of 1,000 Doors for really no reason, she isn’t summoned and she never outright states why she’s going back after her adventures in the first game of the series, also available separately on Steam. Once you arrived you’re sucked into supernatural escapades. The story offers no real sense of urgency, however, as you try to stop a mysterious fireball you only find out is the Palm of Zoroaster at the end of the game. The unfortunate part is that the bonus chapter, not available in this bundle, adds more story than the main game offers.\n\nThe game is still fun, however. It is hidden object scene heavy with a few puzzles as well. The artwork is good and the game has a great map feature which makes the backtracking less tedious. House of 1,000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster is filled with lovely artwork as well and rich scenes from different areas of the world. The only real technically issue I had with the game was the voice acting, it was very wooden and sometimes pretty bad, especially the main character Kate. This is a minor issue, though, in an overall pretty solid game and nice addition to the bundle but I would certainly recommend buying this and House of 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets on Steam separately.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","March 4","true","14.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The games are all somewhat old (some only support lower resolutions), but they are some of the best of the genre. Strongly recommended!\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster. (I played this as a standalone Steam game.) A good hidden-object game, and a very nice, improved sequel to Family Secrets! Taken together, they can be considered one of the better games in the genre. It is quite long and interesting, with a very well-balanced difficulty level, and a wide variety of delightful settings. The voice acting (in English) is horrid, but it doesn't much diminish the overall effect.\n\nEternal Journey: New Atlantis. Another superb classic, with an epic, imaginative storyline and fun hidden-object scenes.\n\nDark Strokes: Sins of the Fathers. A superb, classic hidden-object game, with lush graphics and animation, good hidden-object scenes, and a handful of decent puzzles.

You have all the classic types of puzzles in here: memory games, spin-and-match, etc. For the most part, they don't seem to be very challenging but are time consuming. They're still fun (besides a few puzzle types I don't really care for in any game), but you may hit "Skip" on a few just to keep moving.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent -- mostly standard fare for HOGs. Don't expect excellent quality, however, as most HOG companies focus more on puzzles and story than graphics. Some computer animations will look like circa 2000s technology, but that never really bothered me. The voice acting was pretty decent for the most part, but there were a few characters who made me cringe a little.\n\nHouse of 1000 Doors:\n~I enjoyed the different settings you go through and the different themes. The story was okay but the ending was obviously cut off. You're promised an explanation and then the credits roll. The end. I've read that there's a collector's edition of this game that has the real ending and a few bonus levels. I was shocked that Alawar would do such a thing, but I guess they can do whatever they want with their games.\n\nEternal Journey:\n~I played this one last because I didn't think I'd like it and I was totally wrong. This particular game was my favorite of the four and is easily in my top five favorite HOGs. I've never considered myself big on sci-fi so when I found myself really getting into the story, I was surprised. I wouldn't call it realistic sci-fi but I wouldn't call most HOGs realistic either. Even if you're not big into this particular genre, give it a shot.\n\nDark Strokes:\n~Yes, I giggled at the title for a few minutes. Yes, I cringed at one particular voice actor who just couldn't act anyway but bored. Yes, I spotted the ending halfway through. I didn't hate the game but it was my least favorite. I don't normally harp on about a poor plot, but this one was legitimately bad. Every time something happened, I spotted a plot hole that could've been fixed with a little tweaking. I don't want to spell out spoilers, so I'll say don't bother unless you don't really care about that stuff.\n\nStray Souls:\n~This one was weird. I really liked the dark atmosphere and design, but the story was so strange. The heroine, too, was very gullible to...everything. She liked to just accept things at face value with little coercing or argument, even when a desperate person would go, "Wait, what? No way." The "twist" about the bad guy was so obvious I wouldn't even call it a twist. I enjoyed enough things in this one that it's not the worst of the bundle, so it sits above Dark Strokes (teehee) and below House of 1000 Doors.","May 14","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
