"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kutya23/recommended/431600/","kutya23","kutya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kutya23/","665 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nShort version:\nBuy it if you prefer road racing sims to the more casual driving/racing games. Otherwise it's probably not for you. Also, no ovals currently.\n\nLong version:\n\nGeneral\n\nI'm no native Engish speaker. Automobilista (AMS) is Early Acces, but currently there is no racing sim that could be called a final product. So be aware that AMS and all the similar games are constantly changed, sometimes even introducing new bugs. I'm playing the game for quite a while, way before it came to Steam. The game is made by a small team and it seems that it's more about passion, than big money. It's not about being flashy, stylish etc., but about actual regulated car racing. No offense for NFS players, but this is the other end of the spectrum. It is true that AMS is based on rFactor 1, but it is much more than that.\n\nContent\n\nThe game is rather obscure in this regard, but I personally like their picks. It started as a Brazilian Stock Car (which is a real thing) game, so the older content is Brazilian V8s and mostly Brazilian tracks. Over time they ventured into some popular and some less so areas, but most of the cars are quite different from each other. Many current games offer street cars, hypercars, GT3 and touring cars. AMS has Brazilian stock cars (60s, 80s and current), open wheel (old and new), fwd, rallycross, super trucks, and some more. Content is by no means mainstream. I didn't play much open wheel, but generally the cars feel authentic. I don't have any racing experience, but I'm driving probably before most Steam users were born. So yea, the cars feel really different. You sure don't drive the same a Formula Extreme and a Formula Vee. Night racing is supported, but no rain. Dynamic rubbering is on a Todo I think.\n\nForce Feedback\n\nI have a Thrustmaster T500 + TH8 H shifter, so your experience may vary, depending on the wheel you use. This may be the best part of the game. I have all the actual racing sims and my personal experience is that no current game feels near to AMS regarding FFB, especially the later builds. This may be subjective experience, but it seems that the bigger the publisher, the worse the FFB gets (kudos to Codies/Dirt Rally, which is a rare exception). If you have driving experience, in AMS you can actually feel what is happening with the car (Neils' magic). Some of the more popular titles (that I'm playing too) are laughable in this area.\n\nAI\n\nDon't expect human behavior (carnage in T1), but racing with this AI is probably the most you can get if you play no MP. In most current sims, AI is questionable and this one is I had the most human-like races with. Be honest, even in the better ones, the first two laps are miserable. Here you see cars passing each other, passing you. On the other side, I didn't see any human-like mistakes (which I only saw in R3E). I've also been ocassionally divebombed, but no crazy AI flying all over the road or all AI pulled on a string.\n\nSP\n\nThe usual stuff. Training, race weekends and less usual, championships. There is no GT/AC/pCars like career. Championships are premade seasons for a car type. It is generally the same as rFactor1, except that the devs sometimes mess with the files and the championships don't really work, which is one of my main gripes with the game. For example in the current build, there are wrong (old) track names in the files and some series have 0 scoring. So without basic IT skills, you're doomed to wait for the devs.\n\nMP\n\nI only play that other game if I want actual MP racing without carnage, so I can't comment on this.\n\nVisuals\n\nDespite recently upgraded, visuals are a weak point. If you don't care about heat haze and sunrays, you'll be fine. But an AMS screenshot is like a photo of England on a regular day.\n\nSound\n\nI find it that sound can get really subjective. I'm fine with sound in most racing sims.\n\nConclusion\n\nMore for people who appriciate the older racing sims (GTR2, GTL, GPL etc) than posting a screenshot of your purple Huayra.\n\nPS I avoided mentionning other racing games where possible to avoid fanboys which unfortunately are a big chunk of racing sims/games communities.","March 20","true","13.6"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","25","25","0","0"

And don't forget, there is more to come.\n\nFew highlights:\n- Force Feedback is in the same level of rFactor 2\n- All cars physics are outstanding\n- Selection of cars is excelent\n- Selection of track is also extremely good\n- Reiza's support and comunication is well above standards\n- Neils Heusinkveld!!\n- F1 V10!!\n- You don't need a fancy PC to run this sim @ 60fps with max graphics\n- So far, public racing is rather clean and very fun\n\nIf you are a hardcore sim racing, chances are you already own Automobilista, and enjoy it very much.\nHowever, I hugely recommend it to everyone else, especially if you want to start your sim racing adiction.\nI am having a blast with a ~$600 PC build and a T300RS.\n\nCheers","March 27","true","24.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The physics leave little to be desired, the AI is fantastic, and the force feedback is the second best I have tried. Niels is a genius.. I play almost every sim on the market, but I was late to the party with this one, and i gotta say, I was missing a lot. The Reiza content is fantastic, and it also has a great mod community, with the best mods from RFactor available (only updated and upgraded), and original mod content as well. The physics and force feedback aren't quite at RFactor 2's level, but the content is possibly superior in range of vehicles you get. Nothing matches the best cars in RF2, but it also doesn't have any below average content, and every single car is worthy of your time. That said, after discovering RFACTOR 2, I have been spending a lot less time here. My only complaint is that the online community is lacking, but the fault lies on us consumers and not the game itself. If you haven't tried it yet, do it. Do IT! As soon as possible, do it! If you are into sim racing, I would say this is a must have title. Forget the other big names coming out right now, as they may be prettier, but none of them will give you the complete package and amazing wheel to wheel racing experience that this does. They fixed the UI issues since GSCE and now the whole thing looks a lot more polished, with new colours, design, and on HUD while racing. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that Reiza is always updating, and releasing FREE new content to people who own it. There isn't a better value for your money out there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlitty/recommended/431600/","schlitty","Schlitty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlitty/","617 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is great, simple as that! Quick review headsup; I'm using a G27 racing wheel and have only played single player.\n\nThe content is already vast and only going to grow. You can do a lap in a go-kart then close that out and be driving a big ole truck in a few minutes. Then close that and hop in an open wheel beast! Stock cars. Camaros. And so on and so on. It'd be hard to get bored and I have yet to. If my playtime stagnates its only because I've switched to the BETA branch! The tracks might seem obscure but there is enough and they're great fun. In fact, I find it particularly satisfying actually making great use of a practice session and learning a new track. Then do well on it? Very satisfying. Something new rather than play my standard favorites all the time. Though I still of course do love my favorites and thankfully despite being Early Access the modding scene is already taking off! Which adds even more car, skin, and track variety. And like I mentioned, the core game is going to continue to grow itself. The list of planned features, disciplines, etc. is massive over on Reiza's website. A lot of content to look forward to even though Automobilista already offers your money's worth.\n\nA big key feature for me was how hard they've worked to make each of those vehicles to feel unique while also more or less making my wheel "plug n play" when switching vehicle types. I have never had to rework Logitech settings or in-game settings at all once I found them. This is huge for a "noob" still learning the nuances of a wheel and sim racing. FFB, steering saturation, deadzones... Its of course all there for your adjustments. But for me, I didn't need it. One less thing on my mind. It has soft lock and custom setups that automatically apply to each racing discipline. And what do I know? But I think they all feel great, wholly unique from each other, and "right".\n\nI have a single R9 270 currently and found I needed to play around with a few graphical settings. And then I also capped my FPS at 99 and bam, I am as smooth as silk. A quick aside, but I really wish more games in general had an adjustable FPS lock like Automobilista does right within the game settings. But you'll probably also find yourself poking around your Crimson/CCC (or nVidia equivalent) real quick to apply some AA over the game's sweetFX (which is another things modders have already begun to play with). I've seen some people with graphical issues, but if you follow Reiza's posted tutorials and are willing to troubleshoot I tend to believe everything is fixable with this game. Regardless, it is indeed still Early Access, cannot forget that.\n\nSo long story short;\n-Variety is the spice of life and Automobilista is SPICY!\n-FULL settings options on everything; graphics, input, car setups, wheels, suspension, seat, etc etc. are there for the experts. But default and automatic settings will be fully satisfying for the uninitiated and even veterans alike.\n-Early Access with a detailed roadmap of dates/deadlines and lots of upcoming features.\n-Most approachable "true" sim to new sim racers in my opinion.\n-Great tutorials for anything you'd get stuck on can be found on Steam forums, Reiza's website, and RaceDepartment's website.\n\nLast couple notes;\n\nSome would point out the game engine is old or this is a polished version of a previous game but I'd say so what? Its a lot more than just polishing and window dressing, real work was done here. Some times working within confines and experience with the tools is what makes for a great game. Reiza is doing what they do best pushing this game to its limits and finding new ways to surprise. Put rFactor and Automobilista in front of someone who has never used a sim before and see which one they instantly figure out, make progress on, and enjoy more.\n\nMy one mark against would be that there doesn't seem to be plans to modify the AI heavily. I personally have not seen any egregious issues of any kind whatsoever with the AI. And some videos I've seen online I couldn't even fathom how to reproduce in any facet. But every game has its embarrassing moments and I'm sure I'll run into something. I'd just say the AI does come off a bit robotic and "on a rail" which makes it a tad too predictable. But then I'm no Lewis Hamilton! So the AI provides me plenty entertainment and challenges as is anyway. Some "experts" could be more disappointed in it if they chose to be. But online is where its at for those types of sim-racers anyway, and by all accounts I've read; The net code is great.\n\nFeel very confident dropping the change to get this if you enjoy sim racing or are ready to try it for the first time. I really, really, do think this is thee most approachable sim for someone new to sims. The price is fair for the content you get as it will keep you entertained for possibly years to come. Heavily recommend having a wheel of course as well as heavily recommending Automobilista.

I had the previous game from Reiza Studios, Stock Car Extreme, and this game builds upon that game with more polish and more tracks, cars and the like. It's not a Forza or Project Cars type of game, with fantastic graphics. But the graphics are more than enough to support the racing and it also means it can run well on less than uber hardware.\n\nThe racing is very good. All the bells and whistles are there for setups. And there are a lot of options for control layouts. I use an X360 controller since I'm more of a causal racer and the game easily supports this. And the large number of different car classes means a player can find a number of different cars that appeal to you. And there is a whole range of assists so whether you are a newbie or a hardcore sim racer you can find the assist options that you prefer.\n\nFinally, there is a healthy mod community already in place to support this game. There are already a zillion skins, several new cars and tracks and a bunch of other mods. And there is a good vetting system for these mods so you aren't downloading lots of dross hoping to find a bit of gold.","March 25","true","12.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is BRILLIANT!!!\n\nI own/subscribe to iRacing, rfactor 2, Dirt, Project Cars (rubbish don't touch it) and more. My spare time is spent building my rig and racing.\n\nThis is the game that finally really makes me feel like I am part of the car and can feel what is happening.\n\nSpecs:\n\ni7 3770\nR9 290x\nAsus H61 mobo - it was free!\n8gb Balistix sport something or other @ 1600hz (limited to 1333mhz by mobo)\n22 inch Acer Monitor 1080P 60Hz - Cheap but just about sufferable for racing games. Great for everything else though.\nSamsung SSD 250gb\n\nWith sweetfx turned off and 8x-AA (adaptive multisample through Crimson), this game (sorry simulator) looks excellent. Very little flickering with this high AA and it looks sharp and crisp.\n\nHaving played Project Cars that the graphics here really are better! This is because it is smooth. The textures from my view point are also superb! No strange flickering and very little stuttering. Exactly what you need when doing 150+mph.\n\nAnd its early access!!\n\nI didn't buy Stock Car Extreme, because I was put off by the comments about the graphics. Graphics certainly do not mean everything, but I do find, I need racing sims to be sharp and clear with no jaggered lines. I didn't enjoy the old rfactor engine either, graphically or physically.\n\nHowever it seems I under estimated what Reiza can do. If you had doubts. Don't have. Best £25 you will spend.\n\nI'd rather not have fancy rain droplets and amazing lighting that doesn't work, I'd rather have all the amazing content REIZA have packed into this, how well it is put together and how playable it is. Basic setups are more than driveable and a few tweaks is all it takes to improve your times and start to be able to push. Plenty of Formula cars, plenty of stock cars, TRUCKS, Go karts, rally cross, touring cars, v8's.....................................\n\nOh and the tracks. Never heard of most of them but these need to be the new F1 calender. So much fun. Old style tracks with proper corners. And the modders are making some more well known tracks as well.\n\nAnd the sounds.....................................AWESOME\n\nand the MODS.................................................AWESOME\n\n- Support.....................................AWESOME\n\n- Dev Interaction.....................................................AWESOME\n\n- Community..................................................Only been watching and reading for a week, but so far..........wait for it............how did you know...............AWESOME\n\nIf this is what Reiza can do with a 10 year old engine, I cannot wait to see what they will come up with next year.\n\nThere is so much more. But you should just click the 'add to cart' button and find out for yourself.\n\nEnjoy!!!\n\n\n","March 11","true","131.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Not to mention thier generosity in giving to title to everyone who ownen GSC Prior to Jan for Free.\nThankyou.","March 12","true","120.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

This is a game and a team to get behind. Unlike so many others out there.\n\nIf you are familiar with Stock Car Extreme, then you know this is the natural evolution/ big update of that title. It is everything SCE turned up to 11, and if you owned SCE prior to Jan 5/16 you got this update for free!\n\nAMS does so many things so well:\n-	If you are a Formula One fan you got cars & tracks both modern & historic that span back 40 years\n-	If you are a stock car fan you got a global selection of the Brazilian & Australian V8 spanning back 40 years\n-	Touring cars…check\n-	Karts…check\n-	Super trucks…check\n-	Rally cross..check\n-	Day & Night racing…check\n-	Best AI in the business…check\n-	Beautiful & optimized graphics…check\n-	Accurate &  impressive sounds…check\n-	Evolving track conditions…check\n-	Incredible tire & physics model…check\n-	Fantastic and natural FFB…check\n-	Interesting, unique, and new tracks..check\n-	Reasonable & fair price…check\n-	And on and on and on…\n\nAs simracers, we are now spoiled for choice, and if you own or have looked at any of the big titles out there this is the one that goes straight to the top of that list.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

I've tried to understand why this sim feels so much better than any other ( I have them all ) so, kept playing this, then having a go with the others and decided what it is for me is the sensation of speed whilst driving in this game is fantastic... whilst the other sims look good they don't come anywhere near this product when it comes to the sensation of speed whilst driving.... After all, isn't motor sport all about speed?\n\nBack to original review:\n\nFor some reason, I've struggled with previous Reiza Studios´ products... Bought the truck racing sim, I also bought stock car extreme, but got a refund because it just seemed too difficult to get everything working the way I like it... and although I have struggled to get my controls configured as I like them in Automobilista, I am enjoying the driving experience immensely. Without a doubt, this is an excellent driving sim, the engine sounds are the best that i've heard... It's hard to explain just why this is such an excellent sim.... for me this sim is totally exhilarating and emmersive. 10/10 have to go to Reiza Studios for this product.\n\nMore hours = more appreciation, superlative simulation that beats the rest hands down!","March 13","true","65.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With it you get more content (all made to Reiza's great standards), a better menu than its predecessor, and new features to the ISI engine like track rubbering (in early stages) and tyre flatspotting!\n\nSure, there is the problem of visuals, which are getting outdated (although I think Reiza did a good job keeping them visually appealing), and there are several limitations that the engine gives us, especially concerning settings and in-game customizability. Gladly, this can mostly be fixed with mods, which Automobilista is as open to receiving as any other good ISImotor sim!\n\nI would say, if you have a wheel and are looking for a good sim with a large variety of cars, especially open-wheelers, give Automobilista a shot.","April 11","true","61.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Automobilista brings (like GSC or SCE) a variety of new brazilian content that not many sim-racing titles have covered, making it niche in that regard. Neils has worked wonders with the physics, with me coming to the conclusion that it cannot be beat on a physics front - it simply just feels amazing.\n\nThe graphics are outdated, but Reiza have tried their best to update them to the best ability of the engine -but I fear what you see is the best that will come from this. The only way it could look better would be with a new graphics engine. With the right people this could work, but this will not happen in this title at least.\n\nI would reccomend buying Automobilista for the content and how brilliant it feels to drive & sounds superb, but if having 2016 graphics is a must, then perhaps Assetto Corsa would suit you better (but it will not feel as good!)","May 25","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I currently enjoy R3E, AC, and Project Cars, and have found the experience with Automobilista lacking in pretty much every way so far. The much touted FB on the G27 is hardly ground breaking, and the graphics are only just a step up from rFactor 1. There are bugs in the program that result in the Config Tool crashing (which Reiza has acknowledged and a fix is apparently in the works), and the starts are a mixed bag of being suddenly swerving around as the game gives control to you, or a formation lap where the car doesn't actually go anywhere and won't respond to the controls.\n\nI realize this is an early access release, and I'm hoping that Reiza and their team can improve on things to clean it up, but if you watch OnWheelsTV videos on YouTube and get the sense that this is the next big thing in graphics, FFB, and car physics...well...so far it isn't. Of the 4 main titles that I run regularly, this is a solid forth in all of those categories.","May 20","false","2.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","0"

Let's say it this way: it has all the good things Stock Car 2013 had, like a very good ffb, which is what you are looking for when you play simulation racing games with a wheel. This by itself would be enough to buy the game.\n\nHowever, there are cons too: graphics outdated if compared to Project Cars or Assetto Corsa (not a big issue though), few cars and tracks (you'll miss to drive a BMW or a Mercedes in Spa Francochamps or Nordschleife). Multiplayer is not available from the in-game menus, rotation degrees are broken in Thrustmaster T300 (always 270°, no matter what you do), the game crashes randomly, etc.\n\nYeah, this is well called "early access", so, don't buy it in the current state.

They tried to make it look tech savy but gave little in the way of thought to it. yes i had a wheel set up ... but for the keyboard warriors out there who in their right mind puts accel/brake as the "A-Z" keys and steering as the "comma / full stop keys"\nYes .3 hrs doesnt take long to recognise a bad game.... just doesnt make the cut , sorry fan boys.","March 18","false","0.4"," 3 of 31 people (10%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","10","3","31","8","5"

The sim is adressed to peaple with a FFB wheel and pedals which want to race cars at the limit.\n\nContantwise, the game has its focus at the brasilian Stockcar series and features all of the series tracks. This means, the tracks are mostly unknown brasilian tracks, but there are also some very good internatioal tracks like Suzuka and Montreal. Besides the Stock cars, there is a large variety of racing cars like Formula One inspired (modern and historic), tintops and karts. The cars feel really good - some of the best FFB out there. The cars are challanging but predictable to drive, which offers a good challange.\n\nThe AI is solid and fair. After rF2 propably the best.\n\nA great racing sim which offers out of the box the best experience in my opinion!","April 17","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
