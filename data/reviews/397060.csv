I redeemed Faeria to steam on 2/17/2016. I have just over 100 hours already.\n======================================Faeria (Read on for the full review!)\n======================================\nTL;DR:It's accessible, aesthetically pleasing, strategic, balanced, and in pretty good hands. If you like CCGs, just buy into the Early Access already. You'll be glad you did!\n\n======================================\nPros:+ Graphics: Faeria has a beautiful and thematic aesthetic that is very immersive and soothing.\n+ Audio: The music is pleasing, and more seems to have been added over time. The sound effects are often subtle enough while retaining impact.\n+ Gameplay: Balanced and exciting.\n+ Strategy: The board, interactions, and large distinction between color and sub-archetype playstyles within will make nearly all of your games unique and challenging to deal with.\n+ Variety: Neutral, red, yellow, green, blue; each with their own style, feel, and multiple playstyle options. There are cards which can make dual, triple, and neutral/color options not only viable, but even effective.\n+ Development: The developers have stuck with this game for a very long time, and care deeply about it, and the enjoyment people derive from it at all levels of play.\n+ Tutorial: Quick and easy, comprehensive enough without bothering experienced players. What it won't teach a newb, the challenges will.\n+ Menus: Beautiful and easy to navigate, and the UI is being improved all the time.\n+ Gamemodes: Between the challenges, practice AI, ranked, unranked, and 'Pandora' mode every level of player can find a place to play comfortably.\n\nCons:- Polish: There are some bugs, and slight growing pains (mainly in terms of balance) currently. They will be addressed fairly quickly though.\n- Crafting: Not implemented yet, devs are hard at work, but currently, it is much needed.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction:Hello and welcome to this review of Faeria. Have you ever wandered what it would be like if the lands in Magic were actual lands you had to put down to get to your opponent? Then oh boy, is this game for you! Faeria is a traditional CCG with hex landbuilding and deep strategic elements that result from the options and interactions introduced by such a feature. How does it play, you ask? Read on if you want to find out!\n\nGameplay:So there is a resource named Faeria. You recieve 3 Faeria each turn, but there are also 4 wells placed opposite each other on the map, which will spawn 1 Faeria a turn, which creatures can harvest. Aside from collecting Faeria to fuel your actions, you have to place lands. There is a default land called a prairie. You can place two of these a turn, or a special land, used for summoning color-specific creatures. Lake, desert, mountain, forest. You can only play one special land. If you place a special land on a prairie you already have, you can not place another that turn.\n\nEvery turn, the faeria spawns, a card is drawn for you, and any production abilities you have activate. There are effects that require manual activation that you can then activate. You can also at this point of your turn draw another card, gain another faeria, play cards, or utilize what you have on a board in any order. You will always gain your three faeria and one card at the start while production abilities activate, though.\n\nWhat does an average turn look like? Your turn starts, you make a land or two to get to a strategic spot. At the start, this is often towards your opponent's orb or the Faeria wells. Then you will play a creature or event, or wait. An example of an event could be as simple as draw two cards. When creatures take enough damage to die, they attack back first, so be careful. Structures can not attack back, and some creatures have 0 attack by default. When you first play a creature or structure, if it doesn't have haste, you can't use it yet. So the average turn will involve planning, then trying to  set up your ideal situation. Next your opponent does the same thing. Then you take the product, and you attempt to respond accordingly. If you are both playing creatures, you may on your next turn buff yours so it can safely beat theirs. It's almost always this simple, mechanically, but in execution the interactions between the landbuilding, creatures, structures, and events can make for wildly different and fun outcomes that demand careful consideration and knowledge.\n\nThe cards suits all have a unique identity to them. Neutral is great for rushing and efficiency, as you never need to make special lands. It is very well rounded, but surprisingly strong. Green is great at making many large creatures. Blue is great at reactive control and resource ramping. Yellow is great at sacrificing creatures or health for advantage, rushing, or utilizing flying creatures. Red is great at burning, ranged, and aggressive control. You don't have to pick one, they play friendly. For example, there is a neutral structure that will do 2 damage to your opponent the first time one of your creatures dies each turn. This is great in a yellow or red sacrifice deck.\n\nIn the end, it is deep, challenging, and fun!\n\nGraphics:The graphics in Faeria have what some might consider a generic approach at first. Magic and fantasy. Ogres and goblins. Blah blah. Yet, I've always been strongly drawn to Faeria's aesthetic. The other day I realized it was because it doesn't have generic looking fantasy elements, but very whimsical/ethereal fantasy elements. It is very immersive, draws you in, and takes hold of you. The card art is beautiful, as is the UI, the board, and the card designs themselves. There is a little polish still needed on the UI, and I eagerly await when structures have a unique card design vs creatures, but all in all, if a screenshot doesn't pique your interest, a video will likely seal the deal for you. If you find yourself liking Duelyst, but not the aesthetic, Faeria may be the game for you.\n\nAudio:Just as good as the visuals, except, in a card game, they are one in the same. The batter and the frosting of the cake, so they both enhance the other due to their general quality. I find almost all of the sounds entirely satisfying and impactful. Big plays just feel epic. Collecting faeria feels good. Ending your turn feels good, very final. Starting your turn feels good, so hopeful. Everything feels good, because the visuals and the sounds go so well together to create a strong impression.\n\nConclusion:By now, you are likely wondering how much this game will cost you in the long run. The answer is: As much as you want. Faeria will be F2P once it leaves early access. For those that don't want to grind, you can buy the Full Core Collection for 50$. This is everything that will be in the game until any big expansions hit. That is insane value. If you don't want everything, but still want to grind a little less, you could also pay a relatively cheap price for a lot of boosters.\n\nEven if you won't do either, progression is fairly good at this point, and with crafting in the works, it won't take long at all to get an optimized deck in the future. If you buy into the Early Access for 20$, you get some pretty neat exclusive goodies and quite a few boosters. So.\n\nI recommend Faeria at:\n\nWhatever you can afford. Wait until it is released and F2P if you want, never buy a card if you are dedicated and love collecting and unlocking things ... but if nothing else, spend a couple of bucks on a pretty orb or avatar, the game is amazing and the devs deserve it.\n\n======================================If you like my reviews, you can easily keep up with them here.\n======================================","March 1","true","122.1"," 73 of 84 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","73","84","3","3"

Not rich enough for Money: The Squandering? Eye strain from Duelyst's pixelated art and still recovering from Scrolls tanking? Then Faeria is for you!\n\nFaeria is a fun, fresh take on a board based CCG - deck building, positioning, thinking moves ahead, trying to out meta the meta and build your ELO - it's all here.\n\nThe game play is easy to grasp, difficult to master, like any great game. Deck building is fun and straight forward, with a meta game already developing. The hex based board really lends itself to elegant positioning. Why play on squares, when you can play on hexes! The artwork is cute, fantasy. Not as classic, high fantasy as Magic, but it has a nice, interesting style, in a Belgian/French teenage girl sort of way (I mean that in a good way, I like Belgian teenage girls - who doesn't). The community is friendly, strong and helpful. The Devs are out of site good - highly responsive, very engaged, and really do play their own game.\n\nHighly recommended, if you like CCGs, you owe it to yourself to play Faeria. Grab it in early access and help shape it (re: above, highly responsive Devs).\n\n11/10 would play with Belgian girls again. 8)","February 29","true","58.9"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","77","48","62","15","0"

Much more strategic then Hearthstone. Placing lands and moving minions adds a lot of depth to it! Also like that it is much less random due to less random card effect (as far as I can tell, didnt get to see all) and the ability to draw cards instead of placing lands (reducing drawing volatility).\nAdditionaly the higer rewards for finishing daily quests (60 it seems) and 10 gold for 1 win (compared to Hearthstone's 10 for 3 wins) makes the game very fair and affortable.\n\nWell designed and immensly fun to play! With the mobile client coming later, it does not need to hide from its competition.\n\nI can suggest it to every frustrated Hearthstone player without a bad conscience (Cheers Ben Brode)","March 27","true","15.1"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","31","36","0","0"

If you face the same opponents you can adapt really quickly to their playstyle in terms of how you take control of the board with your elements, which is amazing... kinda like chess. If you like hearthstone but are kinda put off by the random rng elements just crushing you sometimes out of nowhere then I'd say knowledge of the game will be more prudent in this game than hearthstone. Also faeria's soundtrack and art is just super zen and relaxing :P I am glad I checked it out even when I was sceptical, as I am chained to Hearthstone dailies and was let down by Duelyst, but yea this game is just sublime, might consider buying the full card collection for 50 bucks meaning all 250+ cards... which is nothing by the way, compared to Hearthstone prices its like 2-20% of that, based on ur RNG.","March 18","true","61.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

I have had my eye on it since the kickstarter in 2013, and it has done nothing but improve.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly tactical, with land building adding a much deeper level of strategy to each game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roder/recommended/397060/","roder","roder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roder/","44 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm not a big CCG fan. I think a lot of CCGs on the market are luck-based and have the illusion of skill, when most times your hand basically plays itself, and the game outcome is usually decided during the deckbuilding and who has the better cards.\n\nBut Faeria is different. It involves a tactical board and objectives. So positioning and placement of creatures is key. Here, you can outplay someone that has better cards, by using better movement of creatures around the map.\n\nThe two main questions I have when playing any CCG is: 1) is it p2w? 2) does it have a lot of RNG?\nEverything that is affected by gameplay can be bought by in-game currency. And Faeria has crafting, so you can craft what you need. 1x of each legendary max allowed in deck, and legendaries aren't overpowered like other games.\nPaying, however, gives options. If you're F2P, you have to construct your deck through random drops or slowly crafting. You don't get the option to construct awesome 2-color or 3-color decks, because you may not have card combos from both colors.\nFaeria has minimal RNG, very few cards have a random effect (e.g. spawn a adjacent land randomly).\n\nThe main perk of Faeria, for me, is that you can buy the entire base collection for $50. That is a decent deal in the CCG world, as other ccgs can cost hundreds to have a competitive deck, whereas many tournament finalists are F2P players in faeria. But if you're strapped for cash, wait for September when it becomes free-to-play. If you're OK with f2p grinding, buy into the early access for $8.99. If you want to have everything, then you have to invest some considerable money.\n\nUnfortunately, good tactical games come few and far between, and you don't want to miss the train when the community is actually active. So if this is your type of genre, you have to buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostBomb/recommended/397060/","GhostBomb","GhostBomb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostBomb/","45 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFaeria has excellent board based tactics and a bunch of viable decks and strategies, but I think one of the best features of faeria that has been somewhat underplayed is it's unique resource system.\n\nIf you've played a lot of Hearthstone you'd know that it can sometimes feel like whover had a better curve or starting hand usually wins.  You're choices often feel limited because of this need to play on curve and you'll see a lot of the same minions played on the same turns game after game.\n\nRather than giving you an increasingly large mana pool every single turn.  Faeria gives you a fixed amount of resources every turn that you can spend or save and build up for later turns.  This opens up a lot of different plays and strategies.  You can play out a bunch of early creatures to establish board control or you can save up for a huge play in one of your later turns.  The sky's the limit for your deck as long as you don't get too greedy, as players can punish you by taking control of faeria springs to out-economy you or just rush you down.\n\nSo far Faeria shows a ton of promise.  I'd recomended it for any major card game fans if they want to try something new.","February 29","true","248.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"

With more tactical depth?\n\nThis is the game you are looking for. It has all the good things Hearthstone has, like:\n\n- 30 card decks\n- Fast games\n- Daily Quests\n- Ranked Seasons\n- Arena\n- Card backs\n- Common, Rare, Epic and Legendary cards\n\nBut the following things will make the difference:\nEvery turn you will get 3 mana, you can save mana or you can gather mana on the map. Positioning is key. Do you make a forest land so you can make your big creature or do you play 2 plain lands to block your enemy? Based on where your own lands are placed you can decide where to play your creatures. Haste, taunt, flying and ranged creatures get more tactical value because you have to choose where to play them on the map. You can also rush to the mana-springs on the other side to the map to deny mana income from your opponent.\n\nThere is also a difference in land-building. Every turn you can choose to build 2 plain lands, 1 special land (needed for stronger cards), 1 extra mana or draw extra cards. So more decisions that lead to more tactical depth. Something Hearthstone was starting to lose in my opinion. With all the same decks and meta in Hearthstone it started to feel like a grind every month. With Faeria I think I found a more challenging Hearthstone.\n\nYes it is worth the 23,-.  This game is already very polished and feels great.

The #1 thing I admire about the development team is their desire to listen and their ability to blow up large portions of their game and rebuild them in order to improve. They listen to feedback about balance and gameplay, and that is so very very important to a vibrant and long-lived strategy game.\n\nThe mix of board-building, color/energy management, and tactical board-based combat makes Faeria my current favorite of the online CCG genre. Best of all, you can choose: just pay to buy a full playset of all the cards, or earn boosters by playing the game for free.

Minion positioning is extremely important as well as land placement.

The "living board" alone adds astounding depth to the game.  Over-aggression may be met by a starvation of resources, and attempts at control overrun by cautious and crafty land placement.\n\nWhat has impressed me the most, though, is the full collection offer.

However, I cannot give it a thumbs up because of the way the developers/community managers/mods do not accept feedback well and also because of the  pay to win aspect of the game right now in early access. I hope it changes soon.\n\nUPDATE 4/12: I have played the game a few more days now. Played some unranked battle matches against other human opponents and most of the games seemed balanced enough and fun too. I unlocked more cards and created more of my own decks. It is really hard to create a nice deck to start out as a free player, but that is to be expected in any card game. Still, only have encountered a few display errors on cards and other minor bugs, for the most part it is solid in all ways as far as gameplay and graphics and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, something I am upset with so far is the way the games community managers and mods have been treating their paying players that have bought into early access and trying to give feedback. The game asks you to join the official discord chat server to give feedback about the game. I did this, but when I bring up topics about things I dislike in the game so far and things I think should be changed or other concerns, I am quickly stopped by community managers and Mods that tell you "ok we heard you, now dont mention that anymore" "this discussion is over" "i am warning you i will ban you.." and so on. This has happened to me only a couple times, but I witnessed it being done to other peolpe in the chat more often as they voice their concerns more than I do.\n\nOn the Steam forum I have also seen many topics also with people complaining about deleted topics, deleted threads and messages. I do not like when developers or CM/Mods do this and want to control the players that are buying the game and want to give feedback. They need to allow players to have their opinion and not try to hush everybody up that disagrees with something about the game.\n\nI still recommend for you to wait until the game is free to check it out as it will be a free to play game after early access ends, right now I am not sure about how the devs will support us players that have concerns about the game and also not sure about if this "buy every card for $50" is too pay to win or not for us that want to play for free and buy what we want here and there, not spend $50-75 now and then drop more and more to own it all each expansion too.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW 4/9:  This is my 1st impression review asfter one day of play. The graphics, gameplay, UI, tutorial, art, sound, everything I played in my 1st day of this game are all on point. Its very fun and interesting how this game plays, it is similar to Duelyst in that it combined a CCG and strategy RPG combat. You must collect cards and then build a deck, however the game plays out like a strategy RPG where you move your units(placed down using the cards) around a board. The board is actually created by the players by playing the board tiles down little by little each turn as well. It is all very fun and very strategic, a joy to play.\n\nHowever, right now you can put down $50 and own every single card that exists in the game instantly. So that means that you can go to websites that post NETDECKS (the best decks known to good players right now) and you can create all of those decks instantly by paying the $50. This is a huge advantage over any new free to play player that does not invest the $50 and that tries to instead earn cards slowly through gameplay.\n\nAll of the other popular TCG/CCGs out there that I have played allow people to buy packs with real money, however is it always a chance they get all bad cards in that pack. So they keep buying packs but it still takes a long time and tons of money to get every card. Nobody gets them all in one second like how they can in this game. I really think the developers need to change this part of the game as right now it is no fun to even open packs as a free player because even if you get a legendary card, so what, all these $50 players already have all of them and every other card that exists. There is no rare card in this game, all of them are bought in one swift purchase.\n\nSo, the game is very well made, even in early access it is very polished and very enjoyable to play, I really am having fun with it. But again, I cannot support this type of pay to win system so for now I do not recommend anybody buys it until they fix the pay to win aspect of the game.

However, I do all these things voluntarily, there is no payment of any description except for me kickstarting the game.\n\nSo, all you really need to know about this game: It has a card called Yak Attack.\n\nOk, but in all seriousness, I have played many CCG/TCG's in my time, online and in RL. I've played Star Trek CCG, Magic the Gathering, LOTR TCG, Marvel vs DC Universe, Scrolls and Hearthstone, but Faeria is one of the games I've probably enjoyed the most (bar maybe Star Trek, but that was my first one, so)\n\nIt might look simple at a first glance, but the game is incredibly deep. You have to think about so many things, like "Where do I build my lands?" "Will I play this creature or save up for a bigger one next turn?" "Do I go for more land, or rather draw a card or gain an extra Faeria?" and much much more. Next to that, the game will be F2P after release, but in Early Access you get cosmetic swag (who doesn't like that) and 20 boosters + 10 arena tickets! Ofcourse if you don't like to pay for early access, I don't blame you, but the price of admission is well worth it.\nAnd if you don't like grinding? Well, just put down 50 bucks extra and unlock all the cards! If you think that's a lot, just think how many boosters in Hearthstone or other card games you need to buy to get the full collection. Yes, overtime you will spend WAY more money on other online card games. Does this make the game P2W? Nope, as progression also goes faster than other games and someone who hasn't spent a dime except for the admission fee managed to get to the top rank.\nFinally, the devs of this game have been very open and are constantly in touch with the community, listening to feedback and using that to improve the game. To give you an idea, most of the devs play this game as a F2P player to find out how the grind feels, and trust me, they also like to win, so if it's unbearable for you, it's probably also unbearable for them.\n\nSo there you have it. For the TLDR; Fantastic deep game, great consumer friendly business model and devs that truly listen to the community. Well worth the admission fee and more!","March 16","true","327.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

We played the early prototype that was back then. Now its hitting Early Access after some nice years in development. It has changed since the first prototype but its still the same type of game and Faeria at the core!\n\nThis is the most amazingly looking, and exiting Card Game out there! Which also plays like a Board Game!!! Here you dont only have to figure out what cards work against what, but also outplay your opponent on the board, with unit and structure placements as well as movements and land building.\n\nIm not gonna be the one to write a 10 pages long review here but in short, this is the card game that is more fun than Hearthstone in my opinion, and then adds the board game element and depth which makes those of you who think hearthstone is to shallow of a game, much more deep and complex. Yet VERY easy to grasp and learn.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing fund and strategic cardgame, who is open to the fact that you play and even build the board as you go along.\n\nPS: You can buy the whole core collection of cards for 50$ - This is for those of you who dont want to collect and open boosters all the time. If you already have opened boosters when buying the full core set, you will get refunded Gold for each booster, which you then can use for other stuff, or future boosters when expansions hit.","February 29","true","150.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

The main designer really likes to explain why he did something in-depth (example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ynh9UYlz6F8U8Y5b8HSE8r0S7vIHwmqVOEFKDRnG0FQ/edit ) and usually hangs around the discord chat talking about cards.\n\nAbout the game: MTG meets Chess.\nIts a card game that plays on a board. At the beginning the board is empty. Each turn you place some lands. Then you summon creatures on the lands. Then you move your creatures to harvest faeria (the single ressource) or fight. Repeat. Also theres a lot of events (some are really mean). And theres structures (they cant move).\n\nWhy this is good: Because of big plays. Other card games just dont compare.\nMove the enemy defender away from the opponents orb (the thing you need to destroy) with an event so you can move in and deal the last damage? Check.\nTurn your own creature into a cute frog that can jump, so you can jump over the enemy creature to play a land in his territory and then play a haste creature and kill him? Check.\nPlay lots of 1/1 creatures in front of your orb and hold the enemy down? Check.\n\nEach game has its turnarounds and moments that make you just go "wow" and stare at the screen in love (or hate).\n\nAnd the best part: FREE TO PLAY! After the EA the game will become free.\n\nSo why dont you try it?\n\n\n\n\n","March 1","true","227.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Replayability is limited at the moment due to available cards during early access. Worth checking out for MTG fans for sure, big MTG vibe here.\n\nMy recommendations to the devs:\n\nMore interaction with the map - give structures 3D models rather than using a card thumbnail when placed on the map, that'd look awesome. The game needs more cards which interact with the map, such as land destruction.\n\nImprove the thumbnails of cards in play, the portraits are very small and not immersive.\n\nMore powerful sound effects and attack/spell animations, they are a little underwhelming at the moment. A bit of screen shake wouldn't go amiss! :)\n\nMake it so units can swap places with one another by taking a movement point from each, so you don't have your own troops causing blockages which is rather unthematic.\n\n","March 8","true","41.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

You can shape the board with your opponent by creating lands in a ocean. You will never get mana screwed or have followed a curve because the resources system is unique. How? You can actually save your resources, you don't lose it all at the end of the turn, you gain more and you can save them to play a awesome combo or play a powerful creature.

For me personally I have to say this game is looking to be a complete disappointment. I love the concept and the original selling points of this game (for me anyway) was that it was a different take on the ccg genre and I about a year back (maybe two?) I watched a few games of what looked to have a ton of potential for an interesting and unique ccg experience.\n\nFast forward to present day and after a looooong development cycle and an apparent reboot/overhaul and I was suprised to see this game pop up on steam as an Early Access title. I had honestly given up on this game ever getting any kind of release so I was excited and jumped right in to find.....\n\n1- A game that is very clearly trying to look exactly like Hearthstone (the card art style and setup is  nearly identical) which was immediately disappointing. Personally I am just not a big fan of the H-stone for a number of reasons and the art-stlye presentation is defintely on the list. Perhaps there will be some tweaking to make this comparision less obvious as EA plays out and if you like H-Stone art well you won't be as sore as I am to see what they did here.\n\n2-I went through the first couple of hours just learning the ropes and came to a realisation that at the present moment the game is just kind of "blank" in terms of a theme. I mean it's clearly fantasy and there's some pretense about you being a god etc. but nothing about the game makes me FEEL like I am god or that I am interacting in a fantasy world. It just feels like I am playing a board game which is Okay but not up to the standard of alot of other ccg's out there. Maybe some of this will get fleshed out as EA progresses a bit but right now the game just feels like I am playing a knockoff of Hearthstone with the tactical map.\n\n3- The skills and keywords of the current selection of cards are a bit underwhelming and bare bones.......taunt, flying, charge, production, are all present in some form or another in many other games in the genre. There are some exceptions here and again EA so perhaps this will expand...\n\n4-The tactical map is bright spot and probably the only reason I am going to keep checking back. I really enjoying have the positional element come into play with my strategy games so any game that takes this into account gets a plus one from me.\n\nHave you noticed the number of times I have said "Well Early Access" thus far? Well it's early access so here's hoping they can correct some of the issues....but my gut reaction is if this is what we get after 3-4 years of development I am losing faith that his one is going improve enough to be more than a badly mangled H-Stone cash in. I get that H-stone is where the money is being made so imitating the industry leader makes sense in that regard. However there really needs to be more than just one thing (Tactical Map) that will make you stand apart you from the game your imitating. Otherwise it just feels like it's the same song with a new dance for more cash/time/investment.\n\nPurely as a tactical strategy game the new(ish) ccg The Duelyst blows this game out of the water. Though there are problems with that as well I would advise spending your time (for free) with that game as compared to paying to beta test this one.\n\n4/10 thus far......\n\nIn case the developers want some more constructive feedback on specific features -----\n\nBiggest disappointment for me was that you have this great concept of having a hexagon/map/board and yet the play lands to fill it in mechanic should be the highlight of the experience. Yet it comes off so flat. I feel like they have a golden idea here but the implementation of it breaks down to which resource should I stock up on 90 percent of the time. Having different factions of creatures requiring a certain tile to enter the map is a nice touch and does add a tiny bit of flavor but there is so much more that should or coule be done with it. I mean how about giving each of the lands some kind of character/ability outside of just being another pile of resources and creating a new launch pad for qualifiying units? How about being able to move an extra tile if you start your turn on a plains or gaining a defensive boost but inability to move for a turn when a unit starts on a mountain? Or being able to burn down forests with a spell? or requiring a particular setup to build structures i.e. they require you to build on a desert tile that does not touch any water to get the full benefit?  There are some cards that take advantage of this aspect but I really think the game needs to do a 180 and make this the FOCUS of the game. As it stands the map/resource setup is really just a feature that feels slaped on to try and make a standard ccg feel a little different.\n\nSome of the abilities and cards from the lake/blue archtype are the only mechanics I found to be of much interest. Building off of those ideas and expanding them into the other factions would be a good place to start.","March 3","false","10.8"," 42 of 77 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","42","77","2","3"

The board aspect of the game adds so much to the complexity of the game and makes it much harder to master, however, it is also that much rewarding once you get good at it. The Devs talk to and listen to the players and the community is amazing. If I understood correctly this will be a free to play game in the future, so with that assumption I'll touch a bit on this game being F2P.\n\nYes, this game in its core is f2p. You earn 10 gold per win + 60 from daily quests, and a pack costs 100 gold. You will be getting a pack per day which is not bad. The Complete Pack allows you to get ALL the cards for 50$ which is in my peasant opinion one of the best(if not the best) TCG deals out there.\nWhich means if you want to invest you can get all the cards from the beggining, but still you can grind all the cards aswell.\n\nAll in all I would say this game is a 9/10 and would recomment it to anyone who is sick of Hearthstone RNG and wants a TCG meets chess kind of game.

You have devs who truly care about game balance, to the point they reworked things constantly.  For an EA title, the level of reliability on things is pretty high, they spent a lot of time making sure things worked- it won't be perfect day 1 of EA, but it's in very good shape- the game is not a buggy mess.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite fun, and it uses a different mechanic than many of its closest rivals such as Hearthstone or Duelyst- so this will be a refreshing change of pace.   The art in this game is not for everyone, but it is excellent.\n\nOne nice thing is that this game is one of the few in the genre that offers an option for a completely even playfield with the pay $50 option.  This also liberates you from the daily grind of quests, so you can play the game to enjoy the game instead of just to collect the dailies.   There is a free to play option to try out the game before you wish to commit, and the game does have it setup to try and keep the full collection and F2P players from matching up to start in unranked modes, and unranked is mandatory for F2P until they get enough games under their belt.   That said, I would recommend the paid option if you can afford it for the full experience.\n\nOverall, the devs made a fantastic game, and it really deserves to do well.","February 29","true","161.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

At the core, it has mechanics very similar to Hearthstone. The cards themselves even look like Hearthstone cards. But to say this game is a Hearthstone clone would be very wrong.\n\nThe "living board" and the way it is utilized make this a completely unique game. The different environments you can place on the board, and card types that go with them, give the game flavor. Each game feels fresh and thoughtful.\n\nFaeria has an option to buy the complete collection of cards for an additonal $50 (you get to keep everything after the official release). I bought it to support the developers, and I must say, the possibilities for deck building already feel pretty deep. You can combine different sects/environments such as forest and water for some interesting combinations. I hope they add more environments in the future. The prologue does a good job of introducing you to the game. If you play real players, you will quickly realize the depth of the game and the amount of thought and foresight required.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is that it does indeed feel very similar to Hearthstone, and if the devs are reading this, I hope they steer far, far away from Hearthstone in the future. With that being said, it's definitely still got it's own thing going on, and it's worth it if you're looking for a new card game experience.","March 18","true","5.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is no diversity.  It is the same decks over and over.  They currently have a highlander mode which eliminates any kind of experimentation.  Basically the only mode to play is ranked which is fine but since everyone plays the same few deck types it is pretty terrible to play.  If you want to join to support the devs and mess around in it then you will probably enjoy it, but there is a lot of balancing that has to take place, and hopefully the numbers stick around by the time they figure that out or we will see another Scrolls (a game that disappeared).  A lot of potential.....but id say wait a little bit.\n\nThe awful Highlander mode has been removed and replaced with "Pandora" which is a draft type option very simliar to other games, but with more RNG added.  Some may like the rng while others might not.  Id sit and wait a bit to see where this game goes in case it ends up like Scrolls....there are less than 200 people online at any given time with it at times dropping to 50.","April 18","false","44.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This is the kind of thing strategy fans just can't help but enjoy. When this goes free to play in the fall, I think it's going to find a lot of devotees. This is pretty special wizard chess. It's a buffing and synergy game on a CCG backbone, played on a hexagonal field you build as you play. Early access gets you some packs, some gold, etcetera. While I do feel they are generous in giving out gold and packs, I feel like the system isn't as 'legendary friendly' as games like Duelyst or Hearthstone. If you don't feel like paying $25 to start smashing your face against Faeria right away, 'follow' or add it to your wishlist.

I've not been playing for very long (20hr+ as of this reveiw) and every game I've seen my mistakes and learned from them, more or less 2-5 times a match. Meaning it's apparent for newer players what they do wrong, so they can improve.\nBut the best part is the rng in this game is minimal compared to other games.\nA lot of mechanics that were rng based to "work" in other games is a choice here. For example you want set land, but maybe you want another card.But then you wanna fill the board and maybe want "netrual tiles" (Prairie), or maybe a card or one mana (Farie) Well you gotta decide and drop the others. (You get 3 mana and 1 card pern turn always)\nPlus the short while I have played some cards have had major overhuals making more allaround "fair".\nQue times are long due to the smaller community sadly, but not longer than 5 min (Here I live atleast) There haven't Been any other things "bad" about the game.\nI'm so looking forward to see where this game heads\n\nI honestly think in it's current state it's a good buy.

This game is a step forward for card games due to the fact that even if you have the same deck as another person, you may not make the same plays or choose to perform the same actions.  In addition, in many other games, creatures with interesting effects are often removed quickly and do not stay alive long enough to really shine, but Faeria fixes this with its large and everchanging board.  Much more stratgey based than other games of the genre, Faeria is even constantly improving its cards and gameplay with frequent patches and friendly and responsive developers.

For only being in an early access alpha state, the game plays great. This game has potential to be the next HS as Duelyst has kind of fallen off the charts.\n\nOut of the 4 games I mentioned, without a doubt Faeria requires the most skill to win. The problem with card games is that if its too simple, anyone who can get their hands on the meta cards can become a top player. That is not the case with Faeria. It is like a game of chess, there are many possible moves each turn and it takes a true tactician to win this game. Also what I dislike about HS is the class simple. I loved it at first, but it felt like it make deckbuilding too straightfowarded depending on the meta. Faeria is setup like MTG where you can combine different "colors". This makes the deckbuilding endless. Although it doesn't have that cool factor of playing a class like in HS or Duelyst, it makes up in its competitiveness/esport factor.","April 16","true","9.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

You don't have to place a terrain, you can also either draw an extra card or obtain an extra faerie, which adds more depths to strategies. The 5 tutorial missions will show you everything you need to know and the rest will be up to you to master(easy to learn, hard to master, type of game).\n\nAs of the initial EA release, this game is fairly generous. Daily Quests gives 60% of a Booster Pack cost value and each Booster Pack gives 5 random cards. If you wish, you can also spend 50$ to obtain a full collection of the Core Set instantly.

You don't just throw your cards on the table. It's all about thinking where to throw your cards, when to throw them and how to use the terrain to your advantage;\n- The resource system makes deck building more interesting than other games;\n- Skill matters more than luck. Sure, luck is also a ''valuable resource'', but not like Hearthstone where, let's face it, luck plays a WAY too important role;\n- Lovely interface;\n- Fast loading times. Hell, VERY fast loading times.\n\nCON:\n- The business model. They basically force you to pay 50 euros, otherwise, good luck pal in doing anything in this game. Seriosuly, I'm trying really hard to stick to my 8 euros spent. But I'm starting to think that if I want to advance I might just have to open my wallet once more. I feel like smashing the keyboard against the wall every time I start a new battle, hoping to be able to do my quest, and there goes another player who bought the whole set and just destroys me.\n\nSo all in all, do I recommend Faeria? Yes, if you are willing to buy a 60 euro-priced card game. If not stay away (hell in this day and age I wouldn't recommend Hearthstone for an absolute beginner).\n\nI'm not really sure if this game will have a long life or will just fade back into the nothingness, but it might be possible to survive. Probably a lot of frustrated Hearthstone players will give it a try. But I wish they'd made a mode for people who didn't pay the whole 50 euros. Even the playing field a bit. I really want to play this game, but I'm not into losing match after match till I, somehow, manage to gather a handful of decent cards.

I stopped playing HS due to the increasing luck based system. Yet, there are a few reasons why I wouldn't buy the EA version of Faeria. 1. The match making is terrible. In almost every game I face opponents who are at least 10 lvl higher than I am, which makes playing against them pretty pointless as a lvl 4-5 beginner. 2. I don't know if it is just bad luck, but in the +-15 games I had I had to play first 12 times. That seems to be a bit off and lowers the motivation against overwhelming opponents even more. 3. The deck builder could be better for beginners, it should show more stats of the current deck and maybe give some tips for newbies.\nThough I like the game, these points make me regret that I didn't wait for the free-to-play version. Experienced players of such games might ignore this review as it is mainly for beginners like myself.","March 16","false","10.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

That said, I think it is an amazing game, and of all the various other physical and online card games this takes a very easy #2 spot behind Magic.

Set in fantasy, this game pits players against each other as they construct the game board a little each turn, and move their card-summoned creatures in an attempt to overpower each other and win the match. As a game currently in its Development Build, it has a lot of work to be done before it's complete, but it's already showing a lot of promise and even has tournaments in action right now. As of April 2016, there is no trading and there are no other ways to obtain extra cards. It's a purely individual endavor and will cost either a lot of time or a little money. But don't worry that it would be a struggle to construct an effective deck for the first hundred plays. Right off the start, players have access to many cards of all terrains and types, so the only real struggle for getting the right cards should only come about if a player wants to have more than three of that super-rare, super-powerful creature that costs 15 Faeria to summon. Multiple decks can be constructed at once and saved, so one can have as many as ten types of decks available to choose right before that match starts. As of April 2016, unranked and ranked matches are paired randomly and there is no in-game chat or ability to host private matches. However, the game has a notice advising players to join the associated Discord chat channel, so that should help players communicate with each other in the lobby and in the games. Perhaps an internal chat feature will be added in the future.","April 19","true","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

It might seem like a card-games like any other one - because it's obviously a card-game -, but once you're starting spending a little bit of time into it, you'll realize how deep the gameplay can be.\n\nJust to explain a little bit : every turn, you gain three Faerias (the equivalent of mana in this game), and draw a card. You have the choice to either draw another card, gain an additionnal Faeria, or put fields down the board. There are 4 Faeria wells, that each give a Faeria if one of your creatures manage to reach them, and replenish every turn.\n\nAnd then, strategy strikes. Controlling the board is a necessity, but so is controlling the Faeria wells. You may want to turtle near your orb, or rush the enemy to prevent them from getting any. There are plenty of different strategies available, plenty of different decks, of different combos that you can pull off. And that's what makes the game amazing.\n\nBe warned though, that the game will be in Free to play once it'll get released, in September; but that the early access will let you start with additionnal packs, and an orb and an avatar exclusive to the Early Access players.\n\nDo I recommend this game ? Yes, one thousand times. It's far more strategic than most card-games I have been playing lately.\n\n(And by the way, if you're an ex-scrolldier : come with us, they are plenty like you here !)","March 14","true","219.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Faeria, on the other hand, has much deeper strategy, as it adds the mechanic of zoning your territory and positioning your units on a hexagonal battlefield. Furthermore, the game's namesake mana is something that accumulates each turn, so there is no pressure to have a "mana curve" or to dump your hand on the board. You can simply bide your time and be at no disadvantage (as long as the enemy doesn't make significant gains in board control). This leads to situations where, say, having a 10 cost creature from turn 1 may actually be beneficial. Despite the new layers of depth, the mechanics are incredibly intuitive and easy to learn.\n\nIf you are a fan of Hearthstone, definitely check this out.

Imagine if Battleforge was turn-based and this would be it. It's a CCG where games are decided by skill instead of dice rolls. Tactical movement and positioning matter! And believe me: if you like show-stopping wombo-combos, Faeria will not dissapoint.\n\n"Okay," you might be thinking, "the gameplay sounds solid, but even so, I can't be arsed to play an unbalanced or unpolished game." Well fear not! The game has a sort of "dark forest" theme and it works really well. The music can be haunting at times and soaring at others. The art gives each card a sense of shadowy intrigue- while the creatures range from hulking monstrosities to deadly assassins, even the brutish ogre looks like he knows more than he's letting on.\n\nIn terms of balance, rare cards are fun but not overpowered. Smart use of a legendary can be a game-changer... or it could get countered by one of the many cards you get for free in the tutorial. Between the surprinsgly fast rate at which you can earn new cards, and the reasonable chance to get rare cards, even a relatively new player will quicky find themselves with an interesting legendary or two to fit into their decks.\n\nThere isn't much bad to say about the game. The only thing that jumps to mind is that there's no voice acting to speak of, but the game is not yet feature comeplete so I imagine that will change in the future.\n\nOverall, it's easy to reccommend. Fresh mechanics, alluring art, and a beautiful soundtrack.

The artwork is superb!\n\nThe only things that I could complain about is that at 22 euros, even if you get 20 boosters with it, it's a bit pricey; the other is that the artwork for the cards do not have a function that makes you see it expanded(like in Mabinogi Duels), I mean, what's the point of making cool artwork if you can't see it fully?\n\nAnyway, my final judgment is that Faeria is a good, well balanced tcg; however, its price might put off a bit so, if you aren't willing to spend so much for a tcg you should wait some more to see if the developers turn this into a f2p like Hearthstone and similar.\n\n\n","April 10","true","7.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Despite some rough development and a longer-then expected development period the game has grown into it's own with a beautifully streamlined combination of boardgame and competitive TCG. Currently the game as-is is a beautiful piece of art, the game still has some growth to go with regards to collecting cards and finding uses for extra commons. A crafting system has been promised and I am eager to see where it takes us.

Faeria makes you feel like losses are your own fault and not beyond your control such as other card games like Hearthstone (first thing that came to mind).

Fun idea.\n-Artwork. The art on the cards is pretty good, I haven't seen any art that I don't like.\n-Music. It's not going to win any awards, but the music/sound design is pretty good.\n-Relatively few bugs. The only major issue I've had was when the game crashed while I was exiting out of it, which actually sped up the process, so...bonus crash?\n\nThe "not so great":\n\n-CCG mashed together with a board game. It's a fun idea, and it certainly isn't something I'd classify as "bad" but right now I feel as though the CCG portion of the game has difficulty setting itself alongside Magic or Hearthstone while the boardgame portion of it feels small and a bit cramped. I feel like, rather than having one GREAT idea, it has 2 decent ideas.\n-Balance. Not much to say here, it is in Early Access and it is to be expected to be honest. Balance isn't terrible, it's just not perfect.\n-Card mechanics. I feel like I've seen all the card mechanics before (think "flying" or "haste" from MTG or HS) because I have. Every card that "does" something feels really "been there, done that". This isn't "bad", so much as another issue where I think the CCG portion of the game won't hold up to HS or MTG.\n\nThe BAD:\n\n-F2P progression. This feel incredibly slow to me. So far, I've put 11 hours into the game, bought in with the "20 booster pack" option, and still don't feel like my card unlocks have progressed hardly at all in 11 hours of gameplay. You can buy all the cards (in game purchase only afaik) for $50, and it feels, to me, like the f2p progression has been artificially slowed down to "persuade" you into buying the $50. You can craft cards, by breaking down cards you don't want/have excess of, but this seems doubly slow.\n-Deck variety. So, in 11 hours, I think I can say that I've met probably 3-4 different deck archetypes, and not much else. I'm only 11 hours in and it feels like I'm already seeing the "netdeck" problem that I hate in HS or MTG. This game would greatly benefit from a draft mode.\n\n\n\n-Deck "Colours". I'm not sure if I want to put this in the "bad" section or the "not so great" section tbh. In MTG, you have the 5 colours with each colour having distinct benefits and drawbacks. I love blue, but it has never been a big "punchy" colour like Green for instance (in MTG). However, in Faeria, you have 4 colours (+neutral cards) that seem almost like they wanted the colours to have a big impact like MTG does, but then backed out at the last second. This ends up with Green having big creatures, but not really that much bigger than red, Yellow has flying and direct damage while red has direct damage and range and blue has some control but still decent sized creatures. There are differences between the colours, it just feels like they couldn't decide how big an impact they wanted the colours to have, so they left it quasi-indistinguishable from one another. This is another area where it feels like it isn't "bad" or "great", just "decent".\n\n\nOverall, I would say hold off on it right now. It's not a bad game, it's just one of those times where I can see it going either really well or really poorly by the end of development. F2P progression is too slow imo, and it is leaving a bad taste and $50 is too much for a game, imo, that may/may not end up doing well. There isn't enough of a playerbase (yet?) to show me that this mostly MP only game (there is limited SP, but it's not good enough to really be worth mentioning) is worth the investment. As is, I'm on the fence about whether I think my purchase was worth it, so I can't recommend it just for that. The core idea is great, no doubt imo, but it just hasn't done enough to show it's worth compared to MTG or HS.\n\nTL;DR.\n\nIt's alright, great core idea marred by (atm) mediocre delivery and slow (f2p) progression.","April 20","false","17.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

That is the projected actual release.\n\nYou build lands across a map and use your deck of cards to do battle with the opposing player. Your mana can carry over from turn to turn so curving is not quite as important as in other card games.\n\nThe game is interesting, albeit slow (as demonstrated by their attempts at having widely viewed competitive tournies).\nThe barrier to entry is far below Duelyst but your ability to be competitive is crippled much more here. The meta shifts wildly with every patch so unlike Hearthtone for example, you can't still climb with the shell of a deck you had that was previously successful.\n\nThe balance is sketchy at best and quite inconsistent. I have two good examples of this.\nWhen asked about a mind-control style card (Magda) the developers admitted that it was meant to have no place in competitive play, but once it found a super strong niche they eliminted the card altogether.\nThen, in these patch notes below, they admitted to trying to make a card overpowered simply because they liked the idea of a "wild and exciting change".\nhttps://faeria.com/news/patch-notes/33-patch-notes-april-27th-2016\n\nI like the game, but it is not worth the ten bucks. Card crafting exchange rates are extremely unfavorable, but there is no cap to how much you can farm in a day which is nice.\n\nNegative feedback is unwelcome in the discord server, as Taiga claimed. Unless you're part of the inner circle then they take everything you have to say without question.\nWin trading is a thing that happens in competitive play without punishment (even in developer sponsored tournies).","May 5","false","122.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Strategy games, card game, and board games are my absolute favorite. Faeria implements all three of these things. Throughout all of my playing I've discovered a number of things regarding gameplay mechanics, game allure, replayability, and overall design.\n\nI can't pin it down but I just DONT want to play the game. I paid money for it, I enjoy the mechanics and the gameplay allows for strategies to be developed over time. The atmosphere is different and interesting. The cards have a unique style to them, the music is fairly good, and this allows for a stylized theme.\n\nOn paper this game is GREAT. Some minor bugs, balancing problems, and spaghetti code but overall for Early Access this game is a gem.\n\nBUT I DONT WANT TO PLAY IT.\n\nI believe it has something to do with allure. The FEEL of the game. As much as Hearthstone has bugs, crazy RNG problems, and clear issues with Ranked mode as of today it still has me charmed. There's a feel to the character profiles, the sound of the minions, and atmosphere of the tavern that makes me enjoy opening the game.\n\nI enjoyed Magic: The Gathering for years. The art, and style of the cards had my imagination bursting with excitement every time I played a card.\n\nI enjoyed Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG for some time for the exact same reasons. The foil cards had me coming back for more.\n\nFaeria doesn't give me that feel. That energy that makes my imagination come to life and burst with excitement.

The game is played on a board that you and your opponent create by placing tiles of five different types and deppending on which tiles you play allows you to cast different spells. The game has a lot of strategic depth as it not only matters what cards you play but also their position on the board, for example a big bad monster that is on the wrong side of the board is no threat to your opponent while a smaller well placed one is. The gameplay is driven forward by strategic resources, that can be harvested to increase your abilities to play cards, which creates incentives to move out on the board.\n\nThe game is already a lot of fun and with the planned additions and future expansions it will only get better.  It currently offers ranked and unranked cunstructed gameplay modes and a drafting (arena) system is planned to be released soon. Faeria does not let you trade cards between players but has a crafting mode. The pace at which you aquire new cards is high and higher than most other CCGs such as Hearthstone.\n\nFaeria is the CCG with the greatest potential I've seen ever and I wholeheartedly recommend this game.","March 17","true","60.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Some hours playing, here are my thoughts:\n\nFeels like Chess, Magic the Gathering, PokemonTCG and a Hexagon all went into a huge orgy that lasted for whole weeks, and later that year the Hexagon was pregnant and noone knew who the father was, so they named if Faeria.\nSo:\n\n->Pros:\n-Artistic aspect is one-of-a-kind, really great artists are working on this.\n-I can play it 99% of the time withouth being remembered by bugs and glitches that the game is still on Early Acess, and when I did find a bug and reported it, my e-mail was almost instantly answered.\n-Feels good, I'm close to what feels a 50%~60% win rate maybe? Things are way more balanced that what I expected them to be.\n-Huge room for customizing your deck and strategy possibilities.\n-Art man, freaking amazing artwork. The background and the colors are just to die for and the music is stunning.\n-A lot of people are playing it, no queue time at all.\n-Freaking crafting system in last patch, now grinding feels better than just playing for boosters.\n-Did I mentioned FREAKING AMAZING ART?1!!??!11111!!!eleven!!1!!\n\n->Cons:\n-I actually found the price to be a little bit higher than what I'm used to spend in games. Just a little bit.\n-Remember that no queue time I spoke about? Yeah sometimes you end up playing 2~3 matches in a row against the same person, in my case it always happened with the ones who were good enough to hummiliate me and kill me in 4 turns, although it's easy to avoid if you wait some time for them to get into a match.\n\n->Personal aspects that doesn't count towards neither pros or cons:\n-I'd like to see some graphs about my decks, win rate, match history, etc. Still Early Acess, hope they add them!\n-I think the Structure card type is being left behind. I'd love to see creatures that can't move at all (unless you move their land ~~) and I think that fits into the concept of Structures that have attack points. I didn't experienced yet a deck choice that has like 9 or more structures and won, always got my ♥♥♥ kicked. (I mean, almost-full Creature and almost-full Event decks seem to work, why not Structure?).\n-Acessing chat-group-discussion-foruns while inside the game would be neat, hate to be relying on browser since I use Big Picture.\n\n\n","March 16","true","84.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Like Chess met Hearthstone. The ability to create land-tiles(/draw a card/get 1 mana) to place your creatures on allows the player to actually have a huge impact on the match and therefore removes a lot of rng from this ccg, even with bad draw you are able to do well by winning the "tiles placement-part". It also makes matches feel a bit less repetitive and offers a lot of different possibilities, even though most of the cards mechanics are kinda conservative (flying, haste, deathtouch etc.).\nThe art design (at least whats in the game right now) is well done and fits the overall aesthetic of the game, the same goes for its awesome music.\nBoosters are earned relatively fast and I've got a ~55-60% winrate as a free player atm (though I didnt play enough to verify this).\n\nFaeria allows you to purchase the whole collection for 49,99 €, which is a bargain for ccgs/tcgs. Yet I don't know if I like this or not, because I actually like the "collectible" part of ccgs and I personally feel kinda "forced" to get the whole collection since it's possible to get it relatively "cheap" ... I prefer games to give me some barriers, especially since the collecting is part of a ccg at least for me, but I guess i'm just weak :D. I'd call this a neutral aspect of the game, since some ppl gonna like it, some wont.\n\nOverall, Faeria is a great approach on the ccg genre. The refreshing concept and beautiful aesthetics make it an interesting choice for everyone who dislikes Hearthstones rng-heavy gameplay or MtGO's prices.\n\nAnd btw, this game got "Yak" themed cards.

The game is played on a board that you and your opponent create by placing tiles of five different types and deppending on which tiles you play allows you to cast different spells. The game has a lot of strategic depth as it not only matters what cards you play but also their position on the board, for example a big bad monster that is on the wrong side of the board is no threat to your opponent while a smaller well placed one is. The gameplay is driven forward by strategic resources, that can be harvested to increase your abilities to play cards, which creates incentives to move out on the board.\n\nThe game is already a lot of fun and with the planned additions and future expansions it will only get better.  It currently offers ranked and unranked cunstructed gameplay modes and a drafting (arena) system is planned to be released soon. Faeria does not let you trade cards between players but has a crafting mode. The pace at which you aquire new cards is high and higher than most other CCGs such as Hearthstone.\n\nFaeria is the CCG with the greatest potential I've seen ever and I wholeheartedly recommend this game.","March 17","true","60.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Although the art and cards look like Hearthstone, it feels and plays closer to Magic to me.\n\nThere's a surprising amount of depth for something that seems so simple. Positioning your minions and land to take control over the board and resource wells. Deciding what type of land you wish to place each turn. Whether you wish to not place any for the ability to gain more mana or draw more cards.\n\nWon't take you years, or cost an arm and a leg to obtain a full collection. The grind is pretty manageable, you can get several packs a day in just an hour or so, as well as disenchant and craft cards. You can instead buy the full collection for only $50.\n\nWish I could do that for other games.\n\nIf it had some way to message your friends in-game, This would be a 9.5/10\n\nOtherwise this is a solid 8.5/10 game.","March 14","true","13.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The gameboard is gradually filled out in alternating turns between the players, with some of those tiles containing attributes that can influence the powers of the cards played.\n\nYou place your game card onto a tile you've created, with the aim being to destroy your opponents orb at the opposite end from your own. Likewise, the opponent is trying to do the same thing to you.\n\nThere is a very clear tutorial which break down the game rules into several stages before you can unlock enough cards to form a deck to begin using.","March 5","true","7.7"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

It has elements from both of those games, It is basically a card game but has a grid board in addition which makes for deeper tactics and more variety than games like Hearthstone for example.\n\nThat being said, this is really different than any of the aforementioned games with different emphasis on the "mana" curve , it is kind of hard to explain. But sure takes a lot of practise before you can handle it.\n\nI will recommend this to anyone who is into these kind of games in general.

The ability to create land-tiles(/draw a card/get 1 mana) to place your creatures on allows the player to actually have a huge impact on the match and therefore removes a lot of rng from this ccg, even with bad draw you are able to do well by winning the "tiles placement-part". It also makes matches feel a bit less repetitive and offers a lot of different possibilities, even though most of the cards mechanics are kinda conservative (flying, haste, deathtouch etc.).\nThe art design (at least whats in the game right now) is well done and fits the overall aesthetic of the game, the same goes for its awesome music.\nBoosters are earned relatively fast and I've got a ~55-60% winrate as a free player atm (though I didnt play enough to verify this).\n\nFaeria allows you to purchase the whole collection for 49,99 €, which is a bargain for ccgs/tcgs. Yet I don't know if I like this or not, because I actually like the "collectible" part of ccgs and I personally feel kinda "forced" to get the whole collection since it's possible to get it relatively "cheap" ... I prefer games to give me some barriers, especially since the collecting is part of a ccg at least for me, but I guess i'm just weak :D. I'd call this a neutral aspect of the game, since some ppl gonna like it, some wont.\n\nOverall, Faeria is a great approach on the ccg genre. The refreshing concept and beautiful aesthetics make it an interesting choice for everyone who dislikes Hearthstones rng-heavy gameplay or MtGO's prices.\n\nAnd btw, this game got "Yak" themed cards. A "War Yak" always wins.","March 19","true","17.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While it was entertaining, they have removed the 'normal' queue, and replaced it with 'highlander'.  This makes it impossible for experienced players to test decks, and for new players to compete.  While there is a 'ranked' queue it is not good for casual play as most of the players there are higher level and have purchased the full set.  It is likely that this mode will remain missing for another month.\n\nWhile I will continue to play this game, I will not spend any money on it and I do not recommend any new players to purchase it until the developers resore the game.","May 8","false","159.4"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

And really, after giving this game a go, I realise how simplistic Hearthstone really is - I've never really been in to card games like this until Hearthstone.\n\nI just want to say how cool the board is in this game.

Each game of Faeria is not only unique, beautiful and fast-paced but also highly competitive."\n\nThis is the short introduction posted by the developers on Steam to market Faeria with and the most important reason why, as much as I want to, I cannot recommend this game. It just doesn't live up to the advertising.\nOne thing is beyond doubt, the game looks beautiful. It is almost certainly the prettiest card game to date which makes it in a way doubly disappointing that the gameplay is just not up to scratch.\nThe ability to shape the board is interesting but regrettably it leads to 'mind-blowing strategies' only in a tiny percentage of the actual games you'll play. The majority will be decided by factors largely beyond your control, mainly:\n\n- How your deck compares to your opponents. This game in its current form suffers rather extremely from 'rock-paper-scissors' meta and although the development team is very much on the ball when it comes to balancing individual cards, the fundamental design of the individual colours is such that this will likely always be the case.\n- Which cards you happen to draw. Same as almost any card game out there, which cards you happen to draw at any given time has at least as large an influence on the game as how you use them. This is further compounded by the fact that the starting hand consists of only three cards and particularly in the early stages of the game, you will only be drawing one a turn.\n\nAside from this and again, unlike what the game's marketing promises, games are by no means 'unique' and certainly not always fast paced either. In fact there are a large enough number of control effects, removal spells and even board sweepers in the game that control mirror matches are not uncommon. Even control versus midrange battles can occasionally devolve into sleep inducing slugfests which in extreme cases, don't end until one side runs out of cards.\n\nAll these issues unfortunately overshadow what could otherwise have been an interesting strategic premise.\n\nLast but not least, this game is VERY unfriendly to free-to-play players. The crafting and particularly the drop rates of epics and legendaries from boosters aren't great but to be fair, these are still being adjusted. What is more toxic to the new player experience is that there is an option to buy the full collection of cards in the game for 50 dollars. This means that unless you are willing to pay this, you are almost certainly going to be facing people with fully built decks as soon as you start the game. The developers have stated this option will not be removed meaning new free-to-play players will likely be facing a very rough and probably unpleasurable start to the game until they can grow their collection.\n\nFaeria is by no means a bad game and in fact many of the complaints I have with it are not unlike what exists in many other CCGs. But therein lies the problem. Faeria claims to be something more and sadly, apart from the graphics, it doesn't deliver.","April 1","false","128.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","1"

I was a MTG player, but MagiC has become too expensive to afford ...especially for a casual player like myself. Also the board adds another dimension compared to MagiC! Reminds me of chess game. I had some very fun games with interesting situations, comebacks, surprises, where your creativity and foresight of the game are your best allies... which I found very satisfying :D I did not play Hearthstone because I dont like the graphical feel ("cartoon") of that game, but from what I have seen there are some similarities in the game mechanics.\n\nIn the end Faeria is really fun and satisfying, addictive... but the games are quick (10 minutes), and suprisingly well balanced for a development build!

First my feelings, then facts. I love this game! The land placement feature and jockeying for position on the map adds unimaginable possibilities to the strategies that one can employ to achieve victory. Other than that very unique aspect, the game plays like many other TCGs. Deck building and booster pack opening are very much a part of this game. The art in this game, both visual and audible, is gorgeous. Faeria has come out looking more polished than ever and I very much appreciate the aesthetics. For the most part the community is welcoming and supportive, if you decide to play Faeria don't forget to get involved! I say 'for the most part' because it is a competitive game.. naturally, some people are not so quick to congratulate you for beating their pants off.\nNegatives- Most unfortunately, despite many haughty claims from the DEVs (Sorry friends), this game DOES exhibit PAY-TO-WIN characteristics. A person can most certainly gain an edge over other players by throwing 'real life' money at the game. I applaud the DEVs for their meticulous balancing and I believe that the game can be enjoyable with or without investing too heavily into the game. For those who do not have time to grind out the in game currency through daily achievements and shear volume of multiplayer matches, the purchasable content is a great option.\nBUT, Have courage my ANTI pay-to-win friends! This game rewards those who are quick of mind and will also reward those who have more experience and are more intimate with the card library. You will most certainly have the upper hand if you put in the hard work (not really that hard... and quite enjoyable at that) to collect your card packs one at a time.\nIt is my pleasure to play this game, and I think you will love it too.\nI hope to see you in Faeria!\nMilo  <---(in-game)","March 2","true","88.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Game feels pretty finished (for early access) although it is hard to say anything about balance due to small community. Some cards are a little bit frustrating and some are very useless, but nothing that makes you want to stop playing. The main features game is missing are a searh/sort/filter panel in deck builder as well as some kind of fun high cost cards with high risk/long preparation = high fun reward formula.

But this game really deserves one. You can say what you want, but most card games are not that balanced, and most of the time are really unfair, when it comes to ingame rewards. But Faeria offers you a card game, that let's you get cards without real money really quick. Most of the quests give you 60-80 gold (1 booster costs 100 gold), and you can even win games with the starting cards you get.\n\nIt's also more tactical than other cards games. The land building part is great, and the fact that you have to think, before you play a creature, because you only get 3 mana per round, with the option to claim 4 mana wells to get up to 4 mana more each round.\n\nI really like it. Some cards need to be balanced a little more, but in the end it's a funny game. And not so luck based like Hearthstone is.","April 23","true","12.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You get those "artifact" cards that you draw randomly and they give bonuses like +6 faerie or a charge card etc. Problem is the guy who draws the artifact has a huge advantage that turn, which is absolutely flawed. Same goes for when the 5th artifact is drawn, the guy who's turn it is has a huge advantage of tempo. That's bad design if you ask me.\n\nDespite all this, the game looks promising. It's all in the execution and we'll have to wait and see how it's tackled.\n\nAtm I am not tempted at all to invest in buying anything, as there are flaws, I randomly get disconnected for instance. Also the special effects and sounds are lacking which make for an incomplete experience. I could also add the fact that the minions are very small on the board which raises questions about this becoming an esport or being playable on smaller devices.\n\nYet, again despite all this I can see potential. There is strategy in positioning, so it's not only the deck and draw order. Unfortunately there will probably be guides for net decks that will spoil this amazing concept, but you will still have a lot of freedom in coming up with strats due to this added element of depth. I just hope the developers don't limit strategic options like Hearthstone developers do, but instead give players exciting options and let them come up with the strats. If anything is OP, nerf it.\n\nTL DL We need special effects, animations to make this look less static, sound effects, a better Pandora mode without listed flaws. We also need bigger minions for smaller devices and viewer experience. Apart from this, the game looks very promising and I think I've already made the money back in the 4-5 hours I played - had a positive winrate in constructed with my first ever deck, but failed miserably in Pandora and was terribly annoyed by the artifacts.","May 25","true","38.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While it is understandable why things are as they are, it does not make it less frustrating. At the same time Hearthstone is all about randomness. Being a good player doesn't let you win against a worse player, it just gives a small edge in.\nFaeria on the other hand is all about strategy. While maintaining 'Easy to learn, hard to master' mentality and intuitiviness of Herthstone, it also emphasizes strategy. From the first turn of the game you have to plan your strategy and adjust according to what your opponent does.

The game itself is fun but recent changes to the game have been almost entirely negative and the developers refuse to acknowledge it as of this review.\n\nThe constructed mode is fun and skill intensive but unless you want to pay more money it takes forever to build a collection solely through dailies and constructed wins. I find this unacceptable for a game that isn't free, when it's competitors are, and has a terrible draft mode.\n\nThe draft mode, called pandora, was much anticipated and about 2 months late. It's launch ended up being one of the bigger dissapointments I've witnessed in gaming. The actual drafting will be familiar to anyone who's played digital CCG's before but in the middle of games you randomly draw "pandora shards" which wildly swing the game often leading to players who were very far ahead due to clever play now being at parity or even behind because of a single shard. The only people I've seen praise this system are praising it as a very casual format which is counter to how Faeria is presented (a potential e-sport). What makes it worse is each time the devs come out and talk about it it comes out as condescending and blaming the player base for over emphasizing the impact of the pandora shards.","June 6","false","22.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As with any card game like this balancing can be tricky. The developers have had long enough to learn and they just haven't.

It's not rocket science, I would imagine most people would want to have some time to interact in battle with the cards they have in a deck. Right now as it stands you will constantly come up against decks that will only need to pop off about 8 to 10 cards without even needing to get to your main globe/health.

The games meta keeps drastically changing because they keep making "balance changes" where instead nerfing what are cool cards, they completely obliterate them and make them unplayable or just completely redesign them into a boring heap of crap. They do this even when the meta is very balanced with about 6 or so very viable decks with a few barely missing the cusp. For a card game, especially with a game only having one set, 6 decks is very good. Another large issue is the devs focus on tourneyments for their game rather than adding core features like draft mode(I say core because it's in hte menu and the only other way you can play the game). Lastly, the priceing of this game is absoulutely stupid. If you were unlucky to buy it within its first month of very very early acesss, they drop teh game from 25$ to 8$ (you dont get the 20 packs you do with the 25$ version). The large issue with this, is the fact that the game is eventually going to be free (so you're paying 8$ to play an unfinnished card game that quite frankly kinda sucks in its current state) but you also offer a 50$ option to buy all the cards which I will admit is pretty cool. The huge issue with this however, is that I had to buy the 25$ version and still have to spend 50$, where as someone who bought the 8$ version also has to spend 50$ which means im out 75$ where the person who had this option is only out 58$. Lastly, the community seems completely oblivious to these problems and when I bring them up, no one cares when these are some pretty major issues. In conclusion: There are way better card games (ie. Hex, Spellweaver, etc.) play those and save your money.\n\nPS they also release very deceptive updates where you think they made a change that the community asked for but in reality is completely irelevant because the ratios for said change are the exact same.\n\nPSS all the fan boys (community members I mentioned earlier are going to downvote this :p\n\nEDIT: They're promised pandora mode for April has been pushed back, so I do not trust the integrity of this game or company. They said verbatim:\n\nPandora is coming\nWe’ve said that Pandora is the next big feature we want to implement after crafting, and this still holds true. Our limited format will make its way to live servers in April.\n\nInstead they implemented things like observer mode for a stupid tourneyment which aprantly has more priority over a major feature that they PROMISED was top priority\n\nEDIT 2: DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY. THEY LIE AND CENSOR THEIR COMMUNITY. ALSO, after promising a feature in April, they released a copout and tried to force people to to earn it via playing 100k games (great idea with a small playerbase of around 200)","April 28","false","78.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

So far I ended up at the current opinion:\n\nPros\nThe strategy side is very interesting for it's combination of card physics and board game elements. The resource and type system is fairly well balanced. The in-game cash distribution is well balanced that you can get a free pack without a quest in just 10 wins.\n\nCons\nAs much as this game has a lot of good features, it has it's bad sides. The current meta has face decks that ignore the resource system and bring a very frowned upon strategy from other game communities. Card balance also seems to be off the roof and flying in every place.\n\nBut as far as I can say, it is still too early to justify the meta. We are going to see lots of card balancements, so we probably won't seeing face forever. I still have time to get used for the games functions, because I sometimes forget certain interactions.\n\nAs much for everything else, I would like to see a search filter for the collection to find cards more easily. Other than that I am thrilled for more cards and updates on this game.","March 12","true","26.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

With mana gained every turn, but specific land types required for most cards, there's slightly more strategy required than Hearthstone in how to spend mana. Catan comes into play on the hexagonal board, on which the creatures summoned move. Along with 3 mana and a card drawn at the beginning of each turn, you can play 1 of 4 land types (or two Plains, which are aptly named "plain" lands), gain an extra mana, or draw an extra card. The card powers are typical of games like Magic and Heathstone (Haste, Taunt, etc.), but the are also unqiue-feelng Structyre cards, which can have Produciton (something that happens at the beginning of every turn it's alive), as well as abilities that buff other cards at the cost of 1 life.\nI cannot wait for the full release of the game, and I've been recommending it to everyone that I know played Hearthstone as a smaller, more unique game that doesn't (yet) have an extensive library that, to me, is a bit overwhelming to step into at first, and even after some time to be honest.

However, card collection size is still relatively small so if you are looking for a full complete package you may want to wait for launch; $25 early access is a little steep.\n\nThe board mechanics and faeria resource management adds a really nice complex feel to the game. They did a really good job making it easy to understand but hard to master. I'm only lvl 10 right now but I feel that the progression is much faster than hearthstone in accordance to building your collection. They are going to be implementing Pandora mode (Hearthstone Arena) in a month or two which will help those skilled players gain extra coins to get their hands on some more cards.\n\nHonestly the biggest gripe with the game right now is just the lack of cards. With that being said, that's a really good thing. It's an early access game and if the biggest problem is lack of content, you know you are doing something right. One small gripe is the crafting prices. On one hand packs are cheaper and easier to come by, but on the other hand crafting is pretty steep and will take awhile to be able to craft that one legendary card you need to round your deck out.\n\nOut of all the other card games I say this one is a diamond in the rough. It requires a lot of thinking in terms of building your lands to block them from attacking you directly, trying to balance greed (collecting faeria) with aggression and mix and matching different elements in the same deck to optimize value.","March 15","true","23.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

New board awful, it's now got 5 hex and I think it's too short (old was 6 hexes) , now it's symmetric, with old board it's a lot of  ways in how  to start game Long - Short distance gives a lot of strategy in gameplay. So territory gameplay lost.\n1.5 Territory gameplay WHY you delete creatures with skill "capture" territory? Oh, I know why "Because now we got little board, we don't need them, let it be more like Casual, we need more casual!!!!1111"\n2. It's was so interesting gameplay when game was 3 resource (Gold, Faeria, Lands) It was great, for powerful creatures you need Faeria, you can get Faeria from wells, so you need to control wells. Now you don't need control wells to get Faeria because there is only one resource (and ofc lands, so 2). EX: Old green decks need Faeria as breath, so green was slow decks, for now green decks can play without it. (Hello green rush with 9/13 creature near your orb turn 3).\n3. or 1.6. Mountain was nice with their strategy to crash other player lands, where is it now???? Oh stop stop, OHHH I SEE IT 12 faeria megasupermeteor, no sorry but you lost this strategy, as ''capture'' lands.\n4. Devs, I don't know whom was that idea to make 30 card deck only, but it is ruin a lot of deck building, lets remember decks with 50 cards events that ruin 70% low card decks. (MORE CASUALLL!!!)\nI can write a lot of other changes that ruin your nice idea of "old" Faeria, but I think no one need it, for now this is "another" or "new" Faeria, and yes, It's not bad, but for me this "new Faeria" is game that trade Ideas and Soul for nice skins and casual gameplay.","March 17","false","29.1"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","10","23","2","0"

The developers are active. It doesn't take long to get into an online game. There is a lot of strategy involved in the land and unit placement. Creating and trying out new decks is a lot of fun. Personally I've lost a lot more games than I have won but it's always interesting to see what type of deck your opponent tries out. You (currently) get 10 gold for every game you win. A booster pack costs 100 gold. So ever 10 wins you can buy a booster pack with new cards. There's also 2 daily challenges every day which earn you even more gold. You can scrap cards of which you have too many to gain a resource which you can then use to craft cards. Bit grindy though as it takes a long time to get these resources and the good cards are very expensive to craft.\n\nI use a 2560*1080 screen and currently there are 2 black bars on the sides, hopefully they can extend the backgrounds at some point!\n\nThe art work is awesome!","April 27","true","18.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

If you would rather spend the 10$ than put 4 hours work in to a game then more fool you imo.\n\nNow, the actual game.. Whilst still in development, it has enough replay value to keep you going, i have just defeated every mission in the campaign and have started to foray in to online battle mode, each matchmaking lobby takes around a minute to get you in a game, usually balanced within 2-4 levels of you. Games can take between 5/15 minutes sometimes more if you face a tough opponent or one of equal skill.\nThe Gameplay consists of a hex-based board on which you can place 5 terrain types, there are normal, aquatic(Blue) Mountain (Red) Desert (yellow) And Forest(Green) Each terrain type pertains to a certain race or classification of card, you can mix and match decks card by card or by using Codex's which are packs of 6 cards thata you earn through the single player missions that may benefit each other or just be good to play together, each deck has a maximum of 30 cards which is 5 Codex's, there are 4 codex's per race including normal cards.\n\nThe visual side of the game is great, cards are very smooth and battle animations arereally cool.\nI would heartily reccommend getting on board with Faeria whilst it develops if you are a fan of the genre.\n\nVery well rounded, even in early acces, this gets my full reccomendations :)\n","May 22","true","4.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It combines hte best of both worlds.  Want a resource system that is deeper than hearthstone, this has it,  Another example is it can like chess with cards, except the cards have a attack and health value.  The game shows a lot of promise for EA.\n\nWish their was a co-op player for environement game mode in the game and also wish there was team versus team game mode.  It helps that the music is very atomspehereic and well done.\n\nThis is one of those games where seeing it in action on a lets play or review of its gameplay is better in video format.  Though to summerize what I do and don't lihe...\n\nPositives\n\n-Resource system and battling area lets player be creative with their play styles.  Really promotes back and forth gameplay of coming back to win.\n-No resource system like Magic the gather and HEx shards of fate that would cause the player have a shortage / flood of resources based upon pure luck.  Win base of manuavering and out-thinking the enemy more of the time!\n-Music / Sound is very well done\n-Can buy the entire first set for $50\n\nNegatives.. AS a Early Access game, again as a Early Access game.\n\n-Deck is limited to 30 cards, would like to see it doubled to 60.\n-Maps need to be bigger, which will allow for bigger decks\n-Bigger maps mean more players can play at once.","May 4","true","18.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Similar to hearthstone, but much deeper strategy both in the short term and long term. Usually, the more skilled player will win the game, which makes winning feel more rewarding and losing feel less frustrating and as if there is something you can learn from each game.\n\nPersonally I've played Hearthstone for 18 months, throwing around £500 into it in order to play at a competitive level. Since discovering Faeria, every time I go back to try and play Hearthstone, I am thoroughly bored and just wish I was playing Faeria.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategical card games.","May 24","true","204.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It is built around rushing and rushing being the best strat.  There are not enough counters or healing in the game to stop them and I don't know how devs could miss that since that is why rushing is good in hearthstone.  Put more heals that are good and usuable and nerf rush.

Even after some recent patches the game is still very bad.

Early on you get 250 coins per challenge but you soon realise that this is only temporary. You will realise that green decks stomp pub matches and their costs to play the cards are utter BS in comparison to the others. You pay 25$ for early access and then on top of that if you want all the cards in the current game you have to ay an extra 50$.

It is a little bit hard to learn because of the land mechanic, but incredibly easy to master.\n\nAfter having played about sixty games in my life, the fact that i can consistently beat top "god level" player in tournaments is problematic. It would be impossible with so little time on any other card game. Once you understand the basic mechanics of lands and faeria, this game can be mastered in a few hours. Overall the decision making is very poor right now for someone with a little bit of common sense.\n\nThe second biggest problems is that there is no deck diversity : in the last tournament meta, only 2 decks were played. The devs have having trouble to balance a card game, which is probably the most important thing in a "competitive" card game. It seems abrakam are having trouble finding good game designers, which is normal for such a small company.\n\nIf you have any competitive goal in a card game, I do not recommend buying this game. I don't think there is any competitive future to it : cards are unbalanced, bugs everywhere, close to zero viewer on twitch, and most importantly, all the big tournament are run by the same organisation, which is changing rules as they please during the tournaments.\n\nImagine if Archon had all rights on HS world championship(who plays, who streams, what the rules are) : that would be unnaceptable for the community. I hope that people will understand how shady the role of Gamers Origin is in Faeria right now, and do something about it.","April 17","false","52.9"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","7","21","3","2"

Still, even if the game does not feel "pay to win" _ as skill matters more than your collection, it is also not exactly "free to play" (even considering the Early Access payment), as quite a lot of good cards are Epics, and so pretty hard to get. It's then quite difficult to create a really competitive deck as a F2P player.\n\nApart from that, the game is entertaining, visually it's a masterpiece, and skill is rewarded.\n\nAs for the game features, it is still lacking an ingame chat or emotes (but devs say they're working on it), and Pandora (draft) mode should soon be released, thus refreshing our game experience.\n\nOn the whole, I would rate it 8/10 (the missing numbers would be because of frustrating F2P grinding)","April 29","true","128.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
