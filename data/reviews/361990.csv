Never played something like this before.\nIt feels like a little sandbox Friday the 13th.\nGet drunk, get naked, swim naked in the lake with your friends, then have a nice foursome in the cabin... but be prepared for the killer around or even kill your friends before he does. ;D\nSurvive, get killed, wield an axe as a naked, blood-smeared psychopath and throw your friends into the woodchipper, while you slide down a zip-line! Everything is possible. And it's funny as hell.^^\nBut it can also get really terrifying!\nIt manages to hold a nearly perfect balance between fun and horror and the atmosphere can get real close to the classic movies it refers to. But after all it's still a 'sandbox' where nearly everything is possible. You can easily create your very own story here.

The fact that this game was created by a single person shocks me, for it is so detailed and so perfectly displays all of the horror movie tropes we have come to know and love through the years. To thoroughly enjoy this game you must have an imagination to craft a story for these characters, who are basically blank canvases meant to have a personality crafted for them by the player. There also is a briliantly crafted yet oddloy convoluted story that at this point has not been fully revealed due to the fact that only two episodes have been released thus far, yet if you are a person who is fit and able to search out a hidden backstory within a game will be pleasantly suprised. The gameplay is simple due to the fact that it completely revolves around a pick up and throw mechanic I have not seen in any other two dimensional pixelated indie games, yet it feels like this mechanic should have been used from the start in the horror game genre. The second episode feels like an entirely different game, due to the fact that the creator chose to go with a Texas Chainsaw Massacre approach instead of his usual Friday The 13th feel, but still proves to be as incredibly, if not even more, replayable. What the creator has accomplished thus far is incredible, being that he is a single developer who is somehow able to create a game that I, and many others would consider better than most triple a titles released this year. Few other games had me constantly checking the developers twitter for updates on the games progress, and I dont even have an account on that site. This game is so criminaly underplayed that it makes me sick. If you are a fan of anything horror related, it is a neccesity that you buy this game, and if the creator of this game sees this post, please make me a tester, for never before have I wanted to be involved in a games developement more than I would to have the privalige to help you develope this amazing game.","July 20, 2015","true","148.4"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","56","59","2","0"

It's not just a game. It's... something entirely different. You turn into this potential murder (you can kill your friends if you wish to) even though the objective is to survive the horrors of each chapter. It captures the essence of 80s horror movies exceptionally well with a lot of goofiness moments and easter eggs (if you're a fan of horror movies you're gonna love Lakeview Cabin). Considering you can replay each of every episode and have different results and find new secrets, Lakeview Cabin is a bargain.\n\nIf you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video (let's play):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0zBSitqrMM&index=1&list=PLBqXrq67D6oprkVyFEP0w2OyywxqKoO3F","April 10, 2015","true","55.1"," 64 of 76 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","64","76","4","2"

Something.\n\nBasically, the premise is that you play through rip offs of classic horror movies. LVC 3 apes Friday the 13th, LVC4 apes Texas Chainsaw Massacre, LVC 5 apes Halloween, and I'm not sure what 6 apes yet.\n\nEach level is an open ended adventure puzzle game, essentially, with each one having distinct objectives. For instance, in 3 you are simply trying to ward off the killers without all four of your teenagers (that you control one at a time) dying. In 4, you are searching a truly demented mansion and slaughterhouse for gas so the band you play as can make their next gig. In 5, you try to avoid a Michael Meyers esque killer while summoning monsters that can bring him down.\n\nThere's a lot to like with this game. For one, each level is very distinct from the others. The first is probably the most open ended and trial and error one, because it's a very small, confined setting. It's the one that is quite tough to figure out, but once you do, it's pretty rewarding. Plus, there are lots of things you can do in the environment, so it's fun to experiment. While 3 is relatively tame despite the gore, 4 and 5 ramp up the creep factor. Yes, believe it or not, this game actually manages to be pretty disturbing and creepy thanks to its sound design and creative use of visuals. Both 4 and 5 have an extremely macabre and dark feeling to them that 3 simply does not, and it's pretty welcome.\n\nI will say that certain elements stand out as flawed. For one, the layout of the buildings in 4 is entirely RNG, and it can glitch so that, without giving too much away, you can't continue. This is really annoying, as I've died more than once in that level simply because of the rng. Additionally, 5 is one I simply needed a guide for. Originally, I felt bad, but after actually seeing the solution, I don't, because it's very obtuse. Fun and macabre, but very, very obtuse.\n\nStill, this is worth checking out for people who love old horror films and are in the mood for something different. It's definitely not a game that holds your hand, and you may need a guide every now and then, but the wonderful mixture of humor and truly disturbing content as well as the open ended gameplay make this stand out as a real gem. I'm looking forward to the sequel, and hope that the creator refines it even more to make an even better game than this one.","May 27","true","11.3"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","36","36","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAllenJ/recommended/361990/","MrAllenJ","Mr. Allen J The Maniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAllenJ/","121 products in account","I heavily recommend this game. Lakeview Cabin is a sidescrolling game with pretty simple graphics, and a rather interesting concept. While it may look simple, the gameplay is actually pretty complex and requires planning, tactics, and timing. This is technically an episodic series, and as of this writing, there is only one episode out (Other than the secret one). The first episide's plot is simple: you're playing as a bunch of teenagers in a summer camp on an island, which gets invaded by various killers, and your goal is to kill them, or be killed yourself. The main draw of this game is that there's no single path to take as you dispatch the killers. There's a TON of options and variety - but at the same time, you'll have to do a TON of experimenting and planning to see what does and does not work. It's... pretty trial and error, honestly. While I don't like that brand of gameplay, it's pretty rewarding once you succeed. However, if your plan fails even slightly, most of the time you're better off just starting from scratch. Alternatively, you can do whatever the hell you want - the game doesn't punish you until the killers come. So, for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, you can play out your very own 80's horror movie scenario! Once you figure out how things work, now comes the fun part! A thing I love about this game is that you can't take the killers on up front: you have to either trap them, or put them in a vulnerable state, before you attack. Meaning planning, planning, planning. You're going have to prepare and set things up before they arrive or you're screwed. Seriously. Don't even try it if you're not prepared. You won't win.\n\nTo say something negative about the game... it's pretty difficult, to the point of being unfair. You're probably better off looking up a walkthrough. And like pretty much every horror game, the fright factor dissipates... pretty quickly. After a few run ins with the monster, it becomes predictable as you know when it's going to show up. Fortunately, the game doesn't bombard you with jump scares (I don't recall a single jumpscare!), most of the horror comes from the "oh ♥♥♥♥, is it here yet!?" suspense... which wears off the second you realize the obvious cues. Honestly, I don't regard this as too much of a horror game, because of the aforementioned reasons. Oh yeah, there's also the simplistic graphics - but that shouldn't be too much of a problem if you can handle "retro" graphics. Which is honestly better than attempts at ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dreamcast era 3D.\n\nAll in all, Lakeview is a pretty fun game that has a surprising amount of depth and gameplay, albeit with it lacking in graphics and being incredibly difficult. But hey, it's worth the five dollars you'll spend on this.\n\n... Writing this was probably a waste of time. It'll just get buried under all the attempts to be funny. >_>","April 22, 2015","true","38.9"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","37","39","4","0"

It's sandbox survival that perfectly encapsulates the tension of B-grade slasher flicks. You're given control of 4 survivors at once, all of which are about as useless as you'd expect if you've seen the genre before.\n\nNeedless to say, this game is extremely difficult, as by the first night you'll more often than not be under attack from a few enemies at once, each of which is vastly stronger than your party combined. This, admittedly makes for a good challenge, however, when you're done screwing around with all of the tools and mechanics at your disposal, the core gameplay comes down to memorizing how to unlock various items and where to collect them.\n\nIt's fun to kick around in and definitely worth the modest price tag, but be sure to play in private; the true horror experience comes from trying to explain to a loved one, or housemate, that having an ingame orgy is crucial to your survival.","April 10, 2015","true","6.9"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","42","47","13","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/361990/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","There haven't really been a lot of slasher-inspired games thus far, something that Until Dawn will hopefully change. It's strange, too, because they constitute such a major part of horror in cinema, and have all the components of a worthwhile game. Lakeview Cabin Collection puts those components on display in the best way possible, by letting you combine them as you like. And the result is surprisingly addictive.\n\n"Lakeview Cabin" is the title of an in-universe series of horror movies, centered around the titular cursed lake. The game chucks you right onto the street outside the theater, which you can enter to select a movie to enjoy. You can also huck boxes, beat up hobos, plunge toilets, eat popcorn, and harass the cinema staff. It's a great introduction to the ridiculous sandbox nature of the game. On a controller, A lifts and drops things, X throws, shoots, eats, or uses, B enters doorways, and Y lets you switch between controllable characters (4 to a scene). And yes, those commands work on almost every single thing in the game, including people. And their parts.\n\nAt this time, LCC contains two episodes, III and IV. V and VI are promised for the future, but I will say up front that the current two are worth the price of admission alone. Episode III is a perfect send-up of Friday the 13th, giving you control of four teens partying on an island. There are beers to drink, bongs to hit, clothes to strip, and fully-functional beds. When night falls, a strange and relentless killer may show up, which you need to puzzle out a way to defeat. It's harder than it sounds because (A) the killer can take a LOT of punishment, and (B) certain elements of the episode are randomized. Your shotgun may not be loaded, or the tools might be hidden in another cabin. The killer also approaches from where you'll least expect him. I'm not kidding, either. If you camp out with weapons, he'll lay low, so you actually have to do idiot horror movie things to draw him out. Which you're going to do anyway, because interacting with the chaotic, bloody world is irresistably fun.\n\nIf episode III is an homage to Friday the 13th, episode IV is an amazing recreation of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Your band is stuck on the grounds of the Lakeview Slaughterhouse, and you'll have to do plenty of slaughtering to escape. The creator of LCC listened to feedback about episode III being to puzzley, so IV is far more focused on action. There are tons of freaks and killers to fight and trick as you find your way through their house of horrors, the layout of which is randomized every time you play. However, what really got me about IV was how perfectly it apes the look of TCM, even in pixel form. The whole episode looks ♥♥♥♥ing gross, with clashing colors, washed-out exteriors, equal helpings of gore and disturbing imagery, and some truly messed-up foes.\n\nDespite how entertaining getting your characters high and knocking them into a wood chipper is, Lakeview Cabin Collection still manages to be genuinely scary. Waiting for the killer at the lake or getting spotted by a psycho in the slaughterhouse comes with a perfect audio stinger and a rush of adrenaline as you scramble to respond. The enemies are appropriately deadly and require careful planning to overcome, so there's always an air of dread to encounters. Admittedly, there's not much depth to the antagonists, and that's one place the game could really stand to improve. They just beat on you, or grab weapons and beat on you. Seeing them set traps or kidnap characters would add some variety, but what's there now certainly doesn't get in the way of the fun. And it's such a rare thing, to have a game that's fun and scary in equal measure. Appropriate, too, since that's how the best slasher films are.","October 28, 2015","true","2.4"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","34","37","0","1"

"Shrouded in a dense fog with the voices of the despaired dead arising, the tainted blood of B-horror movies oozes out of a computer monitor..."  Yep.  I see the bloody puddles under my chair.  Next to a dirty pair of socks.  Arrgh, my *last* good dirty pair of socks too.  Time to fire up some jump scares and spoopy spoops.\n\nI skinny dipped into the game that night -  a blind playthrough.  Okay,  *truthfully* I would likely leave my underwear on ( modesty be damned ), but you get the idea.  What do you think I discovered?  Why, nothing less than a schizo-spasmic pixelated horror-fest of episodic blood-spattered evil!   And there were pugs too -little ones, running around the screen. Oh, the humanity!\n\nYou start outside of a movie theatre in the dead of night, with the disturbing sounds of a dangerous city all around.  Move forward, pick up a few items, search around a bit, and you’ll find the movie theatre dead ahead with three feature films on hand.  These are the episodes you’ll be playing. You can pick any one of them in any order.  I started out with the first door I saw, episode III,  which featured a summer camp terrorized by some rather quick footed serial killers a la "Friday the 13th". Looking at my surroundings I realized I am playing as a group of people, clicking back and forth between them as I would a hand of cards.  So, I can be a teen dude-stud or the cute girl next door.  I searched around and looked inside a building to find a...bedroom.\n\nRight away, I was able to make myself naked on a bed in a cabin having sex with a girl with the sole intention of seeing if I could.  Boom-shocka-locka, it worked!  And that was actually part of the game!  I swear those dudes were digitally man-scaped too.  That's the kind of game Lakeview Cabin Collection is: an ode to teen slasher movies with all the intrinsically nasty bits included.\n\nGAMEPLAY & STORY\nWhat is this ode to cinema-du-slash all about?  A survival horror zombie-fest with robo-dinosaurs, perhaps? Pfft.  Puh-lease.  This game is about surviving the nights of murdering crazies and killing them off while unlocking the secrets of the episode.  I think.  In any case: kill or die, that much is apparent.  I began to hunt for clues, take things apart, and solve some puzzles without much idea of what was going on or why.  Oddly, it's a bit like an adventure game in this way with using combinations of items, unlocking hidden things in the background, trying out items on the killers, etc.  And also, there is a significant strategy in attacking the baddies at night.  Yet, it's quite open in design.  Unlike many games, you don't need to perform an action in an *exact* way in order to progress...and for that I am incredibly happy.  Your option list is extremely varied.  A little too varied, even.  Sort of like trying to choose what to eat at a buffet with lots of goodies at the bar.  There are a ton of different ways to approach those killers: motorcycle of death, beer can, gas container, oven fire, lamp oil, hammer, musical instrument, teddy bear, etc.  Granted, some of those items won't do a single thing.  You'll find quite a bit of trial and error in the gameplay.  Which again, may or may not irritate the player into a game rage.  To complete an episode you must kill all the killers. So, best not to goof off *too* much before you end up a pixelated stain on the floor.\n\nWhat becomes immediately apparent is that you are going to die. Repeatedly.  Over and over and over and over and...well, over.  I can see how that can turn some folks off.  There is only so much you can take of planning a stage, setting up all the right parts, doing all the correct actions, trying your best, and seeing it all fall apart when a slasher is too resilient and kills every last one of your group. For that, I do chalk this game up as - NOT EASY.  Prepare to sink some hours in.\n\nAfter finishing episode III, I popped into episode IV.  And by that, I mean I died non-stop for a very long time.  This episode is about an all-girl rock band stuck in a compound with a family of serial killers that are simply waiting to be discovered.  Unlike before, you are running to the killers instead of running away as they sneak up.  You're going to be exploring what seems like an endless series of rooms filled to the brim with bloody, twisted murdering nightmare scenes.  It's harrowing to say the least and you get slashed at every few seconds.  But you *do* get to fight back.  One time I ended up soaking my whole screen in red.  Honestly, even after an hour of playing this level I felt like I barely scratched the surface.  It was amazing fun, and a challenge I thoroughly enjoyed, but I was pretty damned horrible at even trying to win this level.  I had to stop and try out episode V.  I knew when I was out of my league.\n\nNow, episode V is much slower.  More along the lines of episode III and I felt like I could tackle it better. Well, at least in the beginning I thought I could.  This episode was hiding more from me than the others.  It's set in - let's say 1987 - you once again are a group of teens and there is a ethereal serial killer involved along with a sort of purgatory of spirits where your soul goes to when you die. You have to figure out what needs to happen when your soul arrives there both before and after you are resurrected - with very cryptic hints.  The puzzles involved are more elusive than in episode III, and the order in which you complete them is slightly more important to finish the episode.  Not that it's linear in that way, I solved several of the puzzles completely out of order, but there is a set of actions that has to be figured out in order to complete the grand puzzle involved.  It's not easy.  Not at all.  And I hate to admit it, but I had to look up a guide just to move on  after getting stuck for hours.   There were secret numbers and codes involved, some hidden in a way that I honestly would NEVER have guessed.  Even looking at someone's guide for hints when I got stuck, I *still* think it was quite hard.  And the cartridge video game...OMG the video game...that took me ages to figure out on my own until I accidentally got it with a naked girl ending. Too bad that wasn't the end!  It was just a small part of a grander series of puzzles to complete.  I'd be spoiling it to tell you any more, but once you attack the killer with all the evil at hand, you will get that euphoric "I BEAT IT!" feeling we all know and love.  Now, I want to go back to episode IV.  And I have.  Still trying as a matter of fact.  The chainsaw dude is just insanely hard to kill for me and I have a feeling there are a lot more people hidden in that house.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nCome into this game with an open mind about surviving in a horror movie, *lots* of patience, and knowing full well you will die repeatedly.  Perhaps even killed by stepping on farm tools!  It's not an easy game to complete and you will likely get stumped - maybe a lot.  Be careful you don't get chipped away in a wood chipper when you are not looking! 8.5/10.\n\nDisclaimer: A review key was provided by the developer.","March 16","true","8.2"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","2"

And then the third chapter is going to surprise you even more, going from slashers to mystery thriller territory.\n\nThe graphics may look simplistic, but there are a lot of nice touches like the sun flickering in the lake or an oscillating weather vane. Overall cartoony art style plays greatly for the whole parody thing, sometimes you just can't help but laugh (maybe with some hysteria notes) watching a chibi-proportioned maniac with an axe closing in on your poor hero. Even more hilarious when overly dramatical high-pitched cello music starts playing and scare chords empathize his blows.\n\nAll in all, Lakeview Cabin Collection is a great game, which manages not only to capture the feel of the old horrors, but does it in just right proportions and, most of all, has a solid, interesting and challenging gameplay.\n\nAs of today, this game has roughly 12k owners according to Steamspy. It definitely deserves more attention!\n\nP.S.

I enjoyed the overall theme of horror-comedy, enhanced by the pixelated art style, the music and - again - the trial and error sand-box game play.\n\nSaid trial and error gameplay does mean the game will likely be harder as one begins, but becomes significantly easier as one figures things out, though one puzzle was particularly obscure, which is my only real complaint. Even then I'd say it's a matter of personal preference.\n\nNot particularly lengthy, but it doesn't have to be. It was still very engaging, fun, and still a bit creepy now and again. There are a few minor bugs, but they generally do not get in the way of gameplay and the dev has been fairly good at ironing them out as he hears of them so I have faith they'll eventually be worked out.\n\nI definitely recommend this.

This is a work in progress review, I will update this review when the other episodes are released.\n\nLakeview Cabin 3- Review\n\nLakeview Cabin Collection took me by surprise once it was released. I played the original flash game and thought the idea was very interesting and had a lot of potential and then I saw that the original developer made a new game, on a bigger scale.\n\nTo begin with the game doesn't hold your hand when you start playing, you have to figure out everything by yourself otherwise you won't get anywhere.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You take control of four campers who get attacked by serial killers and it's up to you to survive. You can set up traps or you can try and take down the killers with brute force, but it's best to take the cautious approach otherwise you won't survive.\n\nThe audio is really well done and is one of the games best features. The sound effects are awesome and sound a lot like the effects in those very cheesy slasher movies that the game is based of.\n\nThe game is overall really well made apart from a few minor bugs like characters not picking up the thing you want them to pick up.\n\nLakeview Cabin 3 is a really great episode and a good start to what seems to be a very promising game. I give Lakeview Cabin 3 a 8.5/10\n\nLakeview Cabin 4- Review\n\nLakeview Cabin is the second episode in the Collection.  The first episode took us to a camp site like Friday the 13th, but this time we go to a mansion and try not to get killed by a crazy cannibal family.\n\nLakeview Cabin 4 changes a lot of gameplay aspects from the first episode. This time you need to find 4 gas canisters to fuel up your car and escape a mansion full of crazy cannibals, but to get them you need to kill a lot of people.  Killing increases your crazy meter which makes the screen go crazy and makes more jump scares appear. Enemies are easier to kill but there's more of them and now there's stealth to avoid an even bigger threat which you can't kill so you will have to be more careful.\n\nThis episode is very interesting and it feels fresh which I like a lot. Now for the good. The audio is still really good. The gameplay is very fun and challenging which is a lot of fun. Funny like always and the graphics are awesome.\n\nBut there are a few problems. This episode was really buggy. An enemy hit me through a door which was closed, and of course the same problem where my character wouldn't pick up what I wanted to pick up. The random aspect of the episode is a great way to add replay value, but for people who have a hard time with the game might have more trouble since they can't learn from they're mistakes.\n\nOverall it's still a very fun game and I can't wait to play Episode 3 or Lakeview Cabin 5 whatever you want to call it. It's worth the full price without a doubt. I give Lakeview Cabin 4 a 7.5/10\n\nLakeview Cabin 5 - Review\n\nTaking  a detour from the previous play style of the other episodes the third episode of Lakeview Cabin takes more of a puzzle game approach. Lakeview Cabin 5 makes you play as four teenagers again in a place that is taken straight out of Halloween the movie.\n\nThe goal in this episode is quite different. You can't die this time, but you have one goal to figure out how to kill a murderer who is immortal.\n\nAs stated before this takes a more slow paced approach than the other two episodes. This time it's more about puzzle solving than anything. I liked the puzzle solving in this episode and some of the puzzles are incredibly crazy not to mention some of the solutions are absurd, but it's incredibly fun non the less.\n\nWhen I began this episode, I loved the retro feel. It felt like Halloween the movie with Nightmare on Elm Street characters. This for me the best looking Lakeview Cabin Episode by far.\n\nNow for the bad and there is a lot this time. The episode is the buggiest episode by far. I had to relaunch the episode several times after finishing one of the puzzles due to the audio cutting out after I finish it. Not to mention the very weird movement of the killer. Sometimes he doesn't attack you at all and just jitters and place.\n\nIn the end I loved Lakeview Cabin Episode 3, because of the puzzle solving aspect. In the end if the bugs weren't there I would say it's the best episode right now.\n\nIf you don't own Lakeview Cabin Collection right now, you just simply need to get it. It's one of the most fun you can have with a horror title.\n\nLakeview Cabin 5 gets a 8/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I was the lucky winner of this game on one of the steam groups I belong to, and I was pleasantly surprised with the creepy pixelated experience.\n\nReally, the game page says it all:\n\n”Relive the horror movies of the 70's and 80's by answering the question: What would you do if you found yourself in a slasher film?”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what the game is: A perfect, pixelated representation of your typical horror movie of the 80’s. There you have the girls with their lovely hair, and the boys with their handsome beards, and the creepy lake, and the cabins, and the creepy nude stalker…\n\n\nWait, what? o.O\n\nThe game is a horror/comedy/parody/adventure type of game. Your goal? To prepare yourself to survive the creepy, murdering monster as long as possible. Or, you know, you could just hide forever.\n\nThere are several characters for you to deal with, and switching between them is super easy.\nYou get to explore the cabins, find items to aid you with surviving, places to hide, and weapons to use against the horrors of the night. Whenever you get hurt, you actually… get hurt. As in, you miss a leg and you’ll be hopping down that pixelated grass on one leg while bleeding off. the game spares no expenses in the pixelated gore.\n\nYou can also kill yourself, kill others, and promptly die when you’re the only one left to face the evil from the lake. There’s more than one way to kill or be killed, and exploring them all is as fun as playing the game as you should be. :)\nAnd you know what’s more satisfactory than surviving? Not giving the monster the chance to kill you all off, by doing it yourself first. :P\n\nThe game is mostly funny to play, but it also, despite being just pixels, manages to be sufficiently creepy as to unnerve you.  The replayability is fairly decent, as you can just replay it to see how many different ways you find to survive, whether you can kill the monster at all, and how long you can last.\n\nIf you’re into a bit of pixelated parody horror, give this one a try! Be warned, though: If you want to play this as it’s intended (as opposed to killing everyone yourself, actually laying traps out for the evil thing), be prepared to be a bit frustrated at the time constraints until you get the hang of what to do.\n\nLooking forward to future episodes!","July 8, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeltHunter/recommended/361990/","PeltHunter","Pelt Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeltHunter/","448 products in account","This is a completely new review. My last one only told of my experience and nothing about the game mechanics. First off, you control 1 of 4 teenagers at any given time that can be cycled through at will. There are different ones in the 4 episodes that come with Lakeview Cabin Collection, although Cabin 6 is in beta currently, you can still play it. Each "movie" is set in a different setting with (obviously) different characters and maniacal serial killers. Some of them even have multiple killers... I'm looking at you Cabin 4...\n\nThe game really builds a sense of dread as you take down the killer with one blast and you approach him to see if he's dead he'll inevitably pop up, bash you, take your weapon and murder you. From that, you'll be so shook up, while you may have 3 more characters to formulate a plan, they will likely all perish in a rather gory fashion until you wise up and search for more supplies hidden and use them to your advantage with your surroundings.\n\nThe game does not shy away from dark and gory subject matter either as a lot of my screenshots can attest. All in all, it keeps the surprises coming. It consistently will make you jump. You know the little pixellated killer may pop out or is just on the other side of the door, your heart rate won't care, it will climb. You will get panicked. Then you'll die and try again. It's a very fun game that has basic puzzles you uncover through exploration and using the tools at hand rather logically.\n\nSound also plays a major role. You may find certain items by listening when you throw something... is that a sock that sounds metallic when thrown? Must be something inside... Is the music ratcheting up when nearing a door? That psychopath may be ready to pounce out... just maybe...\n\nIt's impressive what a one-man team was able to produce on this. The level of detail for pixel graphics and the sound is impressive. Wind chimes blow in the breeze. There's a day/night cycle with some light weather effects. I couldn't recommend it more.","May 7","true","1.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

This game has everything any survival horror fan could ever want. The original archtypical horror tropes, the campy music and atmosphere... A harking back to the good old days of horror.\n\nThe game can't be described in a single word, it's fun, hilarious, challenging, addicting and even for being a 2D game, scared the crap out of me multiple times. It's truly a labor of love from the developer and it shows.\n\nI bought this game for 7 dollars but would gladly have paid the 10+ for it.... it's worth every cent. Massive amounts of replay value.

You'll definitely need a guide to finish these games but the fun is in learning the mechanics and testing different things out for yourself.\n\nHighly recommended for any horror fan / horror game lover.","January 2","true","15.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

Drawing from various horror films, it let's you deal with the creeps in your own way. So far two of it's episodes are out, and both are fanastic, with a very fun, and creepy feel.\n\nOne thing I enjoy immensly, is the freedom to play it as I choose. Do I sacrifice one member of my party to try killing a monster? Do I hide them all and try to figure out some elaborate trap? It's all up to you.\n\nThe second chapter is as good as the first, with a huge homage to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre cannibal style films. The creator even used a lovely kind of washed out look for the colors, to give it that 70's camera vibe.\n\nThe value of this game is great, and, with even more episodes coming, I can promise if you love horror, twisted comedy, or are bored of the constant Zombie/Survival games, give this one a try.\n\n10/10.","July 15, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It does it In the proper way, using atmosphere, timing and many of the tricks from the well-thumbed slasher film rulebook. The game uses sound and score superbly in this regard, the sudden cries of the crows seem filled with portent, the creak of a rafter, a door opening somewhere off screen. It all helps build the tension beautifully.  The charm of the chunky sprites and backgrounds lend extra heft to the stabs of panic inducing action, too. The cute pixel characters offset nicely against the horrific situations.\n\nFor me, each episode of Lakeview gets better with every attempt. While the challenge of getting one character to the end of an episode without significant blood loss would probably not be enough to keep me playing, it is the detail in the design of each distinct episode and the individual stories that have me returning for more. All the episodes are challenging and amusing in their own macabre ways, each having more emphasis on certain of Lakeview's gameplay elements. If I had to pick a favourite it'd be the puzzle heavy Episode 5. The supernatural elements are clevery used and the suburban setting is perfect, right down to the kid brother's toy laser gun.\n\nMy only criticism is one that could possibly be chalked up to my own inferior grey matter. I simply cannot fathom what to do in episode 4. It's great fun to play but invariably I end up with every character reduced to a fine pixel paste within ten minutes and not the foggiest glimmer of a clue about how to progress on the next attempt. As far as I can tell the aim is simply to be suddenly butchered in the most amusing way possible.\n\nAs an homage to 70's and 80's horror and slasher films as well as classic adventure/puzzle games they don't come much better than this one.  Looking forward to Episode 6!","April 10","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Movies like Tucker and Dale vs Evil or Shaun of the Dead aren't so much scary as they are kind of gross or gory sometimes, but the comedy is solid and the movies themselves are excellent.\n\nLakeview Cabin is a unique example of the genre.  When someone says Lakeview Cabin is Horror Comedy, what they mean is that it epitomizes both separate genres equally.  Lakeview Cabin is tense and freaky and, in general, simply excellent at that Horror trick of making you do something while every part of your body tells you not to, especially considering its crude, pixelly style (or, perhaps, partially because of it).  Your heart will race as you try to execute that last, desperate plan to save your own skin as an immortal serial murderer bares down on you in the dark.  At the same time, the freedom it allows the player in its little sandbox levels, combined with the game's swift, incredibly violent consequences of poor decision making, almost immediately opens up a world of hugely bloody, absurd comedy.  In few other games can you run to pick up a shotgun and blast a monster in the face only to discover it is empty, and the only other nearby object is a small pug which has been wandering the island carefree for days now, and in no other games can you desperately pick up that pug and try to hurl it at your killer's face, only for it to soar into a nearby running woodchipper instead, spraying blood and bits of bone at a hapless friend standing nearby.\n\nThe game has a sick and hilarious sense of humor, and, at the same time, is thrilling, tense, and off-puttingly weird.  Is that pregnant redneck trapped in the attic the source of all these slimy, bloodthirsty creatures slithering and snuffling through the walls?

Four "episodes" (plus a hub area), each based on a classic horror franchise (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, ect). You are given control of four characters with the goal being not getting killed. How you go about doing so is up to you. Will you go mano a mano with the killers? (bad Idea) Will you set up traps and try to lure them in? Will you just hide under a bed, cry, and hope they don't find you? There's a lot of trial and error involved and you'll be restarting episodes from scratch every time you fail, but there's a real sense of accomplishment when a plan finally works and you make it through. This is an overlooked gem and is perfect for the Halloween season or if you just want some late-night bloody fun.","October 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuehnau/recommended/361990/","kuehnau","Kuehnau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuehnau/","284 products in account","The Lakeview Cabin Collection is a surivival horror action puzzle game for STEAM.\n\nBefore I talk about what I disliked about it, let me talk about what I enjoyed. It covers several genres of horror that I grew up with, from the killers, to the scenes and settings. The nostalgila factor alone already makes this game pretty good.\n\nI like the art, it's retro, while still having it's own style and being able to separate itself from all the games that use the entire concept of retro art it's whole selling point.\n\nThe game also manages to be able to tell a story in a very basic manner without needing to have any sort of text. And I respect that. They did it in a much better way then Scott could ever hope to do with Five Nights At Freddies.\n\nNow for the bad. To begin with, the controls are kind of wonky, it's going to take you awhile to get used to the very minimalistic controls they use. The game uses 'context senestive' icons to let you know when you can perform an action, but it isn't always clear what it is or what it's used for.\n\nThe hit detection in this game is terrible. 9 out of 10 times, an enemy will hit me before I even get remotely close to it, but the game, for whatever reason, seems to think I need to be right on top of an enemy to attack it. There's hard and then there's poor programming and this game could use a better combat system. At least give players the same attack reach the enemies do, that's only fair.\n\nWhile the game advertises itself as a 'sandbox' game, the reality is, each "feature" feels like the developers had a very specific idea on how the features should be solved. There's a lot of junk laying around, but a large majority of it simply doesn't feel useful in any sense.\n\nIt's kind of like Lemmings. The developers had a very specific idea on how every puzzle should be solved and while some people managed to avoid it, luck out and still win a stage, many others were left scratching their heads.\n\nFinally, the puzzles in the game are simply atrocious. Many of them, you won't understand what's going on unless you watch or read some sort of guide. It suffers from the same 90's adventure point and click game issues, where nonsensical actions result in a reaction that helps you. From banging a lady on a bed to find a key, to pooping in a toilet to drop a stuffed bear, the end result is, what were they thinking?\n\nHere's the thing, I appreciate the game and the concept of it. There's a lot of it I actually do like, but so much of it has made me so frustrated that I had to stop playing. The developers clearly workd hard on this product, but a lot of times the direction and mechanics feel really off.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I could have gotten a refund, but I decided not to. But unless you have a great mind of super obscure puzzles, unfair mechanics and bad hit detection, most of you would be better left off not buying this game. I suggest you play the FREE Lakeview Cabin game first, it's a java based game and will show you everything you need to see to decide to buy the game or not.","December 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","12","30","0","0"

I only saw the antagonist once in the game after a half hour of just wandering around. The most frustrating thing is that when you do get something to do the game just throws it at you and gives no time to respond. There's absolutely no tutorial or anything to help the player along, they're just throw in without a paddle. It's frustratingly boring when it's not frustratingly confusing.\nI'm fine with checking a wiki occasionally but I shouldn't to open the damn thing every five seconds. A good concept poorly excuted.Asthetically it is interesting but when you actually get down to it it's pretty lackluster.

Once the mystique of witnessing an uncensored drunken orgy get brutally interrupted by a neotenous, axe wielding psychopath wore off, I started to realize how terribly this game is designed.\n\nBut even design aside, I could forgive the needlessly convoluted item system, and I could forgive the wonky controls and questionable art style (even by pixel art standards). The real issue with this game is that it is presented as a "sandbox" experience...but there's just not all that much to do. Think Scribblenauts, but without any kind of creative canvas at your disposal. You're basically just running around as long as you can, picking up rakes and turning wood chippers off and on...and throwing that red-headed, open-shirted man♥♥♥♥♥ into it for sleeping with your girlfriend....until the maniac comes to kill you.\n\nAnd don't even bother with Lakeview Cabin IV. It is beyond monotenous. It's just a "mouse-in-a-maze" type of situation. By the time I started mapping out a path through that slaughterhouse, I was very, very tired of playing already.\n\nI can't really recommend it, honestly. Save that ten dollars and buy some delicious nuts and berries or something.

Meanwhile, I was bumrushed by the killer my first 4 playthroughs, and didn't have ANY atmospheric buildup until attempt 5.  At that point I was ready to just go hard for the killer, so I didn't care, there was no suspense, it was just frustrating to have all these laid out traps then have to wait for the guy to get around to spawning.\n\nAll the difficulty is figuring out the basics of what things are, where things are and what to do.  After that it's a cakewalk.  The AI is super predictable, the killer's easily tracked for his every move.  Maybe this gets better with the later episodes but the starting episode did not impress me at all.\n\nMaybe I'd feel differently if I had time to goof around, or a clear way to trigger the monster/killer portion of it, or had gotten more of the atmosphere.  Maybe I'll try for all the achievements next, but the game came off as more tedium than fun.","April 22, 2015","false","4.4"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","10","37","0","0"

Get drunk and run around naked. Run your friends over with a moped.  Jump down from balcony and break your leg. And the next moment beat your friends with that broken off leg :D\n\nI think that the graphics are just right for this kind of a game. That's of course juts my opinion.\n\nIn this game there is much to do and not enough time to do it! I recommend this game but you should still do your research before you buy it...although 10 euros isn't that much money.\n9/10","April 17, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the babies it has the blood, it has the music, and it has all the fun of slasher movies including the sexy bits we all know and love. Find the freaks that are murdering and burn them stab them taunt them and wood chip them. I would say it is one of the best indie game's that has come out in a while, most are copy paste unity,UE3 ect this one is completely stylized in a good way but making you feel it is old school and with all the great parody refrences of movies we all know, and probably love.","April 15, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seamlessly blends the beautifully-nostalgic properties of Maniac Mansion with the old NES Friday the 13th game, in a sandbox-style engine.\n\nThere's *much* more to it than that, of course; I'm merely paraphrasing. The music is absolutely fantastic (as are the sound effects), and even the hub world has an interesting mystery to discover. But seriously, I cannot stress enough just how amazing the atmosphere is in this game.\n\nNeedless to say, as a huge fan of old NES horror games, and old newgrounds-esque flash games alike, this game is right up my alley.

Within the first chapter, your protagonists include a group of 4, "racially diverse" friends... and your dogge.\n\nThe game mechanics are a bit tricky at first, I wont lie. However, once you get the hang of it, it's like 2nd nature. Trying not to fall and break your characters legs is another challenge if your not so careful, like me.\nIt is quite difficult to survive the experience with all characters still alive but not impossible.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the game is to spend 2 days searching through the area, obtaining items and setting up traps and hiding your dogge to survive against the murderers that attack on your second night. I dont want to give away too much of the rest of the chapters, it really is worth checking out yourself.\n\nComing out in this episodic fashion, which is great because by the time it takes for them to release a new chapter you should hopefully have gotten through the previous one.\n\nIn conclusion its a great game, and definitely woth the cost. (Much better than the actual Friday the 13th Games, hopefully the new game redeems all of that).","April 15","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

LVC 3 is based off of Friday the 13th which is really cool and you could do stuff you would find in Friday the 13th and the items are the same.\nIn LVC 4 based off The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has more action and less freedom. And in my opinion more difficult\nLVC based off Halloween is more strategy then anything and probably need a guide to beat it.\n\nIf you have the money and love horror movies get this game for sure.","February 16","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

LVC5, is a fresh new look still funny stillscary everything i loved about part one in a brand new setting with 3 endings. whats not to love.\nPART 1:Okay so this game is legit one fun sandbox horror, its funny and scary at the same time ive found myself more scared of this game than five nights at ♥♥♥♥faces could have and. the only problem i have with this game is that i just finished all of the game thats here so far and... there isnt any more i really wanna keep playing but replay value is kind of killed when you play it over and over exploring just trying to find a way to kill th e♥♥♥♥ing monsters. sure there is tons to do, like have sex with someone get drunk get naked kill your firends bring them back to life and kill them again throw there bodys in the wood chipper, get high have sex while high attempt to kill the monsters... over... and over.... and over... untill you finally find out how to do it then when you win you feel that acomplishment however... by the time you actually win... its kinda hard to find mmore to play. yeah there is the lake of the dead however after you kill 85 zombies by hiding behind a tree with an ax it kinda gets slower. so i think that more pieces need to be reliesed so that the replay value can return. so while there is no more to do with not alot of replay value\nPART 2: For Lake View Cabin 4, i was pleasently surprised when the game felt fully fledged and brand new, there are more weapns more things to find, and its gruesomly harder, and very unforgiving of mistakes, but i guess one of the major flaws for this chapter is that it lacks that funny charm that made the firt episode so much fun, it was funny and charming while bing scary and brutal at teh same time, while i love more content, its still a brand new game all together and its absolutly brutal. honestly. im not sure the random generation helps this game. becasuse, sometimes you dont get a good spawn and it makes the run nearly impossible. so its not perfect but its a hell of a ride and its great\nPART 3: for the 5th installment of the game, i just love how different each chapter is from each other, its the same place, but the story is so vastly differnt and the way the game plays is so much crazyer, and its still one of the scaryest games ive encounteres mixing with random pop up dad with scary atmosphere and spooky minigames and, just to mix things up you can still have sex, while you cant have an orgy you can still do it, the point is its still funny and still charming whle maintaining a fresh new look yet still scary as ♥♥♥♥. honetly. this game has done alot to impress me. i love this game. 9.5/10","April 15, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

El juego es dificl, solo pude pasar el primer capitulo, y creo que estuve a punto de pasar el segundo( bueno eso es lo que creo).

A fantastic game all around. Love the graphics. Love the music. Love the gameplay. I wanted to wait for the full game to release but I just couldn't wait to put a positive review on it. And besides, I'm sure the final episode will be a blast. The jumpscares aren't too cheap and the the stress level stays up when it needs to. Maybe the puzzles in LVC 5 were a little far fetched but that's a good thing.\nOverall, thank you Roope so much for this amazing game and franchise.","January 22","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If a game were to cause actual remorse and survivor's guilt in players, this would probably come the closest. Very cool.\n\nOnly complaint -- some of the graphics are very, very busy to the point of eye-burning. You should be able to easily spot characters and objects against the background.","April 5","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Within the first chapter, your protagonists include a group of 4, "racially diverse" friends... and your dogge.\n\nThe game mechanics are a bit tricky at first, I wont lie. However, once you get the hang of it, it's like 2nd nature. Trying not to fall and break your characters legs is another challenge if your not so careful, like me.\nIt is quite difficult to survive the experience with all characters still alive but not impossible.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the game is to spend 2 days searching through the area, obtaining items and setting up traps and hiding your dogge to survive against the murderers that attack on your second night. I dont want to give away too much of the rest of the chapters, it really is worth checking out yourself.\n\nComing out in this episodic fashion, which is great because by the time it takes for them to release a new chapter you should hopefully have gotten through the previous one.\n\nIn conclusion its a great game, and definitely woth the cost. (Much better than the actual Friday the 13th Games, hopefully the new game redeems all of that).","April 15","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
