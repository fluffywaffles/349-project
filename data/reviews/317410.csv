It is hard and like mario-invisible-block unfair.\nBut I call it a good game, because it is challenging and it fits the character; Because he is sort of blind.\n\nThe style is a lot like anime which Iam not fond of: vampires, elfish ears, slender bodies and dresses and over-emoted japan feel in the design. But I tolerate it, because there're plenty of players who enjoy it and I got to admit it myself it is not a bad design and gameplay.\n\nI like the feel of the game world, the feel of a sort-of blind person because you have to do a lot of jumps of faith, uncertainty of where is trap and where is safety and mostly fight a daemons which connects the outside world with the mind of player's.\nThe only negative thing is story, because I didnt get it from the game but more likely from comments, but I guess it is again the anime thing.\nAnd also that it is pretty short but fine for the zero prize you'll pay for it.\n\nIn the nutshell:\n- fine control, you which are able to used to\n- good gameplay and idea that you feel youself as blind and the character.\n- good and clever design\n- great prize for a fine one evening game.\n- fine story and mood if you are an otaku or anime fan (I guess)","October 5, 2014","true","2.9"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

The animations are a little dull, and a palette of 6 colors doesn't leave much room for creativity. While I understand the reason for the choice, It's just boring to look at. The colors also mean that the walls you control disappear entirely when you get rid of them, which leads to annoying and unneccesary trial and error. You know where to go, you jump, you have no reference as to where you are in the jump, you cross your fingers and bring back the walls, and you clip into the wall, dying.\nThe game would have worked much better if the obstacles faded out instead of disappeared.\n\nTwo, the various RNG and practically unavoidable obsticles. Like the idea of objects randomly popping in front of you, leaving you no time to react? Do you like the method to get rid of them to be randomized. This happens TONS in this game, and it is extremely annoying having to constantly die and start over to get around them. A puzzle game shouldn't have you rely on luck.\nOh, and the hitboxes kinda suck too, and there are times when you can completely skip over areas.\n\nThree, the game expects you to be psychic. There are far too many instances of the game putting the path out of your viewing range, forcing you to jump over a put to find out where to go. There are also cases where you fall down and have to dodge blades, and again, not knowing where they are and where to land. Not. Fun.\n\nFour, the music. 1 track, looping over and over and over. The game is far too long to have just 1 track, especially with the constant retrying that you will have to do. Same for the SFX, as you are going to have to listen to the same jump grunt every single time you jump. Very repetitive.\n\nFive, the story. He is blind, was sent to hell or something, and now controls colors for some reason. That's pretty much it.\n\nThere are also various other issues, such as the sometimes unresponsive controls and the weird health mechanic, but those are minor issues IMO.\n\n\nIn the end, I think it's a good concept, but poorly executed and just not fun to play. Unless you have some fetish with the color control concept, there isn't really a reason for you to play this. I wish I could say better, but it's not a game that anyone should bother playing.","April 9, 2015","false","2.1"," 45 of 74 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","45","74","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duck-hunt/recommended/317410/","duck-hunt","no eyebrows sno white","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duck-hunt/","67 products in account","The game is creative. I love the game mechanic. Its very origional and unique. But the rest of the game could be better. The 3 colors that you use arent very visually appealing. The rest of the environment i can say the same about. Everything looks like its been taken from an old book on architecture. The buildings are the same one pasted over and over. Besides that, the gameplay itself isnt smooth either. The spikes' hitboxes are way too big. They are more of an obstacle than a hazard in all the cases that they shouldn't. Theres really no point in having enemies if you can easily just poof them away. Plus the birds can't even be avoided if they see you. The developer(s) should have just stuck with hazards and obstacles rather than putting in enemies. Besides the spikes, the hitboxes of everything else arent very good, either. If you change colors while standing in a place where a moving platform is, youll be trapped inside it. You can also jump up the sides of the buildings. Also to note, the framerate is very choppy, The hp is very weird and just simply runs out too quick, it should be replace with hearts. The music is boring and repetitive, and it doesnt even have multiple tracks. The v power should automatically activate all three colors so you dont have to waste the little time you have pressing all three buttons, and it should have more obvious times to use it. And there is no connection of the story and game mechanic. its just like "youre in hell, you can change colors". tl:dr good game mechanic, everything else could be greatly improved upon and the game could be something beautiful. Ill recommend it if it gets fixed. 2/10","November 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","24","36","0","0"

(I actually liked the music itself but I don't think it's a really good choice for a game like this. And also, at some level, it can get a bit annoying to hear it over and over again.) Also, the controls are not very smooth. It gets frustrating to move the character sometimes.\n\nEven though, I can not really say that it is aesthetically appealing and easy to use the controls, the game's mechanics design is interesting. You have to pick the right color, at the right time to make things appear/disappear.

I dont think I need to, to tell you everything wrong with this. I was obsessed with the concept of this game before even loading it up. Upon getting into the game, the concept seems simple enough. Change the color of your environment to go through obstacles. Until getting hit by something did I have the slightest doubt of this game. There is no point to your health bar. You either get one hit or you regen full health before you get back up. Why does your health regen so fast you might ask. It doesnt. You have to sit there and wait. Everytime you accidentally get hit, you might aswell go do your taxes or take a bathroom break because you have to sit there and wait for your character to do his hour long jump back up in slow motion routine. Your hitbox is so big, you'll be hit by things you didnt even know you could. I ran into spikes before jumping off of the ledge because I assumed I'd have to fall to hit them. Silly me.  Upon jumping at a wall, instead of having any other games ideals of falling down normally, you rocket down into the ground, ALOT faster than you'll ever dream of standing up in this game. Animations are crap, graphics are lack luster but I didn't mind since alot of the hand drawn art work was well done. The musics repetitive yet good for the first couple runs through it. All in all, I really really want to enjoy this game. And honestly I could probably put everything else aside if it didnt take 10 years to stand up. It gives me a solid time to reply to texts? Idk. 4/10 cool concept but needs alot of touch up","July 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","28","46","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macmillan333/recommended/317410/","macmillan333","MacMillan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macmillan333/","83 products in account","Let's be frank, this game is definitely one of the worst I've ever seen on Steam. Among the very few good things about this game is the creativity. You can't shoot or jump on enemies, instead you can only change the background color. But by doing so, all enemies in the same color will disappear, and landscape in different colors will also show or hide accordingly, as seen in the preview video. It's a pretty good idea, never seen before in a platforming game.\n\nAside from that, the pictures that tell the story at the beginning are very nice. The music is also very nice.\n\nAnd then everything else about this game is horrible. I don't even know where to start - yet I have to start somewhere. Well, let's start from graphics. While the storytelling pictures are good, the in-game graphics are horrible. Big chunks of pure colors everywhere. The whole screen is about 4 or 5 colors - that's even worse than the 8-bit games. Yes having few colors is not bad, but it has to be accompanied with a fitting art style. Things have to be flat, big, straight, simple and abstract. Look at Windows 8 or iOS 7 for examples. However when things are drawn with fine detail and very thin lines, as in this game, people would expect some Renaissance style artwork - full of colors that look realistic. Having the hero in complete black is okay, but it doesn't match with the art style elsewhere. Refer to Limbo on how to draw a good-looking hero in full black.\n\nThe in-game UI also looks wrong. Somehow it gives the feeling of a Flash game, not a PC game. On closer looks you can actually see aliasing(or sharp pixels?) everywhere, on the hero, on the landscape, and on the health bar. I mean, WTF? This is not a 3D game that burns graphic cards, and yet it looks worse than one without anti-aliasing? This game's graphics look as if drawn with Microsoft Painter. Even pencil sketches will look better.\n\nAs for the sound, the music does sound good, but all the sound effects are just childish and random, especially the strange "hah" that occurs everytime the hero jumps. I don't ever remember playing any platforming game where the hero shouts whenever he/she jumps. Well, except for New Super Mario Bros. OK if you insist on making that sound, it'll be a lot better if they recorded multiple samples and randomly chose one to play at each jump. When you are hit, the sound played sounded exactly the same as that sound of slicing someone with knife in Counter Strike. And same sound also plays when you die of falling, although you aren't sliced by anything. I hope I'm just mishearing this.\n\nAnd control, oh my god. It sucks. Sometimes you can change background color while jumping, sometimes you can not. Sometimes you can pull a double-jump, sometimes you can not. Whenever you get hit, the hero starts flashing, yes that's common, but the frame rate drops drastically. I didn't know making a shape blink was such an intensive task. And good luck if you fall into spikes, because sometimes you can jump out while blinking, sometimes you can not. The health bar also acts very strangely. Sometimes you regain HP by standing still, sometimes you do not. Sometimes you lose only about 1/3 of HP when hit, sometimes you lose about 7/8, and sometimes you lose all of it just by falling onto spikes. And by the way, if you fall below the map, the hero can fall for about 1 whole second beyond the border of the screen before he dies.\n\nSo after all these flaws why do I still give it a recommended? Because it's free! Although I've seen other far better free games, this game is still worth a try. For about 5 minutes. Have enough fun changing the background color around, and then feel free to delete this game. All in all, this game feels extremely childish and uncompleted. It looks more like an unfinished student project than an indie game that dares to come to Steam.\n\n+ it's free\n+ creative gameplay\n+ good artwork and soundtrack\n- horrible in-game graphics\n- horrible sound effects\n- horrible control\n- no sense or hint of any progress towards the end\n4 out of 10, very unsatisfying.","September 20, 2014","true","0.3"," 38 of 69 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","38","69","0","11"

Though, it feels like it fits better in a Flash game or something smaller, but I digress.\n\nThere was a very off-setting thing in this game that, quite frankly, make me a bit irritated. The repetitive, boring music. Now you could just as easily cut your music volume to not, but I find it much more pleasing to go into the game files and switch the .ogg main music file with one you prefer. I pretty much got my collab of music and compiled them into an audio format using my Video editor, and replaced the larger music file with the same name. It registered and played with my collab, and thus it made it more enjoyable.\n\nWhile some aren't as adventursome as me to change game files, I can see why there were negative reviews, and the only reason why I'm recommending this is because there is no in-between. I don't feel like this is a great game, but it has potential being a puzzle game and all. But I have to give it some credit for making me smash my Z, X and C keys in anxiety trying to get the right color before I died.\n\nAgain, not the best game. It might have had better luck as a Flash game, instead of trying to pose for a higher-up game, but it still isn't too bad for being a free game.\nThat said, I'm gonna try to not play this game for a while.

At first, it's a little interesting, it talks about how you were betrayed by your friends,going back to get revenge, then it starts you on some tutorial levels, that basically show you that you can change the background by pressing z/x/c, and if the background matches the color of an object, the object disappears. For me, it just got worse from there. The double jump is much similar to if you had rocket boots - unlike most game where its the same height as the normal jump or less, this one is about 5 times bigger, and can kill you because you can reach off-screen areas with it (like spikes that you didn't know were there). The worst part for me was how if you get hurt in any way, there's about a 15 second long animation just for you getting back up, and its really bad, too, because you're flashing the entire time so it looks really chopped up. And when every other object can hurt you, it makes this game really boring. Another thing I found annoying was how bad the controls are. The controls in this game are insanely clunky, the color buttons can't be spammed the way they SHOULD BE, and the movement buttons just don't give you the feeling of truely being able to sontrol your character, which, imo, should be top priority in any platformer, because in platformers, death is very frustrating, but whats much, much more frustrating is when the player dies because the controls were poorly done. On top of that, this game fails to keep me interested. It gives you the same 5 problems over and over, just in a different order.

When you jump toward a wall, you sort of clip into it/get stuck on it for a moment, and then go shooting off with more momentum than you should have in a different direction. If you don't time your jumps right, you'll find yourself falling down and having to try again, often for something it feels like you couldn't have prevented. I was ok with the collision problem and willing to look past it, but the thing that ruined the game for me was the way that the game handles platform spawning. Basically, when you chenge the background to the same color as a platform, it dissapears and the game despawns it, only to respawn it when you change the color again. Because of this, it's possible to tele-frag yourself with your own platforms, often entirely by accident. And instead of pushing you out of it, or even cutting your health in half like using a special move does(!), the game insta-kills you and makes you restart the level. Since you don't know a platform is there until you change the background away from its color, it's very easy to kill yourself this way -- in fact an early level requires you to time your fall between to platforms you can't see and respawn them with you're between them. If you go too high or too low, you insta-die. It's very frustrating and something I can't look past.\nAlthogether, Color Symphony is a good idea for a game undone by shoddy execution.","June 1","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an interesting idea playing with the different colors to reveal different aspects.  I played this the day it came out and was having some issues with the mechanics but the concept had intrigued me enough and I enjoy the artwork enough to come back a few days later to try again and the mechanic issues I had are gone now thankfully.  One thing that does stand out as a con, for me at least, is that grunting noise the character makes when he jumps, and he's always jumping but just doesn't seem to mesh stylistically with the rest of the game.  It takes a little bit to get the buttons for each color down so you can correctly respond fast enough to deal with the current situtation so starting out can get frustrating until you get the colors down.  Those are the only cons I see right now with the game, but like I said, I want to like this game.  I just can't put my finger on why I can't say I like it though... might have to let this sit for a bit and revisit again.","September 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

Really I don't have to say anything more than, "It's free" to warrant a recommendation. This puzzle/platformer has an interesting mechanic, that of switching certain colors off, but there is a lot more to it then that.\n\nAtmosphere: The ffirst thing you notice when you start up this game is the loud, obnoxious music and sound effects. They are absolutely rancid, adding nothing to the playing experience, and forcing me to play the game on mute. Graphics wise, this game is dingey and very low-res, not much better than a flashgame. While this makes sense for a free game, it truly degrades the experience.\n1/10\nStoryline: Unlike most free games, the storyline, while difficult to follow, is somewhat enticing. It's not too complex, and it doesn't impact gameplay, but it is a nice feature to have.\n5/10\nGameplay: This free game has a surprisingly long series of puzzles, and they are all very differant. While this game quicly fluxuates from too-damn-easy to rage-quit-hard quickly, the intersting mechanics make up for this. This game is a little bit misguiding, though, as there is no way to fight the monsters, you must instead turn them invisible to get by them. This gameplay would do well to be implemented in a game with better atmosphere and a higher budget\n7/10\nReplayability: While this game is a substantial size, there is no replayability. With no acheivements, there is no reason to revisit this game once you have completed the storyline.\n2/10\n\nAll in all, this game is just barely worth the download time. You should enjoy themechanics of the game, but quickley realise that this game is just not up to par with any paid platformers.","October 2, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The lack of backgrounds is the biggest issue, since it makes some jumps really hard, because cannot see how much you have moved, so you'll be guessing a lot.

The plot of the game is to go back to your friend(s) for revenge. He forgive them and continue their dreams? for no reason\nIn each level, you need to go to the door to get to the next level and you will be facing colored eagle, dog with 2 heads,  tentacles and sawblades you can mask them by changing to their colors. The first levels are easy enough, even if you get hit because you have a regenerating health bar. You also have an ability which use like 60% of your health to be able to combine all 3 colors to hide all colored obstacles but it's really useless because you switch colors all the time and you need to wait for the ability to wear off and the only time you really need to use it are too obvious (like 3 differents colored sawblades or tentacles on top of each other or in a row) making this skill worthless.\n\nAfter a while, the levels become more difficult but still challenging until the worst idea in a video game : Colored sawblade that appear when you are near them, which make the invisible coin block from Super Mario World like a blessing to play with because they are often located in the air, right above a bottomless pit, right before the exit, which mean you have to jump, get hit and die because you weren't expecting it and that not the worst, that would be too easy, you just need to come back and switch to the color of the sawblade to go through, right? Well no because their colors are randomised every time you got near them, so you need to be on your toes and press the right color because there is a slight delay before you can switch again and by that time, you would see your character get hit with a big recoil Castlevania/Megaman style where you can do nothing before you land and going in the bottomless pit and wait 2-3 seconds before your character die in it before you get the continue screen.\n\nIf you didn't stop here (I wish I did), the level design become more and more dickish with the introduction of leap of faith through a vertical shaft with sawblade you cannot touch or you will go flying into a pit, or where you can't see the platform and have to guess where it's going to be.\n\nIF you didn't stop here (I mean, come on, it's like platformers have regress with this), you will have to do pixel perfect jump on 8 pixels girders with your character's hitbox of 4 pixels wide which is right in the empty space between your shoes.\n\nIF YOU DIDN'T STOP HERE (We are back to bad NES games with this), you will have to jump into a colored inclosed box, which mean you have to jump into it, select the color of the box making it invisible, pray you get into the box and switch back to an another color to make the box solid again and if a pixel of you is inside an object, you get one-shot, even if you have all your life. Also, those boxes love to have sawblade on their side, making it more hard and less fun.\n\nIF YOU DIDN'T STOP HERE (What is wrong with you?), you will have a final level with a cathedral on the background, no enemies, no jump to do, only go right, have a line of monologue and you get treated to a 5 images credits with reuse pictures from the intro, making it one of the worst credits I have ever see.\n\nIn conclusion, this game had a kinda neat idea gameplay-wise, but run out of idea to work with it and made the game really frustating to finish. The music (There is only two tracks, one during gameplay and one during the credits) is meh, not bad enough to want to mute the audio but not good enough to put it on my MP3.

Since this is the case, I wouldn't recommend this game at all. You'll be taking guesses on when to use certain colors since everything is pretty much a leap of faith and if you choose wrong, you get instakilled by the platform itself. It actually comes down to a point where you have to choose to take damage in order to actually move forward due to the "Hit Detection" in the game. Really, I don't really need to say much there, don't believe me, Play the game till you run into a enemy. Clearly not tested. This game can probably be beaten, but after I fell through the platform for the 10th time, I really don't care.\n\nI really like the idea behind the game. I think if the hitboxes were fixed you'd have a pretty solid game, but since it doesn't and it really ruins the gameplay, I wouldn't recommend it.

While this is nothing new or innovating the main reason as to why I cannot recommend this game is because there is far too high of a level of luck involved verses actual skill.\n\nThere are several areas where the entire map will be one color with hazards and the platforms the same color so as you jump you leap into the air with a nothing but a color swatch for a frame of reference to be able to land in which you will most likely land in the platform and die.  You will die a lot from what I felt were unfair obstacles because they came down to luck and no real skill was needed to play through as far as I did until I stopped.\n\nOne of the most annoying examples of the luck aspect is eventually there are floating spinning spike wheels in the air and you have to change color to avoid them.  However they will be very close to each other and you have little time to actually know what the color you need is, in addition more often than not you may get one color right but the other hazard still within the same jump arc is another color and you will have no time to react so you fall take damage and probably die from falling off a platform.\n\nThis is a very simple concept that has been done a lot in the past; however there is so much to do with luck instead of skill I stopped after hour of constantly dying from unfair, and cheap situations.\n","September 15, 2014","false","1.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Total, crap, game. Don't even bother with it.\n\nWhere do I start? First of all they should not have even included a dubble jumb feature, it dosen't make any sence judging the fact that they tried to make the game realistic. If you don't jump again within half a second of jumping, then you will fall to your death. It's like they put it in last second because they realized that you can't reach most of the platforms. Second, through out the game they put small little cracks in the ground. In fact, you won't even realize they aren't decorations until you fall into the gapping abiss that will end in your sure demise. I mean sure you can jump over them, but the dubble jump feature dose not help much.\n\nThirdly, I was playing around with the color change option when I accidently pressed "V" the game started going haywire and I lost all my progress in the game. This is interesting because "V" is right next to all the color change buttons, so I'm sure I'm not the first person to experience this problem. Lastly, when you get hit in the face with an upsidedown multicolored pigeons that will do anything and everything for your human soul, (yes, that is what happens) your charecter will start flashing, don't get me wrong I know thats the invincable effect and it's in almost every game, but I find it wierd that you can use this effect to go through all the puzzles and beat the level like that. The other problem is that your regeneration takes about 2 seconds to get back to full health, so its like an endless supply of cheats.\n\nIn conclution, I think this game had a lot of potential, but it's worth as much as they're charging for it.

Cog wheel's hitbox too big, small bars are too small, so you think you land on them, but game thinks that you should slip down, with them going out of player view so you cant properly target your jump it makes hundreds of reloads. Guy could have had climb ability after all. And quite too much of such leaps of faith, when you don't see where you have to go, only believe that this should be right direction.\n\nArcade that seemed to be nice and smart like Quantum Conundrum 2D turns into primitive instinctive scroller, because you die too often, so you stop thinking and just do learned tricks in hope that this time I won't miss this fkn bar, and this is the last level of the game... Level designers, do you test your levels in a godmode or something? If not, then have anyone except you played these levels? There is no place for mistake, to repeat failed jump, everytime you have to restart level. This is miserable.\n\nMore you go to the end more you understand that last levels weren't properly tested. Some of them are easily passed by, some are hard as fk, some fails are because of glitches - like you switch to another color but game still thinks that you should be hit by that yellow cog; some fails are because of psychology - not every men on earth are korean starcraft player with reaction over 9000, and requires some more milliseconds to choose; some fails because of bad design - like floating island is going away right after respawn, so you have uselessly wait seconds, and this, with a lot death previously, makes you nervous. Hardest are not the last ones - when you sometimes just run through them, but more to the middle of the game. And this makes player fill like "omg, why game lasts so long" - too much levels being hard as "finish him" ones, but not being ending ones. So, after game beaten, and last strings of unclear story are read, gamer thinks "so what".\n\nSo, I'd say that this game is playable, quite stylish, but it is great waste of time and nerves.","September 21, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Cog wheel's hitbox too big, small bars are too small, so you think you land on them, but game thinks that you should slip down, with them going out of player view so you cant properly target your jump it makes hundreds of reloads. Guy could have had climb ability after all. And quite too much of such leaps of faith, when you don't see where you have to go, only believe that this should be right direction.\n\nArcade that seemed to be nice and smart like Quantum Conundrum 2D turns into primitive instinctive scroller, because you die too often, so you stop thinking and just do learned tricks in hope that this time I won't miss this fkn bar, and this is the last level of the game... Level designers, do you test your levels in a godmode or something? If not, then have anyone except you played these levels? There is no place for mistake, to repeat failed jump, everytime you have to restart level. This is miserable.\n\nMore you go to the end more you understand that last levels weren't properly tested. Some of them are easily passed by, some are hard as fk, some fails are because of glitches - like you switch to another color but game still thinks that you should be hit by that yellow cog; some fails are because of psychology - not every men on earth are korean starcraft player with reaction over 9000, and requires some more milliseconds to choose; some fails because of bad design - like floating island is going away right after respawn, so you have uselessly wait seconds, and this, with a lot death previously, makes you nervous. Hardest are not the last ones - when you sometimes just run through them, but more to the middle of the game. And this makes player fill like "omg, why game lasts so long" - too much levels being hard as "finish him" ones, but not being ending ones. So, after game beaten, and last strings of unclear story are read, gamer thinks "so what".\n\nSo, I'd say that this game is playable, quite stylish, but it is great waste of time and nerves.","September 21, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The execution, however, it's quite poor.\n\nThe game has collision detection issues with platforms, which may bounce you back if you approach them at a slight angle, or even outright kill you if you are switching color while approaching them.\nLevel design is alright, they are a bit empty but the switching mechanics probably works better without fancy backgrounds distracting from the interactable objects. Animation quality and character model, however, are hideous. The character sometimes floats on top of platforms (especially moving ones) instead of having his feet on the ground.\n\nWhen the difficulty comes from cheap programming instead of proper level design, the game becomes hardly enjoyable. I don't care if it's free, our time is more valuable than this.","September 17, 2014","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Altough this game has an original idea, it suffers extremely from its poor execution of game mechanics. I can agree with a lot of other reviews here. If you want even more pain in a platformer, this is the game for you. And it has a built in rage-quit mode: after falling for about 5 seconds, you are asked to continue or quit to the main menu, instead of respawning right away.\nI used a PS3 controller emulating the one of the XB360.\nAt the time of writing this review, I didn't beat the game, and to be honest, I doubt I ever will.\n\n-         +                 - really odd collision boxes (enemies, platforms)\n- music does not match to the gameplay (it is way to calm, if the next jump could kill you)\n- and only one title\n- it is hard to judge when to press jump again while double jumping\n- "random appearing cogs of deaths" in which you will often jump right into\n- when hitting an enemy, the character will fly away (mostly to death, because collisons are sometimes ignored)\n- too long recover animation, it's often faster just to restart via the menu\n- blocked controls after being attacked\n- in some cases it's possible to glitch your way through a pit, which I exploited shamelessly...\n- there is no chance to get a preview on where you should jump, => trial and error\n- playing with a keyboard is not so great\n+ it's free\n+ original idea (afaik)\n+ no menu animations!\n+ there actually kinda is a story\n\nother:\n-/+ character has no momentum\n-/+ very hard, but I am terrible in jump n' runs/platformers :S","May 5","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hit something and you drop like it is an early Castlevania. Falling is painfully slow, so much even that you will miss a platform because your character takes ages to get down.\n\nBut the game has worse problems. Apart from the countless leaps of faith you have to perform that make the game an excercize in trial and error, glitches are everywhere. Every now and then you fall through solid ground for no reason. Animals are suddenly on me when I switch colors. How does this happen? Did this game get tested at all? And what is up with the metal-esque soundtrack? It totally does not fit the game in any way.\n\nBut you might come with the argument "But Nidair, this is a free game. You cannot expect anything from it." And why not? Take for example Shift and its sequels.Free games full of jumping puzzles that are way better than this.

The idea behind this game is amazing. You change the background color between blue, green, and yellow. Whatever color the background is, objects of the same color disapper. It's is a neat mechanic that makes you think about how you will need to change the colors availble to progress through each level.\n\nWith that said this game is horrilbly executed. For starters, the art dirction fits the mechanics, but looks unpolished, like you would see in a flash game on miniclip. The music is annoying to say the least. Just a constant one minute loop. It isn't even catchy enough to get stuck in my head; just flat out forgetable.\n\nThen there is the actual game play. From this point of veiw the game feels like it was made by an artist with a cool idea inted of an actual gamer or game designer. The hit boxes are way bigger than they should be. When changing backgound colors, objects disapper completely, so you might have a killer dog spawn next to you or die from having a platform pop up on top of your avatar. And worst of all, there are leaps of fate. Yes, you read that corectly. There are multiple points in the game where you jump as far as you can, change the color, and hope you land on something safe. I thought this was something we figured out in the SNES era.\n\nSo in short, a great concept that was horriblly executed. Funny thing is, a lot of the problems could have been fixed by improving the art design and having something there to signify where missing objects are. A dotted outline would have worked wonders. I do hope that I get to play another game with similar mechanics down the road. Playing this game made me remember just how creative games can get, and that the gaming scene has been getting stale lately. Even is the game play was poor, it was still a breath of freash air. So to all the game designers out there who read this, my future self included, remember to try and use new and fresh ideas in your game.

Not much else to say about it.  It's a used concept turned into a free game that can only be described as--boring.  You just hit Z X and C to change color, which affects which obstacles affect you.  At the same time, you move very slowly and everything about it was just so boring I gave up and quit not because it was hard, but because I didn't want to play it.\n\nAside from that, it feels like a kongregate game in its one sound effect, two anim files, no sort of feeling of an actual character (press a to glide left slowly, press d to glide right slowly), really just an empty and incomplete game.\n\nAlso, the music is repetitive as hell and it didn't take long for me to want to turn it off and activate Steam Music beta in its place.\n\nOverall, it's a big waste of time trying to play this game; the replay value comes from deleting the game and watching the little lines appear in a circle as a sign that the files are being deleted.

Now, I know why I downvoted it.... It's just bad. It seems that all of the developer's budget was spent on the cutscenes and artwork, they're beautiful but the actual character himself when you start playing is what? a black shadow? Graphics aren't really the problem here and I can easily forgive them. However, the controls and just about everything else in this game are just unacceptable. You'll be playing the game and press the keys (hard) and your character will do absolutely nothing, especially on the jumping. I actually had to press the up key more than once to get the character to jump so, basically, the keys and the controls are horribly unresponsive and moving your character takes more effort than needed or nessicery. The controls have weird key bindings which are kind of a pain and require you to take your hands off of the keyboard or move them to places they normally would not be resting.  Also, the game (awful controls included) is way too tedious and because of the issues mentioned before (and possibly more), it is difficult where it shouldn't be. Yet again, you will be playing and in less than two seconds, for some stupid reason, you will have you a** handed to you multiple times over as well as your character dying for equally dumb reasons, such as hitting a jump platform the wrong way. Was there any spikes or anything harmful on the playform? Nope, you just died because you smacked your dumb face on it! Another dumb way to die in this game is that the game, (if you were to be knocked into spikes) will reload your character in the spikes! So, you are literally are forced to sit there and watch him die before you can continue! You will spend most of the game, your time, effort, and overall playthrough, rolling your eyes in annoyance and disgust while your character just dies over and over. No actaul gameplay seems to be possible right now, nothing will seem to be done except of course, your character dying. I can't stress that enough.","September 19, 2014","false","0.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Now here's a bit of a summary:\n\nPros:\nThat wonderful platformer feel\nInnovative game mechanics (filters)\nEngaging Introduction\nShort and sweet\nSufficient challenge\nInteresting music choice\n\nCons:\nindividual levels rely on trial and error on occasion (gears changing colors after a jump)\nSurprise deaths (traps appear out of nowhere right near the exit of a particularly difficult level)\nStory becomes less-engaging and grows vague as the game progresses (I was personally hoping for the story to blossom a bit further)\nHit-boxes (my biggest complaint, you're controlling a ragdoll half the time)\nJumping (occasionally couldn't double jump in the air after switching filters)\n\nAs someone who has formerly worked for a video game company, a bit of advice to the creators would be to clean up the hit boxes and jumping, and maintain patterns with color changing objects (e.g. maintain the same colors for surprise traps regardless of the current filter).  Seeing as though this game is free however, I can honestly say that it was a fun experience, and that I'll be recommending it to each of my friends.  I'll also be looking forward to any other games that these guys are working on.","December 25, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything about it feels like a Kongregate game; the negative space graphics, the presentation of the story via lines of monologue speech floating in the air, even the occasionally idiotic controls and level design. Trial-and-error gameplay doesn't mix with blind jumps.\n\nStill, like many reviews, I can't really say it's a bad game, exactly, as long as it's a game I'm playing for free. Would I rather play this game for free than not play any game? Sure. And among free games, this does bring some interesting ideas and gameplay to the table.

Just incredibly cheap when it comes to killing you off and wasting your time. Here are some of the issues I have with this game.\n\n1. The birds that chase you around have far too much range, some even chased me halfway across the map before leaving me alone.\n\n2. Problems with the edge. Try walking off an edge and jumping. More than half the time, you will fall off instead of jumping. Now you might think to yourself. Well, that's not so bad, just jump before you get to the edge. WRONG. There are so many jumps in this game that REQUIRE you to jump right before you leave a platform, and so many of these are right near the door, so it's doubly frustrating when you pass a difficult part only to fall off the edge. Which brings us to....#3.\n\n3. There are no checkpoints within each level. Just passed an incredibly difficult part of the puzzle and almost there? Whoops you accidentally slipped off the edge instead of jumping. Now restart the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing.\n\n4. No idea which direction you're supposed to go. There are no indicators for you to have any idea where to go. No map whatsoever. So if you happen to stand on a platform with nothing in sight, you usually have to jump in a random direction to see if there's anything there and you have to do it for ALL THREE COLOURS. Usually resulting in your death in finding the next platform. This results in an endless cycle of death and rebirth just to find the next step.\n\n5. Changing colours while something (usually a platform) is behind your character will result in your death. And there are so many damned "puzzles" involving this, you're certain to die several times over just for one platform.\n\n6. There are no indicators that there might be platforms in a certain colour. This game would have been so much better if they put a border/outline around areas with platforms. At least you'll know when to change colours, instead of guessing and relying on random chance.\n\n7. The Hidden Gears. These randomly coloured gears will pop out only if you're close enough, usually placed so that you have to jump before seeing them, giving you about a 0.3 second chance to react before getting hit. Again, you have to rely on luck to be able to pass levels with these.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun platformer with some puzzles involved, you came to the wrong place.\n\nIf you're looking to do some repetitive jumping followed by constant deaths and wanna test you luck without requiring you to think or solve anything, then this is the game for you.\n\nGameplay - 2/5\nMusic - 2/5 (There's only one track throughout)\nGraphics - 3/5 (Pretty nice theme)\nSound - 3/5\nFrustration - 5/5\n\nPlay it for the frustration. Win it for the challenge. Delete it for the regret.","December 16, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It simply means whether or not I would go out of my way to recommend it and why. Of course you can overlook most of the problems I've experienced with this game since it's free and probably has little to no budget but they're still problems nonetheless which I feel shouldn't be overlooked in a review.\n\nColor Symphony is a platforming puzzle game. In it, you switch between three colours to avoid or reveal like-coloured objects which can range from birds, dogs, spikes, platforms, doors and more. As you progress from door to door, the levels become harder and more complicated.\n\nIn general, it's a great concept that shines at the start. As you progress though, the limitations begin to show and, along with poor physics and collision detection, turns enjoyment into frustration. The cause can be any of the following and more:\n\nOff-camera platforms which can only be seen by switching colors in mid-air and risking your life.\nEnemies which are probably right on top of you which you can't see but are the same color as the thing you need to reach to progress.\nDying on spikes without visually touching them because their hit boxes are larger than their sprites.\nColliding against parts of the background which aren't in fact background (caused by the monotone-ish colour pallette).\nTrying to measure distance for percision landing when there's nothing on camera to relate with\nOnce you die, you start back at the entrance to the level, which is forgiving at first but eventually as the levels become longer and the whole game becomes trial and error it becomes necessary as no hints are given as to what to expect beforehand.\n\nAs far as I played there was only one music track. Though it's a good track, being the only one in the game, it gets repetitive. Visually, everything is plain and generic with random props placed here and there in the background but, like the music, there's no variety and it gets boring fast. The visuals to however give the feeling of being in a void which is likely what the game is going for.\n\nSo to summarise, Color Symphony is a great concept which shines in its simplicity but gradually becomes more and more unfair and frustrating as it progresses.","October 5, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story would be good. This game is pretty much the most innovative thing i have seen in a while. but when making something innovative make sure your game mechanics work..\n\nMy first complaint is that you dont even have to do the puzzles. You jump as high as a sky scraper if you double jump therefore avoiding spikes, platforms, wolves and even whole floors.\n\nMy second complaint is that the colour changing is an amazing mechanics but i got stuck on a level where i had to change to another colour so the platform dissapears and bring it back to land in an enclose room blocked with spikes. Hear em out hear if you slightly clip into another wall when you change colours you die so every time you did the puzzle you would die therefore you cant progress... why?????\n\nMy third complaint is the animation...... It takes so long for your character to get up and it skips frames.... It slows down a game that should be fluid and fun.\n\nMy fourth complaint adding to the third. other than feeling good for solving the puzzles that you can skip It isnt even fun it is frustrating. The birds have to be the worst they push you off so you fall and the falling animation takes so long and getting up again it takes way to much time out of the game.\n\nthe story seems ok with alot of mystery but who knows what the ending is since you cant get there.\n\nI give this game a.         2/10","October 5, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is only one solution and it's kinda clear. The hit detection is not right. I die because i hit the air next to something when i change colour. And the worse about this game? After a while obstacles appear out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere in a random colour everywhere. It turns into a quick time event game. Also changing color seems to have a second of cooldown and a second to channel making these qte even harder. But still try it. The idea is good. The gameplay MAY be fun.

However, the gameplay doesn't go so well and there was little to no plot (or there was no relation to it with the gameplay).  such as having difficulty jumping on platforms (like I was certain to make it only to just somehow get stopped underneath or in it) or getting knocked over by spikes just by being too close. Basically, the mapping seemed sloppy to me (this infuriated me the most). Avoiding beasts/birds was annoying as well, since you had to avoid them AND the obstacles. Uh, no, it was already difficult to time things right with the obstacles. There was even a fault with the V-button usage? It ate the HP and seemed just plain useless since you still had to press the buttons and there was little time to do so.\n\nHonestly, the game can be so much more. It was an interesting concept that could be worked better or even have a better story to it. Either way, I wouldn't play this game until it's more fine-tuned.

A knockoff of the flash game Shift, Color Symphony requires you to change the background color to cause monsters and obstacles to disappear and reappear. Normally you can only shift to one color at a time, but you can also hit V to disable multiple colors at once. Unfortunately, the game creativity ends there. The "storyline" is nonexistent, and the only thing that gives any sort of story whatsoever is pretentious phrases scattered around the level. Pretty much every aspect of this game seems like a knockoff of another one. The game itself isn't even that well-made. The unit collision system is attrocious, causing death every time you walk to the edge of a platform under which are spikes (yet graphically the spikes don't reach the top of the pit) or switch onto a color only to find your foot is caught in the platform. I guess you could see the game as fun, but it's hard to ignore the blatant "borrowing" of style and concept.","October 5, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It simply means whether or not I would go out of my way to recommend it and why. Of course you can overlook most of the problems I've experienced with this game since it's free and probably has little to no budget but they're still problems nonetheless which I feel shouldn't be overlooked in a review.\n\nColor Symphony is a platforming puzzle game. In it, you switch between three colours to avoid or reveal like-coloured objects which can range from birds, dogs, spikes, platforms, doors and more. As you progress from door to door, the levels become harder and more complicated.\n\nIn general, it's a great concept that shines at the start. As you progress though, the limitations begin to show and, along with poor physics and collision detection, turns enjoyment into frustration. The cause can be any of the following and more:\n\nOff-camera platforms which can only be seen by switching colors in mid-air and risking your life.\nEnemies which are probably right on top of you which you can't see but are the same color as the thing you need to reach to progress.\nDying on spikes without visually touching them because their hit boxes are larger than their sprites.\nColliding against parts of the background which aren't in fact background (caused by the monotone-ish colour pallette).\nTrying to measure distance for percision landing when there's nothing on camera to relate with\nOnce you die, you start back at the entrance to the level, which is forgiving at first but eventually as the levels become longer and the whole game becomes trial and error it becomes necessary as no hints are given as to what to expect beforehand.\n\nAs far as I played there was only one music track. Though it's a good track, being the only one in the game, it gets repetitive. Visually, everything is plain and generic with random props placed here and there in the background but, like the music, there's no variety and it gets boring fast. The visuals to however give the feeling of being in a void which is likely what the game is going for.\n\nSo to summarise, Color Symphony is a great concept which shines in its simplicity but gradually becomes more and more unfair and frustrating as it progresses.","October 5, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story would be good. This game is pretty much the most innovative thing i have seen in a while. but when making something innovative make sure your game mechanics work..\n\nMy first complaint is that you dont even have to do the puzzles. You jump as high as a sky scraper if you double jump therefore avoiding spikes, platforms, wolves and even whole floors.\n\nMy second complaint is that the colour changing is an amazing mechanics but i got stuck on a level where i had to change to another colour so the platform dissapears and bring it back to land in an enclose room blocked with spikes. Hear em out hear if you slightly clip into another wall when you change colours you die so every time you did the puzzle you would die therefore you cant progress... why?????\n\nMy third complaint is the animation...... It takes so long for your character to get up and it skips frames.... It slows down a game that should be fluid and fun.\n\nMy fourth complaint adding to the third. other than feeling good for solving the puzzles that you can skip It isnt even fun it is frustrating. The birds have to be the worst they push you off so you fall and the falling animation takes so long and getting up again it takes way to much time out of the game.\n\nthe story seems ok with alot of mystery but who knows what the ending is since you cant get there.\n\nI give this game a.         2/10","October 5, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not really puzzles, you just have to press the three buttons and see which one is correct. Also good luck figuring out what any of the bars mean and how health regen works.\nPhysics are meh. No matter what touches you and how, you're going to do this massive jump that'll kick you off the platform.\n\nThe artwork is a shame. It's got good potential but it's really repetitive, boring and cheesy.\n\nMusic is just pathetic. You'd expect an intriguing, mysterious and delicate sound to go with the gameplay and artwork, but instead you get this cheesy garage band music that sounds like a Youtube video outro.\n\nThe storyline.. Oh my, the storyline. What the ♥♥♥ is it even talking about. They use deep words with deep meanings oh so deep and mysterious #deep.\nAwful, storyline is awful. It's like a compilation on Facebook statuses.\n\nWorth getting? It's free and has a really fast download, but no. You really aren't missing anything.\nThe idea has great potential but it's been wasted like poo.\nIt's a puzzle game without thinking.\n\n\n\n","September 28, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is challenging. Controls are pretty easy to under stand.\nCONS: a few bugs when jumping on something to the side and some enemies will still hit you even when you are not touching them. It's worth a try, you ill know right away if it isn't your type of game.

You go through a series of platforming levels making obstacles and platforms appear and disappear by making them match the background colour. The graphics are very simple but they work well for this game. The problem is that the mechanics and level design are not as polished as they should be and instead of becoming about skill and reflexes it seems to be a lot more about trial and error.\n\nSome of the main problems I have encountered have been really weird hit boxes that kill me before a collision or after I've changed the background. Making obstacles appear and disappear starts to become frustrating when you're standing on a platform, change the background and are instantly killed by an enemy appearing over you with no way to counter it. Random deaths are not good in a game.\n\nYou can also die instantly from revealing platforms in the same space as you. That does make sense but becomes a problem with the game levels being much larger than the screen and no background visuals to judge distance. The only way to jump from one platform into an invisible box with no references on the screen and the screen moving to keep your character centered is by luck and many attempts. This problem could be easily solved by making the character smaller and the levels tighter. You won't lose anything but it will make platforming easier.\n\nIt's a nice concept for a game but the levels are poorly designed lending itself to trial and error.","September 23, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love finding cool free games to play, but this is not a game I really enjoyed. I still played through the entier "campaign", filled with ever-increasing difficulty and a warped text-only narrative that is one-hundred percent up to interpretation. The mechanic the game is based on is changing between three colors to alter the world around, which would give a person the idea that it is a puzzle game, in fact, using the r-key to restart levels was taught to the player early on, but you will most likely never use this feature unless you find waiting for your falling character to finally hit the bottom a bit too annoying (I know I did). The conrols are fickle and clumsy, and sometimes the game ignores imput entirely. This game is not advertised as a rage game, but it sure feels like one when you get to sections that are based almost completely on memory. Not even the fastest of reflexes will save you when you are free-falling after taking a leap-of-faith jump (which you will HAVE to do at least once in the game) because the character is clunky and sluggish in the air and on the ground.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't find the game so terrible that I would never have played it if given a choice, but I don't really think anyone should be playing this game unless they really like rage games that are accidentally rage games due to bad controls, odd character movment, and annoying obstacles that sometimes are simply the platforms appearing when you switch colors.

It is at least worth that much! Or if you want a very challenging free platformer and are willing to spend a LOT of time mastering the exact timing and coordination for some of the levels, then I also recommend this game to you.\n\nI really do love the concept of this game! Sometimes the mechanics are very tedious, making levels that should be very simple take multiple, enraging tries! Though, perhaps, the execution of the game isn't perfect, there was certainly a lot of creativity that went to making it!! Even if the graphics are extremely simple, I really like the aethetic of the overall look, and the music choice is a beautiful accompaniment :) Ultimately, though, the game is poorly designed. Eventually you come to a level that is just too difficult for the clumsy controls to be able to complete. The poetic blurbs at the beginning of the game really drew me in, and I was hoping this would focus on the poetry with light platforming to move through the poem. But now I will never know how the story ends because nothing about the game was endearing enough to make me want to spend hours to complete a single level.","October 1, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an interesting change to the way you have to solve puzzles.\n\nThe biggest criticism I have is with the level design.\n\nIn a game that relies on you to solve puzzles by thinking them through logically, there are many times when the only way to proceed is by taking a leap of faith into the unknown and hoping that you land on something. Unfortunately, if you make the wrong decision, you invariably die and have to start the level all over again.\n\nThis tends to get very frustrating because there's no skill in pure dumb luck, so you end up repeating the level until you just happen to make the right guess.\n\nIf the level designers could eliminate all these "leaps of faith", this game would become much more enjoyable.","July 5, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a meter at the bottom that probably has something to do with color switching, but I never really had any idea, and the collision detection is so wacky that enemies hit me from six feet away and touching a vertical edge rocketed me straight downwards. Not to mention that the "recovering" animation takes forever. It's so slow that I thought my computer was slowing down, but no, it just takes fifteen seconds to get up from a hit.\n\nAnd then there's the level design. Not really anything creative about it, especially for a puzzle platforming game. If the jumping just took skill, that'd be fine, but it's so easy to switch colors and have a wall pop into you, instantly killing yourself. Even though the same thing could happen in, say, Mighty Switch Force, at least then you knew ahead of time where things would appear, and the dumb mistake was on you, not the designer. Eventually the point I gave up at was where it started requiring me to make blind leaps of faith, the majority of which ended with me falling to my death, switching in a wall and being squished to death, or colliding with a bird or angry plant that knocked me away with no means of recovery, again to fall to my death. It doesn't help that the jumping is so... floaty. And even when I knew where I had to make something appear, the simpleness of the scenery meant I didn't have any reference point for where that was after I jumped.","July 15, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buggy, but still fairly good.\n\nThe game is simple enough - avoid the traps by using a button to filter out a colour. Blue trap? Blue filter. Green trap? Green filter. Multiple traps in quick succession? Press the buttons fast and hope it responds. There seemed to be a cooldown mechanic in place, which was a little offputting in a high-speed puzzle. Then again, you have certain puzzles that have green red AND yellow traps in the same area. This is where you have to use a special bar to use all the filters at once, thereby leaving only black ink. Why not do that all the time? Simple - it has a recharge timer, takes away your HP. and you actually need to land on a specific colour most of the time... Or you can fall through a platform and randomly hit the end of a level. Yeah I did that on quite a few of the levels on accident. (and three times on purpose!)\n\nThe bugs. Oh, the bugs... I fell through platforms, instead of walking through (they were literally closer together than one of the characters' legs, but apparently that doesn't matter) and I clipped through more than half the buildings I walked towards. This became to such an extent that in the three times I mentioned above, I actually exploited the clipping mechanic to skip a puzzle simply because I couldn't walk to the next platform. I couldn't jump either, as there was a trap within the minimum jump height. So... I don't quite know what else to do in that situation, as I tried repeatedly to walk past it and failed. Oh and it was black ink - no failure of mechanics, just hitbox error. Again, for the sake of fairness it has to be said that the entire game was beatable. It wasn't gamebreakingly bad, just unintentionally frustrating to traverse.\n\nOn top of the platform bug, there was a more annoying issue with persistency. Some coloured traps remained in certain situations (Such as walking to a new level) on same coloured filters. (ie. Yellow spike, yellow filter) This was mostly avoidable as far as i'm concerned, as the game should have checked the filter in use upon loading the level. Although it was able to be fixed in relative safety, it was slightly redundant to have to swap colours to fix this. Maybe if you could have pressed the same filter button to refresh itself that would have been better? Something for the Dev to look into for the sequel, if they haven't done that already.\n\nThis game had its fair share of ups and downs, and to be honest if it wasn't free I probably wouldn't have finished it. As daft as it sounds, I figured since the dev had the decency to post this game then I might as well finish it. I don't know if it is because I played the game in stages, but the end seemed to hit me faster than I expected. I finished the game in 1.9 Hours. That includes standing there annoyed at my character for clipping through a platform one time too many, going from my computer and making a cup of tea, getting a phone call, having said phone call, going back to the computer, realising the game was still on, and turning it off for about a month. I actually only managed to play the 1.9 hours over about three or four sittings, but that was mostly because I had other things to do. But, in the games defence I picked the game up and carried right on where I left off each time. It wasn't the fact it was frustrating, I simply forgot about it...\n\nAnd speaking of forgetting, I don't quite know if the narrative was supposed to be an actual story, but it seemed very bland. White text on a yellow background (to avoid yellow trap) was hard to read, it didn't seem like it was there for any particular reason. It felt a little vague, as if lost in translation somehow. Not saying it was a bad thing, it just didn't seem to serve any purpose. It didn't move me, it didn't leave any lasting impression... It was just... there? *shrugs*\n\nSo, to cut a long story short i'll put a basic pro-con style thing here randomly for the heck of it, eh?\n\nPRO:\nThe game was FREE. Can't get fairer than that in my opinion.\nIt was a playable game - even went as far as having an ending.\nThe mechanics are extremely easy to pick up, highly understandable.\nThe intentional frustration is very real, but not overly so. Challenge, not trials.\n\nBalanced: The artwork was great, but the animation made it feel cheap. Kinda evens out.\n\nCON:\nThe buggy platforms\nThe buggy filters\nSome parts felt improperly paced","April 27","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a very nice proof of concept and an approach to a puzzle plattformer that differs from many others. It relies on colours and making quick decisions while jumping between the platforms and trying to avoid the enemies.\nHowever, it falls flat on its nose in two aspects. Firstly, the time it takes to be able to move on after hitting something without dieing.  It doesn't get frustrating with time, it's frustrating the first time. The second or third time you have enough time before you can continue playing to seriously ponder just quitting and finding something else. Even though restarting when you actually die is a lot snappier, it too is just that bit too sluggish before you can try again. And you will have to try again, which brings me to point two: the controls.\nAll platforming games relies heavily on responsive controls and clear, distinctive movement of the character that makes it possible to judge your movement with a high degree of precision. The controls (I'm playing on a keybaord, by the way) sometimes feel sluggish and inexact throughout. The movement feels choppy and the animation and movement is sometimes a bit stuttering. As I said before, controls that feel smooth and exact and the ability to preciesly judge your movement from the animation and graphics are the hallmarks of any good plattformer. Quick, action/puzzle plattformers more so. This game sadly lacks in both aspects and leave a lot to be desired. Movement is inexact, the controls sometimes sluggish, and the character bounces off edges he oughtn't.\n\nAll in all, I do like the game as such, but it falls flat where you would hope it would shine, which transforms it from an enjoyable game into an exercise in futility and frustration.","April 30","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buggy, but still fairly good.\n\nThe game is simple enough - avoid the traps by using a button to filter out a colour. Blue trap? Blue filter. Green trap? Green filter. Multiple traps in quick succession? Press the buttons fast and hope it responds. There seemed to be a cooldown mechanic in place, which was a little offputting in a high-speed puzzle. Then again, you have certain puzzles that have green red AND yellow traps in the same area. This is where you have to use a special bar to use all the filters at once, thereby leaving only black ink. Why not do that all the time? Simple - it has a recharge timer, takes away your HP. and you actually need to land on a specific colour most of the time... Or you can fall through a platform and randomly hit the end of a level. Yeah I did that on quite a few of the levels on accident. (and three times on purpose!)\n\nThe bugs. Oh, the bugs... I fell through platforms, instead of walking through (they were literally closer together than one of the characters' legs, but apparently that doesn't matter) and I clipped through more than half the buildings I walked towards. This became to such an extent that in the three times I mentioned above, I actually exploited the clipping mechanic to skip a puzzle simply because I couldn't walk to the next platform. I couldn't jump either, as there was a trap within the minimum jump height. So... I don't quite know what else to do in that situation, as I tried repeatedly to walk past it and failed. Oh and it was black ink - no failure of mechanics, just hitbox error. Again, for the sake of fairness it has to be said that the entire game was beatable. It wasn't gamebreakingly bad, just unintentionally frustrating to traverse.\n\nOn top of the platform bug, there was a more annoying issue with persistency. Some coloured traps remained in certain situations (Such as walking to a new level) on same coloured filters. (ie. Yellow spike, yellow filter) This was mostly avoidable as far as i'm concerned, as the game should have checked the filter in use upon loading the level. Although it was able to be fixed in relative safety, it was slightly redundant to have to swap colours to fix this. Maybe if you could have pressed the same filter button to refresh itself that would have been better? Something for the Dev to look into for the sequel, if they haven't done that already.\n\nThis game had its fair share of ups and downs, and to be honest if it wasn't free I probably wouldn't have finished it. As daft as it sounds, I figured since the dev had the decency to post this game then I might as well finish it. I don't know if it is because I played the game in stages, but the end seemed to hit me faster than I expected. I finished the game in 1.9 Hours. That includes standing there annoyed at my character for clipping through a platform one time too many, going from my computer and making a cup of tea, getting a phone call, having said phone call, going back to the computer, realising the game was still on, and turning it off for about a month. I actually only managed to play the 1.9 hours over about three or four sittings, but that was mostly because I had other things to do. But, in the games defence I picked the game up and carried right on where I left off each time. It wasn't the fact it was frustrating, I simply forgot about it...\n\nAnd speaking of forgetting, I don't quite know if the narrative was supposed to be an actual story, but it seemed very bland. White text on a yellow background (to avoid yellow trap) was hard to read, it didn't seem like it was there for any particular reason. It felt a little vague, as if lost in translation somehow. Not saying it was a bad thing, it just didn't seem to serve any purpose. It didn't move me, it didn't leave any lasting impression... It was just... there? *shrugs*\n\nSo, to cut a long story short i'll put a basic pro-con style thing here randomly for the heck of it, eh?\n\nPRO:\nThe game was FREE. Can't get fairer than that in my opinion.\nIt was a playable game - even went as far as having an ending.\nThe mechanics are extremely easy to pick up, highly understandable.\nThe intentional frustration is very real, but not overly so. Challenge, not trials.\n\nBalanced: The artwork was great, but the animation made it feel cheap. Kinda evens out.\n\nCON:\nThe buggy platforms\nThe buggy filters\nSome parts felt improperly paced","April 27","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you stop hitting an arrow key, you will fall straight down, even if you were moving horizontally seconds before). Doesn't feel like the character moves when you want, which is CRUCIAL in a game that often requires split-second timing. Also, you take damage if you switch the colors as you're pasing through an object, whereas if you had just bumped into it you wouldn't. Cool mechanic, poorly executed. Couldn't even get through 1/2 hour of it.","April 9","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music got repetitive, gimmicks were exploited, collision on hitboxes were cursed on, decent platforming, character is sluggish on recovery, and falling through a platform after getting hit barely works in your favor. I'd give it a 7.5/10 for platforming, 5/10 music, there were times I liked it and others where I wish it'd play anything else, and 0/10 for those damn birds, cogs, and tentacles for screwing me any chance they got. Overall, I'd give it a 7 out of 10 for a free game.","May 30","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
