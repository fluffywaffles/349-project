A pure party arcade game where your goal is to smash up a room in various ways. There are secrets in... well basically every level I have played so far, and there are lots of levels to play.\n\nIn short... if you liked crash mode from the burnout games, and want a different take on that idea, than this might be for you.","June 2","true","3.1"," 68 of 99 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","68","99","3","2"

I was OK with what seemed to be a limited amount of content (4 areas) but was pleased when I found there were multiple areas and holes within each area, each with it's own challenges. Apart from that, however, this feels much like an alpha Early Access release title.\n\n1) You can only play this game with an Xbox controller. I'm not sure why they thought this was a good idea. I could see if there was an intricate control scheme much like maneuvering on your skateboard in the Skate franchise, but there isn't.\n\n2) Speaking of the controls, the only time you can even see them is during the loading screen which (Although great) goes by so fast you can only make out 1 or 2 buttons before you're back in the game. On top of this, it seems most of the controls don't even work. The basic scheme is A) Press the left stick forward to hit the ball. B) Press the B button during the special "Smashbreaker" mode and somehow use the left or right analog stick to steer the ball. None of the other controls I read seemed to do anthing.\n\n3) The game basically plays itself. Ready to go for the hole? Hit the stick and the ball magically flys in, ricocheting off of walls and objects as necessary to make a fancier end to the round. Granted, I only played 3 holes before I requested a refund, it seems there's no way to miss the hole. There is no aiming or planning or thinking required.\n\n4) The menu system is very wierd, in case you're looking for the Options screen, you need to go to Clubhouse first, then you'll find the settings for the game.\n\nOverall, I am very dissapointed with this game. I'm not really sure what the devs were going for here other than EXPLOSIONS, and, IT'S RUNNING ON THE UNREAL 4 ENGINE! Save your money for now and if they decide to drastically overhaul this game later down the line it may be worth it.","June 2","false","0.2"," 90 of 145 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","90","145","2","7"

If you did not like the mode or the game you will not like this.\n\nThere are 4 regions but there are multiiple locations with a single map and those locations can have upto a dozen or more levels so there is a lot of content. You have a room, a goal and a few set way to start. Once you get a smashbreaker you have real control over the ball and this is essentially the aftertouch from the burnout series. There are secrets galore on each level as well the requisite signature smashes (remember burnout) and secret smashes (hello burnout).\n\nThis game is aimed at a very specific audience with some overlap with other groups. If you've been waitiing for a 3d crash mode since Burnout 3 this is most definitely the game for you.","June 2","true","2.3"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","39","58","3","2"

Do you have an Xbox 360/One controller? Do you have a decent graphics card? Do you like smashing things? If so, I'd recommend this.\n\nI've had a great time with this game so far. If you go into it expecting an actual golf game I can see why you'd be disappointed. But if you just want to play a game that is literally Crash Mode with a golf ball, that's what this is. From the mechanics to the fonts to the music, I've had non-stop flashbacks to Burnout 3.\n\nOverall, I have very little complaints. I notice that the sound cuts off on some stages. And sometimes my laptop has trouble keeping up, but most of the time it runs fine with lower settings. But other than that I appreciate the variety in missions, my wife enjoys co-op mode and I have yet to try the party mode. Getting platinum involves a bit of strategy, which is nice and has lead to a few retry loops. Some of the criticisms this game's received are valid, but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying it.

I've been seeing two main complaints, so far. The first being that the game offers no form of guide or tutorial, and only the briefest of explanations as to what the controls are. The other being that the game ONLY supports an xBox controller.\n\nHere's the thing about all that: a lot of the problem there is that they couldn't be bothered to read up on what they were buying. They may have thought "Ooo, Burnout! But with Golf!" and just bought it outright. (Full disclosure: I was going to as well.) This is my solution: read. Do research. It took one (1) click once I got to the store page to find out that it needed a controler (if you don't count looking through the reviews, where it's plastered with negative comments about it). And as for the controls, it's in the options. A complete breakdown of how to play. It's conveniently listed under "How to Play". Now, some people want to be able to just jump right in and play with no delay, and I get that. But frankly, sometimes that just isn't the case.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game isn't perfect by any means. There's room for improvement all over the place. Better camera controls, more accurate movement, less resource intensive, there's definitely room to grow. As it stands right now, however, it's a good game that's fun to play, as long as you don't go into it already bitter (and have an xbox controller handy).","June 3","true","0.6"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","32","53","0","5"

Stop whining about it clearly being stated now - It wasn't at the time - not even in the "Additional Notes" at the system requirements. The developer had to get contacted (Email, tweets and forum posts) in order for them to actually do this, so future buyers didn't run into this.\nEDIT!\n\nYou NEED a controller to play this. Not just any controller. A Xbox 360/One-controller (or third party software to make a PS3/PS4 controller work).

Can't see this being a thing of not meeting the requirements either (PC Specs on my profile). Sound tends to cut out as well, when smashing something, until you pause and unpause the game (which doesn't "fix" it all the time).\n\nWould I recommend this RIGHT NOW? - Nope. Not at all.\nMight this be a thing that's fixable? - Yup. Can't see how it's not.

It has a golf ball and a hole to hit it into but thats about it. You have little to no control over power of the shot and directionality. The aim is to smash as much stuff in one shot (and extra time with fiery ball mode of doom) then you putt the ball. No skill is required in the slightest to putt the ball unless its behind scenery or suchlike. Otherwise, you can smash it like a drive right into the hole with no worrying. As it is, I wouldn't recommend the game. It would have been interesting if it required more input from the user. The most input that is required is LEFT and RIGHT, no UP and DOWN.\n\nA decent looking game but with too many flaws to overlook.

Hell on the putt shot there is very generous sweet spot where the ball will go in the hole, It took me 6 games to miss a shot, until then i thought it just auto went into the hole. It definitely has the feeling of Showtime mode from Burnout Paradise. The game runs great on a 980 Ti over 100 fps at 1440p Maxed out with all nvidia gameworks features enabled. . It is pretty dumb though that you cant use keyboard and mouse. But I garuntee its going to be in the first content update. There is also a bunch of levels, and in them you go back to the room and there will be different layouts too. I havent tried multiplayer yet because i havent been matched with someone so i cant report on that. But for $20 as long as you have a controller this game is a great value and its a really nice showpiece technical demo for unreal 4.\n\nNow all we need next is for three fields to work with epic and fix the mess that is the driving mechanics in unreal 4, and make a spiritual successor to burnout paradise, my favorite driving game EVER.","June 2","true","1.5"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","10","26","0","0"

There are very few problems I have with this game one of them being the poor tutorial, all you get are some panels telling you what to do ,I would much prefer it if the game would hold my hand and show me and guide me through what to do rather than explain how everything should work with some pictures and words but the controls really aren't that hard to figure out on your own. Sometimes the audio does not work or is choppy and works only half the time. The another thing I had a problem with was that the camera did not follow the ball after the initial tee off, i'm not sure if i'm doing something wrong or thats just the way it is, I find myself just staring at a wall alot of the time and just watching the scores appear on the right side of the screen until the ball stops and I can watch it again, other that the game is really good and a lot of fun, the grapichs and attention to detail is on point the ball even chips and burns up the floor and walls when it is on fire, the splashing water when you hit the buckets looks amazing, the physics are great and I would expect it to be alot more fun when you have group of friends and and play together.

The problem I have with this game at the moment is that it doesn't feel like golfing,  I don't even know how much influence I have on the trajectory of the ball apart from the starting angle and the initiation of the putting move. I made some medals by just aiming at some profitable looking targets and than hitting the 'put' buttons to complete the level.\nI somehow like, therefore I give it a thumbs up.

You can cap the framerate to 60Hz, which means there is actually 60 fps support.\nI think this would play better on a beefy computer, since it's Unreal Engine 4.\n\nHowever, having no keyboard or mouse support is kind of a loss.

Destroy rich people's houses.\n\n\nNow for the bad:\n\n*No official Controlls for the Keyboard and Mouse:\nGranted this game is originally meant for consoles, this was made clear when they clearly choose to leave the keyboard/mouse out of this game, i have a 360 controller so i had no problems, but for people who would love to try the game but do not have a 360 controller with will be in for a dissapoinment.\n\n* Hard goals.\nThe Controlls are slow, and that's okay... unless you're on a timer that's ticking down fast.\nThe amount of time it takes to turn the momentum of the ball takes way to long to be able to destroy the next object.\nIt's a bit unforgiving.\n\n\nThe game is fun, and if you love physics then this is the game for you.\n\nVerdict:\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nMusic: 0/10 Annoying as ♥♥♥♥!\nPhysics: 10/10 would break again.\nControlls: 3/10 (requires a 360 controller)\nGraphics: 10/10\n\nI hope the devs rais enough money to keep their company a flot.\nI read that the game director was scared out of his mind about the sales.\n\nSupport them!","June 2","true","2.6"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

But after a few rounds I think I get it.

Unfortunately, although the game looks great, clearly it has *never* been tested on a pc:\n\n1.  No keyboard/mouse at all, not bad keyboard/mouse --none.  I'm not sure how they even managed to do that, it's like they wrote code specifically to anger PC gamers :(\n2.  Won't go into fullscreen if desktop scaling is on.  It renders a weird 1/2 screen view that is totally unusable.  Turn scaling off and its fine.  Desktop scaling is 15+ year old feature on PC :(\n3.  It will break your audio *system wide* again, no idea how they even did that.  If you run this game, your audio will break across all apps until you next reboot.  Kind of amazed about this.\n\nEither the devs are trolling us or just don't own a pc (how did they build this?) -- needless to say don't buy until there is some kind of update.","June 3","false","0.3"," 27 of 66 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","27","66","0","2"

As someone with a not so great back/neck, I tend to lean back and play games with a controller whenever possible, so it just so happens I have a controller. And since I can read, I noticed the giant "this game requires a controller" warning when I bought the game, which for me makes it easier to play.\nAs far as gameplay? Its a little on the simple side, and I do wish I could hit it one or two more times per hole, or have a longer smashbreaker. I supposed it would have no challenge if you could keep going, but I just want to destroy more stuff!\nThis brings me to the main point of this review. This is a fun little physics destruction style puzzle game, just like it was advertized to be. The holes and objectives are creative, and the shot styles are a fun way to mix up your attempts. It is worth the ~20 bucks I spent on it, and would be even more worthwhile if on sale. Compare this to the cost of going to a 2 hour movie and getting a drink, and even getting 2 or 3 hours out of it makes the investment viable.I have already gotten those hours of enjoyment, and will probably complete it, which looks like it will take another 2 or 3 hours easily.\nAs a side note, I saw people complaining about the framerate being locked at 30fps, but you can set it to 60FPS. Maybe they just added it?\nAnd I also saw some complaining about technical problems. I can report that on my homebuilt Win 7 64bit i5/Nvidia 960 rig I have had no problems.","June 5","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
