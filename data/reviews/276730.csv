If you are looking for a game to pass some time, have some fun, shoot some bad guys and have fun alone or with your friends, BUY THIS GAME NOW.\n==================\nFull Review Below\nThis amazing game is not only nostalgic, but it is incredibly fun. You can play alone, you can play with friends, you can play online and local co-op. This game not only brings the nostalgic feeling of the 1980's in a wonderful, funny and entertaining way, but it is also challenging and has many play styles, characters, and weapons to choose from.\n\nGameplayYou start the game by picking a character, two weapons, and a throwable. After that you will pick the missions and start unleashing bullet hell on your enemies. The game has an excellent, funny and short story about a man named John Strong and his life of adventures. This game has it all, from guns, bullets, romance and bad guys to explosions, Arnold Schwarzenegger as a weapons dealer, and spooky scary ghosts.\n\nWhile in a mission, the game will point you the objectives you have to take care, It doesn't matter how, The cool thing about it, is the fact that the map and objectives are randomly generated, which sometimes might make it easier, harder and more challenging. At the beginning of the game you will be wondering, "Wow, where's the challenge in that?" And just like that, the game gets really hard, especially at the end. And you thought Dark Souls was hard...\n\nThe only true thing that made me sad about this game, is that I couldn't find ANYONE to play online with me. Luckily I had a spare controller, so me and my friend had lots of fun on this game. Which by the way, this game is better played with a controller.\n\nPersonal OpinionI simply loved this game and all it's features. I can't wait to bring all my friends and play it with them. If you love the 1980's, nostalgia, guns, explosions, action, and sexy manly mans without shirts shooting down bad buys, BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW! It is worth every penny and it's amazing. It has been so long since I had so much fun in a simple game like that.\n\nThe co-op makes it even better. You and (possibly) your friends are gonna have some fun with it. I recommend this game to all of you Arnold Schwarzenegger lovers. You won't regret it.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend buying the 4-Pack because it is EXTREMELY cheap. Plus you and your friends can play together and have some fun. Or you can just hold the extra copies hostage and make your friends pay the ransom. Though I wouldn't do that if your friend is the leader of an elite special forces or something... He might make you stick around.\n\nPROS+ Lots of action;\n+ Super fun;\n+ Super addicting;\n+ Extremely challenging & hard;\n+ Online and local co-op;\n+ Lots of weapons;\n+ Get to the Choppa!;\n+ Lots of enemy variations;\n+ Amazing soundtrack;\n+ Different characters with different status;\n+ Full controller support;\n+ Random generated map;\n+ Destructible Scenery.\n\nCONS- Few bugs and glitches;\n- Repetitive objectives;\n- A bit short game.\n\nGameplay - 9.5/10\nCo-op - 9.5/10\nInterface - 8.5/10\n\nFINAL VEREDICT\n9.5/10 - Perfect!\n"Would get to the choppa again!"\n\nA Note to the Developer(s)I loved your game! Even though I wasn't part of the 1980's myself, I simply loved all the references and the artwork. I just wish it had more missions. I really wanted to play it more.\n\nAlso, nice work on the game description on the Store Page. In fact, I didn't need to make this review. The description was well detailed and very well made.\n\nNow, I do hope you keep your promise of adding the Steam Workshop support. That will not only increase the replayability and fun, but it's also gonna be awesome for content creators and nostalgic porsuers like me.\n\nThe soundtrack is also amazing, I would love if you made it available for download. A tip: Some games like to sell their Soundtracks on Steam. so you could do that. Or just give it for free with the game like so many others.\n==================\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 30","true","9.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","3"

When you have games like Relic Hunter Zero that are free that does what Tango Fiesta is doing in a variety of ways, and the game is free, it's hard to give a recommendation. Especially with gameplay that does not complement the game design in question, as elements seem to work against each other in the over picture: a game that desperately wants to be faster then it is. Now the game has a goofy nature to it that executes rather well, and the presentation in terms of the visuals is enjoyable. But it lacks an oompf, a factor to make it stand out from the rest of the games in the industry even if its competently done, and at this price, it's hard to justify this purchase over other games of the genre. In the end, Tango Fiesta is a party that isn't very exciting.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/r8adIbxJUkQ\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nOff the wall story done in a random yet very goofy kind of way that executes well in delivery.\nCharacter models are nice, and the overall aesthetic of the game works in the big picture.\nControls are competently done in terms of execution, although there's a design element I'll elude to in the negative section.\nGame is competently done all around. But unfortunately......\n-:\nIt lacks punch. The game doesn't shine in one area at all in any significant way. While the game has strengths, it just does nothing in terms of gameplay to really change up the formula in a very crowded field.\nDon't see why the 8 access controls were necessary, especially with the control schemes implemented. Adds too much simplification of gameplay to my tastes.\nSome enemies blend into the background and don't fit the theme of the game or themselves. Weird audio plays on what seems to be an invisible enemy that may be a dog of some sort?\nInconsistent rules with things like destructible environments that seem to hinder the gameplay.\nGame shows its early access roots and this causes cohesion problems. In game UI has changed, but opening sequence and level preview shows old footage with a different UI set, almost a different game.\nThis review was reposted as the video linked to it unfortunately had a SLIGHT PROBLEM with youtube, because well youtube is a butt sometimes.","October 1, 2015","false","3.3"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","13","20","3","4"

You can see the little flourishes that the dev team are adding, little animations and jokes here and there that really add to the polish.\nIt's a pretty simple game and wears its heart on its sleeve, but it's all really well executed - if you're looking for something that's really fun to play with friends gathered round, Tango is perfect.

It's still very playable. You start with an automatic rifle, shotgun, and some grenades. Every enemy drops gold. Gold is use to unlock the other weapons. The longer you play the more enemies spawn until you destroy or capture the objectives, then the spawns stop and you get to mop up the stragglers. The next level unlocks after defeating the last, and you can select any level you've completed. The levels are themed after various 80's action movies. I noticed a good mechanic in the second set of levels that was quite impressive. It's a jungle with areas of brush from which you can post up and pick off the enemies. The brush blocks their gunfire. If you are equipped with a rifle, the bullets fly through the brush. If your other weapon is for example a submachinegun, your bullets  will only hit the brush. Each tile of brush is destructible, so it provides temporary cover. Also, walls of most structures are destructible as well. I want to keep this short for now so will end it here. I may pop in to edit in the future. I like top down shooters, and this one is fun. If you don't mind playing an alpha, and you really like top down shooters check this out. Was it worth the $15 or so pricetag? I mean, hey, I'm having fun with it, and my first impression was good, that the developers open to suggestion, and are frequently updating material. It's worth it for me.","July 28, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I decided to come back to Tango Fiesta now that it was released.\n\nIt... uh. Bleh. Guns are really bad at describing what they do before you use them in a level, which is fantastic since they're all terrifically expensive and several of them are an incredible pain to unlock via any method except running around in circles killing easy enemies for an hour, since you need to get hundreds of thousands of points in a single run.\n\n"But points! You get them by doing well!" Well, actually you don't get all that many by doing well, because you get points for killing enemies en masse, and you complete levels by ignoring most of the enemies and destroying the objectives, since enemies infinitely respawn and can be rather tough... especially enemy corporals, who sometimes take almost a full magazine, if not more, of your gun unloaded directly into their face to kill.\n\nBetween that and several glaring bugs still present in the launch version (enemies spawning or being knocked on top of walls in the Killionaire missions, a level of Bionic Cop that took me 5 tries arbitrarily deciding it would never end after I beat it) I wasn't really having that much fun with the game. Half of the bosses (Yatcha Queen, Ramishar) are interesting, but the others were just an exercise in running away from them in a straight line while shooting, and Ramishar's HP bar overstayed its welcome for me, a bit.\n\nI unfortunately wasn't able to complete the game yet, having gotten bogged down in the final level set, Bionic Cop, but I don't think it would change my review much even if I manage to get through it next time I try. Ultimately, there's much better twin-stick shooters and better, uh, Broforces. Like Broforce.\n\nEDIT: Tried once more, got through Bionic Cop 2, still not able to clear Bionic Cop 3. Guns still require me to farm 250+ enemy kills each.

If it looks fun to you, pull the trigger!","August 18, 2014","true","6.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

I can excuse the awful writing as an homage to the genre, but not the sticky controls, the tendency to crash, the inability to work with a gamepad despite the game’s recommendations to use one, and the myriad mindless yet still frustrating gameplay choices that make this a time-waster in the worst way. Perhaps with the four players on one screen it’s fine, but I feel like so much effort was put into making it playable by four people at once that there was no consideration for whether it should be.","December 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At the moment it's entirely unplayable.\nEven when your friend is able to join your game, they can not affect it in any way, bar picking up items.\nTheir bullets freeze on the spot, while they can still take damage, and be killed, as evidenced in my first impression video.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/oPmixSft2rY\n\nThe game certainly has a lot of potential. I do like the music, art direction, and gameplay ( when able to play ).

The accent in the gun shop is not funny, it is actually just annoying. The lack of foresight in missions can have you walk into a ton of men, whose rapid gunfire is incredibly frustrating to dodge. It takes way too long to hack  an objective with how many men it spawns while yu are hacking, so you always take a beating, because they don't stop spawning until you complete the objective. The weapons seem very similar, and some are named something silly, such as 'mac & cheese'. Overall, I feel like this game is trying too hard to be something it is not. The lack of aim in this isn't challenging, it is (much like the accent in the gun shop) annoying, unlike other games' lack of aim can be, such as the Binding of Isaac. Nobody ever hosts a server for online play either. This is not worth it's current price, and unless it has some dramatic improvements, never will be. I've played better FREE games online.","July 30, 2014","false","0.7"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

It's a twin stick shooter that doesn't use the second stick for shooting, just aiming... Enemies take way too much damage, objectives are extremely repetitive and dull(such as hold A button next to a radio tower to fill the meter or shoot a building for 4 mins, both while enemies spawn around the point). Seriously, it's clunky, awkward and bizzare for a twin stick shooter. Just buy any other twin stick shooter, it will be guaranteed better than this pill of junk.","August 18, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"
