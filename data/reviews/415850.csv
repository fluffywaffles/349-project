It reminded me of some of my favorite Japanese horror movies, like “One Missed Call”. It has a nice set-up in a small Japanese town, the characters look like typical high-school students with their own problems and….curses.\n\nBut I don`t want to write spoilers, so will just say that the story itself has nice twists in best traditions of Japanese horrors. I should also say, that at first the main characters – Kuoko and Kyuuhei – were not really pleasant in some ways. Kuoko was shown as a type of girl who plays with boys and uses them for her benefit – quite an awful character, don`t you think? Kyuuhei was annoying at some point but I think it`s just my own issue, so no wonder I started to really like him later, when I saw more of him.\n\nAlso, the art was really nice. I liked Kuoko in particular. Music was suitable too and added to the atmosphere.\n\nAll in all, the game is not really long: it took me around 3 hours to complete it and get all possible endings. Still, the experience was quite enjoying and the price is quite low, so if you`re looking for a nice short game to give you goosebumps (if you are as paranoid as I am, at least) I`d recommend you to try it.","November 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","48","62","3","12"

Under those conditions, I absolutely recommend it. It's unintentionally funny, there are quite a few hiccups in the translation (my personal favorites being "mean't" and "It isn't work throwing my life away over something like that"), and Kyuuhei is sometimes painfully oblivious.\n\nIf you go in expecting to be scared, you're not going to get it. Minus one legitimate attempt at a jump scare, there's just no horror in it.\n\nBut if you're here for questions such as:\nHow long ago did [event] occur? It has been either one day or a few weeks.\nHow is this game so popular despite the rumors that people die when they play it, no visible marketing, and a download link that never works?\nWait which character said that line?\nWhat is that line even supposed to mean????\n"mean't"?\nThen go for it. I can definitely think of worse ways to spend $2 and a few hours. I highly recommend viewing/playing with friends, since it's the way most mediocre horror is ideally enjoyed and definitely made me feel warmer towards BAD END than I might have otherwise felt.","November 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","27","30","9","1"

In Bad End we take on the role of the MC, who's best friend just died after failing to beat a new and popular mobile game.. Is this game responsible for his death? If so, then who made such a game and how does it exist? These are the mysteries that we are tasked with solving.. There are several different decisions that need to be made during the game and some of them will lead directly to death, also known as a "Bad End". If you can survive the game and solve the mystery, then you will get the "True Ending".\n\nThe only problem I had with this game is that some of the decisions to be made seemed really random.. Such as, do I run left, right, or go straight when a monster is chasing me? Do I want to hang out with my friend or stay home for the day? Considering a lot of these choices lead to death, it'd be nice if the decisions I made actually gave some sort of a hint as to which one you needed to pick in order to survive. Most of the time, if I picked the wrong choice, I reloaded and picked the other choice, but that just makes things a little tedious.... Also, some of the characters in this game act really irrationally.. If a killer was chasing me down, then the last thing I'd want to do is go hang out on a roof top where no body else is around.. Or go on a date with a cute boy at school..\n\nStill, these small things aside, Bad End is a refreshing little VN and was a lot of fun for me to play through.. The game took me about 2 hours to beat, and if you use tactical reloads when you make the wrong choices in game then you will have no problem experiencing the "True Ending" your first play through and without the help of guide.. So for $2, go ahead and buy this VN! And when you're done, come back to this review and let me know what you think down in the comments below ^_^","November 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","18","20","4","0"

At $1.98, you'll get at least 2-3 hours from it if not more for trying to get all the different 'BAD' endings.

It was a typical high school slice of life for Kyuuhei until his best friend, Yuuji dies by an unknown cause. Moreover, around the time of the incident, rumors have spread about a mysterious visual novel mobile game called BAD END where if you reach a bad end within the game, the player actually dies in real life.\n\nBAD END delivers a different approach to horror visual novel games. The writing style of the story adapts the traditional Japanese Horror you see on movies. The choices given in the game results to whether you continue to progress or reach a bad end immediately, making every decision shaky for the player. The art style is nice. The music could have been better if there was quite a variety but the tailoring of events made up for it.\n\nBAD END is a decent visual novel to grab. The price is well-matched for its content and it's a good visual novel to start with to anyone new to the genre especially if you're looking for a horror visual novel. It's a bit short but it's not text-heavy and remains interesting along the way. For an indie visual novel, this is one of the few good ones.","November 26, 2015","true","2.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

In fact, you might laugh at most of the scenes, with laughable translations and failed attempts at jumpscares.\n\n\nPros:\n- Multiple Replayability\n- A plot that has good cliffhanging capabilities, plot twists, decent story\n- Actually lived up to its name: Has multiple 'Bad Endings'\n- Cute backgrounds and decently drawn characters\n\nCons:\n- Cheesy music; not really fit into the game, which is of Horror genre\n- The music is not looped correctly, but I think it's negligible\n- Failed to live up to its genre\n- No character drawing for the MC (Main Character)\n- Few cast to further engage the plot.

I think loading from save datas count as replayability too.\n\nI'd not recommend this game if you are REALLY looking for a Horror Visual Novel.

This is my first ever experience with the genera, and despite its flaws, it left a good impression on me.\n\nYou take on the role of Kyuuhei; an everyday college kid with everyday interests. It isn’t until a tragic event spirals his life into a horror mystery.\n\nKyuuhei’s best friend, Yuuji, spends an evening at his house, wasting the hours away with videogames and conversation. It isn’t until Yuuji says something that fills the air with discomfort.  He describes a new game on the market called BAD END, in which players die in real life if they die in the game. The two trade their thoughts and even try downloading the game, but to no avail. As dusk turns to night, Yuuji decides to head home. Later, Kyuuhei is awoken by a text message. Yuuji claimed to have successfully downloaded the game on his cellphone. They talk briefly before going to bed. By dawn, Kyuuhei’s given some shocking news… Yuuji’s dead. It’s your job to uncover the truth behind BAD END and avenge your friend’s death.\n\nThis is the extent of the plot. The whole concept of playing a choose-your-own-adventure game within a choose-your-own-adventure game is fun and creative, and the game juggles its two sets of characters well. The backdrops are nice on the eyes, but I don’t see myself daydreaming about their beauty. Point is, they achieve what they strive to achieve.\n\nAs for characters, they’re done pretty well, both astatically and verbally. Their designs are detailed and they boast a handful of fascial reactions, but what really matters is their writing. In a game like this, your artwork may be jaw-droppingly beautiful or vomit-inducingly ugly, but story and writing will always be more important, and as for BAD END, they do an alright job. Each character portrays their own personality and uniqueness, and their writing is decent.\n\nThat’s really the best word to describe this game: Decent.\n\nBut don’t take that as a negative. It took me a minute to care about the story, but it wasn’t long before it engrossed me. I genuinely wanted to know what was going to happen. What BAD END reminds me of the most is a B-Horror film. It’s got the cheesy writing and cheesy plot of one, and I often felt like I was watching a Halloween Disney special. But again, that isn’t a bad thing. It lent a certain charm that only this kind of entertainment can provide, and you’ll get your money’s worth.\n\nIt’s safe to say that I’ll start playing more games like this. If you’ve never experienced this genre before, you’ll be happy with BAD END’s presentation. It’s a great start for noobs like me. However, if you’re well versed in this style of entertainment, or you have higher expectations, you won’t be missing anything if you skip this one. But seeing as how cheap it is, something as harmless and simple as BAD END can be enjoyed by almost anybody.","December 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I remember the days of seeing you on the Google Play Store and thinking to myself "Nah, I have Tsukihime to finish." Should you play Bad End? If you want to spend the $1.98. It is worth it for that price, but the visual novel itself is not good.\nThe story is boring and cliche, and some of the lines were just really...... really? I mean really? The characters are bland. None of them develope in any way, not even the main character throguhout the course of the game. He's just dead set on beating the game, and other than a few "Keep Playing" choices, there's no dillemas or anything he has to face outside of the badends, and this makes the game drag on.\nIt's honestly not even worth going through the trouble of getting the bad endings unless you do it purely for the achievments. There's practically no difference in most of them and they don't make any difference or add any new exposition at all. (Saying this because in some visual novels they add details in the bad ends that are relevant to the story, but wouln't fit in the main route.)\nThere's really nothing else to say about the game. That's how much content it has. If you think 2 hours of stale writing is worth 2 dollars, then go for it, i personally think the price isn't too bad for what you're getting.","February 6","true","4.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I got well over ten hours of fun reading practice for $2, and I still need to do another playthrough to fortify vocab. This seems to be aimed toward middle - high schoolers. (The hours count it shows for me isn't accurate because I left it running in the background a lot)\n\nPros:\n-There is no automatically advancing text. All must be advanced manually.\n-There is a dialog log that shows past dialog lines.\n-If you have two monitors, you can have dictionaries and whatever else open on the other one, and you can move your mouse between the two. The game doesn't even minimize, just pauses.\n\nCons:\n- Some hard Kanji usage. For example writing かわいそう as 可哀相. Who does that??\n- They took a lot of liberties with the English translation. It's not very helpful to play the English and Japanese versions side-by-side. Sometimes it helps, but not often enough for me to bother with it.\n\nI liked the story too, though the ending was kind of a letdown. There may be a better ending that I just didn't get. As for the horror aspect, it's pretty tame. It's a creepy idea, but not very likely to keep you up at night, and there aren't any gory scenes or such, none that I ran across anyway.","April 17","true","35.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the indie Visual Novel/Choose Your Own Adventure BAD END. BAD END was devloped by Arai Koh Create Office and published by YOX-Project. It was released on Steam on 11/25/2015\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TK0jGYX7d4o\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nMaybe grab it for $1 as an intro to the Visual Novel style. It works better than you initially realize if you give it a chance.\n2/5 Stars\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nOK, so I grabbed this for a buck and figured "Why not?" and let me tell you why you CAN. If you're new to the genre, or are of a younger audience even, this is certainly something to consider if you can grab it for a buck like I did. It is not too text heavy and the story is fairly easy to follow. The graphics are decent, but get repetitive. Same with the audio. Now, for a Visual Novel, you may need to ramp up the audio and video components more simply to avoid as much repetition. For a typical CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) however, there really isn't much need for graphics at all, so long as your story is engaging. I didn't think of this game so much as a CYOA until I explored it further and began branching out to more endings. As the story goes on, there is more choice (thought not a lot, it is a short game). The story itself (Horror) is quite formulaic, but still works out ok. So, in this gamers opinion, you'd need better story and more choices that branch out better.\n\nWhy not, though? Well, frankly, $2 is just too much. It is only worth picking up at a dollar or less as it is just an average experience at best. None of the aspects of the game are horrible, but none are remarkable or significantly above average either.\n\nJust....meh.\n\n2/5\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","November 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 12 of 40 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","12","40","0","0"

I am very familiar with Visual Novels from Japan and I have played alot of them.\n\nThis one in particular is just a port from Android/iOS Phones for Steam. I later realized this. However, The price point is set very well about how much this game is worth\n\nIt is pretty short, took me about 3 hours to get ALL endings, 1 hour for one playthrough to True End. So its better to get this on your phone and play it spurratically IMHO.\n\n-I Purchased this game because I am a huge fan of Survival Horror type games where the Protagonist is mutilated in a variety of interesting ways. This was rather lacking to what I'm used to. All the Bad Endings are mostly the same with little difference in what happens. Very Unoriginal Bad Endings  For a game called BAD END, only the True end makes the game make sense lol\n-The BGM (Background Music) was very distracting in key scenes which were supposed to be scary with "Happy Tones".\nSo calling this "Survival Horror" is kinda a joke.\n-There were very few Unique CGS, but considering the length of the game, understandable.\n-The plot breaking the 4th wall and back again was entertaining at first, but was dragged on and on throughout the game. Personally I have enjoyed stories from Amatuer Visual Novelists better than this, but it was an okay way to spend an hour of life.\n-Best part of the game is the funny posts you can see in the Discussion community after you play\n\nI recommend you play other Visual Novels instead, use vndb.org to find the genre you like best. Steam isn't really the best port for these types of games yet, but the 16:9 / Fullscreen Aspect Ratio was appreciated (Although you would get the same thing on your phone)\n\nIf you really want to get this game, it is entertaining for about an hour or so, and I would get it on iOS/Android because of conveinence. Also it IS made to be a mobile game.","March 25","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is pretty short, clocking in at about two hours for me personally (and that's because I actually took the time to try to get every achievement. If you don't care about such things, the game will probably be a lot shorter for you)\n\nThat said, the art is actually pretty decent and the story was engaging enough to keep my interest when I played it. Though there are some holes towards the true end of the story that does hurt the writing a little here. Not enough to completely ruin it, mind you, but it was something I couldn't help but notice.\n\nIt's pretty cheap so it's not a bad buy, but I recommend this ONLY if you're a visual novel fan and looking for something to kill time with. It's not as scary as other horror VNs, but it does have a charm reminiscent of "One Missed Call" and if that's the sort of thing you like, then go for it.\n","March 16","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the end of 2.5 hours, my first thought was "Well, there goes 2 hours I'll never get back." I very rarely say that about the game. That said, 2.5 hours isn't bad for a $2.00 price tag. But honestly it felt like they took what could have been a very interesting concept and watered it down into something else entirely.\n\nOne big issue I had with the gameplay was that once you die, you either start over completely from the beginning of the entire game and have to hold down your mouse for literal ages (and re-choose from previous dialogues), or you have to start from where you left off at the last save point. The latter of these options still consists of holding your mouse down for ages.\n\nSpeaking of the mouse thing, there is a LOT of dialogue. If you like reading, you might like it. I struggled with reading it all, but did, and while the story itself was okay, the scripts and playout in the end were not so much to my liking.\n\nThis really comes down to personal taste and by all means, if you think you'll like it, you just might. I'm really on the fence about saying yay or nay and just out of that experience I had I have to go nay. But it's not a concrete thing. The game reminds me of Hell Girl in a sense, and that's why I feel it would have done well as an anime. But as a game, it left me looking for closure. And things without closure are hard to enjoy for me personally.\n\nIt's not bad for what it is, it just isn't for everyone. I can't recommend it unless you're okay with a lot of reading, okay with backtracking when you fail, okay with holding down the mouse for long periods of time and repeating many scenes, or, alternatively, you're going for the achievements/cards/whatever and following a guide.","March 16","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the translation had some errors, they weren't too serious that you couldn't follow the story. And as far as the story goes, it's kind of a game inside a game deal. The story is about a new cell phone game (visual novel style) going around where you die in real life if you make a bad choice and get a bad ending. It kills your friend and off you go to play it yourself and solve the mystery.  Kind of like Fall into Poison, the bad endings are somewhat fun to collect, and there are Steam achievements for each. I often tried to get all the bad outcomes first before continuing with the story and it was usually pretty easy to do so. I wish they were more creative with the names.... you'll see a lot of Bad End 7, Bad End 8, etc. It's a horror/mystery game that's rarely all that scary or mysterious. The characters are fairly one dimensional as well, most of them, anyway. And the end result of everything is pretty absurd.

Basically I think it is a pretty decent little VN, & there are people that complain that is not Horror, but there is even a dialogue in the game where thr character you are playing is playing BAD END, & says it is more like an adventure survivalistic game, what I'm trying to say is that a lot of people complain that this VN isn't a horror, even though if they actually played the VN they would get it wasn't really meant to be a horror VN, &  I don't think people should not try to give this game a try, just because it's not "horror".  Also another complaint for this game is your choices don't matter, you will just die no matter what, which yes, is true for the BAD ENDS, since that is kind of their point, however your choices do matter & you have to do stuff a cerain way to get the other type of ending, & even the bad endings you have to make choices in a certain way to get that specific bad ending, the same for regular endings.  & while it is true the story is somewhat cliche, it is still a nice little story well worth the $1.98.\n\nGraphics/art style:  8.5/10, it has really nice art with some good CGs\nStory:  6.5 or 7/10, a nice little story with likable characters, where I actually felt sad for them, & felt sad for their deaths\nChoice system: 5.5/10, the choices do matter & there is a lot of them, & you do get new dialogues & scenes but not much branching a very linear story, which is fine, since it is still a good VN.\n\nA highly suggest this VN, I hope you enjoy it as I did.","May 22","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I often find myself disagreeing with their Let's Plays of visual novels anyway, but still. Not sure if the epilogue was a teaser to a sequel, or simply just a joke, but if the creator ever comes out with more games, I'll happily support it.","June 1","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
