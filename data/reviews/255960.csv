The extent of your abilities as the roach are to move up, down, left, and right, and interact with things by pushing them or using your weight or presence.  The short term goals the roach needs to achieve (puzzles) are cryptically given in the form of poetic (rhyming) riddles that are often subtlely humorous; the puzzles themselves are quite challenging, possibly to the point of being frustrating for some players depending on their tolerence for or enjoyment of adventure game puzzles.\n\nThe developers and creaters of the game did a very good job in realizing a very dark and ominous game in tone, atmosphere, and mood.  The music is also very good and fits perfectly.  The Steam release also includes some extra content:  the soundtrack (two compact discs worth) in mp3 and FLAC format, some videos with developer commentary, concept art, storyboards and more.","July 6, 2014","true","0.5"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","44","54","0","0"

The scenary is detailed and very realistic on the objects and interactions you'll find, even though graphics are clearly limited. It's old technology, but it is so well done it feels right. The history is a good and interesting complement to the theme.\n\nOn the negative side, controls and game feedback are bad. Sometimes you know you have to interact with something, but can't seem to get it done, and sometimes you'll find yourself with no clues to resolve a puzzle.\n\nI recommend playing this game with a walkthrough, for times you get stuck. To me, it did not ruin an excelent game experience, and made me focus on the many good points in this game.\n\nIt's a short game (I would guess most people would take around 3-5 hours to finish it) and even though is limited on playability, it makes you feel like you're really living a history. In the experience aspect, it is a far better game than many modern ones.","August 3, 2014","true","3.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Bad Mojo is a nasty, gritty adventure game about a man turned cockroach. It's a major displeasure to look at, and fittingly so. The game's pretty cryptic at first, being thrown into a sewer with no instructions, but if you continue exploring around, where you're supposed to be going will be guided pretty much. $5.99 isn't bad, as you get bonus material such as concept art. and the making-of documentaries along with commentary over the cutscenes, so, overall, if you're not squeemish, get Bad Mojo.","July 9, 2014","true","0.1"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murikov/recommended/255960/","murikov","Murikov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murikov/","327 products in account","A weird, partly nauseating, yet strangely good adventure game from the golden 90s. A small blast from the past.\n\nAfter being transformed into a cockroach, it's up to the player to find out more about his mysterious past and to solve puzzles in a ridden-down tavern in San Francisco. From the bird's eye perspective you control the cockroach with your arrow keys i.e. with WASD and basically let it crawl around in bathrooms, kitchens and other rooms to find out how to transform yourself back into your human form. During your bizarre journey other insects and animals are happy to help you or to eat you - watch out for Franz, the cat.\n\nThe story is mainly being told by several live-action cutscenes, pouring the charm and the feeling of 90's FMV games. While some younger gamers nowadays may disagree with me, I find that such cutscenes with real actors should find their way to modern gaming again. It gives a story a much more deeper note, even though acting back then wasn't always top-notch. Remember the good old C&C cutscenes by the way?\n\nAnyway, the game is quite short though (circa 4 hours) and has its flaws as well. Sometimes there are some bugs (hehe, bugs...) when the savestate is being loaded and your roach suddenly finds itself trapped in a wet spot. Just load again the same game if this happens. Furthermore the pre-rendered 2D graphics with the relatively small interactive sections aren't everybody's taste, but I found them appealing for a mid-90's adventure game.\n\nThe Good:\n+ A fair amount of live-action cutscenes\n+ Good and innovative story\n+ Interesting interaction with small-scale environment\n+ A dark, grimly atmosphere\n\nThe Bad:\n- Relatively short\n- Outdated (but charming) graphics\n- Some minor bugs (not the ants, maggots, roaches...)\n\nThe Ugly:\n-- Some nasty scenes in the game. I liked them though.\n\nGive Bad Mojo a try if it's on sale, it keeps you entertained for a whole evening. With its numerous cutscenes it sometimes appears like a interactive movie rather than a video game. Nonetheless pretty recommended.\n\n7/10","October 21, 2014","true","3.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Your basicly a cocoroach in a couple of rooms. but these rooms are HUGE and so interesting. If you loved the premise of films such as Honey i shrunk the kids and bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy stuff such as Pye, get this and look incredibly cool playing it day after day ;)\n\nCompletely surreal !!\n\nGraphics - sort of grainy/gritty  digitized  mix with some nice art. Realy well set up scenes and stylized FMV.\nSound - standout, spooky and weird synth stuff up to the usual cult b-movie quality of that era.\nGameplay, lots of exploring and solving puzzles (with minimal , easy to get to grips with controls ), some not so hard and some that have taken me months! (Just like the old days) . Some unfair trial and error but, its from the era of the quick save, pretty brutal.\n\n\n\nWe need more games like this !","September 5, 2014","true","1.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

A surreal feverdream of a game with a gritty horror atmosphere coupled with cheesy but charming FMVs. I would definitly recommend it if you are into adventure games.

Buy it. Now.\n\nAlright so to make it a bit longer, I would say that except for three reasons (too young - not incline to try oldies - not very open minded in general), there is NO reason whatsoever you could not enjoy this work of art. There is everything in it: visuals, sounds, musics, drawings, acting, lightning, writing, poetry, catharsis... The game is very short, although it took me months when I was a teenager at the time, but don't expect to spend more than ten hours to figure it out. You can finish the game in thirty minutes, probably, but finding all there is to read, watch and learn, all left from the honest and hard working developers to the audience, would take you these ten hours.\n\nThe story is fantastic, the acting is brilliant, the world conception is marvelous, the psychology behind all the story is genius. Plus it works without any tweak on modern computers, AND you get a nice making of bonus with cool devs talking.\n\nIn other words, and for real gamers: remember Sanitarium? This game is not a point and click, but it will give you the same impact. That's right, the impact of the word: masterpiece.\n\nDO RECOMMEND!","June 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It certainly looks like it. Unfortunately, it doesn't run. Have a look at the discussion forums for this game and you'll see several threads of people trying to find a way to stop the game from crashing on load, and not succeeding. Nightdive and Steam have both refused to offer any support or assistance with this problem. It crashes intantly on loading: the only way I was able to get the 5 minutes of gameplay required to post a review was to leave the crash error window open for a while. If you're prepared to gamble with the possibility of the game not working, go ahead and give it a try. You may get lucky.

I remember playing the original game on release, and it was amazing.  The product description states that the game is "rendered in stunning hi-resolution detail", but that quip must be a relic from the original release.  And I'm not sure what "updated FMV" refers to, because everything I've seen in this version of the game is rendered in grainy 640x480 8-bit video.  It's dishonest to market this as an updated version of the twenty year-old game when the only update has been to hack it together to operate on modern operating systems.  It doesn't even scale the graphics to modern dimensions - it just forces your desktop resolution to 640x480 (which is guaranteed to look beyond foul on a modern high-res wide-screen LCD display).  Alt-tabbing out to adjust the volume (it can't be done in-game, of course) rearranges windows and desktop icons to fit on a 640x480 display.  This game is a hot mess, and I can't recommend it even to those who remember it fondly from a best-forgotten era.","September 27, 2014","false","0.1"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","23","47","0","4"
