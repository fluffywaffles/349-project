The game is simple but fun, and provides a good challenge during the second half of the game.  It can be tricky but the checkpoints are placed in such a way that you're willing to take risks and try new ideas to get past some obstacle - a very important attribute for puzzle games.\n\nThe only thing that is sub par is the animation (or lack of).  It isn't really needed, but the game has the GameMaker feel, a bunch of sprites just moving around the screen with a short walking animation, which I find kind of off putting.  It isn't important, but it should be mentioned.\n\nIf you like physics manipulation games or platformers, then I recommend buying this.  The game is $3 at the time of this writing, more than worth it.","February 11, 2014","true","13.0"," 96 of 105 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","96","105","0","0"

Defy Gravity is your basic puzzle platformer where you have to use an unusual mechanic to navigate levels. In this case, you can shoot gravity fields that attract you or repel you and activate a shield that lets you ignore all gravity fields. By mixing these, you can sort of rocket-jump-grapple-hook your way through levels. Some timed jumping and obstacles that sometimes are and sometimes are not affected by the gravity are there to stop your progress.\n\nIn the words of a wise man, you're going to die. A lot. The game takes delight in throwing stuff in your way at just the wrong moment. But at the same time, it's surprisingly forgiving with how you swing around the level and you can often brute force your way through tight spots. "Hectic" is not a word you usually associate with puzzlers, but Defy Gravity can get pretty hectic -- and that's when it's arguably at its most fun. For me it hits just the right balance between frustration and challenge.\n\nThe graphics and sound are absolutely nothing special, but in terms of pure gameplay, this is value for money even when it's not 90% off. When it is, of course, it's a no-brainer, just get it. :-)\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","0.8"," 115 of 139 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","115","139","0","2"

The game is short so I have to say only buy it on a major sale, but well worth the time if these kind of games interest you.\n\nGameplay wise it is a fun platformer, and does remind me a bit of Portal. It isn't an exact copy though, instead of Portals, you manipulate Gravity to repel and attract yourself and other objects. The momentum and physics of the game is fun to toy with, though it CAN be frustrating at times. Checkpoints are placed in fair spots of most stages to reduce frustration, but later stages stretch this out quite a bit so you will have to keep on your toes or be prepared to die again and again.\n\nI did beat the main story but I decided to leave before continuing deep into hard mode. It takes away one of your powers and while I do feel that's an interesting challenge, I'm satisfied with just beating the main modes.","November 1, 2014","true","4.3"," 79 of 96 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","79","96","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/96100/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewDefy Gravity Extended is a small game, with only a few tricks, but does it very well. It lacks the flair of a quality game, but once you go in and try it, it certainly redeems itself. In this game, you play as a spacesuit wearing gravitymancer trying to pass the gauntlet. You are equipped with a gravity gun (not the HL type!) and have to traverse many levels to prove your worth!\n\nThe Pros:Simple Concept - If you can make a simple game fun, you have succeeded as a developer. The game mechanics are very simple. You move about, and create two types of "portals". One that has a strong gravitational pull and one that repels objects. You can also activate a shield around you that negates any gravity effects. Leaving breaking the laws of physics aside, you must combine these simple actions in order to get yourself to the exit.\n\nGood Level Design - I'm not talking about the aesthetics, of course! I'm referring to the level layout, the challenges you face, their diversity, their difficulty. It impressed me how challenging this game became in later levels, without repeating itself throughout. The levels are many times relying on sinusoidal patterns and geometric arrays of projectiles!\n\nChallenging - The levels begin increasingly harder, and some are outright stressful. If you are looking for something to test your skill and patience with, you've come to the right place!\n\nGood Music - The background music is a nice relaxing tune that suits the space environment we are supposed to be in. Really helps ease out the stress from those hard levels.\n\nCheap - The game is 0.99€ at normal price and can go all the way down to 0.09€ when on sale. So, just give it a try, it will cost you basically nothing. (Not to mention it has Steam Trading Cards)\n\nAchivements! - Few achievements, only requirement is passing the game. Sounds easy, huh? It's not, but good luck, hunters!\nThe Cons:Ugly Visuals - The textures aren't eye candy and everything is flat and pixelated. While I'm not saying a game is good if it looks good, it wouldn't hurt getting a little face lift every now and then.\n\nShabby Animations - The animations are barely existent, sometimes movement may seem plastic, especially the way your character tilts its body when looking at the cursor.\nConclusion:Defy Gravity Extended is certainly not a game for everyone, so if you don't like skill-based platformers with minimal controls, then look elsewhere. If however, you like that sort of thing and still have the pocket change from grocery shopping, then consider giving it a go!\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

No game exploits, no grinding to get to a certain level or luck driven events.\nJust simple, skill-based levels with original and adaptive gameplay.\n\nGranted that not everyone is into 2D flash puzzle-platformers, this game may not be what everyone is looking for, however if you do purchase this game and give it the time of day, I think you might be pleasantly surprised at how much fun you'll have.\n\nExtra - The authentic soundtrack is very atmospheric and enjoyable.","August 4, 2015","true","2.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","1"

To be in space. The final frontier. There's all kinds of cool things up there, all of which could kill everyone on our planet in the blink of an eye. We could all just be a little flickering candle of a planet, snuffed out by the flap of a little space butterfly's wing. It's pretty cool.\n\n\nWe've obviously never really been in space though, or on the moon. That's a conspiracy perpetuated by Richard Nixon and the Disney Channel. You don't want to believe the lies, but it makes people happy. Just like the tooth fairy or the concept of chivalry. You can believe whatever you like, but really all they want is to get in your mouth and leave some money on your nightstand.\n\n\nWhile humanity will probably never REALLY be in space, because space is actually also a conspiracy that Disney Channel likes to keep going for their "special interests", we can imagine what this fictitious place called outer space is like through video games. Yeah!\n\n\nAccording to the legends, people can float in space. There's a force that pulls things towards planets, but there's none of it in space. "Gravity", they call it. It's apparently what holds us onto Earth. Even though everyone knows that we're actually held to the Earth's surface by the natural paste on our feet and shoes. If you ever sprayed non-stick cooking spray on your feet, you'd float into the sun and die.\n\n\nBut gravity makes for an interesting theoretical concept, and an even better game. Defy Gravity, which has also apparently been Extended, is a sweet little gem of a PC game you can get on Steam.\n\n\nDefy Gravity is a little budget puzzle platformer. Nothing too fancy. I probably bought it for a quarter. But definitely a quarter well-spent. It's short, sweet, fun, and surprisingly smart.\n\n\nThere's a definite Portal vibe going on here, and it's at least mildly Metroid-inspired in some way. Your character controls gravity with their gun, which is capable of shooting two different colors to make pushy gravity and pully gravity. They also PLOT TWIST ARE GIRL WITH BOOBIES. GIRLS CAN PLAY GAMES TOO.\n\n\nWHEN HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF AND HAS THE BOOBS SO YOU KNOW IT'S FEMINISM.\n\n\nDID YOU KNOW GIRLS CAN DO THINGS.\n\n\nDefy Gravity packs a lot of punch for a simple game. I can count the amount of stage hazards on my fingers. And yet the way they're combined is never dull. It's a short, compact game. There's not a super bountiful amount of content. But for what you're paying for, they squeeze every little drop of game out of it.\n\n\nMost puzzle games need to be this huge-♥♥♥ Rube Goldberg type of thing. There's so many things everywhere, and you need to remember all these different elements that interact with one another in all these ways. And when all of that combines, you can pop a balloon or some ♥♥♥♥. Defy Gravity has like, a brick and some lemons. One lemon has a nail wedged into it. There's a dog. And yet they manage to pop the ♥♥♥♥ out of so many balloons. There's some really memorable levels with only those elements. It's humble, and it's simple. But it's smart, it's fun, and it's well-worth the quarter I spent on it.\n\n\nIt's a budget title for sure. Everything seems to follow the basic theme of "Not amazing, but for a quarter this is pretty nice". It's not meant to be the biggest, most impressive game you can buy. Graphically, it's incredibly simplistic. It almost looks like it was done in Flash or something. The sprites are decent, but everything is very basic looking. The graphics work though. They're unimpressive, but they're not ugly. It has a nice look to it, the sprites are well made, and the general art direction and style works.\n\n\nIts game design and mechanics are its biggest selling point. It's not even particularly long. It's pretty short actually. But it's a brutal platformer later in the game, so it can definitely take you a few hours to complete with the excellently done difficulty ramp considered. And if you're a sucker for brutal puzzle-platforming, the extra Hard mode post-game is enough to frustrate most platformer fans.\n\n\nThere was clearly some love put into the game. It's well-designed and has a nice coat of polish. Cheap polish, yeah. Not the name brand polish that all the super models use. More like store brand Kmart polish. It'll get the job done. Might even look nice. They'll never know, probably. Your mother-in-law will be able to tell, and she'll gossip about it to everyone just to spite you. You ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. But no one else will notice otherwise.\n\n\nIt's a nice game. It's pretty nice. Better than most things you'd buy on Steam for the price. It's like the difference between putting your quarter in a fancy machine with flashy lights and junk, and giving your quarter to a homeless heroin addict. You want to pay for the nice machine, not only to reward yourself with the gumball but to reward the nice people that took the time to build this nice machine. You don't want to flip a quarter to a guy that's gonna save up to shoot himself up with heroin, break into your house and ♥♥♥♥ your guinea pig or your sister or something. Think of the guinea pigs.","January 13","true","2.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It has an original concept, and good application. It was challenging, fun, infuriating at times, and immensely satisifying to complete. The storyline is relatively simple - as are the controls. You will almost always be able to understand how a level should be beat, but the application will still be somewhat challenging, and may require a few attempts. Once you've beaten the game, there is a secondary playthrough which removes one of your abilities, rendering the game a completely different approach - needing more planning and less random leaping about. It assumes you know how the mechanics work at that point, then puts your knowledge to the test. The game was a bit short, but well paced. I would happily buy the game again, and at it's current price, it is more than worthwhile, even just to test it out.","October 16, 2014","true","5.0"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","0"

This game has been out for at least a year, maybe 2 even. The release date has changed simply so that the game will appear on the Steam store front. Very fishy action from this dev and this should not be alowed on Steam. The new release date is simply fake and false.\n\nI played it for 5 minutes and crashed 5 times by pressing W at the start point. Seems to be made with Unity (or Clickteam), but badly coded.\n\nI also looked al the reviews and most of them now show up a 'pre release' due to the fake release date. Not to mention that a lot of the reviews seems to be super positive with a 10 minute total play time, so I call those fake too. I can't really check how good/bad the game is ,because I crash every minute just by pressing a key.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/96100/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nDefy Gravity follows a similar road with some other platformers we've seen lately, using space as a foundation for the game, as you take control of one of the Gravitymancers who came to the Gauntlet, the ultimate test, in order to prove themselves. However, where other platformers with a similar pattern such as The Swapper manage to tell an interesting and unique story using the darkness and emptiness of space, Defy Gravity only introduces you to the Gauntlet, without actually telling you what it really is, what purpose does it serve and why would anyone risk their lives just to prove that they can get to the end. It is quite obvious that story isn't the main focus here, but even so it's hard not to notice the missed opportunity, since The Gauntlet itself could've been filled with messages from others who tried and were defeated by The Gauntlet or pretty much anything at all to justify your desire to finish it; instead you're left with a left to right Mario-style platformer without any princess at the end.\nRating: 4\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is based around the use of gravity wells, which can be created using your gun, in addition to the ones that are already placed on the map and cannot be moved; using those wells properly and learning how they influence other objects is key in Defy Gravity, as almost every puzzle is based on how well you manage to use the gravity wells depending on position, as well as timing. There are two types of gravity wells: positive and negative; the positive wells will attract objects towards them, including yourself, while the negative ones will repel them, and combining those wells with your anti-gravity shield that makes you immune to all wells is what makes the gameplay unique and interesting. The whole concept does wear out by the end of the game, as there won't be any new ideas introduced into the game later on, leaving you mostly with more bouncing objects to avoid in order to make the game harder, something that does happen once you finish the game and Hard mode is unlocked, disabling negative gravity wells and changing a few things in each level in order to make it more challenging.\nRating: 8.5\n\nGraphics\nThe first thing you will probably notice are the backgrounds, which look amazing and change from level to level, but what on the other hand, the levels themselves are designed using the same monotone, gray blocks and the only thing that differentiates them one from another is the layout of those gray blocks and the bouncing objects between them. The visual effects are basic and nothing stands out, mostly because no beam or ray of light can move your eyes away from the galaxies in the background.\nRating: 5\n\nAudio\nThe tunes are okay, but since there is no story or momentum to what is happening, this is probably one of those titles you'll play with your own music in the background. The sound effects feel absent most times, as they are either too quiet or not in total sync with the action, but then again you probably won't need those anyway.\nRating: 4.5\n\nExtras\nFor its 3€ price tag, Defy Gravity offers enough to justify the purchase, even if you can finish the game in less than two hours, adding 2-3 more hours to that time if you're down for the Hard mode, but if you are looking for anything extra, there is nothing more to the game than the adventure itself.\nRating: 7\n\nVerdict\nDefy Gravity is an okay platformer if you only care about the gameplay, as it does introduce a new concept even if it only lasts for a short time, but for anything else you might expect from this game, you will probably be disappointed.\nRating Overall: 5.8\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Defy Gravity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=366","September 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I know most of you already have this game, because it gets so damn cheap, considering the card prices, it even had effectively negative prices in the past.\n\nSo, this review is not to make you buy this overlooked gem. It is to make you play it.\n\nFirst, who is the targeted audience here? If you liked, Rochard or Outland or any other puzzle platformer, you will feel like at home here. I know most of the reviewers really like using shortcut of, "Yes, this is puzzle, and the most commonly loved puzzle game around is Portal, so I will just call this Portal in 2d AND space AND gravity guns rather than portal guns AND without an actual story AND heavily amateurish -or indie- AND with some minor bugs making controls a bit harder AND....\n\nAs you can see if you say this game is similar to some other with some exceptions, but if number of these exceptions are more than 5, actually your so called similarity does not convey any information at all. So, I will just skip calling this "2D PORTAL game" even though I agree that it sounds catchy. It is not similar to that game. And btw, if the idea of 2d Portal sounds enticing to you, here is the original Portal game that started it all: http://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-version\n\nThis game is a puzzle game. You use a gravity gun whose stationary bullets move you towards it, and another one whose bullets repel you. You also have a shield, causing you not to be affected by those effects. You can just use once for each type, until your feet touches the ground. You use these mechanics, together with momentum to overcome some obstacles, reach some high places which is not obvious how to reach. Levels get progressively harder, introduces some enemies, some hazards, and new tools like free to move platforms, vanishing platforms etc to increase the complexity a bit.\n\nI really liked playing through it. The most used "tactics" is same for many puzzles, put an attractor, jump to it, put a repeller behind, cancel attractor then you are flying ahead.  Of course there are some others, and even using when to use that changes from puzzle to puzzle, and in the later levels, choosing where to put starting attractor also becomes a part of the question. But still, if this game was longer, it would be prone to become a chore. In current case, it introduces the mechanics, uses them all, tests whether you are really able to use all, and says farewell before giving you a chance to get bored.\n\nI have one minor and one more minor negative. First, minor one. Even though I can feel the effort put for attracting and repelling mechanisms, they dont work in a predetermined way. Sometimes you perfectly know what to do, still a milimetrical wrong placement of the "bullet" destroys your strategy. Not being able to assign moves from before hand, together with general difficulty of placement of "bullet"s midfly, helps the feeling of glitchiness. I think there is no glitch here, only some calculations is not smoothed out. Really really really minor mistakes, even the ones that is not visible to the eye can cause to death.\n\nMore minor one: In the last level, checkpoint placement sucks. I had to read through all of the Credits 50 times before finishing it. For the first 5 times, I thought "Wow! Such a nice idea to implement credits here!" Nearing the end, my thought was like this: "These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are stealing my precious seconds again."\n\nIf you can oversee some minor problems with games like these, you will enjoy the effort and thought put here. There is also an extra "New Game+"like mode, supposedly taking the option of attractors out, but I did not try it, so I cant comment on it. From what I have played though, I know that you will enjoy "Aha!" moments, and succeeding "Finally nailed it" moments. Not expect a perfect platformer or a hardest puzzle ever though. It is mediocre at both of these.\n\nTLDR:\n=========================\nif indie_tolerance==0\n{ignore;\nend}\nif indie_tolerance>0 and puzzle_love>0 and platformer_love>0\n{\nif cheapskate>0\n{get;\nend\n}\nelse\n{\nmaybe;\nend\n}}","December 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","12","16","4","2"

You will use a gun that places gravity wells and anti-gravity wells. You will use them often to solve various puzzles throughout the game. Gravity well pulls you into its center, while anti-gravity wells repels you from its center.\n\nDefy Gravity Extended has a very unique game mechanic, it is quite different than most puzzle platformer games I've played. The soundtrack for this game is very nice and relaxing too. You can get 100% achievements just by finishing the game. I like that the game doesn't make you finish a level in a particular time so you won't be pressured while playing. The game has 24 levels and certainly doesn't lack in challenge. There is also a checkpoint system in the game, so if you die, you won't start from the beginning which is nice.\n\nHowever, for me, it is more frustrating than It is to enjoy while playing this game. The controls are a little bit difficult. I don't like the animation. The game looks very unappealing to me. The game lacks on the options menu. You can't adjust the game's volume at all, so you will need to change it from Windows or your speaker. It also lacks in resolution options too. The game at one point crashes, but it wasn't in a middle of a level. The story is pretty much non-existent.\n\nIn conclusion, Defy Gravity Extended is a unique and very challenging game. But it is very frustrating to play. I don't enjoy this game very much, maybe because this game isn't for me. The price seems a little fair though. But I do not recommend buying this full price since it goes on sale quite often. I do recommend purchasing this game on sale because it's usually on sale for 90% off or more.","September 4, 2015","false","3.3"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

Not all mechanics allow it and not all games offer more than one route from point A to point B. I believe gravity manipulation and physics-based gameplay is one of the greatest things gaming has bothered exploring. When done well, it is logical, intuitive and rewarding. It’s like pulling out that second to last piece of Jenga.\n\nThis is what Defy Gravity Extended is: an extremely satisfying game. You play as Kara, following the Samus school of power armour where you couldn’t tell the gender were it not for the game description. She has to prove herself as a Gravitymancer in the Gauntlet, using her sassy gravity gun (which looks a bit like a Super Soaker). The gun can set two kinds of fields: one that attracts and one that repels. This is the basic premise, and the levels are variations upon previously-set rules. You might encounter enemies who are also affected by the gravity fields, a level may turn your anti-gravity shield permanently on, or you’ll have to use platforms affected by your gravity gun as well.\n\nThe graphics are really basic, and I admit I was a tad skeptical when I saw some screenshots, but after 5 minutes into the game all my doubts were washed away. The levels are very well-made and reward smart thinking. The first few stages give you hints where to place the respective gravity fields, but you will soon realize that you can use even less resources than recommended.\n\nThe music is also really good. Now, I’m not a music reviewer and I lack the capacity to translate how music feels using words, but Defy Gravity’s soundtrack took me off-guard in a very pleasant way.\n\nThe only complaint I can think of is a lack of level editor, which seems extremely appropriate for a game like this.","December 2, 2013","true","1.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It mixes mechanics that are a bit similar to Portal's mechanics with Braid's platforming (or jumping, really). Of course the game has its own style and own mechanics, so don't expect a clone of the games I just mentioned. The graphics are extremely simple, but they get the job done. I absolutely love detailed, well animated 2D graphics, so I'm a little bit disappointed, but for this price, I guess I can't really complain. The gameplay is the most important factor here and I have absolutely no complaints about that. Controls work well, but take some time getting used to though. The game is also quite forgiving in parts where you die. It makes the game fun and removes the frustrating parts. But don't expect an easy game. It will still take some skill to finish it.

In fact, dying is a good 70-90% of what you will do.\nBasically you play as a gravity-mancer, which is a person who uses a gravity gun to create bubbles of gravity and antigravity. With these bubbles, you will redirect yourself, platforms, enemies, and platform-enemies to try to survive a series of increasingly difficult puzzles. This game requires as much skill in execution as problem-solving, and is more fun to play than most $15 platformers out there with better graphics. On top of all that, it's cheap. If you like puzzles, platforming and difficulty, you should definitely buy this game.","May 29, 2014","true","2.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Here you have a gun that can create a gravity or anti-gravity field, and you must use that to go through the levels. One thing i liked is that the gun isn't always necessary to progress, making the level design feel more balanced. There's 24 levels, and after that you unlock the hard mode, but either way the game isn't too hard, just challenging a few times. The graphics and music weren't impressive, but they got the job done. One think i didn't like was the lack of a level select screen: you can only start a new game or continue.

Fairly generic music loops, non-existent story, simplistic art style, and a pretty short length compared to most games on Steam (30-60 minutes for a basic playthrough, or 90-120 minutes if you're including all achievements/hard mode). The concept's not too bad, but the puzzle design is somewhat repetitive and the difficulty progression is very uneven (the final supposed-to-be-climactic puzzle is actually one of the easiest rooms in the game).\n\nOverall, there are plenty of worse ways to spend an hour or so. Defy Gravity is definitely worth the summer sale price of $0.29 - especially considering it comes with Steam Trading Cards which you can easily sell back for more than that. At full price, however, the cost is a bit steep for the paltry amount of content here. Grab it if it's on sale and you have a huge fetish for physics puzzles, or not at all.","June 26, 2014","false","1.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Thankfully, the mechanics are very easy to learn, though it will take more than a few tries for the trial and errors to take hold in experience.\n\nThere are 24 levels in total, you can expect to die countless times on laser traps, football-like projectiles, collapsible platforms, shuriken shooting bots, moving walls of doom and the classic never-ending pits of doom. It won’t be unfair to call this game brutal, but you’ll have unlimited continues in your disposal, along with a save point practically after every trap.\n\nThe length of this game will vary depending on how good you are at it, a speed runner can do this in 20 minutes, a good player may get away with 2 hours, it took me around 12 hours to complete it entirely along with the hard mode.\n\nIf you are someone who likes a real challenge, get this.

The player takes on the roll of a Gravitymancer who uses a tool (similar to the portal gun from "Portal" which can fire a matter which pushes away objects or pulls them in) to overcome obstacles to reach the goal. The game isn't very long, but can be challenging. Once you do finish the game you'll be presented with the opportunity to replay it on a higher difficulty.\nThe game is fairly cheap and worth buying. I'm sure your money will not be wasted.\nIt also includes trading cards and achievements.","December 21, 2014","true","5.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I forget exactly what's different about this edition, aside from being a fair bit longer. Still, this is a game that can completed twice in about two hours (if you're going for all of the achievements).\n\nEveryone buys this game for the cards right? After all, this is one of those games that can be had for so cheap, players will profit just by owning it. While it's tempting to turn on idlemaster and do something else, IMO this is a game that is actually worth playing. The concept is interesting, the mechanics/controls are solid, and there's a fair amount of challenge to keep things engaging. The pleasant low-key soundtrack rounds everything out nicely. Defy Gravity Extended a pretty short game, so it didn't give me many opportunities to find things to complain about. Actually, I suppose the hit-box is a little too big, but the checkpoints are generous enough so it's not really a huge issue.\n\nGive it a go sometime.","November 30, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I can, however, offer a few comments on what I've already seen. This is an intriguing puzzle game with a unique weapon that has two main functions. Choosing to either draw or push things around the well will influence your character enough to navigate the level. There is no maze function, though there are many twists and turns\n\nThe point and click functions well with the controls and there is a level of versatility offered as many keys have the same function. My only true complaint about the game is the camera view. You can shoot outside of your line of sight (which you are often encouraged to do in later levels) and yet you can't see where you're aiming. There are the suggestive little circles around it to promote the shot, so of course the developers intended for you to aim there. Unnecessary deaths aren't always fun.\n\nAnyhow, this game is definitely worth the money I paid (it was 90% off when I bought it.) That's just $0.29. Who wouldn't want it? Even at full price I'd definitely recommend this game.","December 13, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I originally got it because it was less than a dollar and it had steam cards, but the time I played it for steam cards, I really enjoyed it. It's a bit different from other puzzle games if you'd call it a puzzle game. There are times you have to act fast and if you don't, you will find yourself falling towards the ground and then you'll have to start back at the last checkpoint.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/96100/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","Nice little puzzle game going with the theme of physics based utility guns. In Defy Gravity this gun is a device that creates gravity and anti-gravity fields. Player can also issue a shield against these special fields, which renders him (her?) immune to the fields but not the "ordinary" gravity. Strangely enough, some objects (it turns out they're the yellow ones) are affected by the fields while none of the others are.\n\nThis makes for adequate puzzles: in any level you have to reach the end, while juggling between platforms and deadly blades. Dying is not a big issue: you'll respawn at a close-by platform and can continue right away. However, there are a couple of rather difficult spots, that might turn to be frustrating to get past.\n\nThen again the game is rather short. In mere 2.5 hours I completed both the base game and the hardmode that comes after, has more difficult levels and slightly different rules.\n\nIf you like punishing puzzle platformers like Super Meat Boy or Adventures of Shuggy, this game is a nice snack (it even costs almost nothing). Musics are nice, and while there's no actual story, you will probably find it fun to be one of the universe's magnificent "gravitomancers".\n\nRegretfully, I encountered a couple of bad bugs along the way. First, the game freezes if you try to start a new game without having Windows Media Player installed. So, you have two options: install that or disable music (by -nomusic command line option). Another one was even more annoying: apparently some video cards (ATI Radeons) have a bug that the screen black-outs every once in a while. Very annoying issue. It would have been game-breaking, but it turns out at least I could work around it by doing double jumps (jumping in the air... so yeah) or going to Steam Overlay, both that repaint the screen. It does seem that the developers are looking into the issue, so hopefully it'll be fixed sometime in the future. It turns out the game was entirely completable and enjoyable despite these bugs though.","December 20, 2013","true","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its a 2D Platformer / Puzzle, where everything revolves around Gravity, being able to\ncreate gravity fields and anti gravity fields to attract or repel the character (repel = rocket jumps! true story)\nIts highly addictive, and gets pretty hard towards the end, but is a very short game.\nEven with hard mode (with no antigravity available), completing it twice only took me 5 hours.\nThen again, with its current price tag, its definitely more bang for your buck!\nGive Defy Gravity a try.","June 24, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/96100/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","Nice little puzzle game going with the theme of physics based utility guns. In Defy Gravity this gun is a device that creates gravity and anti-gravity fields. Player can also issue a shield against these special fields, which renders him (her?) immune to the fields but not the "ordinary" gravity. Strangely enough, some objects (it turns out they're the yellow ones) are affected by the fields while none of the others are.\n\nThis makes for adequate puzzles: in any level you have to reach the end, while juggling between platforms and deadly blades. Dying is not a big issue: you'll respawn at a close-by platform and can continue right away. However, there are a couple of rather difficult spots, that might turn to be frustrating to get past.\n\nThen again the game is rather short. In mere 2.5 hours I completed both the base game and the hardmode that comes after, has more difficult levels and slightly different rules.\n\nIf you like punishing puzzle platformers like Super Meat Boy or Adventures of Shuggy, this game is a nice snack (it even costs almost nothing). Musics are nice, and while there's no actual story, you will probably find it fun to be one of the universe's magnificent "gravitomancers".\n\nRegretfully, I encountered a couple of bad bugs along the way. First, the game freezes if you try to start a new game without having Windows Media Player installed. So, you have two options: install that or disable music (by -nomusic command line option). Another one was even more annoying: apparently some video cards (ATI Radeons) have a bug that the screen black-outs every once in a while. Very annoying issue. It would have been game-breaking, but it turns out at least I could work around it by doing double jumps (jumping in the air... so yeah) or going to Steam Overlay, both that repaint the screen. It does seem that the developers are looking into the issue, so hopefully it'll be fixed sometime in the future. It turns out the game was entirely completable and enjoyable despite these bugs though.","December 20, 2013","true","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kainlane/recommended/96100/","kainlane","[cwz] kainlane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kainlane/","905 products in account","Defy Gravity is a platformer. You might say puzzle platformer, but I’d just call it a challenging platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy or Blood of the Werewolf, though Defy Gravity isn’t quite that infuriatingly difficult as those two. The gameplay was challenging enough to be rewarding but easy enough to be fun, I thought it was a good mix. The checkpoints were much better as well, being more frequent. If you die, you basically just start right before the last little challenge. Levels are fairly short. I think with SMB you have to start at the beginning of the level and BotW there are checkpoints but they can be pretty long at times. This game doesn’t really have any enemies either, besides some orbs, spiky orbs, and some sort of ships that shoot missiles or whatever. I don’t really remember about SMB, but BotW had more traditional enemies and super bosses. This didn’t have any of that. Mostly you are avoiding friggin laser beams on the floor or wall or ceiling. Sometimes you had to ride a platform through the level.\nThe way it all works is that you have a duel gravity gun. You can shoot attractive gravity and reflective gravity. Attractive obviously pulls you toward it, so you can jump, shoot that and get sucked to it and then dispel it as you approach it to give you a little jump bust. Reflective will bounce you away, like a rocket jump. You have a double jump in the air. Pretty simple. You hold the LMB or RMB until you want it to stop, aim with the mouse. Movement with A/D. I don’t think a controller would help the controls, but they didn’t work bad. I think Q dispelled the attractive gravity, though it didn’t seem I could dispel reflective. Shift put up a gravity shield so they didn’t affect you. Sometimes a level would shoot it’s own gravity wells. The more challenging levels were when you had to ride the platform, which was propelled by your gravity gun, and also avoid everything else. Problem was that the platform would continue through walls if you weren’t careful, whereas you would not. Challenging.\nPresentation was pretty mediocre/cheap. It didn’t look BAD, but it was far from a pretty game too.\nI would recommend the game for people that like this type of game, especially for the price. It’s normally only 2$, which isn’t bad at all and it frequently goes on sale for like 90% off. I don’t mind it, but it’s not my favorite by far. So I played until I had the first three achievements (38%) for progress and then quit. I think it was about a half hour. There was no indication of what level I was on or how many there are total. Which is annoying as you don’t know how long the game is going to be. Though I suppose most games are that way, huh?\n","February 29","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Sounds really basic, but the level design is really good, some levels require thinking and puzzle-solving skill, while other ones are more like  based on timing- and aiming.\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game, if you don't mind the simple graphics, it's a really well-executed puzzler-platformer game with medium-high difficulty.","January 30, 2015","true","2.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

I enjoyed every single minute of it. Made after a pretty basic mechanic, the game offers a decent amount of gameplay time and it also feature trading cards, which will make you back the money you spend on the game. I never thought I'll find it interesting, but as you progress, the levels become more bigger, more interesting and even the puzzles are starting to be a little bit harder.\n\nWhy would I recommend this game? Because the developer knows how to deal with the market and understands that using basic mechanics in a good way can turn his platformer in a appreciated game that will make people try it out just because it's a catchy game (not only because of the price)!\n\nI wish I could say something bad about it, but at this price, I don't know what do you expect.

But this  keeps the game interesting because you never no when it will make you fall asleep or when you won't be able to( you'll be up all night trying to beat the level), 8/10. Overall i'll give the game 9/10, but i got the game for $.29 and with trading cards i made over $.30 so worth it all the way.","June 23, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only played about 30mins and got 11 levels done, until they told that the hard part was comming, and i begin to get rly excited, and scared from the future frustration that i'll need to fight. And it rly got harder.\n\nSo the point of the game is go to Point A to Point B using platforms, using your gravity gun to create "platforms"(one to atract and the other to push away) or even bring the golden balls/platforms to whethever you want them to be, so as you can see, you may complete these levels in different ways, even going at the top of a map. You'll need to dogde balls , but you may jump on them ,making them usefull in levels, or even making them necesary, but you'll need to dodge the shuriken, and be carefull of the gold ones :). Another thing that i love of this game is its difficulty spike that it has after level 11-12, as i already told you.\nAnd the soundtrack, some of them are EPIC and other meh(dubstep) but ofc that's my opinion. What would i have liked to seen is some story, background , but still this is good, giving it a 8/10, recommend to all platformers guys or just normal guys who for 0,19€/2€ may wanna spend an hour or so.(And i would like to see this game have a community that make levels, would totally be cool having  User-Created levels in this game.)","July 15, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't try to draw you into an un-funny joke. Instead this gives you puzzles to be solved with platforming and using your gravity gun and quick reflexes.

Then the music is really nice, although it does tend to loop it will keep you calm and stop you from punching your screen, 8/10. Which brings me the next part of dffuculty; it is varied and scattered with no apprent ryhme or reason. But this  keeps the game interesting because you never no when it will make you fall asleep or when you won't be able to( you'll be up all night trying to beat the level), 8/10. Overall i'll give the game 9/10, but i got the game for $.29 and with trading cards i made over $.30 so worth it all the way.","June 23, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has the right feel for an old-school platformer, but it is a puzzle game rather than a shooting game.\n\nIt's designed like a classic 2-D sidescrolling platformer, but the trick is that you have a gun that creates two types of gravity fields.  One pulls you, and one repels you (along with some obstacles).  This makes it feel in some ways like a 2D version of Portal at times, although the feel is very different.\n\nI am breezing through the game so far, but I have played a lot of puzzlers and platformers over the years and don't usually find them challenging anymore.  I think an average player would find this game very challenging, and it certainly is inventive.\n\nSo far, everything about the game is good from what I can tell, with one exception.  The aiming mechanic on a gamepad is a little hard to fine tune, and it's especially hard to aim when in motion on a gamepad.  This is bad as some of the puzzles are best solved with mid-air field placement.  Meanwhile, the usual gripes I have with this kind of game (bad hit detection, erratic controls, poor optimization, graphics glitches, etc) aren't an issue here.  The game feels pretty solid with the single exception of the aiming system.\n\nPretty good game.","June 29, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gravity mechanics work well and the level design does plenty with them. I'd contest a few of the design choices (especially the second-to-last level which somehow manages to get EASIER or hard mode =.=; ) but overall it's a fair challenge without ever being overly frustrating. It's not really much about the puzzles as much as manuevering around and you're given a variety of ways to deal with scenarios instead of being stuck trying to figure out the one thing to do, which is what makes it pretty fun to play. The hard mode also rather well changes how the game is played and I didn't mind playing through all the levels again for it. Probably a fair purchase at full price and a really good deal on sale.","June 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do have a few complatins about the game which are: The hitbox of the character, I've been killed countless times by enimies/lasers not even touching me at one point a moving enemy went past me, just above my head I stood still to figure out what I was planning next then all of a sudden... dead, by the same moving enemy. Another issue I have is that a few moving lasers don't kill you? The only reason I figured that out is because i mucked up on a level and jumped towards the laser to retry but no the laser just passed through me and I was unharmed, I don't know if it was supposed to be fake to hurry you along but it never really tells you anything past the tutorial level.

It really remind me of few really old, mostly pre 2000, simple games. I remembered all of good times I spent playing those simple, shareware or freeware, games - without fancy graphics, with short but enjoyable music, focusing only on gameplay not some story. And it was really fun. When it's on sale, it's really cheap - you will be able to get most of your money back from selling cards.

You have a jetpack and a gun which manipulates gravity, and with this equipment you have to get to the other side of the room, avoiding obstacles using your gun, the jetpack or the enviorenment. It's not long but it can take a few hours to beat (4-5 for average players). The best thing about the game is the soundtrack, it will accompany you and turn something that could be very boring and frustrating into something interesting. I think it fits with the game, and personally I find the soundtrack very peaceful. For an indie developer with that people (during the credits i counted 6 or 7), the final result is impressive.

The soundtrack is decent, but the minimalistic visuals are very lacking, and there is no biome diversity, nor any kind of visual diversity for that matter. In terms of story, there is not much to say: there is none. The only type of background information you can gather is the one found on the "About the Game" section of the game's store page, which is disappointing, as the game would have stongly benefited from a solid narrative. 2.5/10 However, as a money making method, Defy Gravity excels itself, as the money made from selling its trading cards are is far superior to the game's cost.

Players will be navigating the astronaut through short levels of increasing difficulty, avoiding deadly laser beams and robotic enemies to reach the end goal.\n\nThis title has no loading times between levels or deaths which results in seemless addictive gameplay.\nYou may die instantly upon impact with a laser or enemy; but there are infinite lives and a clever checkpoint system has been implemented which means you will never be taken too far back, if you happen to fail any part of a level.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by something so simple but different from the 2D puzzle/platformer genre.\nThe game features Steam Trading Cards, Achievements & Xbox controller support as a bonus.\n\nI purchased this game on sale for a matter of pennies, however after playing it I probably would've paid full price.\n\n8/10\nNon-stop physics based fun in 2D space but I wish there was a bit more variation in design.\n\nEDIT 6/Nov/15: The game appears to only support Xbox 360 controllers as it wouldn't recognise my unbranded PS2 style USB controller, which is a shame as it works in most of my other games.","November 3, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its really just as simple as that.\n\nIts definitely challenging though as your astronaut isnt the easiest to control. I tried using both Keyboard and mouse & the Xbox gamepad with this one and found that either way, if your control isnt perfect then your gonna have a bad time. Thats not to say the challenge is unfair though. You dont feel cheated for failing here which marks the sign of a game developer that knows what they are doing.\n\nThe music whilst sounding pretty basic actually helps the ambience of the game aswell. Its nothing to get excited about. it just seems to fit quite well with the kind of game this is.\n\nMaybe abit to boring for me but I can definitely see the good sides to this game, and it has alot more going for it then it does against it.\n\nAt the end of the day, When all is said and done.

The trailer looks like pretty much like how I felt while playing the game. If it looks good to you, you'll probably like it.\n\nThe challenge from the game comes in equal parts execution and figuring out what to do. Sometimes you'll know what to do but can't quite do it, sometimes it will take a little while to figure out quite what to do, and sometimes both. I like that because it means you can't really sleep-play on subsequent playthroughs. The best thing I can say about the gameplay is that it does not put you in a situation where it feels unfair, it never throws something at you that you don't know how to deal with. I never felt like any death was unfair. It was usually me panicking and forgetting which mouse button shot what gravity well, or I just plain failed.\n\nWhat I personally think is better than the gameplay is the music. I like to think of my purchase as a soundtrack purchase and the game is a bonus. Like the game, the soundtrack is short, 20 something minutes, but fantastic. Once again, look to the trailer to see if you'll like it. The rest of the music is similar. This is one of those soundtracks I listen to while doing other stuff, and it evokes mental images of space ships, colorful galaxies, and futuristic technology. If you like the music as much as I do, it makes the price well worth it even if you don't like the game that much.\n\nThe mp3 files can easily be found in your C: drive > Program Files (x86) > Steam > Steamapps > common > Defy Gravity > Content > Sounds > Songs. Some of the tracks are in a folder called techno, for some reason, but everything including the trailer music is here and ready to play in your media player of choice.","February 2","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gravity orbs don't always work as intended and at some places there is a lot of trial & error, but I had fun with this game. However, I stopped my playthrough after 45 minutes (roughly 60%) because the game started annoying me. At this point the game tells you that it becomes harder, and yes - it is, in a specific way. It's not really the level design which becomes more difficult to beat, it's your sanity. There are less checkpoints and they are horribly placed.\nThe passages are not difficult to figure out, the game just reduces itself to trial & error. After each respawn you have to wait up to 10 seconds for the enemies or platforms to move so you can continue. Usually I die and then I think "Whatever, I'll just try again". I reached the point where I just Alt + F4 out of the game after the 10th death because the game makes me wait longer than I actually have fun with it. It just feels like a punishment for bad playing which is inappropriate for a game like this. Or it's just really bad level design.\n\nAt least I had 30 minutes of fun. I bought it for 9 cents and I sold each of the 3 trading cards for 8 cents.

You use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity wells in order to make your way through the levels.\nGravity is hard to manipulate and it can get frustrating to try so many times before succeeding, relying a bit too much on luck with the timings and the hard-to-predict behaviour of the wells.\n\nThe controls are easy enough (although I had some trouble with the jumping, as it would only jump after I ran off the edge) and, again, the soundtrack is quite good.\nThe graphics, however, aren't the best around, even though I believe the look somewhat agrees with the game. Nevertheless, the game is visually consistent and the space setting is always pleasing.\n\nWith all that said, I found the game to be nice, but also frustrating and somewhat boring after a while. The good thing, though, is that it is short.\n\nAll in all, it is a fun, short-lived experience, if you can keep your cool after dying so many times on the same spot because your gravity well didn't pull you well enough.

The music is very good, quite a bit of variety and I have been playing to both listen to the music and enjoy the challening puzzles.\n\nThe controls are simple, however, you may need to practice getting used to manipulating the fields created by your gun - you can create gravity and repulsion fields. The learning curve is moderate, as the puzzles get pretty difficult once you reach the second half of the game - you will need to be good at timing to pass many of the stages.\n\nYou can create one active field of each type with your gun, and you can fire twice - you will refill ammo whenever you touch the ground/jump on an enemy. The fields are destroyed when you place a new one, or you can manually destroy them. There is a shield you can turn on to ignore the effects of any fields. You can also double jump.\n\nAny golden objects can be affected by your fields, and many of the puzzles utilize this mechanic in a variety of ways. Your main hazard are purple lazers that will kill you on contact - your body explodes into several pieces (no blood), and this can be quite hilarious if you are dying within 3 seconds repeatedly and you consider the type of music playing (making it seem like less of a big deal).\n\nI've been getting into a lot of puzzle platformers, and the ones where timing is critical to completing stages are my favorite. In DG, timing is essential in the later levels. There are also several ways to complete the stages, and, if you experiment and become proficient with manipulating your fields, you can even bypass a few levels without having to use the objects the game places to help you.\n\nA very, very good platforming game, get it if you are even the least bit interested in this genre.\n\nDefinitely recommend!","July 15, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music is very good, quite a bit of variety and I have been playing to both listen to the music and enjoy the challening puzzles.\n\nThe controls are simple, however, you may need to practice getting used to manipulating the fields created by your gun - you can create gravity and repulsion fields. The learning curve is moderate, as the puzzles get pretty difficult once you reach the second half of the game - you will need to be good at timing to pass many of the stages.\n\nYou can create one active field of each type with your gun, and you can fire twice - you will refill ammo whenever you touch the ground/jump on an enemy. The fields are destroyed when you place a new one, or you can manually destroy them. There is a shield you can turn on to ignore the effects of any fields. You can also double jump.\n\nAny golden objects can be affected by your fields, and many of the puzzles utilize this mechanic in a variety of ways. Your main hazard are purple lazers that will kill you on contact - your body explodes into several pieces (no blood), and this can be quite hilarious if you are dying within 3 seconds repeatedly and you consider the type of music playing (making it seem like less of a big deal).\n\nI've been getting into a lot of puzzle platformers, and the ones where timing is critical to completing stages are my favorite. In DG, timing is essential in the later levels. There are also several ways to complete the stages, and, if you experiment and become proficient with manipulating your fields, you can even bypass a few levels without having to use the objects the game places to help you.\n\nA very, very good platforming game, get it if you are even the least bit interested in this genre.\n\nDefinitely recommend!","July 15, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity wells in order to make your way through the levels.\nGravity is hard to manipulate and it can get frustrating to try so many times before succeeding, relying a bit too much on luck with the timings and the hard-to-predict behaviour of the wells.\n\nThe controls are easy enough (although I had some trouble with the jumping, as it would only jump after I ran off the edge) and, again, the soundtrack is quite good.\nThe graphics, however, aren't the best around, even though I believe the look somewhat agrees with the game. Nevertheless, the game is visually consistent and the space setting is always pleasing.\n\nWith all that said, I found the game to be nice, but also frustrating and somewhat boring after a while. The good thing, though, is that it is short.\n\nAll in all, it is a fun, short-lived experience, if you can keep your cool after dying so many times on the same spot because your gravity well didn't pull you well enough. I recommend you give it a try, especially since you can get it very cheap on sale.","March 7","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The initial levels took me about 30 minutes to go through but hard mode try an hour and a half.\n\nSo here's my feelings on the game in 3 catagories...\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is fun and easy to grasp, each level offers a new challange. The early levels are easy but as I got to the last 5 it took a few deaths to formulate a strategy. The gravity gun is a very interesting mechanic, left click fires a blue ball that sucks things in and the right click was an orange ball that pushed things away. I like the idea and would love to see the same concept done in a 3d environment. Overall, the mechanics were smooth and no glitches occured.\n\nGraphics:\nNot really an important part of this game as I'd have been just as happy with 8bit. The graphics are smooth and made for 1080p screens. The animations are basic with very few frames but this isnt really a con to the game. Really I think the artwork done for this game fit the theme and looked rather good for what it is.\n\nSound:\nThe music for this game is rather nice, one moment its calm and relaxing and then in some levels the music speeds up a bit for escape levels. One nice thing I'd like to note is that the sound enemies make when they bounce off of walls is there but not distracting. That I believe is very important and I'm very happy that they were careful about the volume of that ting noise they make.\n\nOverall I can definately recomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers alike. 10/10","February 28","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I picked it up for about $0.20 on a sale, and overall, it's a good game.  The game revolves around the use of a gun that shoots gravity wells, the blue gravity well, which attracts things, and the orange anti-gravity well, which repels things. This is a quite fun concept, and is used quite well. Now, if a gun that shoots one of each orange and blue glowy vaguely round objects to progress through a series of puzzles in some sort of challenge course sounds familiar to you at all, that's probably because it sounds a lot like Portal. However, it is actually quite different from Portal. No puzzle has one specific solution, and feels more of a skill-based platformer than a puzzle game. The puzzles are fairly loosely designed, so you can solve them in your own particular style. The game also looks nice, and the music is quite amazing. And after you beat the game, it starts Hardmode, which is implemented in a quite interesting way. Instead of just giving you trickier puzzles or a limited number of wells, it gives you the same puzzles, slightly modified, all enemies are affected by gravity, and you can only use regular gravity wells. This really caught me off guard, because for most of the game, I was using tha Anti-Wells in a sort of rocket jump way to clear the levels. I had to change up my playstyle, and it was kind of cool. However, my biggest problem with Defy Gravity is the bugs. These weren't just small things, they happened every single time I played. When I start the game, I always need to close out of it in task manager and start it again before the graphics will work, and on some levels you need to shoot a gravity well off before the graphics will start, which can get very irritating, especially if there's an enemy nearby. But despite these problems, I enjoyed it. It's creative and fun. If you can pick it up for a few bucks, I say get it. And thank me for not using a Wicked joke throughout this whole review.","June 12, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I picked it up for about $0.20 on a sale, and overall, it's a good game.  The game revolves around the use of a gun that shoots gravity wells, the blue gravity well, which attracts things, and the orange anti-gravity well, which repels things. This is a quite fun concept, and is used quite well. Now, if a gun that shoots one of each orange and blue glowy vaguely round objects to progress through a series of puzzles in some sort of challenge course sounds familiar to you at all, that's probably because it sounds a lot like Portal. However, it is actually quite different from Portal. No puzzle has one specific solution, and feels more of a skill-based platformer than a puzzle game. The puzzles are fairly loosely designed, so you can solve them in your own particular style. The game also looks nice, and the music is quite amazing. And after you beat the game, it starts Hardmode, which is implemented in a quite interesting way. Instead of just giving you trickier puzzles or a limited number of wells, it gives you the same puzzles, slightly modified, all enemies are affected by gravity, and you can only use regular gravity wells. This really caught me off guard, because for most of the game, I was using tha Anti-Wells in a sort of rocket jump way to clear the levels. I had to change up my playstyle, and it was kind of cool. However, my biggest problem with Defy Gravity is the bugs. These weren't just small things, they happened every single time I played. When I start the game, I always need to close out of it in task manager and start it again before the graphics will work, and on some levels you need to shoot a gravity well off before the graphics will start, which can get very irritating, especially if there's an enemy nearby. But despite these problems, I enjoyed it. It's creative and fun. If you can pick it up for a few bucks, I say get it. And thank me for not using a Wicked joke throughout this whole review.","June 12, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This platformer utilizes gravity as the main mechanic. The player can create gravity and anti-gravity pockets to proceed through the levels. I would say that it has a similar difficulty curve as found within Portal, but it lacks story elements. Being a platfomer, however, it doesn’t require story elements, just quality controls. Graphically, it’s lacking, but having solid controls is what makes this game fantastic. This game also has a “Hard Mode”, which requires you to only use gravity pockets, and the enemies are affected by the gravity. This “Hard Mode” extends the gameplay you will find within Defy Gravity, but it doesn’t come off as too forceful. The only real reason to play through “Hard Mode” is to get all of the achievements. I will recommend this game to anyone looking for a new affordable experience.","May 19","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snorkel_dog/recommended/96100/","snorkel_dog","Snorkel Dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snorkel_dog/","115 products in account","As someone who's played a fair share of platformers and puzzlers and has pretty defined opinions about design and what "difficulty" entails, this game started out as decently fun and interesting. I enjoyed the music, and the title screen background art got my expectations comfortably high. But quickly, it feels like the game runs out of ideas for level design using the gravity gimmick. It starts to feel like a mediocre free Flash browser game - long segments of jumping on a slow stream of orb enemies, repeated "use gravity to drag this platform around" bits, and a lot of areas where the solution to the puzzle is to simply use the same bruteforce technique a few times, because the inconsistent physics will net you a win. Some of the puzzles that brag difficulty turn out to be boring - you have to place a grav/anti well at a very precise point that you won't realize is wrong until a full 10 seconds pass, so you try just a little bit to the right, etc. A browser Flash puzzle platformer game is the best comparison really, because of the inconsistent physics and drawn out level design characteristic of them. And the "ultimate challenge," which is the game's sort of newgame+ hardmode, serves to limit your options to make levels feel even less creative to pass by removing anti-grav wells, and makes all enemies physics-based, allowing the often shoddy engine to make your play even less consistent than your first run. Ultimately, I gave up on that because I was bored, not challenged. Games like La-Mulana will leave you feeling challenged by the puzzles and platforming. Or, perhaps this game will as well. A lot of people seem to like the game, but I would have been bored of it if it were freeware. A lot of positivity about this game seems to repeatedly refer to the price point. A game at a comparably low price point which I will recommend in Defy Gravity's stead is Super Hexagon, a challenging game that tests skill rather than the sheer snoring patience required of Defy Gravity. Or maybe I'm wrong and don't know ♥♥♥♥ about video games.","July 6, 2014","false","1.9"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

The idea itself is not bad: armed with a gravity gun, you have to make your way through all kind of (jumping) puzzles. Not enterily original, but still.\nBut. Almost everything else about this game is awful. Sorry for the harsh words, but I find no others means to describe my feelings during playing. Controls are very, very poor, which is disastrous for this kind of game. I played it on an Xbox360 controller, which should be fine, but alas, no.\nGraphics are even worse - even in the 1980's, games looked way better. Sound is almost non-existent.\nThe only reason I can see to buy this game, is for the trading cards and the xp when you craft the badge. The game is, understandably, very, very cheap, so you can even make a few eurocents if you sell the cards. Oh, there are Steam achievements too, but I gave up after under an hour out of sheer frustration.\n\nNo detailed rating, but surely only 3/10 or so - and that's just for the cards. Otherwise, it would be even less.","July 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","3"

Little did I expect to stumble upon this gem. After spending only $0.14, I would have been okay if this game was literally nothing more than a pleasing menu. However, that was not the case. After playing for only about 20 minutes, I realized this is probably one of the most fun games I have played in a while. True, it is no Triple A title, but that does not mean it isn't compelling, innovative, and most importantly, just plain fun. I would highly reccommend getting it, and actually regret buying it so cheap; I would have been more than happy to support those behind such a absolute joy of a game. To not get it at full price is foolish. To not get it now is simply absurd.","June 17, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Little did I expect to stumble upon this gem. After spending only $0.14, I would have been okay if this game was literally nothing more than a pleasing menu. However, that was not the case. After playing for only about 20 minutes, I realized this is probably one of the most fun games I have played in a while. True, it is no Triple A title, but that does not mean it isn't compelling, innovative, and most importantly, just plain fun. I would highly reccommend getting it, and actually regret buying it so cheap; I would have been more than happy to support those behind such a absolute joy of a game.

Well, its actually a really fun and challenging puzzle game that surprises you with what it will throw at you next. I almost forgot to mention the amazing soundtrack to this game, it is the perfect music for when you beat a level or in progress of completeing one. Unfortunantly, The only thing that bugs me are the horrible graphics but you get used to them over time...\n\nSince this game has trading cards that most sell for 0.09 cents each, and if you buy this game under 0.25 cents, you will literally make a profit from this game. It's like they are paying you to play their game!\n\nPros:\n-Challenging\n-Fun\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Hard mode for replayability\n\nCons:\n-Graphics","April 8, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Comparing it to a 2D Portal would be a vague comparison, but they are pretty similar.\n\nIn this game you have a gun which shoots a blue ray, a pulling force, and a orange ray, a repelling force. Using these forces you have to figure out puzzles and ways to get around obstacles (similar to Portal) and interact with the enemies around you. The style of the game reminds me of the retro side of games, but it kind of adds some sort of character to the game.\n\nOh and also, it gets pretty hard I wanted to die\n\nAll in all, I really think you should get this game. Not just because it is extremely cheap, but that it has so much to over and it really enjoyable. I am not near finishing it, but I definitively have my moneys worth (it did cost 9p for Christ's sake).","April 1, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
