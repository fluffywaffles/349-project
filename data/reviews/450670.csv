It is a $10 or less game.\nIt is a solid table top non serious acarde racer, but just not that fun or challenging. In under three hours I am almost half way through the game.\n\nThe maps are not even very imaginative. There is no real feel to the different driving serfaces or maps.\nThe game modes are pretty much all the same or things we have seen in every other game like this before.\n\nI have seen this table top theme done so much better over the years. This one is just pretty but without substance even for a game that is arcade style it lacks being fun.\n\n\nOH And Release day paid for DLC needs to be banned.\nThis is getting to be the norm for many companys and in this case they have removed access to several car's in game to charge players who have already purchased the game if they want to access the full game.\n\nEDIT:\nI have just received a message in the comments section of my review. I will not post it in the review so all can see clearly.

Its not a marketing tactic, it was structured like this so we can add more content and to it later and as an indie dev with limited resources, we couldn't re-write and re-bundle for PC in the time frame we had. Your assessment of our launch strategy is wrong and so I thought I'd flag this review as it is assumptive and misinformed.","May 27","false","3.4"," 56 of 84 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","56","84","2","10"

Big plus.\n+ Time consuming - a lot of races in the story mode + a lot of special challenge missions + multiplayer, i wasted like 7 hours to complete 1st 3 campaigns.\n+- 1st *problem* i faced playing this game - the difficulty is just low - story mod is very easy to complete, every single competition was completed  within 1 to 5 minutes at best with 3 stars - so this is good for casual gaming, and not so good for those who loves challenge.\n-Only 5 maps for a ton of races, you know after like 10-20 races you understand that your a are rolling over the same places over and over again :| Dlc contains 1 more map well then\n-Not so much cars - you have 4 cars for each class 3*4 - 12 in total, and most likely if you will play as i do - youll just pick the best car in its class - so you will most likely use only 3, because you have to pay coins for unlocks and upgrades. Dlc contains 4 more cars with another car class.\n-Weird collision physics - When you collide with cars and obstacles, your car acts very weird :|\n-The last problem for me - call it personal - this game is about toy cars racing normal world BUT it does not feel like you are driving toy car. It's more of a driving REAL car in the world where everything suddenly became enormous big. Maybe its engine sounds, maybe its turning feedback i cant say for sure, but this feeling still exists.\n\n\nShort conclusion - as a racing game this game is nice for casual gaming, not a big challenge, also kind of fun to derp with your friends, cant say there is much of content but they are making dlcs with cars and tracks so i think after some time this game will become big enough to become something like Revolt.","June 2","true","9.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JetUppercut/recommended/450670/","JetUppercut","Jet Uppercut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JetUppercut/","202 products in account","Table Top Racing is a very aptly named game, because you race around on various sorts of tabletop surfaces. I'm not sure about the World Tour part, though I did see an American Flag in one level and a Union Jack in another, which I guess are flags corresponding to different parts of the world. Four out of five words is pretty good for a title.\n\nNow I couldn't really make my mind up on whether I liked this game or not. I spent an extra five or so hours more than I feel this game deserved trying to decide. The graphics seem to lend to an illusion of this game being much better than it really is, at least for me as someone who enjoys racing games quite a bit. The flaws to the game and total lack of documentation on certain game features lend to my depreciating opinion on the game.\n\nI know a lot of people will compare this to similar games on Steam like Toybox Turbos or Super Toy Cars and I'd definitely put this on a similar quality level. The graphics are much better but the gameplay lets it down a fair bit.\n\nThe handling model is incredibly simple and doesn't interact at all with the physics. If your car is acting under physics, whether you hit an object, got rammed or just landed after a jump, you have no control over your car until that stops. You have very mild 'air control' which is the same level of control you have while on the ground. This means the most powerful weapon in the game is ramming someone from the inside on a corner and makes the handling feel very inconsistent. Not to mention, the physics system itself isn't perfect by any means after landing from certain jumps or even little bumps in the track I've had my car rocket in total random directions. The very simple handling model and poor physics implementation means the meat of the game, the actual driving, is very hit and miss. I could forgive it if the game didn't force jumps on every track but every long race I was just constantly in fear of the next jump destroying my chances of coming 1st.\n\nThe AI doesn't offer much challenge either, none of them take any shortcuts, they all follow one racing line and drive at set speeds and only ever fire their weapons at you. This means the best events become the Time Trials, Hot Laps and Drift Events since all of the Combat Race style Events are braindead easy provided the physics don't screw you over.\nThis in itself wouldn't be a bad thing either, but there's no Single Race mode, you can't pick any of the tracks you've raced on, pick a mode and some settings and have some fun. You have to race on their preset events, whether they're in the Championships or Special Events. There might be a track you really want to drift on with your favorite car, but unfortunately you're not able to.\nThey're working on local multi-player, so perhaps this could come in a future update, but as of writing this review, this feature's not in the game.\n\nThere's also a lot of undocumented features. Lots of weapons in the game counter a weapon and are countered by another. Like bombs attracting Heatseeking Missiles or the Electricity blowing up the Bombs. Some of the pink glowing things on the side of the track are Shortcuts which can be opened by hitting them with a Level 2 powerup, the things that aren't shortcuts usually toss some debris on the track. There's a boost start you can use at the start of the race somehow which was recently added in an update. There's also a lot of little things on the tracks you wouldn't be able to find out without making a serious effort to. Like the orange GO! Sushi signs on the Sushi shop track actually being little doors you can drive through. Or the Circular Saw on the Workbench track actually hiding a shortcut you can take. I understand some of these things are meant to be 'secrets' but if you have some shortcuts highlighted and others not it doesn't really make sense. It's just confusingly inconsistent for no real reason. The level 2 weapons are also locked at the beginning of the game for some reason so you don't even really know they exist, which means things like shortcuts are unavailable to you as well.\n\nNow the Drift Mode for the game, even though I've been decidedly negative about it this whole review, I found to be quite enjoyable. The DLC also adds an AE86 that's 'Legendary' for drifting, so I spent a good amount of time sliding around in the few available drift events I could use that car in. I'd personally say it's the best part of the game even if it's limited. There's also another great undocumented 'feature' in that a lower handling rating makes a car drift better. Especially useful on cars with lower drift ratings and high handling ratings like the Supercars.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game just because I hate the way the physics are handled. For a casual racing game player, once you start racing on the more difficult tracks I could see the difficulty spiking way up, especially with all the hidden things that aren't really common sense. For someone more experienced, the game won't challenge anything except your patience with the poor physics. A little more effort and it could have been a brilliant game.","June 2","false","8.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I have played all of these titles and adored them, same story with table top racing. The game has superb graphics and quick loading times between races, and runs smooth as silk on my three-year-old slow laptop. While reviewing this game a new update came out so I asked Playrise Digital on their website question form the new features and the team responded hours later.\n\nThere are 6 championships or 'Cups' to complete and several special races which may require certain wheel types  and cars to participate. The vehicles are divided into three tiers/categories; Amateur (Cult Classics), Pro (Street Racers), Expert (Super Cars) which have four different vehicles to choose from in each category. From the base game there is five different style of race tracks (tables) but four variations of the course. Each car can be upgraded in top speed, acceleration, handling, armour as well as choose from four styles of paint and seven different styles of wheels. Each wheel is unique and gives a different attribute to the car; Standard, Drift (For Drifting), Bling (For Bonus Coins/Money), Sheild (Force field around the car), Centurion (Spike Wheels), Boing (Allow your car to jump/bounce and reach coins on some tables) and Peace Bomb (Disarm weapons). One thing to note is when you buy the wheels which are fairly expensive, you can use them on everyone car without having to rebuy. Opponents do not have weapons wheels until the Expert difficulty cups, however opponents may have weapon wheels in special events.\n\nThere are seven different types of events; elimination (last car standing), time trial (quickest time over a set amount of laps), hot lap (quickest lap), Combat race (Race with power ups), pure race (Race without power ups), drift (race with drift wheels for drifting) and pursuit (catch up to a slower car and tag). In combat race there are several power ups; Acid, Rocket, Tracking Rocket, electric pulse, boost, bomb and ice beam, which once you pick up two power ups you get a special upgraded power up upon reaching Pro difficulty. The cars in the game generally handle with ease, however the cult classics are a challenge to turn. The opponents are extremely easy to beat in the first two difficulties but the game gets more challenging later in the game, especially the pursuits. The game also has online only multiplayer which I find impossible to find a server in Australia, the game allows the creation of one though. While typing this line I found one server and played, there was a slight jagged feel when controlling my car although this may be an internet issue for the other player. However, at this current update there is no local co-op multiplayer aka split-screen, which is a real disappointment.\n\nIf you decide to purchase the 'Supercharger' DLC you get three additional championships one each vehicle tier, four additional cars, one extra track 'Can Ya Dig It?' and 16 extra special events. Included is a great drift car which will be useful if you struggle with the drift events like myself. Please do note if you want to play with some people online you need this dlc. The game features upbeat, electronic dance music which adds a nice feel to the game with a nice variety of 17 tracks by WES SMITH which you can listen to on soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/itswessmithyo .\n\nConclusion:\nTable Top Racing: World Tour World Tour by Playrise Digital is a great indie title to play with friends or alone with a nice selection of vehicles, customizations and maps. The game does lack variety of tables, however I do not mind this as the game is highly addictive, and will provide at least 10 hours of fun. It is now your turn to decide whether a $20 USD price tag is a good price for the game.\n\n*Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*","June 5","true","14.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

This review is coming from someone who is not a fan of the racing genre and I tend to avoid racing games. This game however is an exception to that as it is extremely fun and very entertaining. It’ll remind you of Mario Kart, F1 race stars, those old Hotwheels games etc. The game is very polished and I was surprised how good the production quality is for an Indie game.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are very good, you can change settings to low, medium, high and ultra, depending on your system specs you can adjust accordingly. As it’s a table top racing game, the maps are filled with all sorts of stuff such as huge pool balls, spray cans even sushi plates and such, the cars are those cute small cars with huge wheels and they look adorable.\n\nSound:\n\nThe game features upbeat, fast paced, techno-ish soundtracks which are very suitable for racing games as it’ll keep you pumped up. There’s plenty of tracks so you won’t get tired of listening to the same tracks over and over again.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay consists of, well, world tours of racing. You have 3 categories of races, there’s the “Amateur” level which will have the cult classic cars such as the Volkswagen beetle lookalike, Ford Mustang, Mini Cooper etc. There’s even a camper van called “Braking bad” which I thought was a hilarious reference to, you know, Breaking bad. Then there’s the “Pro” level which has street racer cars such as Nissan 350z, Skyline even a Range Rover type of car etc. The last but not the least is the “Expert” level which has super cars like Ferrari or “Fauxrari”, McLaren or “McHandful” as the game tells it. All the cars’ names will be different than their original counter-part I guess due to licenses and other such legal matters.\n\nThe cars’ physics and feel is very arcade-y as it should be for a table top racing game. The cars handle fine and have plenty of upgrades/paintjobs/bling-bling rims etc. There’s quite a few customizable items to unlock. The cars also have special wheels/rims which affect your car e.g. there’s the Spartan blade rims which will damage the other racers’ cars when brushing against them. Every time you win or lose a race you will get coins and the 3-star system which will give you stars depending on how well you did on that race/event. You can use these coins to buy new cars or upgrade your already bought cars. One car in all 3 levels are unlocked for you from the start, rest you will have to buy with coins. There’s a lot of stuff which can be bought with coins, paintjobs, wheels, performance upgrades etc.\n\nYou have a bunch of different types of racing modes available such as racing with power pickups, time trials and best lap time modes. The maps are small enough and most events have short races which are usually 1-2 minutes long with 3-5 laps. There’s plenty of themes like of the maps like a workshop theme which will have all those car parts lying around, sports theme such as pool stuff, kitchen theme with vegetables, sushi etc.\n\nYou can also get power-ups in races such as speed boost (sort of like nitro), rocket, bombs etc. The usual type of power ups available in any combat racing game. The AI is pretty good and will try to screw you over every chance it gets.\n\nThere are 3 types of racing levels, or leagues. Each has 3 tournaments which you can beat and get the trophies. The multiplayer mode is pretty dead, as of writing this review I could not find anyone playing online but then again it’s morning where I am right now so I guess people will be on at night time (as is usual for me with multiplayer games). You can also play with friends so if your friends have the game you can have plenty of fun with this game with friends. A short best lap mode race video can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695706997\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nConclusion: 9/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game looks very nice and is pretty fun to play. If you like racing games, you should get this game. There’s not many multiplayer people playing so do watch out for that. The music is awesome and the graphics are very neat looking, gameplay is fun and will have you playing more and more to unlock more stuff.","June 2","true","3.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

The actual race courses are small and not very interesting besides the "table top" gimmick. That's some novelty at first, but not a lot of fun is had with it. The driving lacked a lot of feel and excitement a racing game usually has, and the tracks are very flat except for an occasional jump, incline or decline. Sure, it's racing on a table top, but I really think the racing and track design could be done better. Maybe those are reasons why table top racing games tend to disappoint. I think some day someone will finally get it right, but this game still isn't it.\n\nI got the game with the first DLC only to end up feeling like the game did not create enough interest to keep me coming back.\n\nThe multiplayer lobby here is a good place to watch tumbleweeds from.\n\nSome people like the "breakbeat" dance soundtrack.

Lots of game modes and tracks to choose from and the multiplayer is really fun too. Art style is really nice and the cars look and sound great, fair amount of cars to choose from and different weapons. Well worth the purchase!\n\nJust to add more info, There's 3 types of cars to choose from, classics, street racers and supercars, each has 3 trophys to win using each of the 3 types of cars. Each type has 4 cars to pick from, so 12 cars in total. (Unless you buy the DLC then there's 4 more) Each car handles differently and has stats to upgrade, speed, acceleration handling and armour so the more races you win the more money you get and the better you can build your car. Each car can be equiped with 7 types of wheel and there are 4 different paint jobs for each car. There are 126 challenges in the game with 3 stars to get in each (gold silver bronze) for a total of 378 stars. Game types inclide Combat where you have weapons to blow up other cars, elimination where a car gets eliminated each lap, pursuit where you start 1 lap behind another car and have to catch up to it, drift where you drift, hot lap which is 3 lap time trials and fastest lap game types. There are 5 different enviroments to choose from and 4 different tracks in each enviroment. Online is upto 8 players and you can customise if you want power ups on and off etc.\n\nI think it's worth the money and really fun, the small details make this game. The art style is really nice and on the best settings it runs 144fps so the frame rate isn't capped.","May 26","true","8.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","2"

All the cars feel like they handle differently, so there's a good reason to change cars for different events.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/recommended/450670/","nkdeffa","DEFFA.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/","178 products in account","Table Top Racing : World Tour is arcade style racing game having both single and multiplayer modes and has been developed and published by "Playrise Digital" on 26 May of 2016,making their debut on steam.\n\nSingle player mode is chapter based, filled with a variety of maps and challenges having them separated with 3 types of cars available in-game, which are : cult classics,street cars and supercars each having a variety of customizable settings and upgrades providing different visuals, tuning and power-ups besides the ones that are located on the map.\n\nAs I mentioned game also has a multiplayer mode however player base is just not there yet since game has came out recently so I couldn't test it out. Going in-depth with a technical side of the game is intended to be played with controllers with keyboard serving as a secondary option. The mouse has been completely left out due to functionality being completely disabled even on the menu navigation system,furthermore it often glitches out faintly flashing until you re-tab to the application.\n\nBesides having enjoyable gameplay, accompanied with matching sountracks, the game has some what astonishing graphics having every single detail  well designed and pointed out besides also a having beautiful power-up effects making gameplay more fun and eye catchy.however maps seem to be repetitive just having a little details switched out. I think there's around 5 maps so far just being slightly modified for different races.\n\nPROS:Variety of cars – (there's 3 type of cars available with each having about 5 or so different vehicles)\n\nVariety of modes – (the game offers different types of modes such as drift, elimination, hot lap, pursuit, combat, time trial, etc.)\n\nVariety of customization – (besides just having cosmetic options and basic tuning there is a variety of power-ups to purchase each completely changing the gameplay)\n\nGraphics – (the game has beautiful and well designed graphics, every detail is considered and pointed out)\n\nGameplay – (the gameplay feels more like a Mario Kart having power-ups located around the track and giving you the chance to take advantage of your opponents which is accompanied with cool matching music)\n\nGamepad support – (the game makes full use of a controller)\n\nMultiplayer – (the game has multiplayer,however there's no player base for it,since gamecame out couple of days ago)\nCONS:No mouse support – (the mouse is completely disabled even in menu navigation)\n\nMenu – (it sometimes glitches out and not allowing you to choose anything, once you finish the recent track, which is fixed by re-opening the feature)\n\nHidden coins – (there are some hidden coins that give you currency once you get them, however, they are located in some unreachable places unless you have certain power ups to reach them and even then you may lose an entire lap attempting to get them).\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews. I received this game for free thanks to Steamified and the developer.

Table Top Racing: World Tour is...well...a racing game. The biggest appeal they push is small cars on table surfaces like work desks at an auto-shop or a sushi bar. The lack of content and overall non-uniqueness bring this games quality down, begging for a price change. I will reccomend it however with the case of waiting for a sale. Now let's get started!!!!\n\nFor starters, let's get that TL;DR out of the way!\n+Good Graphics\n+Pick-Up and Tire powerups\n+Several Game Modes\n+Online Multiplayer\n+Tracks don't look alike\n+For me, Good performance\n+Ugrade Vehicles with in game money you win\n\n-Unlike Sonic, Mario, Flatout, Gas Guzzlers there is no named racers. So making a rivalry [like I hated Jason from Flatout] or making your own makeshift narrative doesn't happen. This also brings no character to the competition\n-Only 3 classes of cars with 4 in each.\n-Only 2 cups in each class\n-Each gamemode feels old...like classic is good of course but, there is no new feel to it. Rather just go play another racer that has done it better or made it feel new with some extra mechanic.\n-Powerups are your typical powerups...ice blast, shockwave, rocket, homing rocket, all generic powerups.\n-Can not shoot some powerups behind or foward [so if the rocket shoots foward, you cant shoot back]\n-Day 1 DLC [this doesn't bother me....but it bothers most]\n\nSo 7 pros and 7 cons....my feelings for this game are very mixed at the moment. Stick around for the full review!!! I am going to put a tad bit more time into it just to make sure my claims are valid, do a video and I will come back later to write out the long winded review. See ya soon!\n\n-Update-\nOkay so to give you a bit of an overview of the content I haven't yet brought up:\nThere is a championship mode, special events mode, multiplayer. There is no quick race or custom race in singleplayer.\n\nThere is a few secrets such as short cuts and coins...but not many.\n\nThere is only two track hazards: falling off the table top and objects like dice, cups, spray paint cans you know...it depends on the setting. I like this, but they don't really have much of an effect. I've slammed into many of them, they just go flying and I keep truckin'\n\nThere isn't much in the way of dynamic gameplay. No random track events, no dangerous tracks, nothing like that.\n\nPowerups\nThis is my biggest beaf with this game. The power ups are not satisfying at all. Take mario, sonic or gas guzzlers extreme. When you shoot someone with a power up, you see them explode or go ape crap. But here, a rocket hits a car..little bit of black smoke...then nothing. The electric shock, acid, mines all of that look so weak in nature.\n\nThe recovery time is also atrocious. You recover so quickly that the power up attacks affect maybe .5 seconds of progression.\n\nThe power ups I remember are as follows, keep in mind I don't know the official names:\nHoming Rocket\nRocket\nFreeze shot [you shoot someone and they turn into an ice cube]\nacid trail\nelectric shock\nboost\nmines\nand there is one more I can't remember.","May 26","true","2.1"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","21","43","2","4"

If so, then copy and paste a glowing review for that game here. Better than Micro Machines, if for no ther reason than the cars. TTR:WT has better cars. They're awesome, but I worry that there aren't enough 'vanilla' cars, and any extra are going to be paid DLC. I'm not against paid DLC at all, as long as the base game has enough to start with. Please release some free cars to make the base game more attractive to customers, who will then buy more out of choice, and not feel forced in to it. Game runs really well, looks great, and even the sound is pretty good too. The cars are really cool, and the handling is good. The level design is a lot like Micro Machines. The game's title should tell you that, but I do think more scenarios are needed.\nIn short, the base game is a little light on cars and scenarios, but it's cheap enough, and plays really well. Worth a buy.","June 2","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
