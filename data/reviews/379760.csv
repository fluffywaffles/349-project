As a Unity Developer myself I'm extra picky about these kinds of games but I was pleasantly impressed by this one. Very smooth, creative, cute minimalistic side-scroller that lets/makes you set up the level before trying to survive it. Gets very challenging later on. It reminds me of VVVVVV with the amount of dying-by-spikes. Decent soundtrack. Excellent physics. Gameplay is thought out and set up so you get to try and experiment with different setups as you play... without having to restart the level... which is refreshing. Has an Angry-Bird-Esque scoring system that's blissfully free of any time limits. Advancement is based on collecting powerups, however these powerups can be hard to see in the first world due to the bright background. Doesn't seem to be an issue though once you progress and the game gets darker. My kids love watching me play. Gonna say it was worth the $5.\n\n8.5/10","August 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","19","19","2","0"

You are playing in rectangular rooms that only fill a screen each, using placeable arrows to influence gravity.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay consists of the strategy and the action phase, as I will call them. In the strategy phase, you place the arrows. There are four arrows: Up, down, left, right. Each arrow makes gravity pull the protagonist in the direction it shows. You can place them on the whole playfield, with some exceptions. You can't place them into other objects (orbs are exempt from this). You want to collect all orbs and then reach the exit, so you must plan a bit ahead, but only in one level was it actually interesting to figure out how to do it. Many times you have more arrows than you will need.\nThe game consists of five sets of ten levels each.\n\nAchievements\nThere are ten achievements that unlock as you progress while collecting all orbs. As the developer currently is moving, he will fix the achievements when he is able to, he says on the forums!\n\nMusic\nThe music is very nice, it's very catchy. The sound effects are sparse and fitting, but of a bit a low quality.\n\nControls\nThe controls are working fine, but have two big issues to me. First the protagonist does not steer well. He oversteers easily, running further than he should. This can become tedious later on.\nSecond the protagonist goes on the 2D plane in the direction of the key you press. Now this might be a matter of taste, I would actually like him to always jump when you press up and accordingly go for the other keys, so for example pressing left is going right when the gravity points up.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are very basic, there are few different graphics. The game feels just like a series of chambers you go through, which it is, and does not build any graphical atmosphere.\n\nOverall you get a small nice game, one I can actually recommend if you got it from a bundle or cheaply. Since you get only around an hour of entertainment until you 100 percented everything (except of course the broken achievement), you should keep that in mind when buying.\n\nRecommended: If you get it cheap","September 22, 2015","true","1.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Nice music and visuals and satisfying puzzles. The narrative is decent. It's not complex. It's just there in the background and ties the game together nicely.\nIt contains 5 worlds with 10 levels each. The length depends on how well you do. Steam registered 4 hours but that includes leaving the game open, letting other people play, and sucking at puzzles. Regardless, I got my money's worth out of it and it was satisfying.\nI didn't get 2 of the achievements even though I should have (chapter 3 and beating the game). Not really an issue for me.\nIt doesn't support a controller. Not an issue since it's a PC game and it works really well with K+M. I think using a controller to place gravitational arrows would be awkward.","August 13, 2015","true","4.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You have the freedom of placing the arrows before starting the level and adjusting between tries. Add a bit of platforming and orb collecting and you have Gravity Error.\n\nThe game's design might look simplistic but it easily pulls you in especially with its soundtrack, and if you happen to be very good at platform puzzle games you will find yourself finishing this in one sitting. Some levels are harder than they look if you plan to get all orbs. Overall worth the low price tag.\n\nI only wish it had more challenge-based achievements, but that's just me.","August 13, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You will die many times.  You will also die a lot.  And you will die over and over again.  But the good thing is that the music doesn't stop and reset when you die.  It just quickly resets the level and you start back at the beginning.  So your concentration doesn't get jarred.  I hate (like Angry Birds) where it takes time to reset everythign and do the beginning music flare every time you die and die and die.  So annoying.  But this game did it right.  The reset is smooth, so you can quickly get back to trying again...and again...and again...maybe I'll be able to make that jump this time...or not...how about trying this strategy...oops...how about, oh crap I slipped and fell by accident...etc.\n\n","May 27","true","1.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game includes some interesting puzzles and the controls work well.\n\nI found the game to be pretty easy though. Most of the puzzles I finished quickly. The puzzles that took longer were usually due to failing the platforming sections of the level.\n\nGravity Error is also king of short. While I didn't get all of the collectibles in the game, it took less than two hours to finish the game. If I were to get all of the collectibles it probably would have taken a little over two hours.\n\nIf you like puzzle platformers and don't mind that the game is a little on the easy side I think you should enjoy Gravity Error.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer. Other than the review copy I received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review	[www.geekyhobbies.com]","August 19, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

There is some trouble with getting achievements, but you can find a solution in the Discussions section. Except for that, it's an extremely entertaining and perfectly polished game. That's the case where puzzles can be solved in many ways, so everybody's playthrough will be different, and the platforming side is fast-paced and breathtaking. The game is kind of short and isn't especially tough, but nevertheless it will take some time and mental/tactile strain for you to make your choices and perform them in action, so you won't be disappointed. Also, the soundtrack is quite a pleasure to listen to. Highly recommended.","January 6","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Adding expert mode that makes all the levels twice as hard after finishing the normal game would have address this.\n\nGet it on a discount for a quick and fun gameplay if you enjoy puzzlers. 5/10\n","February 11","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
