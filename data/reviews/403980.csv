After the failure of their previous entry into the world of giant boats and the sea, European Ship Simulator, it's back to the drawing board as Odin Game Studios does a redo and tries to make something that's playable and, well, not a gigantic turd sack.  Will they succeed?  Maybe, but things are not looking good.\n\nThe graphics look like they've come from a game made in 2001.  I'm really not joking here.  It's embarassingly bad.  Ocean textures are awful (and not in the "full of awe" kind of way).  There appears to be this horrible, radioactive-like film grain effect while on the open seas.  The sky graphics, especially the stars at night, are blurry and extremely low resolution textures.  They look terrible.  And don't get me started on the harbor office!!  The interior of which looks like it game out of a game from 1996.  It's downright embarassing!!  There are people walking around who are apparently at the harbor for some kind of balsa wood bridge building convention (and no, I'm NOT making this up!!).  They also happen to be genetic clones, only forced to wear horribly different clothes as to not confuse each other.  The women walk around like they've either just given birth in the women's restroom, they've just crapped their pants, or their thongs are on backward.  I just can't get past the downright terrible graphics.\n\nGameplay itself is incredibly dull as well.  Find the nice lady giving out the jobs, and she'll have to go to some fishing spots, or some other ports, or delivering cargo, the list goes on.  The missions are insanely, mind-numbingly boring, and don't really offer anything beyond "go here, do that" on a flat surface (the ocean).  At least we have the option to accelerate time, just so we can get through the pain more easily.\n\nThis game is so bad that I really don't even want to continue writing this review.  I hate to be so brutally honest, but I'm afraid if I continue going on, I'll turn into Gordon Ramsey and really let myself go off the hook!\n\nI DO NOT currently recommend this game.  If it improves, I'll be sure to update my review to reflect those improvements.  I'm really hoping that this game can eventually become a cash cow like Euro Truck Simulator, but so far it's not even 1% as good.\n\nDO NOT BUY.","November 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 40 of 65 people (62%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","62","40","65","16","11"

Un-optimized, a decent PC can barely handle it at lowest settings.\n2.

Most people might disagree on the claim I'm about to make, but I really think that ESS (European Ship Simulator) was far superior in being a proper ship simulator, it might have felt daft at first, I played it for 2 hours, and came up with the conclusion that it is garbage, but went back for a 2nd try, and almost enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed SS2008/SSE, and considering they well, scrapped a project competely, that did actually have some potential, just to start from scratch and have another go into the darkness and hope for the best is really quite unprofessional, which means that WSS might have the same fate as ESS.\n\n","March 24","false","0.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I found it fairly easy to control, and a bit slow, but then? This sort of game should be slower, right?\n\nGiven the point it is at now as the starting place? I look forward to what it has coming.\n\nWater and other graphics looked good to me until going to the Tourism port by Fast Travel. Then the water disappeared or showed my port boat as more of a submarine. Outside that (which didn't crash it, as I could still moor the boat to go into the harbor offices), it looked beautiful on Ultra settings.","November 17, 2015","true","1.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","21","35","4","1"

I honestly think my grandmother could do a better job using MS paint and she can't even use a Nokia 3310!\n- Land bird noises out at sea- I know this may sound petty, but really, whenever I have been out at sea (7 ferry journeys this year) I have not seen a single land bird. I understand they migrate twice a year, however, definitely see a lot more Gulls than I see Robins this is for sure\n- Water coming through the front of the boat- This just feels unfinished as of yet so not overly concerned, however, realistic boat through water effects would be amazing.\n-Very small world- I hope this will be increased in size massively, I am sorry but 3 or 4 ports will not cut it. In a Sim/Arcade game, size will mean everything, a great example is Euro Truck Simulator, dozens of unique towns\nWorking lighthouses- I dont think Ive seen a single Sim with a working lighthouse\n-The lock/unlock function- whereas this may have its uses, I feel that you also need a semi-lock where the throttle will lock after pressing w/s and not have to use the mouse.\n-Things I'd love to see implemented- buoys, realistic shore lighting, more boat animations\n\nAnd now for the good...\n-This game has playability potential- yes the missions may be missing depth, but it has missions, and a career structure, and I am not aware of any career structure in a ship sim to date.\n-The water and boat lighting- the water looks pretty good, and at night with the light shining on it, I think looks even better\n-The potential this game has, with the right additions, and ensuring the additions have quality, rather than throwing in rubbish, speedily created additions would help add to the games immersability.\n\nI look forward to regular updates, and I actually believe with the right care and attention this will be a great sim. After playing for the short time I have, it feels very much like an early Euro Truck Simulator, and that is now probably one of the best sims out there. Keep up the good work devs, and I look forward to giving you more feedback!","November 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","12","18","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charlieso/recommended/403980/","charlieso","charlie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charlieso/","409 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is highly inaccurate. I've been the captain of many boats in real life, so I've gotten to know the inside and outside of these vessels. That being said, whenever a boat even emits the slightest whimper, I can identify the make and model of said boat. For example, I spend my leisure time in real life on  my 2009 Yahama 190 FSH, an aquatic vessel with a delightful purr that brings even the most hydrophobic lasses crawling the dock. This game has the NERVE to introduce a sport boat, yet the boat itself sounds more like a Scarab jet boat than my precious Yahama. Stuff like that honestly just makes me want to arm myself with a cartoonish hammer and bonk the devs of this game.\n\nNow as far as commercial boating goes, the crimes here are even more pernicious. The Hammerschmidt Shrimpmaster 320 is the standard for fishing boats, obviously. Yet the Hammerschmidt sounds similar to a sustained rhinoceros grunt, echoing through an aluminum tube. If these devs were fisherman, they'd know that. Instead this fishing boat sounds like a baby ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into an aluminum can. I can't listen to this and not be angry. This horrible mistake could only go unnoticed by the most oblivious of grass men, whose ears are so small that sounds are simply monotone beeps and purrs.\n\n\nSecond point, don't even bother me with a tutorial, I know how to pilot a ship. I've been on boats my entire life. My father was the captain of a large skiff, which he used to fish for crab in the Alaskan Sea. Unfortunately fishing regulations caused him to go broke. I think if the liberal up north are so concerned about the life of freaking fish they should just dive into the sea and life among the crabs, sea snails, and aquatic creatures like Aquaman.\n\nTLDR this is BULLCRAP.\n\nAny real fisherman knows this game is trash created by the aeronautics industry to bring a crappy name to all boating men throughout the world (including the oceans).\n\n\n\n","April 12","false","0.2"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","57","25","44","12","4"

I will say as the game is an alfa and is only on its first verison, the game is very far from being a game that is worth buying. The water is not the best looking, when moring it is hard to see the points of conections though the orange bubble, and the graphics on the highest setting looks very poor. I also had a glitch after leaving the game and coming back to it a few hours later a screen came up saying my boat is damaged and is needing repairs. I found this strange because I had not hit anything before hand and then to be charged $1000 in game money was not fun.  Another thing that I think is bad is that when you are in the harbor office it still sounds like you are on the boat. There is no music or any back ground noise while in the office other than the sea.  People in the office are weird and don't interact well. Missions are boaring and sometimes confusing to know what to do. They need to have a thing saying what the diffrent colors mean out side of the totorial. The money system is not very good as it would take many missions to buy any of the ships. The game is very hard to control while fast fowarding time, as it is very laggy and skips a lot.\nHope this helps people looking at the game. currently I would wait till further updates and more reviews to buy this game unless you are really into alphas or ships.","November 18, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

I was very shocked when I noticed a guy sat beside me with his feet through the floor. I tried to notify him in which he ignored me. I decided to go and inform the secretary but his feet were also through the floor! Everyone’s feet were through the floor! I almost fainted!\n\nThat was until I found a lass who was walking with her feet on the floor. Although walking very ‘manly’ like in an attempt to recapture Ronda Rousey's style in which was lost a few days ago - This lass indeed won’t be on the cover of World Ship Simulator. She eventually led me into some sort of class room with charts and lots of seats. That's when I decided it was my time to shine and start a lecture, no one listened though and there were some people just walking around not even paying attention to me and even walking into each other!\n\nThe other rooms contained a salesman who I quickly avoided to make sure he didn’t try selling me boats because I know I would’ve ended up with seventeen trawlers, nine fishing boats and eighty five kayaks. In the last room of the port there was a guy (who looked like an older version of squirrel) who was there for the grunt work of repairing your boat for a set price.\n\nI decided it was time to take starboard and go to reception to ask for a job. There were several jobs on the board – Fishing, Delivering Packages, Fishing (Small memory forgot the rest) so I decided to take up delivering packages. Upon leaving and getting in my ship I opened the map and set sail to the objective. I found a neat feature that was speed x5 until I realised the game got very jumpy and I couldn’t control the ship at all. I did control the ship eventually, right into the back of another trawler and I was immediately thrown back into the port.\n\nMy ship was dead and suddenly Squirrel was taking money from me and I was -$1000. Luckily the other seaman didn’t claim insurance else I would’ve been buggered. Actually, I don’t even think he made it out of his ship alive. I decided it was time to get myself back into the action and within 10 minutes I was back in the sea. I followed the objective back to port and when I got there it said “Going into port will cancel your mission”. I was very highly confused. It seemed the game did not have great guidance on where to go for your mission.\n\nIt was at this time I realised that this was not a pilot and that was to do with planes.

Fair enough.  The devs are promising more ships, missions, career mode and possibly free roam.\n\nHowever, the game needs some very fundamental changes to the core.  The graphics are very amateurish and, in the case of the scenes at port where one is trying to choose a mission, the whole thing looks like something from the 1990's.  The NPC's look like something a child would create, the colours are all wrong and are too vibrant.  The port area is excrutiating to look at.\n\nThe ships exteriors are not too bad, but utter rubbish compared with European Ship Simulator (ESS) which this game is supposed to be replacing!  The bridges are nowhere near as good as ESS either and equally lacking in any interactivity with most of the controls not working.  The UI controls are too small and are tricky to grab with the mouse, especially the throttles.  The sea is not as good as ESS either and the water breaking over the bow looks rather like a poorly done snow storm.  The background pictures on the horizon are very poor as well.  It is nice that you can walk out of the bridge and around the ship, but why would you want to as there is nothing as yet to do, though this could be changed in the future as could interactive radio comms with the port authorities and other ships or interactive fully detailed bridge controls.  More ports are also promised.\n\nHowever, I fear that all such improvements will come to nought if the devs do not do something drastic to change the quality of the graphics.  Ship sims, like non-combat flight sims should be all about beauty and something to behold.  If the graphics are not improved at least to the standard of say, ESS or Silent Hunter 5, then this game is going to be a flop.\n\nPersonally, I would dearly love to see this game developed to the standard of FSX with a full world to roam about (or time skip if the distances are too far on a particular voyage).  fully interactive bridges, interactive comms with ports and other ships.  Radio traffic from other ships and, like FSX, a system in place where other publishers can produce high quality detailed accurate real world ships and ports as addons whilst paying a percentage towards this game's publishers/devs.\n\nHowever, such developments may eventually be achieved, but are pointless unless the graphics, colours, textures and animations are not significantly improved.  I will soldier on with this game and will be happy to revise this review in the future if things improve.","May 28","false","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The overall graphics are really not great and still, I got a ♥♥♥♥ FPS with a highend gaming system.\nThe AI is... did a piece of bread program it? I spawned for the first time with my completely new profile, the ship in front of me sailed away straight out directly into the port, and then continued on the ports surface. While sailing, it stuttered up and down rapidly all the time, which is what all AI ships that I've seen have been doing.\nYour own ship doesn't really correspond to the effect that waves have on a ship that is afloat and underway, on my first attempt it didn't really move up/down in any way, with the nose stuck in the water and the back in the air, and then just very lightly, plus it looked just completely fail.\nYour ship gets damage when you touch an object, there is an indicator at the bottom right to show you a percentage of the damage. When it reaches 100, it's game over. The problem is that the game doesn't care whether you hit an object with 1kn or 10kn, so even if you just touch something slightly, you get a higher damage of about 20+ percent, which is bullsh*t. By the way, you now have to repair damage (using ingame-money), so... RIP if you want to buy bigger ships (you have to buy a freighter for 20k.. wtf?).\nThe missions are completely boring and dull, with all the flaws that the game has it is no fun whatsoever.\nCan't recommend it in the current state. If something changes, I'll let you know.","November 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

The vessels I noticed didn't have the proper lighting arrangements that I was hopeing. For example the starting vessel being a power driven vessel did not have the aft section lights and the port and starbord lights, the fishing and tralling vessels along with vessels towing displayed this as well. But I can go into more detail about the things this game needs to be as close to the real thing as possable. For now I have issues with lag with this game on my laptop but right now its not too bad.","November 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fanmad/recommended/403980/","fanmad","Gabriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fanmad/","70 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has potential if they will listen to the community on how to improve it. A lot of ideas in the community page point out to Euro Truck Simulator 2. I would also point out to TransOceania: The Shiping company for mission, map and leveling system and Ship Simulator Extremes for the first person camera view.\n\nThe game looks nice graphically in most parts except the port's first person view / walk mode. These are totally horrible.\n\nAs of now, I would suggest to keep this game in your Wishlist till later when it will get (probably) out of Early Access. You will regret spending the money on it now.\n\nLet's hope tho, the developers will find the encessary funding to further develop the game and not get into the same situation as with Euro Ship Simulator.","November 30, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
