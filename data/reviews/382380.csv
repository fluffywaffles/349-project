I want to start off with the good things about it though only because I have been trying so hard to like this game. As everyone mentions this game is breathtakingly gorgeous, with almost every background and sprite being hand drawn.  Then there's the story which is extreml creative and nuanced touching surprisingly on quite a few modern topics that can paralel perfectly with the real world. From here though I stuggle to find compliments for this game.\n\nI am willing to write off so many issues with plot or charcters or gameplay just because of the beutiful scenery and soundtrack, but I cannot write off the game breaking bugs. I have on six seperate occasions been forced to go back an hour to an hour and a half's worth of progress due to autosaves happening just after a game bug. For example, early in the game in the forest village there is a man who if you talk to at an incorrect angle you interrupt his pathing the game saves, and your character is unable to move. Or say much later (about 11 hours in) there is an enemy that you MUST avoid at all costs otherwise once you defeat it you are treated with a completly black screen The game is still there your character can move and interact with the world the game itself has just become black.\n\nThen there's the open world RPG element. Please for the love of god if you are making a completly linear storyline where I must progress from one area to another and back again in a specific order, do not give me the ability to travel everywhere in the world. I would love to say that I understood what was going on in that storyline, but because I wanted to explore I ended up triggering events out of order and making a mad hash of everything. Playing through my second time after realizing what I had done, I must also ask that you make it blatently sure as to where I need to go. So that I no longer interpret dialouge to mean enter areas where I am instantly killed which are meant for the end game.\n\nI was so close to the end I was trying so hard to push through, but replaying the same sections over and over due to bugs takes a toll. This game is in the end unplayble.","November 9, 2015","false","12.6"," 145 of 166 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","145","166","2","3"

It was good. Amazing even.\nThe artwork is lovely, the gameplay is very intuitive, the characters are interesting and the story, man the story. I was invested from start to finish. I'll have to replay the game in hopes of catching some more foreshadowing.\nI am not lying when I say this is one of my favorite games to date. It's worth every bit of money I spent.\nI know I know, this sounds super ridiculous because I only say positive things. Truth be told the only negative thing I could think of, was that the sprint key was so far away from the arrow keys and I couldn't sprint while eating stuff in front of my computer.\n\nCheck list of positive things in this game:\n+ Girl with a sword and her new bestie, Girl with a pistol, go and want to overthrow a throne\n+ On their way they pick up Rifle Dude, a bird and a lizard\n+ Plot twist that was actually not super surprising but I still yelled "DAMN IT!"\n+ Incredibly lovely artwork that I'll definitely honor with fanart\n+ Very relaxing soundtrack. Seriously you can just let it play in the background. Maybe use battle music for cleaning idk\n+ Not as much exposition as you'd expect\n+ Long game\n+ Great story\n+ How was this made with RPG Maker? I had to double check because I could barely believe it.\n\nCheck list of negative things\n- No sprinting and eating Pizza at the same time\n- At times the controls were a bit wonky but you get used to it.\n\nIn my humble opinion everyone who loves good stories in video games should definitely get The Amber Throne. I'd give it more thumbs up if I could.","August 6, 2015","true","21.5"," 80 of 88 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","80","88","10","0"

Let's do this.\n\nThe Amber Throne is gorgeous. You definitely acknowledged that by now, but since it's the most important and successful part of the game I can't really write a review without mentioning it. The story is good, and even if I personally didn't find the soundtrack to be as remarkable as some reviews said it would be, It's still satisfying.\n\nThe issue I have about The Amber Throne is that it's not that good at being a game.\n\nThat's not going to be one of those review that says "Not worth your time - don't buy". Like I said, there ARE some good things about this game, but I also have a lot of complaints, and the Negative Reviews section is the place to talk about those.\n\nLet's start with the main issue, wich is also the reason why I can't play the game anymore : because I'm fed up with it. The skill system was so much fun to tinker with when I started playing. Like with any RPG, the first thing I did was to open the menu and check the evolution system. I was pleased to see that as soon as a character joins the party, all their locked skills are already visible, wich means you can immediately have a look at what kind of roles each character might be good at. That way you can plan your progression in advance even if you don't have the levels to buy the skills. So, kudos to that. But.\n\nLike I said, I ended up being fed up with, it mainly for a reason : there simply isn't enough skills.\n\nIt's actually a problem I encountered quite often with games made with RPG Maker (the reason behind the obsolete resolution, btw), as well as RPGs in general. If the battles become a chore, if each of the four characters end up using the same three skills 90% of the time, then the player might not want to finish the story at all. Add to this the fact that you can end up wandering through the map with no idea where to go, or that the battle sound effects come from RPG Maker's sound bank and WILL get to your nerves if you've already heard them in several other games.\n\nThe last problem I have with the skill system is that the last character (Sirra, unless there's another one) joins the party way too late, and with only one skill, when Arra and Popette each have a good ten or even more. It wouldn't be a problem if you could level him up to catch up with the girls, but at this point the leveling had already become much slower, making it difficult to unlock new skills. And that's a shame since Sirra is so cool, on top of having a name that reminds me of my favorite character from Bluebyte's Albion. (But that might not be the point)\n\nSpeaking of characters, I also find it extremely stupid that even with only four playable characters, you can only fight with three at a time. I know I'm a fan of FFVI, and some people prefer to have three characters in combat, but in this case it's literally "the three fighters and that guy you only remember in the cutscenes". (Sorry, Nuo)\nI know the point of such system is to make the player switch between characters to adapt their strategy to the current enemy, but you need way more playable characters to be able to do that ! You can't expect someone to make a three-cards deck from a selection of four cards, especially if those cards need to be leveled up before their gameplay gets interesting.\n\nThe last thing I have to say is about the design of those characters. Graphically, they're great (but everything is graphically great in this game). However I completely failed to grow attached to them, and that's probably because of a lack of character development. Retroactively, that's probably a huge part of the reason why the story wasn't enough to make me keep playing after I started to get bored. The plot is heavily world-driven, and the characters barely interact with each other. Heck, the main protagonist is actually mute. Sure, the story supports it, but it's really hard to get emotionally attached to a character that doesn't say a word outside of dreams and journal entries.\n\nAnd that's all I have to say. At least for now. I might add something if I end up finishing the game (and I probably will, but right now I don't feel like it). As for what I meant by "The Amber Throne is not that good at being a game", it's simply that, at the end of the day, I might have suceeded to really like it if it had been a novel. Or one of those japanese Light Novels. You can't simply give up on drawings like these.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, like I said earlier I don't think the game is unplayable because of this. Even if I ended up disappointed, I still had fun playing it. There are some really good ideas, varied enemies, a beautiful story, and I found the gameplay very entertaining in the beginning and middle of the game. Also, did you know that the graphics were gorgeous ?","January 23","false","7.8"," 69 of 84 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","69","84","0","0"

I adored the watercolor inspired landscapes. The story kept me invovled and had a fairytale quality to it. Each character was uniue. The images and storytelling were enough to forget that the games is an RPG Maker game. There are glitches that occur that will remind you as well as some of the battle mechanics. This did not detract from my overall expereince. My only issues with the game were the map and walking speed. First, the map was just an over view of the entire world. I perfer a map that gives more detail or is helpful when exploring. This map did nothing for me. When exploring you will also find ancient statues that will respawn enemies each time you enter that area. I chose not to activate the statues and I was still able to level-up enough to beat the final section. Now for the walking speed. Yes, you can change the walk from a slow turtle pace to an elderly person with a walker pace. I felt much of the game was me walking slowly. The game is beautiful but I still like to move at a decent pace when trying to backtrack etc.\n\nI found this to be a great mix of story and artwork. I doubt it will be a game I replay again but it was worth playing.

However, the story and the art style are both very strong and help to compel the player to go deeper and deeper into the depths of this game. The story starts as so: The Amber God had a prophetic vision that there would be a rebellion that would claim his life. He perceived that, if the throne fell into the wrong hands, the destruction and carnage that would fall upon the land would be catastrophic and unparalleled. He raised his kingdom high into the sky and protected it by encasing it inside of an impenetrable cloud. The events unfolded as he knew they would and he was killed by the rebellion. Prior to raising his kingdom into the sky, he hid his sleeping daughter away with the hopes that she would someday awaken and destroy the throne once and for all. The reason why the throne had to be destroyed is because the Amber Throne grants any wish that can be imagined to the person that sits upon it. There have been several Amber Gods. However, this particular Amber God wanted to stop the cycle. Will his daughter Arra be able to fulfill her father’s dying wish?\n\nClick this link to read the full Review:\nhttp://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/the-amber-throne/","September 19, 2015","true","6.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I have no real bad things to say about it, (as it was very enjoyable!) only some wishes.\n\nI wish the story was more... concrete? It felt very fantasy babble at some points. I'm an experienced reader, but the text often was confusing. I was left to fill in the blanks for many things (and I played where I talked to everyone to get all the information I could, searched for all story clues, etc).\n\nI wish that we could have known a little more about the characters. They talk about their motivations but no real reasons are shown for them... They just... have a lot of feelings I guess? Since you are playing as Arra, who lost her memory, that confusion kind of works at the start in the game's favor? But as the game progresses, you realize that even the person you are supposed to be playing as is keeping things back from you... argh. I'm frustrated, because with some fine tuning, this story and characters would make me care about them as much as Undertale did. As it is, I'm left with the feeling of being on the outside of something big, and not now or ever being allowed into their inner circle to see more. Because I do care about the characters, I just wasn't allowed to get to know them.\n\nThe art and character/monster designs are stunning tho. Extraordinarily, sometimes breathtakingly stunning. It felt like playing through a storybook. The music matched very well too. Knowing where to go was confusing (a lot of walking into invisible walls ensued), because of the watercolour artstyle there wasn't clear lines as to where the path was.\n\nAlso, there would be paths that would lead off-screen that you couldn't explore. I didn't mind all this however, as I liked exploring the world. It got frustrating a few times (like the time I wandered around an entire area for 5+ minutes walking into all the spaces of the screen trying to figure out where I was supposed to go - it turned out that it was a screen you previously couldn't enter, but it looked the same as it always did, so I assumed it was one of those 'aesthetic' background doorways - like it was befoooore it changed), as it does take you out of the immersion, but I don't know if that could have been helped.\n\nYou can tell so much love went into this little (surprisingly long) game, and it is a gem that is worth playing. Despite what I said about the characters being rather one demensional, the world building is exquisite. All down to the art once again. The art is certainly this game's strong point (and comes so alive, that maybe that's why I was left disappointed with the writing, it just couldn't live up to the art).\n\nDefinitely worth it for the rpg fans, or people new to video gaming. It's a very soothing game.","May 9","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Content is reasonably lengthy, at about 14 hours from start to finish. The game's few detractors were a number of typo's, syntax errors, and minor bugs that did not detract from my experience.

The first thing I want to say is: YES this game is worth your money. That being said, the reason I love this game is because it takes me back to my youth when I played games like Earthbound, Chrono Trigger, and later Xenogears (as well as the Final Fantasy Series of course). The mute main character is hugely nostalgic for me, personally. The soundtrack really enhances the overall vagueness of the setting and the plot. Speaking of which, I've seen some others complain about the lack of direction in an (impressive) open world. I personally love it.\n\nThe combat is a simplistic "rock-paper-scissors" system but I thoroughly enjoy it so far! I keep catching myself thinking of ways I would have tweaked the combat and the skill system but then I remember that isn't the point of this game. From what I can tell, the point IS the simplicity. I love how casual it is while also providing for interesting encounters. One last note: the turning enemy spawns "on" and "off" with the shrine/pillar things is genius!

But when you get into the game it's just not fun. Every bit of the presentation is cranked to 11 but the story and gameplay get tired near the end. This is a problem I find with a lot of JRPGs but the story seems liked it should have ended a long time before it actually does. If you play this game do yourself a favor and (Spoilers for a RPG maker game no one cares about) after you get back to Karra after treking throughout the Sunken City and kill the white mage just look the ending up on Youtube, it will save you about 6-9 hours of your life (Protip: there is a difference between raising excitment for the final hurdle by pushing it back and delaying the story for a bunch of bull$#!% reasons).","March 26","false","25.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

At times slightly obtuse, it rewards patience and exploration thoroughly. Something like a simple background object can be an interactable bit of lore with a minor experience reward attached. Rich, seemingly hand-painted art and a dynamic, ambient soundtrack completely destroy expectations of what RPGMaker is capable of.\n\nOn the mechanical side, while stats are assigned automatically at level up, the player has a nice variety of choices in regards to which skills to buy with JP, a currency earned upon gaining a level. Nearly all of these skills have an effect on enemies; one might break an armored enemy's defenses and turn him into an "Unarmored Enemy" or a particularly fast enemy into a "Wounded Enemy". This gives battles a more involved feel which is refreshing for a turn based RPG.\n\nWhile I normally ignore RPGMaker games as a whole, I can say this is worth full price. The game's creator has been highly active in addressing the very few issues the game has and patching them. If you are a fan of the JRPG genre at all, the overall experience of The Amber Throne is for you.","July 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The combat itself is your average JRPG flair, if a bit easy (enemies aren't particularly challenging), but it's passable enough and has enough strategy that it's entertaining.

I saw it when it first came out on the Steam new releases page, and after scanning the page decided to take a gamble, it paid off!  Wonderful soundtrack, great world to explore, a good story (so far), eye popping visual style, this is easily one of the better RPG maker games available.  Some of the story moments actually surprised me at how well thought out and executed they are.  There are a few complaints, though:  the battle systm is interesting but many of the status/elemental effects seem inconsistent (or are very poorly explained).  Its not difficult but you honestly just get the impression the game is cheating sometimes because you are never given a detailed description of how the battle mechanics work, stuff just sometimes decides to be super effective or not.  A few of the characters also could hae been fleshed out more (why was Nuo in the party again?  I completely forgot).  All in all this is a breathtaking game to experience and I highly recommend it for those looking for a good JRPG, especially if you are looking for something different.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allthegoodnamestaken/recommended/382380/","allthegoodnamestaken","Allthegoodnamestaken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allthegoodnamestaken/","452 products in account","I can wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone with even a passing interest in JRPG-style games. Steam is loaded with RPG Maker games that rush to compare themselves to Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger at every given opportunity, but The Amber Throne is the exception both in being confident enough to sell itself on its own merits and, ironically, in being brilliant enough to actually deserve mention alongside the classics.\n\nStory:\nThe Amber Throne is the story of an entire world, and as a result the focus is less on the characters that what you'd typically expect from a JRPG-like. The 5 playable characters are all well-written and interesting, but they exist to strength the story of Arra and the planet itself rather than to be traditional leads.\n\nThe story is fond of only telling you what you need to know at any given moment, and it's absolutely loaded with symbolism that only makes sense in context of events you learn about later. It takes effort to fully understand and appreciate at times, but having finished it I can safely say it's among the best RPG stories I've ever played.\n\nGameplay:\nNever the focus of a JRPG, but it's actually pretty good. AT's battle system is an agility-determined turn-based system that sets itself apart by having loads of skills and absolutely no requirements to use them. Initially, this seems like a questionable decision, since you'll only have a handful of abilities and little reason not to just spam the same ones in every fight. Thankfully, it gets much more interesting later on when you have more characters and full ability loadouts for each of them. It's further enhanced by the introduction of enemies that change states both on their own and as a result of the attacks you use. State changes have an accompanying shift in battle sprite and, especially by late game, can force you to adopt a completely different strategy while they're active.\n\nSkills are unlocked by the player. You get 50JP to spend per character with each level up, and since most skills cost 100JP, you effectively get a new skill every two levels. Most characters have 5-6 classes of skills that unlock partially linearly, and there's generally a huge variety between and within character skillsets. Better yet, the game subverts the trope about powerful skills with no actual use. Although some enemies may be more resistant to attacks than others, all skills are usable on every enemy in the game. Even the final boss is vulnerable to your status effects and traps.\n\nBeyond skills, characters are highly customizble through gear and craftable purchasable upgrades. Stat boosts on armor and accessories can be pretty dramatic, so it's possible to significantly alter a character's function in battle with the right gear. The one complaint I have with regard to the combat is that there's no XP leak. I never used the game's final two characters because they were already horribly underleveled by the time I got to them, and there wasn't an easy way of catching them up.\n\nArea progression is almost entirely linear, but individual levels usually have a decent amount to explore, and there are optional dungeons scattered throughout the game. There's apparently even an entire uber-boss quest that I missed entirely. Someone who really went all out on exploration and side content could probably get another 3-4 hours out of the game. There's no real reason to play a second time, but I felt I got more than my money's worth from my ~10 hours.\n\nSound:\nPhenomenal. Every track fits its environment perfectly, and there are a frankly incredible number of them considering the game's price and length. Save for a glitch that occasionally results in area music continuing to play during a battle, I really don't have any to criticize here.\n\nGraphics:\nEqually phenomenal. They combine with the sound to create one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. The screenshots really don't do it justice - there are some incredibly creative and well-realized locales and creatures in this game. Even the good RPG Maker games I've played have always had that "look" that betrayed the engine's identiy, but AT looks truly unique. The art and soundtrack were both done by one person each, amazingly.\n\nAll that being said, I do have one complaint about the graphics: RPG Maker has limitations on the number of frams in character animations, which unfortunately means character motion on the overworld looks a bit silly. Not a big deal, but it stands out when everything else is perfect.\n\nConclusion:\nI haven't been this surprised by a game's quality for years. It's one of the best RPGs on Steam - or any other platform - and thoroughly deserving of your attention. Hopefully we'll see much more from this developer.","September 15, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I haven't played a RPG that has reworded exploration in a long while and thankfully the amber throne scratches that itch, if it is off the beaten path expect to be rewarded. Be it through simple items and experience to entire bits of story details about the world. As far as the combat is concerned there is a neat form mechanic that makes combat a little more engaging then standard RPGs. Some enemies have different attributes that can be effected by your parties special moves, ex being if a enemy has Armour use a defense debuff to remove it. I feel that if a game dosent grab your attention almost immediately then it may not be worth it in the end, but thankfully The Amber Throne quickly grabbed mine and hasn't let go.","September 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
