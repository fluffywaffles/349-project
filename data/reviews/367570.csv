Yes, it's difficult too, but it has a good learning curve and a nice variety of levels to progress through, thankfully it has a very helpful checkpoint mechanic as well.\n\nCurrently oO is incredibly cheap (£0.79 in my case) so I'd definitely recommend picking it up, there are certainly worse things you could be doing with 79p.\n\nThis game would certainly benefit from the addition of a level editor and Steam Achievements, hopefully something for the future.","July 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","58","68","10","0"

It's not the kind of game you think you'll be coming back to, but there is something addictive in it's simplicity and difficulty.\n\nThe concept is as simple as the graphics and the music in this game.  Your a circle, moving inside (or outside) of another another circle.  When you click the mouse, you switch which side of the circle you're in.  Use this simple little ability to move from circle to circle and make a path forward.  Then you start to throw in some spikes and obstacles and the game starts to feel a bit more rewarding.  Then you turn that up to 11 and you're screaming expletives at your computer screen and swearing on your mother's grave you will not be defeated by such a simple concept of a game.  It's fun, addicting, and rewarding.  The visuals are nothing impressive and I preferred to turn the sound off and play my own music, but for $1 it's worth your time.","August 23, 2015","true","0.5"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","0"

This game never gets boring because there's always some randomness which will keep you entertaining.\n\nI've played this game on my Android and am glad they made one for the PC as well. The concept is pretty simple, you have a ball spinning around in the ring and you need to advance by switching from one ring to another where they get connected from.\n\nIt's not just that, each level gets more and more tough as these rings have spikes, they move in a wavy shape, screen angles rotate and some rings will drop in randomly.\n\nPros\nLots and lots of hours of fun\nDifficulty at max\nUnique pattern of gameplay on each level\nMinimal Graphics\nDude, it's just 1$ game (I seriously seriously want that the developer of this game should sell it for 3$ atleast, I won't mind paying even 5$ for such a game honestly)\nCons (Actually none but some suggestions infact)\nLevel editor missing, will be fun to have one\nNeed an endless + random endless mode, not sure if it has one as I've not completed the game on my phone\nCan improve graphics\nIncrease the damn price xD\nAgain, great piece of work, thanks for making this game.","July 9, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

At least, I didn't have much trouble getting through it, but I don't cringe or get emotional when I die.\n\nIt's pretty clean, and for the price if you like your one button games, then you can safely enjoy a few hours with this.\n\nI wish the music was catchier, it's too ambient for my tastes, and I feel like some  rhythm could be a nice addition. I liked the trippy levels for the visual effect, but don't see the allure of playing them per se.\n\nIt's a case of a game that delivers whats on the tin.

Even though it does a few neat things in terms of level design, the lack of any other interesting mechanincs makes traveling  through these interesting levels really boring. Soundtrack is mediocre and visuals are simple yet pleasing. One thing i noted whilst playing the 2nd level was what SEEMED like input lag, where i hit spacebar and the related action would happen 0.5 seconds later. In a  game that requires split second reactions in order to proceed, this is a major drawback.\n\nSummary:\nMechanics - Only one mechanic that's incorperated well into the level design.\nSoundtrack - Nothing amazing, but it's not bad\nVisuals - Simple stuff, nothing amazing\nFinal opinion - Wouldn't recomend this game unless you literally have nothing else to do","October 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

But while things may look easy enough at first glance, the challenge comes in mastering the sparse mechanics you are given to get past whatever sadistic obstacles oO's glowing, circular world cares to throw in your direction.\n\nWith ever more complex patterns to overcome and a faster and faster rate of play, the simple "push space to flip" mechanic might only be one button but will eventually build to challenge even the fastest of reflexes. You will die again, and again, and again and again, and again, and again, and again, and again; but unlike some other punishing titles of similar ilk, the deaths here don't tend to feel cheap. Instead, your deaths will give you new crumbs of information that'll not only help you get past the obstacle you're stuck on, but will make understanding and passing later ones a lot easier - especially if you want to try one of the optional modes.\n\noO has four main levels, with four optional "drunk" levels and two endless modes which are again normal and drunk. Minimalistic, punishing games like this aren't often to everyone's liking, but I'm a huge fan of 'em and always gun for total completion before moving on. I'm currently on the final drunk level and am slowly going insane trying to complete it - but mental stability aside, oO is a fantastic little entry to the "easy to learn, punishing to master" genre, and I hugely recommend it.\n\nSo! With all the familiarities out of the way, I guess there's only one question left to ask you:\nAre you ready to die?","January 24","true","10.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They must be difficult.\n2. They must make the player feel like they can clear each stage/board/level, even if it takes 500 attempts.\n3. They must strike a balance between the following reactions: (a) Oh, come on -- I totally]/i] landed one pixel to the left! (b) Oh, I timed that just a little wrong. (c) Oh my god. I can't believe I just did that. My incompetence is hilarious.\n\nOo strikes this balance perfectly. Reflexes, pattern recognition, and tiny bits of critical thinking all combine to make for a beautifully infuriating experience. The wavy boards are just silly, but I don't think they're required.\n\nThe music is decent, although I wish I could turn it down without turning it off.

Solid soundtrack that fits well with the game.\n8/10\n\nFull Review:\n\n~ Description ~\n\noO is a 2D game where you're a ball on the perimeter of a circle, and with a click you switch from either going around the inside of the circle or the outside. This is used to travel between circles and progress through the levels and to avoid spikes on your way.\n\n~ Gamemodes ~\n\n4 levels of increasing difficulty and new obstacles every level.\nEndless mode, which gets harder as you go on, and every circle you progress through increases your score by one.\nBonus versions of each level, where everything has a wobbly effect, causing it to look like the ball is speeding up/slowing down, but it's still moving at the same consistent speed as in the normal levels.\n~ Pros! ~\n\nI picked up the game for only $0.89 when it was on sale\nGood music that didn't get annoying throughout multiple hours of playtime.\nAmazing level design and cycles that are easy to understand but hard to master\nVery simple controls. Literally one button. (Space bar or Left Click)\nWhen you die, you go back to the most recent checkpoint, and it restarts the cycle at a specific point, which makes the game far less frustrating than it may first seem.\n~ Meh's... ~\n\nI feel like the game scammed me a few times when switching from circle to circle, but that's probably just me trying to find an excuse to say it wasn't me.\nWhen you use the menu button in the upper left corner while in a level, your ball switches sides of the circle before the menu pops up. It's a minor bug but it can screw you over sometimes.\nNo way to save your progress mid-level, but it doesn't really matter since the levels are somewhat short and can be done pretty quickly if you have practice and you know what you're doing.\n~ Cons! ~\n\nThere are only four levels, plus the Endless mode, and no level creator/editor, making the game quite short.\nThe game may trigger motion sickness on the later levels if you're a bit sensitive to it.\n~ Achievements ~\n\nThere are 6 achievements, one for beating each of the main levels, one for hitting a score of 15 in Endless, and one for hitting a score of 100 in Endless.\n\nIt may be due to my lack of experience in the game and/or just sucking at it in general, but hitting a score of 100 in Endless seems practically impossible to me at the moment.\n\n~ Conclusion ~\n\nIf you really want the game, you can go ahead and pick it up for the full $3, but I would honestly wait for it to go on sale at least a little before getting it. I picked it up at the end of the Steam Winter Sale for just $0.89 and I'd consider that absolutely worth it.\n\nThe game itself is pretty entertaining and also got intense for the last two levels. Easy to pick up, difficult to master.","February 1","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In where you have to use second timing in order to advance through the circles. Left click where the two circles combine, and advance, all while avoiding spikes and red spikes. and blue moving spikes. You can also invert yourself outside of the circles in order to dodge spikes and other objects, but there's really only spikes.\nThe regular levels play the same just get harder with time, and while challenging, quite short.\nThe distorted levels are just the same levels as their counterparts just distorted to make the level a lot harder. It's actually quite difficult to progress when the circles are basically jelly.\nThe heat level is moving from circle to circle as fast as you can while running away from a red bar. That's why I call it 'heat'. You only get one life so it's basically a test to see how quickly and efficiently you can move without messing up or getting consumed. And the distorted level is once again the same thing, but the circles are jelly.\nThis is basically the game, I played the kongregate version a little bit, but google changed some stuff and now I can't run kongregate games without firefox. It's basically the same thing, but one level.\nSo this game is just a basic 'pick me up for a dollar' game. It's fun for a couple of hours, but the only replayability is getting 0 deaths in all levels, or trying to get a super high score in the heat levels.\nBuy it if you want, but it's nothing exiciting.","August 9, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
