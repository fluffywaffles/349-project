It has super retro graphics, music and style - but a very modern foundation. On the PC it's not going to scratch any deep desire for gameplay, but it is still a fun and simple game to kill some time if you're not looking to do anything serious.\n\nYou have three abilities, attack, defend and use an item. Everything else is basic timing (dodging attacks, avoiding their defenses, finding weak spots), collecting loot (you can only wear one piece of equipment), potions (you can carry one) and gold, buying gear and unlocking new passive abilities. There are three classes with a different passive tree that bring different strengths/weaknesses. It sounds absurdly basic and it is, but it's a nice dose of old-school fun.\n\nSome of the boss fights are actually suprisingly challenging despite the basic abilities and you will die - at least whilst figuring out their moves and timing. Death is not permanent and in the PC game has no real serious setbacks except for your time and frustration; you can revive and restart the dungeon but will lose your hard earned loots that you have on you. In the iOS game you had to pay microtransactions to revive and death was a costly endeavour which really upped the frustration.\n\nIt is ultimately a game that's designed for the casual mobile platform - meant to provide a small dose of entertainment whilst you're bored or travelling, not hours of deep gameplay. I would still recommend it, but people should be aware of that before buying.\n\nPersonally, I like it. It's simple, it's fun, it's addictive and although I think that it is a game well suited to the mobile market, paying $5 for the full game with zero microtransactions is worth it.","October 15, 2014","true","3.9"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","63","69","0","1"

It appears that it used to contain microtransactions for extra lives / equipment. But now that those are gone for PC, they didn't rebalance it in any meaningful way. I would never have purchased this (even for a dollar on humble) had I realized that. You have to grind everything.\n\nYou tap to attack, tap to defend, or hold tap to do a charge up move. It's a memory thing more or less about when you can sneak in your hits based on how you saw them attack before. If you win, you go down one level and fight another ememy. Pick up an item here and there, get currency. If you die you lose your stuff. Again, the game looks like it was designed around forcing you to lose your stuff every once and awhile and having to get it back through micros. Which you can't do here. So grind grind grind.\n\nPresentation is kind of cool if you're into retro. That element is well done, but shallow.

In other words, it can be challenging.\n\nCould be better:\n> Option to Mute the whole game (you can disable the music, but the SFX keeps playing);\n> Indicator of how many levels each dungeon has. If the idea is to make it a 'surprise', then let it be visible after the dungeon is beaten;\n> A Warning telling me that I WILL lose all my stuff if I opt to leave the dungeon.

But not necessarily if I want to leave it.\n\nEdit:\nOn my original review I'd stated that having a Windowed Mode would be nice. Now it does have! Thanks, devs!\n\nAll in all, it's a good $4 game.

With that said 2 hours on Deep Dungeons of Doom was a good experience for me especially since the price is rather cheap as well.\n\nGame Info  Name: Deep Dungeons of Doom\nGenre: Dungeon Crawling, Timing, RPG, Comedy\nPersonal Verdict: Good honest fun. Short enough to pick and play.\n\nReview Starting Deep Dungeons of Doom, a nostalgic take timing based dungeon crawling where missing a time attack for the critical hit means being on the receiving end of heavy damage. Then again any mistakes you make are entirely your fault in this game since the AI only controls the enemies and controls are responsive and simple with only 2 buttons needed for everything.\n\nStory\nThere is not much story to be told in Deep Dungeons of Doom and whatever story it has is told mainly as an excuse to get the main cast together to go to the DEEP DUNGEON OF DOOM. Basically that yeah!\n\nGraphic\nNice pixel art graphic it packs. Cutscene are told through the old style that is like the ones you can find in the old 90s adventure CD game. Sprites for monster and character are easily seen through the backdrop and spells and projectile uses bright colour so you will never ever miss them. Unless you dun goof.\n\nSound\nDDoD has a beaty soundtrack that changes based on the dungeons, make sense really since this is a timing based game so having something beaty to keep track of while you shake your head to it is a nice touch.\n\nGameplay\nAnd here is where the game shines.\n\nLong story short you will only use 2 buttons in this game. Left and right button that can be easily configure. Left invokes your shield which completely negates damage on a successful block and right which is the attack button with the ability to deal critical damage should you get right before the enemy execute his attacks.\n\nEssentially you and your enemy has a little bar for each defend and attack and once its filled you can then jolly use them. There's a strategic element where pressing the attack button just as it blinks allows you to halfed the time required for charging. Enemies are no slouch either. The first few dungeons are easy as heck but later one test your timing ability to the max since the enemies can block your attack, Fun. Oh yeah, holding your attack button till it blinks allows you to use a character special ability.\n\nThere are 3 heroes with three different playstyle. Knight with his tough health, healing ability and normal strike. Witch with her mana regenerating ability and oh i don't know i never used witch. Rogue has the lowest health, fastest strike and highest critical. Each of them can be upgraded through gold you obtain through the dungeons at altar.\n\nSpecial events can happen as you traverse the dungeons which range from finding altar, chests and equipment. Often time they are a gamble since you don't really know what you will get till you do it.\n\nTo accomodate the RPG system each character can hold 2 item, a consumable and a equipment slot that provides passive bonuses to your character. It can however has a debuff as well. Mix and match.\n\nClearing a dungeon is a simple thing as killing every single enemy in it before facing the boss monster. Afterward you may try again to grind for more gold to upgrade.\n\nConclusion\nA great game with minimal skills but high ceiling. DDoD love to give you a surprise pattern and completely demolishing your training. Then it proceeds to force you to restart but thats part of the charm really.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A Rank\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

It's probably the kind of game you'll want to play in mobile devices, rather than in your PC, but at the end of the day it's still fun, despite its flaws. In other words, although I can't say it's the great game I thought it was gonna be, I've still played it for many hours, as you can see. I recommend it, but not 100%. After some fine-tuning, this game could become something a lot nicer, no doubt.\n\nPros:\nGorgeous pixel graphics\nBGM is varied enough for a grindy game and they all sound really nice with their retro style\nMore than 10 unique dungeons, each with its monsters and secrets\nNice skill trees for each of the 3 characters that you can always change if you wanna try different strategies\nThe gameplay is not as brainless as it may seem and I got really addicted to it\nBeating different monsters require different strategies, which is great\nBoss fights are also very interesting\nCons:\nIt's insanely grinding--you barely get any money, drop rates for some items are extremely low, and it all seems like an excuse to pretend there's more content. Ok, the game IS about grinding, but the grinding should be a lot more rewarding\nMost of the secrets are really obscure--some of them I got by chance, other I had to look up in a guide (and, after doing so, I'm glad I did)\nA lot of things are never explained in the game and you'll probably visit the forums a lot more than you'd like to\nOther things are just useless, like the encyclopaedia (doesn't help, could have location and drop info) and the shops on the main map (never used those)\nDefinitely not playtested enough. Some people report bugs that, had I experienced them, I would probably need to start the game over. As of now, I didn't face any game-breaking bugs, but it definitely needs some polishing and fine-tuning (devs, if you're reading this, I'd be glad to get into more details)\nBought on: I got it as a Xmas gift from Shadow! Thanks a lot for these 28 hours of fun and some frustration =)\nIt's currently 50% off, going for US$ 2.49 (R$ 5,24). It's not an expensive game, but I'd wait a bit more for possible updates, unless you buy it to play it on your mobile while taking the subway or something like that.","December 30, 2014","true","29.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","3"

It's just a minor glitch towards post-combat cleanup for gameplay objects and all that. It's perfectly playable and everything happens as it should.\n\nOverall, 9/10 will play later once I get some studying in.","October 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","32","43","0","0"

You attack and you can't block in time, you block and... you get where I'm going. So you have to play through it over and over to learn every enemies attack patterns and timing because there's no real doing it on the fly. Then some enemies have multiple attacks with the same kick off graphic so its just pot luck, one or two unlucky guesses and you have to start again, skill isn't an element and neither is fun.\n\nNext is luck, well more luck, you need a decent item to hit up any of the bigger dungeons and buying them isn't really an option so grind for luck! You get lucky enough to get one lets hope you don't die as you pretty much loose everything, You can take just 10% of your gold and walk (which equals alot of runs for a simple skill upgrade) or you can enter a lottery to win back some low level items or 50% of your gold but still be locked in the dungeon.

What makes each adventure worth taking are the steps we take and paths we follow along the way. And Deep Dungeons of Doom follows a path I don't think I've ever quite seen before. Unlike most dungeon crawling RPGs, Deep Dungeons of Doom cuts immediately to the chase. Rather than skulking around corridors kicking barrels and waiting for random encounters, you are dropped straight in a battle situation the moment you enter your first dungeon.\n\nEach of Deep Dungeons of Doom's dungeons is a sort of mini RPG plot unto itself. Exploring a cursed monastery, rescuing a young woman captured by a demonic polar bear, and slaying a legendary sewer monster are only a few examples. Rather than wandering through a maze or trudging through caves filled with random encounters, each of the three unlockable characters (Crusader, Mercenary, Witch) will systematically move from floor to floor. Sometimes they'll encounter priests to bless them with stat boosts, other times they might find an altar that will restore their health. Most of the time, though, they'll have a fight on their hands. The combat is a simple system of tapping one button to attack and another to defend, but it becomes a bit more complex when trying to read enemy movements to predict attacks and avoid getting blocked.\n\nDeep Dungeons of Doom is a rather simplified and arcade-like approach to an action RPG, but it's balanced surprisingly well. Levels and buffs are tied to each dungeon, so once it's finished the character resets to almost zero. However, any items or gear that are found will remain. Other incremental upgrades can be earned and bought by discovering altars at the end of certain levels and then paying for the new-found ability. These changes are permanent, so long as they're enabled, and will affect the adventurer throughout each stage. It's a series of light RPG and equipment systems that are just simple enough to compliment the two-button gameplay, yet deep enough to warrant plenty of attention.\n\nThough its visuals might be basic, there is both novelty and nuance beneath Deep Dungeons of Doom's blocky exterior. There's real satisfaction to be found in the combat, and a decent amount of environments and enemies to explore and conquer. Provided you don't mind the difficulty then you'll discover that these dungeons do go surprisingly deep.","September 27, 2015","true","22.4"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","19","26","3","4"

Basically a rhythym/QTE-type combat system (you whack 'em or you block 'em when the time is right) that gets padded by light RPG-elements and bits of Rogue-ish fun. Comes with a humorous oldschool fantasy-storyline about demonic forces, revenge and girly first names. Pick one of three characters with different skills and fight your way through various screens either achieving victory by ascending/descending to the final floor or die trying.\n\nIt's minimalistic / simplistic but quite charming and more complex than one would think at first. The game is really quick and excellent for short sessions, but offers enough variety thanks to unlockable skills, various weapons and armor (of which you can only bring one!) and of course all kinds of potions and dark altars that make you more powerful or actually hurt your character. There may be a certain randomness to item-drops and enemies encountered, but the battle-system is a nice, oldschool affair. Learn patterns, exploit patterns and march to victory. Knowing when to block and when to attack is crucial, and items as well as the aforementioned skills can alter your playstyle a fair bit.\n\nIt's just a good old time wrapped in a splendid presentation with amazing pixelart and a fitting medieval chiptune soundtrack.

The review describes my expression of the game and nothing more than that. Thanks.\n\n"Have you ever heard of Dark Souls? Not really, I'm still trying to master DDD. What's DDD? Oh, you would be better not asking." What a horrific game it is, indeed. Beware, fellow achievement hunters, as you may never be sane again after completing all the challenges Dungeons offers you to.\n\nSkipping the lyrical part, I can say with confidence that Deep Dungeons of Doom is pretty much worth your time, of course unless you are willing to get 100% completion (then read above). Who would know that a tiny mobile game can actually be such an eminent gem?\n\nDon't be fooled by poor presentation, - behind seemingly plain sprite graphics (which is super neat though!) hides amazing art, pleasing animations, peculiar characters/bosses, quirky jests and hours, many hours of fun. Soundtrack is catchy and doesn't make you quirl in agony like some titles do even after repeating same levels dozens of times.\n\nYou start with a trivial "one day in one kingdom/land/realm there was great evil and heroes to beat its fifth point" and set off a journey to gain fame, earn gold, allure maidens and grind , grind a damn lot a bit too. We have three heroes in party (while there are two from the beginning, third joins the "batallion of light" soon after) with each possessing not so variative, but still unique gameplay style as you will need to adjust item build and fighting strategy to fit the hero/'milieu' (environment) dogma. Also, you can only fight with one hero of your choice while standing versus just one enemy at once, entering tower/bunker type level and then descending deeper/going higher between layers.\n\nIn order to progress steadily and succeed, it is required to either loot or buy new items and consumables or level up your heroes with earned gold. However, what is quite notable, even your inventory gear are basically consumable items since you will lose your every possesion upon meeting death (there are tokens to ressurect, but just a little of them and they are being given rather rarely for meeting certain hidden criteria on each level).\n\nA pleasant fact and as was mentioned previously, we can complete each level or so called "dungeon" in two ways: the common and a hidden, for which you will need to perform a certain action or bring something and finish the stage carrying it.\n\nTechnically, I haven't encountered any bugs or issues in particular while game was running smooth and stable on every possible platform (well, so far I only tested it on a desktop PC and Mac Air). If you have a portable device with Steam available, this game would be a good choice by matters of fun time/ "battery loyal" too.\n\nAlright, no more hiding here, if you plan to master in perfection the Dungeons, you might need to store some snacks, decent music (OST is fine, but still isn't enough for long sessions), natural luck [I'm serious about that] and patience - a lot of patience. Despite all that, you definitely won't be bored soon enough - DDD is fairly good at keeping the pace and can serve a perfect joy bringer & time killer through several evenings.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n8 "I can't bear it any longer, let me die already" Ancile Guards out of 10.

The plot is straight out of a classic table top campaign from the early days of D&D, Forgotten Realms, Warhammer, etc. The theme is very gothic, grungy and brutal, from the backgrounds to the enemies, everything fitting in nicely.\n\nSo why don't I recommend this game? Because the gameplay falls flat. The controls are simple, which is normally great, except that every character basically plays the same, and the strategy for beating each mob doesn't vary much from character to character. The equipment system is also unrewarding as once you find a decent item for one of your two slots, you're going to be hanging on to it for literally most of the game. Moreover, it's hard to decipher what's going on with the retry screen without looking it up. There's soo many mobs that are unintuitive and need to be fought in a specific way which is at times VERY frustrating to try to determine. You will die a lot just because you don't know what to do. And looking it up is not satisfying.\n\nNow, if there was more going on with the gameplay, I could see how people could try to claim this was just a Knights of Pen and Paper clone, but at the same time, the art, hardboiled plot, the grizzled monsters and action-style of gameplay would convince me and others otherwise. There was and is still a lot of potential here for future titles. But this one isn't fun. So skip this one and look at the next one.","November 12, 2014","false","2.1"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","32","55","0","2"

Gameplay itself is as simple as pie; attack at the appropriate cues, block damage depending on what signals your enemies give you, use potions and whatnot, etc. all of which is done with just a few keys. Nonetheless, combat is quick-paced and quite fun, there's plenty of variety and diversity to flesh things out, and it's overall an excellent dungeon crawler.

This comes into play for every fight.The mobs themselves have attack patterns that you will need to learn so know when to attack/defend. Evasion and counter attacking are present in the game as well.\n\nYou have 3 characters to choose from each their own skill trees that you buy your skills with gold earned.You can buy armor,weps,potions,accessories but the game does a good job with giving you drops as you do dungeons.You are retricted to 2 slots, one for armor/wep/accessory, the other for hp,mana, and buff items. The armor & accessories themselves oftem come with attack or magic attack bonuses plus your characters skills do more then make up for other stats.\n\nDespite its looks the game is a gem, I have not beat the game since I enjoy going to old dungeons just for the fighting and to get gold to get skills for my chars (want to unlock all their skills).The game is chucked full of achievements that are fun and ingame achievements which change as you achieve one.\n\nGet it if you like rogue-like-lites and pure dungeon fun.","May 13, 2015","true","18.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/325090/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","ThemeDeep Dungeons of Doom has no noteworthy story as it is not the main focus of the game. Graphically, the environments look nice, although I'm personally not a big fan of the character and monster art. To me, it feels like the art is stuck between the Atari-age and the NES or SNES sprite art where simplicity was a necessity, not a choice. The color palette is too rich for the former, while the graphical design is too simple for the latter. As a result, this graphical style comes over as lazy or lacking skill, rather than retro. The graphical style does not hamper the gameplay elements, though, which is most important. If you enjoy this quasi-retro pixel art style, you may well enjoy the graphics offered by this game.\n\nGameplayGameplay is marked by simplicity both through its learning curve as well as its depth in progression. The entirety of gameplay consists out of repeated 1 versus 1 battles with an attrition mechanic. You enter a dungeon and fight 1 monster per floor (or receive a random bonus, purchase a temporary item, or get some dialogue). During combat you pay attention to enemy attack cues, so you can block their attacks and retaliate when it is safe. Other than being able to use a consumable, there is nothing more to it than that. As you progress to a dungeon, your character levels up and you assign attributes. While the mechanic seems clever at first (as you start at level 1 at the beginning of every dungeon), as you expect to finetune your character for each dungeon specifically, you'll quickly notice that you're always running with the same build anyway, taking away from the variation that it would otherwise offer. Thus, the idea behind this mechanic is great, but its implementation is lackluster.\n\nCompleting a dungeon provides you with gold for temporary or permanent upgrades, character or skill-tree unlocks, and new dungeon unlocks. You advance by spending gold, gained through achievements and dungeon completion. If you die you end up losing most of your gold, resulting in the game becoming very grindy.\n\nWhile the simple mechanics are charming, they don't provide consistently fun entertainment. Enemy variety is largely only on a graphical level, making the gameplay become boring rather fast.\n\nUsing only your D (attack), A (block), and C (view character sheet) keys the Deep Dungeons' controls are as simple as the rest of the game. Timing your input is essential for beating the game, and in that department the controls aren't lacking.\n\nDifficultyDeep Dungeons'  difficulty requires a separate header, as it needs to be pointed out that it is entirely artificial. Rather than having to deal with difficult scenarios through variation in monster attacks and more, the real difficulty is in attrition. Your health is a commodity that does not automatically refill, resulting in minor mistakes piling up. The further you advance through the game, the longer the dungeons will become. As a result, small mistakes are more likely to happen. This makes the game feel very frustrating.\n\nDeath causes you to lose a large chunk of your progression, and as such the game's difficulty is not entertaining, but irritating and pointless. The penalty can be mitigated through some rare resurrection item, which looks like a microtransaction remnant from the mobile version that has not been phased out of the PC version. As a result, the game is more difficult than originally intended - and the original intention was to slap some microtransaction money out of you to make the game less of a grind.\n\nConclusionDeep Dungeons primary intention is to be a mobile platform cashcow for selling afforementioned resurrection items. The simplicity both in its artstyle and gameplay is not done out of some statement, but to put forth as little effort in order to get as much money. While the money-grabbing aspects of a microtransaction store are not present on the PC version, the game has not been modified to reflect this. As a result, it is a cheap and simple port - again intended to grab some more money while it lasts.\n\nThe grinding is frustrating and irritating, without any redeeming factors making it worth doing so. The developers have opted for simplicity in every single department, resulting in a game that is only entertaining for the first five minutes.\n\nAvoid this game.","March 25, 2015","false","1.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/recommended/325090/","dtox508","d.Tox508","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/","217 products in account","First off, this game met one of my prerequisites immediately: Looking like it was made in 1991 for MS-DOS or the Commadore 64, and this game fits it better than a condom. This Android port originally made for tablets, despite what some may say in forums, is a great port to PC and although simple, is still incredibly fun. Initially the graphics reminded me a lot of a recent release called “Ultionus” but the gameplay however is incredibly unique. Deep Dungeons of Doom takes a bunch of elements and blends them all together to create a playing experience like no other. I love everything from the painstakingly perfect pixel graphics,  intense and spectacular soundtrack, all the way down to the deep, rich and in-depth story straight out of the times of King Arthur.\n\nDeep Dungeons of Doom is what I would call a “Timing Based” dungeon crawler. Meaning you can’t move your character on the screen and you only have 3 actions, attack, block, and use item. Simple and straight forward controls, my only complaint would be the lack of controller support, but I can only hope that will come in the future. Starting out is pretty basic, but it takes a short period of play to get the timing down for blocking and attacking enemies. You face your opponent in a turn based style, but battle is very much real-time. Seemingly simple at first, Deep Dungeons of Doom ends up turning into an involved and intricate game that continues to keep your mind at work and make good use of your keyboard skills. You can cause extra damage if you attack an enemy while they are attacking, but be aware; it works both ways, so watch out. The fighting isn’t as cut and dry as it seems. During boss battles, like the first dungeons boss Pitch Black, you need to learn his secret before being able to inflict any damage. Each enemy has a unique attack and block pattern, so stay on those toes and attack when they aren’t blocking, and block while the enemy is attacking.\n\nYou will meet monsters and you will need skill and tactics to defeat them. You will find weird and wonderful treasures along the way. Most will help you, but some might not. You may choose to play as a Crusader, a Witch or a Mercenary – in fact each one might well be required if you are to successfully complete your quest – but knowing when to use each one is something you are going to have to figure out for yourself. – Deep Dungeons of Doom\n\nThe whole point of the game is to clear dungeons and build the characters stats with special items and skills. After completing the first dungeon you are given missions to complete with the Crusader. Once the first dungeon is cleared you are then able to view the map, this is where you can visit the shops and are able to purchase potions and upgrade your skills. The first skill upgrade for the Crusader is “Holier Than Thou” which gives you +5% Miracle Heal & +1HP. In the dungeons you find Altars, these Altars are where you exchange gold for enhancements. Usable items make up a large part of gameplay and are essential to success… most of the time. Some items like “Contract of The Vampire” that gives you +1HP & deals +2 normal damage to your opponent have nothing but positive effects, but others like “Devils Contract” where on use you pay 8HP but receive +60% resistance to all, +6 attack & +6 agility for 3 floors have some negative effects as well. There are also equipable items found in random chests after you defeat an enemy in a dungeon, or in shops when on the map. Items such as “Sturdy Sword” gives +1 attack while equipped, or even better “Ring of Magic Cure” which requires 2 magic but gives +2HP per floor. With continued gameplay you unlock 2 other playable characters, also upgradable. This gives the game a bit more “depth”, using magic with the Witch and swift moves with the Mercenary, combining items with the heroes passive skills makes for an even better chance of victory.\n\nThe soundtrack stays true to the 8 bit era, composed with astonishing perfection. Songs don’t get overly boring or repetitive they actually keep you interested and are pretty catchy fitting the game perfectly. Graphically Deep Dungeons of Doom is brilliant with incredible pixel art capturing the essence of the original games we call retro that paved the path before it. The cut scenes are awesome with beautiful 8 bit graphics to tell its incredible and strong story line. The death animations are on point, imaginative and gorey as hell. I don’t usually promote games made for the tablet and ported to the PC, but in this case, its was done perfectly. I’ll be honest, I had no clue this was originally Android based that’s how good the gameplay in Deep Dungeons of Doom is. This is an incredibly fun game, and for the price completely worth it. Not only does it have several hours of gameplay, but the “replay factor” on this game is huge, because remember those dungeons do get deep.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nPlayability: 7/10\nStory: 9/10\nChallenge: 7/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","November 2, 2014","true","10.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I'm enjoying it enough that only 2 hours or so in, I'm giving it a recomendation.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple. Left blocks, Right attacks, and Space uses your item. You battle one enemy per floor using these simple controls. There's more to the battles than that though. After you attack you must wait a small amount of time before attacking again and there's a fraction of a second window at the end of the cooldown to "combo" which if you hit the cooldown will only be 1/3 as long! Or if you attack just as the enemy is telegraphing its attack you will do 2x damage, but recieve their attack as normal.\n\nYour character can only equip/hold 2 items. A peice of worn gear that buffs/debuffs certain stats or has certain effects like +1 HP/MP per floor or drain them usually for a benefit. The other slot is for potions (hp/mp), scrolls, wands are things I've found so far. It's a tough decision to what to have what to leave behind.\nThankfully if you leave a potion on one floor you can go back up and grab it / swap items. Except if you buy something from the vending machines you sometimes find, then the item you already had vanishes. You have a chest to store items from the map screen if you don't like the item(s) you currently have on the hero you want to use. This is a great surprise to me for a game like this, I'm happy they inluded it.\n\nDuring the life of your hero you will level up and level ups keep between dungeons until you die. When you level, you select one of four stats to raise: Health (Max HP), Magic (Max MP), Agility (how fast you can attack again), and Attack (Damage).\n\nWhen you die you lose your levels, both items, and any money you found during this dungeon. You can choose to retry the dungeon with the same character and get a chance to respawn with various different items or buffs, and one slot on the wheel is a revive that brings you back with your previous gear... but one slot you get nothing.\n\nBetween dungeons you can permanently upgrade your heroes passive abilities with gold or buy items, so there is a sense of becoming more powerfull outside of the leveling sytem. There are three columns of upgrades, only one unlocked at start, you progress through a few levels to gain access to the other two, and you may have one trait selected per tier from them.

There is exactly the right amount of story and humor, enough to be noticeable but not enough to become obnoxious.\n\nThe meat of the game - the game-play and mechanics - are, surprisingly, as advertised: really simple, yet simultaneously hard to master. The initial 2-3 dungeons do a good job in familiarizing the player with the way that the game handles. After that, the user is thrown into the deep water. Player not only has to time his actions (attack, block, special slow power or consumable use) really precise (but not too precise, luckily) but also memorize the action sequences for each enemy, in order to beat each dungeon, or be forced to go through it again, from a start.\n\nA challenging game, overall, best enjoyed in short bursts, in my honest opinion. Worth the asking price. For me, it turned out to be one of those rare surprises that can, out of the blue, bring back the simple joy of playing a game ;)","January 16, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

DDD is in some ways a tribute (or parody for the cynical observer) as it pokes fun at dungeon crawlers and what is usually found in games of the type. Even the plot is filled with it, there is a crusader who wants to bring an end to the evil and along the way he meets a shadowy mercenary and a pretty witch.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, as DDD is obviously developed for a more casual style of play. It is after all available for handheld devices using Android and iTunes, and it shows. You choose either the Crusader, Witch or Mercenary, then enter a dungeon and you fight a single monster on each level, till you face the boss of that particular dungeon. On the PC version, you have a few keys for Attack, Defend and Use which is all you need to play the game. The game revolves around you watching your enemy (there are many types) and remembering cues which show that they're going to attack. You have to then pick the right time to attack, defend and also to counter, which does double the amount of damage you normally do. Simple, right? However, as you unlock more dungeons and face more difficult enemies, the cues become harder to observe and the much tougher enemies will not only hit harder but faster as well. Bosses also cannot be defeated by normal means and you'll have to either spot or figure out their weaknesses.\n\nEnemies drop random items ranging from potions to items like armor or weapons that give your three heroes the edge along with gold that comes from a treasure box behind each enemy on each level. Gold can either be used to buy items at shops or upgrades. Another aspect of gameplay is the secret rooms that generate randomly in dungeons. Sometimes, you'll find a devillish merchant or a vending machine but the most common one would be statues that give different sorts of blessings that would help your chosen hero in that particular dungeon.\n\nDDD's art is very simple and pixelly like the games of old but that actually suits the game's somewhat silly atmosphere and the soundtrack is surprisingly good. For a game of its price, it is a great boon. If you're looking for something a little simpler that doesn't stress your PC out, Deep Dungeons of Doom is more than worth it. I also recommend purchasing the game on iTunes or Google Play so that you can play the game on the go.","January 17, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Very oldschool fashioned. You have like 5 min or 3 hours to loose? Go in there, deeper and deeper!

Sound can be a little dull when you listen it for like a hundred of times but it build up that climate of old games.\n\nThere are some cons as well. Mechanics shows its weakness when you delve into the last dungeon, that's the biggest one. Grinding! Damn, you need to grind as a pro to earn something and it can be really boring sometimes. A pain in the A*s.\n\nSo, buy or not? Of course you want to play it! Just watch for a price drop and get it.

The other item is a passive.\nYou will find merchants/altars/vendors and you may want to use it - it's not always safe however.\n\nThere are also missions in the game - you might want to see this as a side-quest for extra rewards.\nYou can also unlock new characters with different stats.\n\nEach level has their own kind of a story and effects.\n\nThere is also a "perk level system", you can buy those to equip the current hero with new stats or effects.\n\nOnce you are dead - you can try to buy back urself into the game and get some of your loot back.

It's hard to describe DDD's combat experience with words, but I can say that it scales very well as you progress through the game. While the controls never change (press right to attack and left to defend), the game begins to add in mechanics that require situational awareness in order to complete more difficult levels, such as timing your attacks in order to get an attack speed boost or watching enemy cues to defend against particularly deadly attacks.\n\nThe thing that makes the whole of DDD so satisfying for me is that you don't defeat harder enemies by levelling up or unlocking passive talents (though there is a cool talent tree feature), you defeat harder enemies by getting better at the game, and the game uses enemies to teach you important tactics that you'll use to defeat bosses.\n\nIt's an action-packed arcade-style game that can easily be picked up, put down, and then picked up again whenever you want.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/325090/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Deep Dungeons of Doom is a casual mobile title ported to PC by Bossa Studios, responsible for "viral" games like Surgeon Simulator and I Am Bread.\n\nThat first sentence is key - this is a mobile title with slightly higher than usual production values. It is not some deep, dark dungeon delving title, it is a phone game and comes with all of the caveats of a phone game, caveats that make it extremely hard to recommend this title to anyone.\n\nBiggest caveat of them all is the sheer lack of content.\n\nFirst things first - the gameplay is fun. It plays on the established "Punch-Out!" formula of reading enemy telegraphs, reacting with a block and then responding with an attack. There are some other elements - you're able to "charge" your attack to different effects and can bring an item into the dungeons, but those amount to little more than superficial additions.\n\nWhile it does have the usual touchscreen-to-cursor conversion for the interface, the actual battles themselves are able to be played with a keyboard and are better for it, it's just a shame (and somewhat confusing) that the game doesn't have full keyboard support.\n\nAesthetically it's played out - low resolution pixel art, but the animation carries it to an extent. While what's there looks good, the sheer lack of content means you'll be seeing the same few backgrounds and the same few enemies time and time again.\n\nThis comes back to that caveat.  Deep Dungeons of Doom has very, very little content. About 2 hours worth, give or take. And attempting to explore the limitations or post-game of DDD means you'll be grinding that same 2 hours for 20 hours, give or take. There's no remixed dungeons, no different patterns, every enemy generally performs 2 actions and both are incredibly easy to spot.\n\nFor a dungeon delver with so little content, the balancing is atrocious. Most of the post-game content is just finding out how useless the Mercenary is and how overbearingly powerful the Witch is (complete with a 3x damage multiplayer).\n\nThe bulk of the post-game is grinding pre-existing, 2 minute long dungeons for frustratingly rare drops and an Endless Dungeon that doesn't use any of the altered patterns or even half the bosses, leading to one of the most mind-numbing experiences I've ever had in a videogame.\n\nThis was not exciting.\nThis was not satisfying.\nThis was not fun.\n\nIt might be missing the point to attempt and evaluate Deep Dungeons of Doom on any merits beyond what it is - a casual mobile game to be played and dropped within 3 hours.\n\nHaving attempted anyway, it can safely be said that there are no merits behind that casual waste of time and attempting to treat this as anything else will lead to pure disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but people looking for a specifically casual title.","December 19, 2015","false","23.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You fight countless enemies, but one at a time. It's cooldown-based game, where you and the enemy have a specific time before you can attack and block.

Usually when I have time to game, it's not hours and hours of time, but more like ten minute spurts where I'm able to sit down and play. Because of this, I love a lot of games that don't offer much plot, and allow for quick sessions of in-and-out gameplay.\n\nDeep Dungeons of Doom offers exactly that. The gameplay requires just the arrow keys (or wasd), and puts you in the position of a character trying to defend a kingdom. There's a knight and a wizard so far, and I predict more characters later. Typical dungeon crawler in terms of aesthetic, but almost like a mobile game in ease of play.\n\nShould you get it? The five buck price tag is a tiiiiiiny bit much, but there's certainly enough game for the value.

I felt that it was justifiable to buy it again, especially since it's only 99 cents. It is fantastically simple while being incredibly intricate at the same time. The combat system is so simple you can literally play it with 2 keys on the keyboard. The real depth of this game comes in timing your attacks and defense just right, depending on your response to the opponent's movements. Along with the customization and RPG aspects of the game, it becomes an almost flawless game of strategy. The graphics are crisp and clean pixels, the animations are done well, the gameplay is quick and responsive, and the music and sound effects are very fitting with the setting of the excellent story line.\n\nThe only thing that bothers me about this game is that fact that you can only have one item of equipment at a time. It makes it frustrating when you get new items in the treasure boxes and you feel like you are forced to throw you item away. I mean really.. why can't I wear a helmet if I'm holding a sword?  I suppose this was done to increase the difficulty of the game, and is only a minor issue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blag/recommended/325090/","blag","A Big Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blag/","281 products in account","So, first, let me say I bought this game for $1 on the 2015 Winter sale. I came in to it expecting nothing, armed only with the knowledge it was a fantasy dungeon crawler, and I didn't read any reviews/metacritic ratings before I got it since it was only a buck.\nI have to say I like it. I didn't realize this game was originally on mobile, but apparently it was, along with microtransactions.  I didn't really think that it was a game adaptable to microtransactions playing through it initially, because if you have a decent sense of rhythm and can memorize the enemy's attacks, you can easily clear all of the dungeons without taking any damage - I did that, basically, and found I could have beaten all of the game's content in about 4-5 hours or so. However, even during that time, some grinding was needed to beat various dungeons.\nPros:\nVery fast paced, can be played in small chunks.\nGameplay is fun, simple, and addictive - just the right blend of rogue-like and action RPG.\nArt is well done for what it is, music is catchy as hell.\nStory doesn't take itself too seriously.Cons:\nIt's relatively short for the main storyline. For a dollar, I didn't care, but if you paid more than that you might be disappointed.\nThere's a lot of grind once you finish the main story. For example, unlocking secrets: In order to unlock secrets, you need to do specific, strange actions in the game, or get certain rare drops. The rare drops is what the issue stems from - some of the items you'll need to unlock the secrets can require you to do the same dungeon over and over.\nIt lacks some of the basic settings you'd expect from a modern game, like the ability to mute sound effects.Overall, if you have the oppourtunity to buy this for cheap: e.g. at a heavy discount on a Steam sale, or in a humble bundle/similar, I'd recommend it. For $5, though? Not worth it.","December 28, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

AS. HELL\n-i might be just weak player but i have to say the game seems to pride itself in killing the player alot. And honestly this is my biggest problem with the game. it's really stalling you to keep playing the game's levels over and over when you could have just kept it as straightfoward game thats more fun. It's difficulty for difficulty's sake.\nAnd in some occasions there's very rare loot that you need to get certain secrets, but you dont keep theese as key items. if you die in the level you LOSE it. which some might like, and i get that, deep down i like that you have the balls to do that. But as a player, i just am wondering, why so cruel?\n\nTLDR:get it in sale and try it out if you like hard nes/old school games.","September 15, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taebae/recommended/325090/","taebae","YUI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taebae/","660 products in account","Really simple and fun.  A bit of a grind.  About 10 dungeons in total and you try to gather money to unlock skills.  You also get weapons or armor along the way.  However, when you die you lose everything you are wearing and all the gold gathered that run... unless you get lucky with the revenge mechanic.  I probably took longer than intended to beat the story dungeons since I kept rotating characters.  There are 3 classes in general: mage, crusader and mercenary.  The mage is a magic user that can regenerate mana, the crusader can regenerate health with balance of stats in hp and attack and the mercenary has high agility (more frequent attacks) but suffers low hp.  The game gets significantly easier if you do the secrets because you get a bonus (some times gold other times weapons) and will make the game much easier.","July 22, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt that it was justifiable to buy it again, especially since it's only 99 cents. It is fantastically simple while being incredibly intricate at the same time. The combat system is so simple you can literally play it with 2 keys on the keyboard. The real depth of this game comes in timing your attacks and defense just right, depending on your response to the opponent's movements. Along with the customization and RPG aspects of the game, it becomes an almost flawless game of strategy. The graphics are crisp and clean pixels, the animations are done well, the gameplay is quick and responsive, and the music and sound effects are very fitting with the setting of the excellent story line.\n\nThe only thing that bothers me about this game is that fact that you can only have one item of equipment at a time. It makes it frustrating when you get new items in the treasure boxes and you feel like you are forced to throw you item away. I mean really.. why can't I wear a helmet if I'm holding a sword?  I suppose this was done to increase the difficulty of the game, and is only a minor issue. It's just kind of annoying and counter intuitive.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RPGs.","October 31, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualRaptor/recommended/325090/","VirtualRaptor","VirtualRaptor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualRaptor/","386 products in account","Absolutely dreadful combat mechanics and on top of that, it feels like this game may have once had an item store attached to it. If it was turn-based or had better real-time combat mechanics, this would be a lot of fun.\n\nI also found the fonts very difficult to read. I enjoyed the pixel-graphics a lot but I didn't like the eye-strain induced by the ugly letters. I also thought the buttons and the like were way too large, they went a bit overboard with the VGA-era resolution mode.\n\nThe combat is overly simplified: you either press A to defend or D to attack. Enemies attack every so often, everything happens in real-time. Imagine a game where you're stuck in permanent quick-time events; Deep Dungeons of Doom would look a lot like it.\n\nI couldn't recommend this unless you enjoy QTE's.\n","November 1, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not espending 100 hours more doing the same thing just to get them.\n\nIt's a fun game until you realize what you have to do to finish it properly, then you start to depend so much in luck that the fun stops.\n\nI'll probably keep trying though, because I have OCD, but not because it's fun.","November 1, 2015","false","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having said that, Deep Dungeons of Doom is entertaining, EASY to learn and no matter how noob you are, no one is going to judge you. Once you die 12132143 times, you get used to the ephemeral nature of life and it’s OK.\nI like this game because I can play it with one hand while the other can be happily holding a beer or playing maracas (just one).\nPlus, you get swords and monsters and 80’s arcade music nonstop.

Usually when I have time to game, it's not hours and hours of time, but more like ten minute spurts where I'm able to sit down and play. Because of this, I love a lot of games that don't offer much plot, and allow for quick sessions of in-and-out gameplay.\n\nDeep Dungeons of Doom offers exactly that. The gameplay requires just the arrow keys (or wasd), and puts you in the position of a character trying to defend a kingdom. There's a knight and a wizard so far, and I predict more characters later. Typical dungeon crawler in terms of aesthetic, but almost like a mobile game in ease of play.\n\nShould you get it? The five buck price tag is a tiiiiiiny bit much, but there's certainly enough game for the value. I recommend grabbing it off a sale, but if you're like me in terms of loving easy-in-easy-out games, this is definitely for you.","July 14, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
