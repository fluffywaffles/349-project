It's a lot bigger and more indepth than I was origionally thinking it would be. The game's exploration element took me by surprise. Though it has open world elements, I wouldn't really call it an open world game. You can look around but generally you'll only be getting quests on a specific island and if the quest isn't there there's not a reason to be there.\n\nUnlike some people on here I actually like the music. The sound effects are kind of cute but get annoying after awhile. The music is actually one of my favorite parts.\n\nThe waiting around for resources can be annoying. It looks like it's based on a lot of those weird freemium games models. Though as this game is something you pay for and there's no reason to wait around I don't know the point of that. However I do rather enjoy the whole building buildings on your own island and setting it up. Moving them around is a bit too expensive but some good planning keeps that from being an issue.\n\nI'm a sucker for tactical rpgs and this seems like a doozy. The early stuff is pretty simple but things start getting more fun once you get off the main island. I think so at least. You start exploring and fighting pirate bosses and that's pretty neat.\n\nThe graphics are charming as well. But I grew up in the era this game is kind of mimmicing, so it's right at my heart.","October 2, 2015","true","10.7"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","38","43","0","0"

Heck what make it worse is considering how much you need to do everything the trader where you sell your resources doesn't give you much for them, at least the more basic ones, and same for the Weaponsmith, selling weapons bring very little money, considering how much resources you need to make them its a pretty steep imbalance. I mean seriously you need to do as many side quests \ grind quests as possible and steal as much gold as possible with your thief if you ever want to manage to have enough gold, the rest of the resources isn't so bad but early on at least, gold is Hell to manage.\n\nNow beyond that your character selection is limited, I don't have the feeling you can get 'generic' troops to recruit, if you can I haven't seen it, and yet I am close to 5 hours in. The skills the characters I do have are very limited, at most about 10 skills, a mix of active and passive skills, that you need to invest points in, and that cost every more every upgrades, with this little amount of choices their isn't all that many options for how to level your character up, also one of your starter char seem to have skills that rely on a resource that isn't available for a while, so its pretty useless to invest in anything but the passive in his case. Another one seem to capture beasts to put them in the Zoo, I have yet to see anything I captured in there, so I don't know if its a bug or merely I tried to capture too beasts that require an upgraded zoo to be available. Also the skill progression is fairly limited, my thief got Steal Gold lvl 3, and it gives 56% chances typicall to steal, while Steal Gold lvl 1 gives 50%... at about 3% per upgrade the skill will be effectively useful... about at level 10, problem is its not the only skill you need to get... but however gold is so much an issue... now if you could steal the equipped gear I'd understand 50% or lower rates... but merely for gold... I'd expect it to be a easier to begin with.\n\nNow the Village construction is an interesting aspect the fact you have an entire island to build up is nice, but it cost ALOT to build stuff, to build even the decors cost a bunch, now while I understand in this game the decors have a use, you still have issues managing to get enough resources to build up properly, also it cost like 500 gold to move something, which make any mishaps in setting up your Village and any needs for relocation to be fairly costy.\n\nNow I'll simply say beyond that, that the combat is not the strongest elment of this game, as I said early limited skills available, getting new gear is difficult since it cost so much per item, it means you'll play your characters mostly one way with very little in term of effective variations, you'll also do the same side missions over and over for the sake of grinding those few precious resources early on at least, however I expect later too to a level.\n\nStill even with all the complaining I did about the game, it got a fair amount of charm and is pretty interesting, it combined Tactical RPG with Town Management, its story is quirky and amusing, our party characters seem to be novel and have alot of personality and tend toward being very unique, if albeit in a sort of caricatural \ parodical fashion. Anyhow its even with its flaw still a good game and the developers have shown much willingness to work on it and better it, so they get alot of appreciation from me for being so willing to cooperate with the players and correct the flaws to their game.\n\nEDIT:\nWell it seem the developers once again listened, the new update did help with two of the issues I mentioned, namely they reduced the price for moving stuff around, so its now down from 500 gold per move to 200 gold per move, which is nice, I'll be frank I would have prefered more along the line of 50-100 but this is already 60% cheaper, so its a nice drop, its going to help when we need to rearrange the Village for sure. Also they fixed the Zoo issue so now we should be able to capture beasties fine. So thanks to the developers for those fixes. Also they added a 'speed' so that the time on the map can be sped up and thus you can generate resources faster, that should be fairly helpful too to help avoid some of the tedious wait for some of those basic resources build up.\n\nEDIT 2:\nSo at this point I'd say much of my complains about resources are gone... after trying the game with the Speed Options I noticed it was fairly easy to gather up resources and selling them for gold take care of that, at this point I'd say much of the complains maybe short the combat being too simplistic also maybe the fact that you can't buy equipment and must craft it, maybe there would still be some complain when it comes to resources for crafting being required in too large quantities, at this point dividing all numbers, received and to use for crafting by 10 might have been more sensible than requiring hundreds of items for one piece of gear. Anyhow, oh yea and somehow the Tier 3 Farm cost WAY more to get than the other buildings at this point, is the food resources justifiable of a 3k gold for the upgrade to Tier 3? Along with alot of other resources, it may be overkill. However considering how easy it is to gather up resources with the massive speed boost of x16, it might not matter all that much.","October 4, 2015","true","23.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Well, kind of. ;-)\n\nI bought this game for a mere $3 during the Steam halloween sale, not expecting anything spectacular, but I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by this game. I started it up for the first time planning to kill some time waiting for some other games to download/install, but then I just ended up playing Swords & Crossbones for like 5 straight hours.\n\nCOMBAT: On one hand, it's a tactical RPG. You're going to be fighting lots of battles where you move specialized units on a grid map and engage enemy units in turn-based combat. As your units participate in battles, they gain XP which levels them up and improves their overall stats, but they also earn Ability Points which can be spent to unlock and upgrade their unique abilities in whatever order you like. The game follows essentially a revenge plot, where first you have to go one-by-one bust your pirate friends out of various island prisons, which is how you get your new recruits. There are various bosses to fight as you go. When you're on a battle map, in addition to just plain old fighting, you can also trap non-human monsters and use your thief to open locked chests that randomly appear on some maps. Maps also frequently include powder kegs, which you can hit with a ranged attack to blow up and deal massive damage to any units standing directly adjacent, which is useful for kiting and damaging more difficult units.\n\nMANAGEMENT: When you're not in combat, the game shifts to being a sort of simulation/management/trading/economy type game. Your pirate band takes over their own island and starts setting up houses, storage buildings, a tavern, a pier, etc. You have to build a house for everyone in your party if you want them to work for you (otherwise they just stand around doing nothing). You recruit various non-combatant NPCs onto your colony that take up professions like lumberjacking, farming, building, smithing, mining, cooking, etc. You have to build a house for all of these people AND a shop for them to engage in their trade. Your combatant allies will serve as generalized laborers that help carry resources to storage. The resources you create can be sold directly or they can be used to build and expand. A little later you can even start a thriving tourism industry on your island, once you're able to build leisure/entertainment businesses. There is even a weapon/armor crafting system, although it isn't entirely available until several hours into the game.\n\nEXPLORATION: This was the surprising part. You also have to explore in this game. When you first land on an island, it's covered with fog and various battle symbols that show each unexplored section of the island. You have to battle your way through each section to uncover it and make it passable/useable. On your home island, this makes the land useable. On islands you visit on the ocean, it just makes that area passeable or sometimes unlocks hidden objectives or reveals underlying towns where you can rest your party or pick up missions. Exploring over land is pretty simple, but exploring over sea requires a boat. The boat can only hold so many party members at first, so upgrading to bigger boats that hold more party members is an obvious goal. You also can only stay on the open water as long as you have food supplies on board (which you bring with you from home or catch using a fishing equipment upgrade). If you run out of food, you are forced to return home immediately.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun combination of tactical RPG combat, simulation, and exploration. It's pretty cartoony and lighthearted as well, which I tend to prefer over grimdark.\n\nDoes the game have any downsides, though? Yeah, a few. The tutorials don't explain certain aspects of the game clearly enough, so you should be prepared to be somewhat confused at first on how certain systems work. For example, the game explains to you that upgrading buildings requires meeting certain decoration requirements, but the game doesn't sufficiently explain the symbols used in the decoration system, what they mean, or what to do about them. There can also be a certain point at the beginning where you may feel frustrated because you don't know if you should be focusing on exploring/fighting or just letting your economy run and focusing on development. It would also be nice if the game had some kind of hotkeys to use for battles instead of making you click all over the place, but clicking all over the place you will have to do. I also feel like there is a huge disparity in the usefulness of abilities, with some of them feeling extremely helpful and others being so heavily penalized (e.g. using a lot of abilities forces you to deal 0 damage in exchange for inflicting a status effect, but the status effect usually only has like a 30 to 50% chance to hit, so when you first learn them they feel pretty useless). It can also be frustrating that enemy units use status effects so aggressively, and your only defense against it is the healer's "remedy" spell, which only has like a 30% chance of success, which again feels like a pretty steep handicap. But you CAN get through it.\n\nI also encountered two bugs while playing, though it wasn't so bad, since they turned out to be the kind that help you. On one particular island, there were two battles in a row where I placed my units and clicked the "ready" button to begin the battle and was immediately shown the VICTORY screen as if I had won, but not a single unit had moved. I still got all the loot and XP though.\n\nIt would also be nice if the ships or units, when traveling on the map, would cancel their current destination when you click on a new destination. At present, they will continue traveling to wherever you first clicked and won't recognize new clicks until they reach wherever they're currently traveling. It's not so bad on land, but it can be annoying on sea where you have rations to worry about and they get burned away because your boat isn't smart enough to abort the current destination and switch to a new one. But it's still manageable. Just use short "baby step" clicks to your destination and you'll be alright.\n\nFinally, I wish there were something like secrets or treasures or some other kind of unique discoveries to make when exploring. Even though you can explore and fight as much as you want, your progress and objectives are still ultimately pretty tightly woven to the game's story missions. I like that the game has sidequests available from the tavern, but it would be nice if there were some sidequests that were a little more interesting than just battles.\n\nOverall, I am pretty pleased by this game. I would love to see a sequel to it or just another game similar to it that expands on the ideas and makes both the TRPG half and the exploration/management half even more complex and engaging.","November 1, 2015","true","16.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

All I had to do was to fight the crocs and bird on my main island a few times and I am OP for the next few islands.\nThe building process is too troublesome. It is hard to find the correct building I want in the midst of all the others. For example, I need to upgrade the house of the correct person before I can upgrade his workplace. But I can't find it if there are 15 more people on the island!\nThe production for the basic commodities (food, wood, cotton, etc) is too slow, in the end, i just go out there to salvage shipwrecks and use the gold I find to buy commodities.\nThe MMI for buying and selling commodities needs to be improved. I have tons of money but need to buy tons of wood and food to build stuff. Unfortunately, I can't buy it in the same store window and have to move to find the market place.\nAt the end of the day, I can easily leave the game to idle for half an hour and find my stores all filled up to use.\n\nBut those said, the game is still recommended for the comic relief and turn-based strategy fights.\nI love the references to several games I have played before within the game as well as other characters in real life.\nThe varying terrain and combat maps are good.\nThe difference classes are varied enough with their own strength and weaknesses to make the strategy very interesting.\nI love the exploration sailing, simply to clear out the map and go from port to port.

I do wish that the tourism aspect can be more complex, like making the tourist visit the party's houses to offer them unique weapons and quests?\n\n3 more things to add.\n1. Pirates whom are added on later in the game ought to start with more training points for their skils or at least have some skills already invested in\n2.

Sometimes it never happens, sometimes it happens... TOO often. It didn't really crash initially but I started building my island up with tourist-ey stuff and utilizing the 16x speed and it can freeze up a lot and crash unexpectedly. I have also had it crash in lots of battles when too many units are doing too many things too quickly.

What follows is a somewhat spur-of-the-moment review wall of text since I had just completed the game. Don't pay any attention to my game time though as I did a lot of idling. Still I probably got a good 20 hours out of the game.\n\nTD:DR; A casual tactics RPG with city management sim elements. Good casual fun best served in bite-sized portions.\n\nSwords & Crossbones: An Epic Pirate Story is tactical battle rpg with city sim and exploration elements, packaged in a casual wrapping. The pixel aesthetic is easy on the eyes and works, and the character design unique, if somewhat unusual.\n\nFirst, the RPG parts. The combat system in this game is an old-school turn-based grid-based system reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea or any of a multitude of N64/NES/Gameboy tactics RPGs that used to be so common. Characters can move anywhere within their move radius, no matter how many steps they have to walk around to get there, and vertical layers can be traversed by jumping based on the character's jump stat. Since this is a pirate-themed game most maps include substatial amounts of water tiles -- these can be traversed freely but restrict using actions. On actions, each character can move and act in a turn, and actions include regular attacks, skills/spells/abilities, using items, or even swapping places with an enemy corpse that's blocking the character's passage. There are lots of skills and abilities to choose from and each character is themed slightly differently.\n\nEnemies are a mixed bag -- story enemies are mirrors of player characers so make for decent combat, but these encounters are limited to some two dozen or so boss battles. The majority of combat is in random encounters and generic battles, and those enemies only come in limited archetypes and some pallette-swaps so eventually fighting them becomes a grind. Thankfully there are ways of avoiding the random encounters so only island liberation battles against pirates are obligatory. If taken in small chunks the grind is manageable enough though.\n\nStory is cheesy and fun, an epic rescue and pursuit of revenge. It works well with the varied characters and original graphics design. I won't say much else because anything else will pretty much spoil what little of the story there is. It goes well with the game though.\n\nAside from the combat the game has elements of city building/management. It comes in the form of building up a pirate island to provide houses for the crew, collect resources, craft better equipment, and build bigger ships. Eventually players can expand into tourism to entertain residents of liberated islands and provide a level of gold income to fund further expansion and upgrades. Needless to say, plans for each building have to be obtained by defeating enemies and clearing islands. Resources and items can also be found while exploring the seas and recovering sinking wrecks.\n\nIt's all casual though, so no deadlines no rush. Time can be sped up at will up to x16 speed to simply wait for more resources when needed. Battles can be re-tried however many times needed -- getting the whole team knocked out simply sends the team back to the pirate island to train up and upgrade equipment.\n\nThat pretty much sums up the game, in way too many words.","January 10","true","41.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's basically a "Tactics" game, following the Final Fantasy Tactics combat-style, which is essentially taking a normal JRPG and adding terrain to its combat. Now, units actually move around, have AOE abilities, etc. etc. which adds quite a lot of depth to the more traditional JRPG combat, with a few new interesting possibilities.\n\nI have not played any of the tactics game, but I remember one of my friends playing it.

Especially since it's a genre that I don't think I've ever seen on PC (not often, at the very least).\n\n\nI won't write a long review, just focusing on a couple of points that I feel were very relevant when I was playing.\n\nGoing against some other reviewers, who claimed the game to be both "deep" and "casual"... well, I wouldn't call it depth, as much as breadth. The game does a lot of different stuff. Not only does it have the Tactics combat, but it also has a city-builder element, where you must manage resources in order to build a growing island, to construct buildings that provide resources or upgrade possibilities for your characters.\nIt also has some exploration element, where you sail to find new islands (unfortunately purely linear, going along with the story), and some other repeatable quests.\n\nI disagree with the "depth" because of a single, yet huge problem with the game: the combat is too easy. I've spent most of the game without even knowing there were abilities (the game explains everything in the first 30 minutes, while some of the things are unlocked hours after the fact... later), and even then, the combat provided no difficulty at all.\nThis is mostly a problem when you realize that the whole upgrade/skill system is rendered pointless. Which, in turn, renders most of the city building system pointless as well.\nIt lacks depth in the sense that you'll never have to think about the combat situations you're in. The game is also very much extended by repetition (again, mobile roots), keeping you stuck in the gameplay loop of discovering islands to unlock more upgrades, to discover more islands, to get more upgrades, ad infinitum.\nWell, not again infinitely, but for far longer than it should.\n\nSo, except a lot of the same battlefields, enemies, etc. while at the same time requiring no thought to get through it.\n\nIt has an interesting button: auto-combat. The AI isn't very good, but it works. 5 hours in, I stopped playing most battles. There was no point. I just hit the little button, and very sub-optimal AI would do the obligatory grind for me!\n\nThis is not enough, since the UI requires you to still click quite a lot of times to get the auto combat started.\n\n\nThere are a bunch of problems created by the previous one. Random encounters during exploration, some obligatory battles while you're doing the main quest, etc. etc.\nIf the combat was well tuned, it might have been good.\nUnfortunately, the game is mostly a skinner box. It would almost work better as a clicker game.\n\nAnd this is all very unfortunate, but it's a useful example to have, I guess.\nThe game seems very cool. The visuals are pleasant, the writing was actually good (I was laughing at the start of the game! And I rarely appreciate the writings in videogames), and the various system had incredible potential. The combat system and skills may have even been good, if the enemy encounters were balanced. As they're not, the game turns into a huge, huge grind... There's no point.\n\nI apologize for just hitting the same point over and over and... But that is the single problem that ruined the whole game, for me. If it was shorter, I would have enjoyed it, as I would not have experience much down town. While I was learning the systems, it was cool! After that, the game couldn't keep up and still extended itself (rather artificially) for a good 10+ hours.\n\nYou have a bunch of characters, equipment upgrades, etc. You never get to explore any of it.\n\nWith all this said, I look forward for the developers' next game. This was so close to being great... hopefully, they'll take similar concepts, but with a larger focus on the game's core, instead of all systems that are mostly skinner boxes.","February 17","false","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minifigs/recommended/383720/","minifigs","DO DOPE FUCK HOPE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minifigs/","1760 products in account","This game is a light hearted pirate themed game with turn based grid combat and island management/base building. Sounds great so far? TLDR it is indeed great.\n\nLight hearted Pirates - the theme in this game works really well. The jokes are constant and mostly pretty funny. Lots of call backs and clever developments building on other previous things. You build boats and sail around raiding and looting and making jokes about it, it's great.\n\nTurn based grid combat - Each member of your pirate crew is essentially a unique class. Enemies are also of these classes, but you only get one of each. The move and act system is very forgiving, letting you move around as much as you want before confirming. The tactical combat is pretty fun and varied.\n\nIsland management - every member of your crew, every craftsman and every resource gatherer needs a house, and then with beauty objects you can upgrade each building from level 1 to 3.  Your island draws tourists and produces resources and gold as well as being able to craft equipment.\n\nI would say that each element of the game is simmilar: the story, combat and building are all well implemented and enjoyable but not super deep.  I find myself opening this game up very often, if only to play a couple fights while I wait for something. For $5 (or below) it's a very well done game with a lot more depth and length than you might expect.\n\nOnly negative note: SAVE OFTEN because sometimes it will just crash to the desktop out of nowhere.","February 3","true","22.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Mind you, I just have 4 team members, but my complaints so far will not be lightened by extra gametime. The humor is okay, but the citybuilding element is extremely shallow(as you can speed up the game instead of upgrading), and there are just too many annoyances:\n\n- The game is too slow. No queueing commands, fast movement button. It's fun seeing your characters move for some time, but it doesn't take long for me to get bored of waiting for walking.\n- The music, oh god. Two tracks of maybe a minute, one for combat and one for exploration mode. Mute quickly.\n- No control options but LMB, on EVERYTHING. Designed for touch screen.\n- Especially egregious when placing characters, pick character at top screen, click okay at bottom of screen, click new guy at top screen, click okay at bottom of screen, GRAH. Want someone moved one space to the left? That's four clicks. Want to switch two characters because you accidentally put the tank first? That's at least ten. You'll be pressing auto after two battles. Just make it click-and-drag devs! Dragging onto another character to make them switch places! Most facebook games get this!\n- Even when there is a context sensitive option like "open chest", this is clicking on actions, on open chest, on the chest, and on okay. This could be one click on the chest.\n- Nope, not even escape to open the game menu. Oddly enough, the exploration menu items get hotkeys.\n- No way to check mission objective during battle. Or save. Luckily fleeing is almost free. You just need to WAIT for some time while your guys run back and forth.\n- No way to decide which pirate gets the new house if multiple pirates are homeless.\n- No scrolling through the message log. Artilleryman fires at 4 units? I hope you can read fast.\n\nIndubitably going to finish because I'm an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nEDIT: Actively updated, as it was just two days after I posted this that the instantaneous battle movement button was added. It's not perfect, enemies can jumble real quick, but yay!","February 9","false","8.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

UI is not that user friendly, and tactical elements are hard to find. Stupid AIs.  And please do not rub tutorial tooltips all over the beginning of the game. That's not nice.\n\nI liked that there are plenty of female characters in game, and that the default heroin was a girl. We need more female protagonist for sure. What I didn't like was the crewmen. I felt that they had some potential to be great characters, but that was it. 11 characters were seriously too many to handle. I don't even remember their names. Almost none of them recieve decent character development, except probablly that thief lady. Crewmen were just fawns to me, not comrades.\n\nAbove all, It was really hard for me to watch every single one of the characters from the game try to be witty and horribly fail, repeatedly. Not to mention those awful running gags like blizzard-o name jokes. O, the humanity... It was not something I could withstand, so after some time I decdied to skip every dialogues. Good riddance. Storyline needs some patchwork, too.\n\nPros for me: the concept. the Protagonist. the tycoon style of island building.\nCons for me: EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE DIOLOGUE LINES.","February 14","false","16.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"
