You see, you're an alien tasked with levelizing cities and the most efficient way of accomplishing your mission is by sabotaging the everyday life of earthlings. That means laying down oil splates on pavements, placing destructive cows to set off chain reactions and various other tools of chaos. It's fun, challenging and beautiful to look at. Demolition, Inc. will provide you with some quick strategic fun!","September 26, 2011","true","6.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It looked like a fun puzzle blow up so I gave it a shot.\n\nWhat I really liked about the game is the variety you use to destroy what you need to destroy. The goal of the game is to bring down all the buildings in the area and to raise green areas. How you do it though is up to you and the resources you got to do it. What's exceptional to me about video games is the ability to have ENTIRE control (so when I play RTS I want to be able a single unit from FPS stand point or RTS). Demolition INC sort of let's you do that as you can manually control a few cars. The physics engine while jumping a car off a ramp then slamming into 3 buildings while hitting a propane tank is quite fun.\n\nWould I recommend this game as something extremely worth playing? Depends on what you like. If it's on sale I would say buy it for sure.\n\nRATING : 7.0/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	C+	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+","July 21, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

I played one level and crashed 3 cars into a building that was already damaged, yet the building stood firm and defiant and that cost me the level.  Plus having to retry can cause some previous effects from your last try to still be in play and not reset properly after, resulting in the army coming for you straight away.\n\nAlso I have  been having crashing issues here and there with the game, so beware of that.\n\nMusic though, quite catchy, pretty good and suits the game very well.\n\nAs I look at the price currently, it stands at £4.79.  Its a push, but yes its a fair price for it, though get it on sale if possible.  Its a fine game, could be better with more polish and attention, but its workable and it will eat time like no other as you try and find solutions to destroy the target city, so thats a good thing going for it for sure.  Pick it up if you want to try something a bit different thats cheap and a good time killer.","July 30, 2014","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has its moments, but as a proper PC title, it lacks imagination and playability. You are constantly limited in regards to the timer, allocated 'weapons/tools', as well as environmental props. Essentially, you need to use the vehicles that are driving around the allocated areas to force them to destroy buildings. This sounds fun, but it fails on a technical level. The limitations set by the devlopers decreases game longevity as there's no point in returning to the game.\nIn addition, the game areas need to be larger and have more happening. Instead of relying mostly on the vehicles, there should be other items, tools, props, as well as other objectives to use and/or complete. I like to support independent companies, but I only recommend this game if it is on sale.\n\nI hope that with the income raised the developers can create a sequel or another title, which will perfect an already decent idea.\n\n4.5/10.\n","January 7, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's been my default "go to" game whenever I have some time to kill or just feel like blowing things up for no obvious reason. With the DLC installed, in particular, some of the storyline challenges are no easy task - there is no free run to the finish line.\n\nThe workshop adds a whole new layer of fun/challenge/wtf, with enough uploaded content to keep the game going for days. With "Create a game level" as one of the achievements, there is a lot of chaff in with the wheat; but a good explore of the workshop levels is hugely rewarding.\n\nI've found creating game levels for the workshop generally entertaining, whith a few small quirks that take a little getting used to [and are probably more indicative of my own lack of experience with making game levels, than with this game in particular]. Above all, the game creator has been a brilliant place to escape to when I've had trouble getting through in-game levels, and just want to take a break for a while.\n\nOverall: an absolute favourite game, not especially complex but tremendous fun to play. Should be much better known than it is. Highly recommended, especially for the fan of blowing stuff up.","July 2, 2015","true","225.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I passed on the PS3 version because I wasn't sure if it was worth the money just to play it on a bigger screen.\n\nAfter seeing it dirt cheap in the Steam sale though, I thought I'd get it again, and I'm very glad I did.\n\nIt's not going to change your life, or eclipse all you have played before it, but what I like about it is that it's quirky and fun. It's one of those games that aren't to demanding on your concentration or brainpower either - perfect as I've got a heavy cold at the moment.\n\nIt has level designer and workshop integration so you can share new levels etc.\n\nDefinitely worth a try.","July 16, 2013","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
