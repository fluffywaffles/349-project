There's no run and gun, there's no portals, there's no incentive to click as fast as you can, there's no minigames or leveling up. All there is, is a collection of levels with simple mechanics used in very clever ways, and a goal. That's right, it's just you and your brain. You can take as much time as you need, and retry at any time, but be prepared to do it a lot if you intend to complete every level perfectly.\n\nNever before has it been more difficult to simply kill one sheep, or feed a few dogs. In your quest to (sometimes literally) extract these cute animals, you will have to systematically divide, subtract, and add to the groups of critters. You have various tools at your disposal for doing so, including incineration, lazers that split individuals in half, drowning, replacing (and still drowning,) jump pads that split your group up and send them in specific directions, platforms that swap with each other, etc.\n\nSacrifice is the name of the game, here, and it's never been more cute or fun. Divide by Sheep starts off relatively easy, and with great pacing gradually introduces more features and difficulty, although sometimes a level or two might be easier or significantly harder than previous ones. All of the puzzles are completely solvable and require experimentaiton or calculation, but never abstraction; you will never have that moment where you have to look up a solution to a puzzle and then go "How was I supposed to know that's what I was supposed to do?" The design of the levels is brilliantly clever and you will find yourself feeling increasingly satisfied with figuring out how to beat them with a perfect score. Get ready, it's really addicting!\n\nGraphicsThe graphics in Divide by Sheep are pretty simple, but very effective. It has a classic isometric style with modern design, with an almost vector art aesthetic. The menu transitions and navigation are smooth and simple, and I love how the UI stays almost completely out of the way, however, I will fault it slightly for clearly being intended for touch devices, and for having a rate this app page. There is also no option to change resolution. There is, however, a button to make the gameplay more child-friendly, which is really cool, and considerate of the developers, because this would be a great mental workout for any kid who can understand the mechanics.\n\nIf you've looked at the screenshots or trailers, then you know most of what you need to know about the game's graphics.\n\nAudioSo there's not a whole lot to say about the audio in Divide by Sheep, except that I like the music, and surprisingly at no point found myself getting tired of it or completely tuning it out. The sounds are pleasant enough, and there's good audible feedback for actions and navigation. There are also no problems with the quality of the sound itself.\n\nConclusionDivide by Sheep is an exceptional puzzle game that will keep you busy for quite a while. It is challenging and engaging but never unfair. The content to price ratio is very good, and I am entirely comfortable recommending the game at full price...in fact, they could have charged more and I would still recommend it at full price. Seriously, treat yourself.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 25, 2015","true","6.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","5"

There are a tonne of different mechanics it seems as I'm only 20 levels in and already seen 6 different mechanics that add a lot of thought into the game such as little rat things that swallow your sheep. The game is laid out very mobile like but controls very well.\n\n*Gameplay*\n\nYou jump your sheep across islands that can only fit a certain amount of Sheep, if your sheep can't fit then they fall off to their death which may be nessesary. Like I said there are a tonne of mechanics that change the way you think and play.\n\n*Conclusion*\nThis game is very fun and easy to learn and I highly recommend picking up the game. I give it a 9/10 for being, fun, addictive and just awesome.\n\n*YouTube*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knF0_gD8u3c","July 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","1"

Within a few levels was flinging sheep through laser beams followed by duct taping them back together. Which may sound disturbing if not for the beautiful vector-like art. More directed towards mobile and touch interfaces can happily say had no problems with the controls or UI.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh0I7bvKOk8\nRather straight forward gameplay. Fill rafts with the correct number of animals and get rewarded stars with a total of 3 per level being possible. Gradually introduced to new obstacles such as trampolines (split packs), wolves (eat sheep) and electric fences (let's not go there). Don't let the 'math' requirement turn you away, levels could be passed by receiving 1 star if just wanting to progress further.\n\nDepending on puzzle skills and if aiming to perfect levels, should get around 5~ hours of gametime.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/252130/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Death is lonely. Death wants some company. So naturally he would flood a plain filled with sheep and wolves, then float rafts requiring very specific numbers of dead creature souls at a time. Obviously. Divide by Sheep is a math-based puzzle game and to that end it works well. What makes it noteworthy is the window dressing, a whimsical cartoon presentation of fairly morbid subject matter.\n\nLike many well-designed puzzle games, Divide by Sheep starts out with a simple premise, which it builds upon as the player progresses. Groups of sheep in numbers ranging from one to nine are spread across platforms whose sizes can vary within that same range. Sheep can be moved between adjacent platforms, but if a group size ever exceeds the destination platform size then the excess sheep are thrown into the water and drowned. The goal is to load life rafts with sheep, but only in specified numbers. Too few and the raft won't launch, too many and the raft will spring a leak and sink. Hitting one numerical goal for a level will unlock the next, but mastering a level requires three quotas to be met in a specific order.\n\nn the beginning, there isn't a lot to think about. The options for adding and subtracting sheep from a group are small: combine two groups together to increase the number or throw more sheep than a platform can hold to decrease. It might sound complex in writing, but it's an easy concept to pick up after a few minutes of play. Not far in, Divide by Sheep introduces new elements to use toward the end of filling up life rafts. Fences block movement between adjacent platforms. Dynamite platforms explode and disappear if they have no occupants. Laser fields will slice sheep in half so one divided sheep takes up two spots on a platform.\n\nThe first major change comes with the introduction of wolves. If a wolf and a sheep share the same platform, the wolf will eat the sheep and become so obese it cannot be moved or fed again. Wolves have their own life rafts and the two species can never commingle on rafts. It almost reminds me of the old fox/rabbit/cabbage puzzle; there are constant calculations for when and how to feed the wolves in order to get the right number of animals to safety. A wolf can be fed to completion on half a sheep, so one sheep sent through a laser can feed two wolves. With all of the mechanics put together, there are several ways to add and subtract from groups of sheep and wolves.\n\nWhat I like about the setup is that even though there is often only one three-star solution to a puzzle, there are several different avenues to mentally attack it from. In some levels when the quotas are high, it's important to note exactly how many animals can be safely sacrificed. Others require a different kind of foresight, forcing one initial move since all others would lead to failure. Still more are so complex that a sort of trial-and-error can reveal the path to the best answer.\n\nThe next big wrinkle comes in the Dark World, where Death finally shows up. He has rafts of his own, and he is collecting souls. It doesn't matter how the animals die; they can be drowned, sliced, eaten, or burned and he will take them. It eventually gets to a point where sheep can do double duty in terms of raft occupancy. The sheep can be cut in half to fill Death's raft, then duct taped back together to fill a sheep raft.\n\nThat highlights the odd tone of Divide by Sheep. At a glance, it looks like an average cartoony mobile title. The soundtrack is bouncy and upbeat. So the juxtaposition of that G-rated presentation and the graphic slaughter with copious amounts of blood is funny in the same way the fictional cartoon The Itchy & Scratchy Show is. It would be disturbing if it weren't also adorable.\n\nDivide by Sheep hits the perfect level of difficulty, where every stage makes me think for at least a few seconds, but each one is also small and self-contained enough that persistence and critical thinking can always lead to victory. It has never felt too easy nor have I ever been permanently stumped. It's smart, it's pretty, and it never dwells on any one idea for too long. At its heart is a quality math puzzler, but what makes it shine is the dark comedy found in killing cartoon animals just to satisfy some arbitrary numerical requirements.","September 25, 2015","true","18.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Often times, I would ignore blatant low-effort ports published on Steam for just another cash cow to milk. However, Divide by Sheep did surprise me in terms of its intelligent puzzle design. It first starts out simple enough with you trying to rescue specific amount of sheep in a certain order. This can be accomplished by utilising the size of islands, splitting certain herds with jump pads and so on. Soon, Divide by Sheep becomes a mashup of devouring sheep, sacrificing wolves or sheep for their souls, all while trying to give whatever the upper left corner of the screen at the current time point demands. I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the game gradually introduces more and more mechanics, melds them into more demanding puzzles and keeps you engaged and challenged throughout your playtime. At the same time, Divide by Sheep never pressures you, as the cute art style and relaxing soundtrack trot along with your gears doing the calculations. Should you be amongst the vast amount of people who never enjoyed maths in school though, you might not particularly desire to add, divide and plan ahead in Divide by Sheep. I personally enjoyed my time a whole bunch, except for the missing undo a move button, which led to me redoing a bunch of levels, as I out of idiocy did the wrong move a tad too early or too late. So yes, an undo button would have been great.\nVERDICTAll in all, Divide by Sheep will probably not lead to you falling asleep while counting. It’s a cute, polished puzzle game which provides a bunch of hours of gameplay for just a few bucks and can therefore be recommended easily to everyone enjoying a bit of numerical puzzling from time to time.","August 26, 2015","true","2.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/252130/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","If you would've told me a day ago that I was going to play a game all about math, division, and adorable little animals being cut in half, I would've called you crazy. Even more so for saying I was actually going to ENJOY it, of all things. That was yesterday. Today we have Divide by Sheep, a hilarious little puzzle game that is full of charm and some very challenging puzzles.\n\nNow I feel before we move any further, we should really note something. This title is extremely App friendly in design. If you are somebody who gets easily bugged by that type of thing, you are going to grind your teeth as you gain 3 stars and see a complete lack of options menu. With that aside, I love Divide by Sheep. The game is disguised beautifully, but its all about math and putting numbers in the proper order to get the outcome you want. Using sheep, pigs, wolves, lasers and more, you will send the adorable little animals on their voyage to the hands of Death.\n\nThat's right, Death is lonely and wants a friend, but I mean Death is adorable, who wouldn't want to be his friend?\n\nSmall plot aside, the aesthetics and charm of Divide by Sheep is what got me hooked. This is incredibly important aspect to the game, otherwise it's just a math puzzle game. The dark humor is what kept me smiling, even when I got frustrated. So much so as a matter of fact, that if you are not a fan of math, you may not enjoy this title as much. You must bounce sheep or an assortment of animals to a raft that requires a specific number. Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it can be incredibly complicated. The difficulty scales rapidly and there have been more than a few times that Divide by Sheep has made me scratch my head and made my eyes go cross. More elements are introduced to complicate matters, such as limited number platforms, wolves that eat sheep, laser grids that divide sheep hilariously in half, and bouncing platforms that send your helpless animals flying.\n\nThat isn't to say that Divide by Sheep is too hard to beat or play though. If you can match just one of the numbers you are allowed to progress to the next level. Getting stuck is never an issue, and the challenge is one you set on yourself. Go for three stars or just say screw it and come back to it later, just like a real math test. Divide by Sheep has a large assortment of levels all with the 3 star challenge. The aesthetic of the levels does change from grassy halls to frozen tundras but for the most part, level design is always the same. Some floating platforms, which is your puzzle, and a raft to put X number of animals on.\n\nOn occasion after beating a number of levels, you are rewarded with an adorable piece of art, that usually explains a new up coming element in some manner.\n\nIt really is hard to find a fault with Divide by Sheep, because it's a very simplistic game. That in itself may be an issue though, because sometimes lets face it, math sucks. Mind you, this is why I'm a writer instead of a Architect or something that actually pays. But I digress. The point is, if Divide by Sheep had a fault it would be that it's a one trick pony. It doesn't exactly claim to be anything else than what it is, so this isn't a fault to the game. You should be more than aware what you're getting into if you buy this game. Aside from that and the App like nature of Divide by Sheep, it's bug free and is very fun to play. The replay value comes from trying to get 3 stars on every level, which unless you're very clever, is going to be long and challenging.\n\nThe options menu for the most part is non-existent, however there are parental controls if you wanted to leave the messy parts of the game out, like sheep being cut in half and leaving bloody messes. This feature while not incredibly important, is rather nice to be included and makes this game also a great learning tool. The music and soundtrack of Divide by Sheep are absolutely adorable and jaunty, matching the games almost carefree tone. It never really got grating on my ears or did any painful repeats. The music changes from area to area of the game thankfully so there is always something new to listen to around the corner.\n\nI have played plenty of puzzle games but none that actually made math fun for me. I am not huge fan of Sudoku or other games of its nature. That in itself is an incredible compliment to the games level design. After being stuck on a level for a while and finally beating it, you get the "aha!" feeling that is quite addictive. Divide by Sheep may not be incredibly innovative but I haven't seen many games like it.\n\nThere are some areas that Divide by Sheep could've added a little bit more to make the game user friendly. There is no hint button or any hand holding whatsoever, so if you bang your head against the wall, you are heading to Youtube or a forum for help. While there is a quick start over button, a undo last move button would've been very nice for some of the more complicated puzzles that involved many steps. While these puzzles are rare they do happen, and having to start completely over again left me a little wanting.\n\nDivide by Sheep is available on Steam and mobile markets, the price is representative of that fact at $4.99. This makes it an absolutely steal if you love puzzle games, plus hey, Steam achievements are always fun. You can always nab this game for on the go at $2.99 on the iTunes store. This game makes a great traveling companion. So if you are in the market for an incredibly adorable puzzle game that is going to give you plenty of bang for your buck and more than likely make you scratch your head, I can't think of a better game than Divide by Sheep.","July 30, 2015","true","1.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

Divide by Sheep has one of the easiest concepts for a puzzle game but yet still manages to make your brain explode whilst still making you want to keep playing more and more. Although, I can definitely recommend buying this as it is really fun, it still has a few things which could be improved which I will explain in my Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n♦ Great Gameplay that really makes you think without making you want to rage quit and never play again (There is the right balance here which makes it fun. It's one of those puzzles you just pick up and want to complete that no matter how frustrating it can be at times you never want to put it down until it's solved)\n♦ Decent number of Worlds and Levels (5 worlds, 30 levels a world, this is a good balanced number as it's not too few levels or too many. It doesn't leave you wanting more levels or make you feel like it's just dragging on and on becoming repetitive)\n♦ Awesome Cartoon Styled Graphics (This adds a nice edge to the style of the game)\n♦ Sound that just fits (Music and Sounds that can be listened to over and over again without sounding repetitive and annoying)\n♦ Decent Tutorials and Tutorial style (These are set of graphics/images before the level happens. They are well designed and detailed enough to understand what is going on which is awesome)\n♦ Not Repetitive (Each World looks graphically different from the last and incorporates aspects from the previous but adds something new. Also each level is scaled on from the last making each level a unique puzzle in its own. This makes the game fun and not repetitive)\n♦ Achievements are easy to get by just playing the game (Really easy to 100% if you can 100% all the puzzles)\n♦ Star incentive to keep trying a level until you 100% it (This is a nifty way to draw people into keep them playing a level until they 100% it and get all 3 stars for the level)\n♦ Awesome Graphical Story involving the Grim Reaper (For the minimal story in the game, it works)\n♦ Decent looking Steam Trading Cards, Emoticons and Backgrounds (Really well designed)\n♦ Controls just work (This is because the only thing you have to use is the mouse)\n♦ Worth the Price of $5 (At a $1 a world or $1 per 30 levels, you will definitely get your moneys worth)\n\nCons:\n♦ Don’t have to rescue/kill all the sheep, pigs or wolves (I found this part a weird concept as it felt like I was completing a Jigsaw Puzzle for example without using all the pieces).\n♦ Ported from Mobile without 100% checking that everything is consistent for the PC version. (I say this as it says "Rate this App" in one of the tabs. This should say something like "Review this Game" and shows the Devs didn't bother checking it/changing it for pc)\n♦ Can't skip some cut scenes (Such as Intro Scene)\n♦ Some aspects seem randomly introduced such as Pigs (One second you’re just playing with Sheep & Wolves and the next you know you have Pigs. I just felt they could have introduced them better in my opinion)\n♦ Menu looks like Mobile still (This isn't a major issue as the game works fine, it would just be nice to have the menu looking more like a PC games to make it look more PC orientated then straight ported from Mobile)\n♦ No Graphics or Resolution options (This is annoying if you want to play in different size resolutions or change from FullScreen to Windowed Mode as this is the type of game that would suit Windowed Mode)\n\nSide Note:\n♦ Most people complain that this is a mobile port. In some aspects like the menus and options it is. However, if you can look past that fact, it is a really, really well made puzzle game that shouldn't fully be criticised on the fact that the Devs didn't fully change it for PC. With this said unlike some Mobile Ports, the Devs have made full use of the majority of Steam Features such as Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Therefore, it's not just a straight Mobile Port in all aspects and the gameplay 100% works.\n\nOverall, even though there are a couple of cons, they are only minor things which could improve the game slightly. Therefore, as the game just works, has good graphics, a decent storyline, isn't repetitive and has a decent amount of levels, worlds and content that will keep you thinking and thinking...

It's not a long game, took me 10 hours to finish it but I definitely enjoyed it.\n\nSomething that is lacking would be a level in which all the mechanics are used at once.

It seemed like a nice little puzzle game, but ultimately it got too aggravating to play for one very simple reason.\n\nNo windowed mode.\n\nOn a puzzle game, this is not acceptable. I should not be boxed away entirely from everything else I'm doing just so I can focus entirely on a calm, casual puzzle game. Hell, I don't like being boxed away from everyone else for ANY game, but with a puzzle game such as this, that's particularly problematic. It wouldn't even work with DxWnd.\n\nI held onto this game for a while in the hopes windowed mode would be added later. However, the developer seems to have taken a very "Fire and forget" approach to this game, and has actually admitted he's too lazy to implement a windowed mode.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/252130/discussions/0/517142892060966035/\n\nI am sorry, but if the developer isn't making time for us by updating thier mobile port with something so small as a windowed mode, and is outright saying it to people's faces, I'm not making time for the developer. I may change my tune if/when a windowed mode is added, but as of right now I'm a very dissatisfied customer due to this behaviour, and I have requested a refund.","May 15","false","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

I got it originally for mobile and I enjoyed it. Then I saw that it had been ported to Steam and was excited beacuse it had achievements, and I love achievements, and it was Mac compatible so I could play it on my laptop. I played through the entire first world (in full screen because there's no windowed mode) and did not get a single one of the corresponding achievements. They just don't work on Mac.\n\nSince the game hadn't been out on Steam that long, I emailed the devs to make sure they knew about the problem and ask if they would fix it. They said they had no idea there was an issue and they'd look into it. Months later, no update, I email again and am told the devs have moved on. They just made a quick and dirty minimal work required port and have no intention of fixing any issues with it or ever revisiting this game ever again, despite the interest of many customers. I have no respect for that type of developer and do not intend to purchase games from them in the future.","May 16","false","0.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

At first it looked like a try-too-hard-to-be-cute mobile puzzler turned quick steam port cash grab, and it is indeed a port, but oh was I wrong.  From the opening cinematic you know things are slightly off. It reminded me of Happy Tree Friends, turning the cute visuals into a sometimes gruesome scene.  Usually I'm put off by things like this, but this game nails it.  The soundtrack is not something you'd probably throw on while not playing the game, but it is very entertaining.\n\nDown to the gameplay itself:  This is actually one of few puzzle games that I've been infuriatingly stumped by, making the success that much more satisfying.  As the name suggests, the puzzles revolve directly around math and sheep.  Also wolves, lazers, trampolines, and lots of death.

It's cute, but not overly so, with dark humour, that's not overly dark. Small artistic touches abound wherever you look. The music adds to the mood and never becomes irritating. The tune for the Dark World even made me stop playing for awhile just to properly enjoy it.\n\nFor me, it was 10 hours of gameplay over 10 or so sittings. I'd feel like stopping after an hour or two, but I'd be left feeling satisfied rather than drained or bored. This is a good game to relax with now and then, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\n10/10 highly recommended, except for young kids (due to the visceral deaths).

It really makes you think about your moves as it slowly adds in more elements. only on 2-6 so far but i find it hard to STOP playing. the puzzles are very clever and well thought out and once you find yourself feeling like you have the answer you realize you made mistake, thankfully it's a little forgiving as there are no move goals. Just 'save' goals and duct tape (when you play you will see what i mean)\n\nit controls very well, being originally for ap stores, but works very nicely on here anyways. It also doesnt do any hand holding, just a easy stage for you to get how the new element to the puzzle system works then drops you right back into the brain teasers. Though really, it is not all that hard to understand so long you remember your math. I found myself drawing out the puzzles a couple times on graph paper so i could keep track, but that is jsut cuz i tried to figure it out ahead of time. It's simpler to just figure out on go.\n\nthe design fits the game itself to. which jsut helps with the fact it makes me laugh a lot as i play. I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS FOR SENSITIVE KIDS...especially those who like sheep...trust me. not for them. good gaame, but 'no sheep were harmed in the marking of this game' should "apply" if you get what i mean.\n\nworth the buy, especially if you love puzzle games. this one is great and well thought out and very goofy.","November 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But then I'm no fan of match-3 games either.\n\nThe one nice thing it does is that it lets you literally divide sheep in half (you can set the amount of gore from the main menu). Other than that, it's a straight-up puzzler that I think of as a "labyrinth" game: figure out the correct sequence of actions to reach your goal. Some levels have multiple ways to achieve that, but there's no reward for choosing one over the  other. I should also mention that the difficulty ramps up nice and even over the first 30 levels (of 150), and that new mechanics are introduced with little more than a picture hint and an opportunity for the player to research what they do in the next level (that's good).\n\nA small nigle (steam doesn't let me spell this word correctly) I hold against it is that the game seems to favor playing by trial and error: when I want to do it perfectly and figure out a master plan before starting to move the sheep around, the game slows me down by making me do each hop (and animation) separately instead of doing broad sweeps: I wish I could swipe a group of sheep over several hops at once, or maybe swipe a circle on a group of islands and have every group make a hop to the neighboring island. Instead it is hop-wait-hop-wait, and precisely because the game avoids such grander mechanics, it's casual. Oh, and if you didn't turn the music off after 10 minutes I admire your patience. [There's more information on the music in the comments.]\n\nI don't regret paying 0.99 for this game (it is 80% off), but I had hoped for something more memorable which it ultimately isn't.

Music is getting really annoying really fast, but well I wasn't expecting a 10 out of 10 at this price, and  I guess it makes sense since the game is not designed to be played during long periods of time. It's not a problem thought, since you can just disable it and keep the sounds effects.\n\nI'd say you would need like 1 hour/world if you intend to finish it with all stars for each stage, at least for the 3 first world. Therefore I'm not expecting more than 5-6 hours of gameplay with this one.\n\nWould definitely recommend it, if it was a mobile game.\nThe pc port is awfull. You can't customize anything, not even launch this in windowed mode. The UI is unnecessary huge and so on. I wouldn't even call this a port if you ask me, I doubt the devs spent any time thinking of how to improve the experience depending on the platform you play this game on.","November 7, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

An explanation/tutorial what does what is basiclly non-existant, if something new is introduced in a level, you usually have to fail the level once just trying to figure out what it does (and sometimes it doesn't make sense, like the "split-jump-pads" that always shoot a single sheep into the same direction instead of randomly to the left and right). It also doesn't make sense that you're not rewarded if you save all sheep without sacrifycing any. The music - it's upright annoying, it's like a 30 second-loop, repeated over and over again. Play the game for two hours, and you will want to kill the composer. But most of all, the game is not FUN. It doesn't have the slightest surprising moments, it never makes you laugh because something unexpected ot "cute" happened. And even the intro movie (which is poorly executed) with death wanting some sheep companion doesn't make sense and isn't fun.","July 17, 2015","false","2.2"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","1"

Don't be ashamed to look up walkthroughs; often all I personally needed was to see the correct first step, and then I could figure it out properly from there. I found it pleasantly challenging and relaxing at the same time, and there was no real frustration from working through all the variables in each level. Buy it, and buy copies for your friends when they're on sale!","February 29","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few levels are being used as some sort of tutorial to a new type of enemy or block, but the rest is challenging enough. I do miss some settings (there is only a volume slider), such as the ability to change the resolution, and the menus way too large for PC, but other than that it runs and looks great.","July 19, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But felt too much like a mobile game to me.  If you're okay with that aspect I would definitely recommend the game. The animation flows so smoothly. And the art style is just beautiful.  Some of the  levels were too easy, but i found myself being stuck on some levels. Also I think this game needed rewind feature.
