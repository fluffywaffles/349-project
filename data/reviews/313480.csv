That fact of the matter is that you're dealing with total, brutal, and almost perfect simulation of a battle. It has its quirks, and its weak points, but not buying this game is really forcing you to miss out on one of the best WW2 strategy games ever created. Below is a rant and roast of persons saying this game sucks:\n\nFirt, You realize how deadly a fight really is, right? I mean, 80 percent of your casualties are going to be from indirect fire, shrapnel, and explosives anyway. That's a HISTORICAL STATISTIC you can look up. As far as pathfinding, I agree. It is pretty irritating, but that's why you should be using the shift key to manage the path your units take.\n\nEven so, I don't find your review fair, in and of itself. Despite what games like Company of Heroes will display, a tank is not going to bulldoze a damn tree, so not being able to drive through a forest is realistic, open ground means death, cover is an absolute requirement for survival, and stationary tanks and guns are incredibly accurate. A tank or AT gun is essentially a giant rifle, as the grooves in the barrel are pretty much the same as the grooves in a rifle barrel. I found the deadly aspect of weapons refreshing. If you get shot, you're going to die. That's just the way it is. If a round busts through a weak point in a vehicle's armor, its going to be destroyed. Again, that's just the way it is. On some tanks, particularly the German Panther, the armor in the rear is only a few millimeters thick. If that thing gets hit in the rear, either the engine is doomed, and the vehicle is pretty much screwed, or that round is going to travel the length of the tank until it stops. There have been accounts where a bad enough hit on a tank carries enough force to blow the turret off the top of the tank. The HEAT rounds from a Bazooka, PIAT, or Panzerfaust are shape charges, meaning it is designed to literally burn through the armor of a tank and get inside, killing every man in there.\n\nFurthermore, the allied tanks during the war toted weaker armor, less effective weaponry (until high caliber AT guns were placed into them, boasting faster velocities and better ballistic characteristics). Even more, the Germans had the BEST ENGINEERS IN THE WORLD at the time. Most of their military equipment was better in almost every way. The allies won due to sheer numbers and better tactics/strategy. The game boasts encyclopedia knowledge to orient you to the time period and situation, fulfilling a stronger level of immersion. The game's historical accuracy is almost uncontested in comparison to its sequels, and similar games of the time period.\n\nI want to reiterate that you need to realize just how DEADLY combat is. If you make a bad tactical decision, you are going to get your a** kicked. A good tactician takes their disadvantages and turns them into advantages, anyway. Or, he/she mitigates their disadvantages as much as possible to make victory possible.\n\nAlthough, I do, again, have to agree with you about the pathing. It's really heinous, which is why I downloaded a new ailogic.dll I found online, derived from games based on the Blitzkrieg engine, that fixes the problems the AI is having, and many more mods exist in Blitzkrieg communities to make the game better still.\n\nYour review lacks a realistic point of view, thus I must disagree almost entirely with it. You're dealing with an entirely new breed of strategy game with this one. That's why it's so popular with strategists and WW2 grognards alike. Buy this game. NO, SERIOUSLY, BUY IT...\n","December 9, 2015","true","19.8"," 87 of 101 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","87","101","7","10"

I played this game when I was younger but I lost its installer. Now that I have it again. I'm sure that I would play it for hours and hours again!\nThis game is an RTS game without building bases and stuff. What you have is only what you have and you have to beat the enemy with what you have. The AI was quite intelligent for its time, when you use artillery, the enemy reacts with counter battery fire. When you call air support the AI tries to counter it. The battles are very realistic unlike normal RTS, I think they based it on real life data of the weapons used here. There are many more to say but I don't want to give you the reader a wall of text so I'll just say: "If you want a realistic RTS game without building bases and has very limited resources that is set in World War II. Then get this game!"\n\nI hope this review helps.","October 25, 2014","true","18.1"," 46 of 47 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","46","47","0","0"

A few things to know about this game:\n\nTHERE ARE NO BASES - There is something awfully appealing about having a certain ammount of units and being told to capture an area without reinforcements.\n\nThe Campaign is fairly repetitive after a while. Essentially you will end up doing similar convoy missions, town clearing missions, defend the gun emplacement missions etc to get upgraded tanks and artillery.\n\nWithout fail i have hit a point in every campaign where i need a break - Everytime i have played though it (more than two dozen times for each side) I will find that the missions get too repetitive and i need to play something else. I find that this game draws me back like a wasp to jam, and i need to take my units though the campaign so they can go home.\n\nThis game is a relic, it is from 2003, so don't expect fancy graphics, or elaborate game plots. This is exactly what it says on the tin, and without fail i would say that it is the best strategy game I have played. True, it has it's bad points, but every game does, but the magic i got when i first played this game is still there, and it's still worth playing!\n\nI notice that i doesnt have much play time on record, truthfully i have sunk well over 1500 hours into this game, but having just bought it on Steam, i have yet to match this.","October 19, 2014","true","71.5"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","36","36","0","0"

I've remembered when it lagged frequently on my old compaq Pentium 4 computer lol\n\nThis game is so good that I still have my first physical copy installed since 2008 (wanted to play it during that time and it was only about ~800-900 mb so it doesn't tax on your hard drive at all). So since 2008, After playing all the mission that was offered in this game + expansion, I wanted to see if there were any modifications to this game to further enhance my imagination. My god, there was; mods like CSLA and ROK 1950 mod was the best that I've seen for this game and probably was the reason why I never deleted it. If you ever wanted to play this game but in a different time period (i.e. Korean War/Cold War) you should definitely try out the CSLA and ROK 1950s mod (the 'official' blitzkrieg mod forum was shut down [Bk portal] in 2009 but that place had everything, every custom map every mods were there and now its gone....) I'll post link to the mod in the comment (glad to see that the other old sites are still working). With this mod, I had so much fun in playing that I started making tweaks of my own to these mods especially combining these two mods together.\n\nHowever, the issues that exist with these mods are that there is not many of the single player custom missions that comes with it (it takes alot of time scripting each units and making waypoints, such). So you are left with downloading other custom maps and making the missions on your own but again too much time. But these few missions have some memorable missions like the Fuldagap in the CSLA mod where you are holding off the Russian invasion into Western Germany with German and US forces (Of course TONS of new units, new Aircraft animations, helicopters as well).\n\nBottomline: Game is worth every cent, still play it (with mods too), my first WWII strategy game","January 3, 2015","true","16.5"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","22","24","3","2"

I first played through it when it launched back in 2006 and it was a pleasant surprise to see it on Steam a week ago. All of the things I loved are still there. Unit upgrades, unit experience and interesting and compelling missions. Some things irk me today like they did 10 years ago. The pathfinding can be pretty bad at times with units most commonly taking the shortest possible route which has obvious consequences. On "attack" missions the enemy AI usually just waits around for you to attack.\n\nThere are two types of missions, the randomly generated and the historical. The random ones are all right.

It isn't perfect but the way it let's you play and what it allows makes this a real RTS gem. I played a demo back in 2003 and I love the game ever since so I was happy I could replace my scratched up disks with a digital copy. The game itself lets you control infantry, vehicles, tanks and even planes (to a certain limit). And it is LOADS of fun. You can go bulldozer through enemy ranks (if you are lucky) or can instead send a sniper to scout and then blast your enemy with your artillery. The historical missions are great and will make you think. Downside is that the side missions scenario repeats so it gets repeptitive. Also the movement/placement/pathing is a bit obstructed by the 2D graphics and gets annoying sometimes. This also makes the AI glitch up occasionally. I wanna write so much here but in the end it is up to you. This game is awesome, unforgiving and fun so I recommend it to any RTS fans!\n\nP.S.- if you like this game then beware the arcade-like Blitzkrieg 2 or especially Blitzkrieg 3...","June 14, 2015","true","1.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Sudden Strike was one of the most unforgiving RTSs I have ever played and it made little attempt to teach me how to play or any of its mechanics.\n\nBlitzkrieg is kinder in that regard. They had a proper tutorial and explain the components of the game. They also have a much nicer campaign than Sudden Strike. Firstly each campaign starts with pretty much the same kind of level to kind of introduce you to how the game works so it doesn't matter which of the three factions (Allied, German, and Soviet) you choose. Another cool idea was that you pretty much always have the same units at the beginning of each level. You're given two sets of core units (three armored vehicles and three artillery). As you progress you'll unlock newer units and you can earn bonus units when you complete levels and often you'll have a hub where you'll have a few different missions to choose from each with a different bonus. So Blitzkrieg does reward you for picking what battles and what core assets you take with you into battle. Do you want long range artillery or maybe replace some with anti-tank guns? Do you want to gamble with the bonus vehicle you unlocked (which will be lost if it gets killed) or use something more expendible.\n\nI was really surprised by all the things the campaigns had for me to think about.\n\nInfantry is pretty flexible compared to Sudden Strike. Infantry was basically canon fodder in Sudden Strke. They're slow, die easily, most slowly if pinned down, and host of other things. Sudden Strike 2 did introduce the idea that if there was an officer you can order soldiers to stand or line down which was an improvement. Blitzkrieg however offers a wider range. By default infantry will behave like in Sudden Strike and stand by default and go prone if under fire. Or you can have them completely disregard incoming fire and charge your enemy which is actually how you're supposed to deal with enemies inside buildings or tanks. They also made them faster which makes them a lot more dangerous. Additionally infantry will be in 10 man squards by default and trucks can replenish squads which means it's often a better idea to use your infantry than risk your tanks.\n\nThey also reworked a lot of the air support options giving you tactial fighter bombers, good old carpet bombing, recon planes, paratroopers, and air supremacy fighters. This is where I have a complaint, they don't tell you what model planes so when I asked for a bombing run I got fighter bombers instead of bombers. They also don't tell you how many planes are available. I think there was a missed oppurtunity because in the hub this seems like something I should be able to control before the mission.\n\nBlitzkrieg is a massive improvement over the Sudden Strike series (though I still love that game that didn't seem to like me very much) and is a lot fun for people who want an old school RTS or really love World War II. As someone who loves both I love this game.","October 4, 2014","true","12.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is much more slowly unfolding and presents a challenge which is equal parts movement and logistics. Armored units require not just repair but also ammunition which is itself delivered by support vehicles from points scattered around the map. Infantry is fragile yet can peel apart vehicles rather quickly. Engineers are not tasked with erecting full structures and instead focus on trenches, bridges, and mines. Artillery hinges on surprise and concealment. Air power is abstracted and for the most part consists of calling for recon and carpet bombing strongpoints. The campaign game is split between the Allied, Axis, and Soviet fronts.\nThe high attrition found in early missions may frustrate new players. Unit selection is difficult and I often find my clicks unresponsive. It is definetly slow-roasted though and brings something new to PC tactics other than simply unit balance. I recommend this to those who dislike the frantic pace found in most RTS games or looking for something with low system requirements.\n\nUpdate: The game may become locked in high speed while the game speed hotkeys are both non-responsive and non-reassignable. If this happens, a restart should remedy it.","October 30, 2015","true","5.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Graphics are maybe outdated but gameplay is awesome. There are 5 main campaigns with side missions giving you more than 100 hours of gameplay. Everything is about tactics. If you simply throw everything you have at the enemy you will definitely end up in masacre. You must combine infantry with armor, air and artillery support. If you are familiar with ww2 units you will quickly learn the best way to use them. Game also features mission editor. You can create your own battles. I made myself dozens of missions. Blitzkrieg community is still alive. There are so many good mods to give you more units, improved gameplay and so much custom missions that you need years to check them all out. Feel free to contanct for more BK expirience.","March 29, 2015","true","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This makes it annoying to play as the bottom layer of the controls are off the screen as are some other screen items. Changing the config and deconfig file won't help, either will making it read only, the game simply defaults itself back. From menu screen to in game screen it also defaults from 1024x768 to 1600x900 (or whatever res you set), a pity, used to love this old gem.\n\nYou simply can not force it to 1920 x 1080 despite some people saying you can, so be aware. Playing lower than 1600x900 really dates the game horribly imo and you are forced to pause it continually to scroll around the map whereas in a decent sized res you would not have this issue.","April 22","false","0.8"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Had countless times artillery trucks just drive into the enemy at the start when I told them to only move to the other side of the warehouse or units getting stuck on each other for no reason and requiring your intervention to pry them apart one at a time.\n- Enemy AI artillery is psychic and relentless. You better not hope your map is somewhere cold or dusty, cause if one of your men so much as sneezes, the enemy AI will pinpoint it's arty to fire on him and his buddies. God forbid if you fire your own arty.\n- The amount of AA the enemy has is a little on the stupid side. Especially compared to the two you start with.\n- Enemy AI also know exactly where your sneaking your troops around and send a scout plane at the area so it can make you feel less like it's cheating when its arty's your ♥♥♥♥\n\nAgain, I like this game and its fun if the enemy isn't going to have arty but that's not common later on.","May 13","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
