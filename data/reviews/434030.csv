Okay.... but far from a true flight sim..... are IPACS going to stick to this path?\n\nThe current flight model is way off the mark. For example, the C172 flies like a stunt plane (inverted, outside loops and unrealistic climb rate to name but a few!) It stalls, but doesn't feel real, no spin entries etc. Its far too easy to land and, when taxiing, it behaves like a go-kart! Crosswinds aren't challenging at all and you can throw the thing around the sky with unrealistic ease - Basically, it feels like a Smartphone game on 'Easy mode'.\n\nIt is very nice to look at, with smooth frame rates and lovely cockpit detailing. Photo textures are, for the most part, very nice, but away from the airports they can sometimes reduce to very low-res blocks. I guess this isn't a real problem and can be addressed later on. Likewise, the 3d objects overlayed are nice when they're there, but quite sparse in places. No road traffic or night lighting outside of the airstrips (a real downside). However, as early access this should be too much to worry about.... yet.\n\nInteractive cockpits not really there yet and there's little in the way of any challenges or incentives to learn more about the aircraft and how it operates.\n\nSo what's the point to Aerofly FS 2? I just don't know - especially If it maintains its current form, its neither sim nor game.\n\nMy prediction? If they're isn't a major commitment by IPACS to develop the software, then I see it as a quick bit of fun for newcomers to flight sims. But, when the novelty wears off, so the interest will too and they'll rarely come back to it. Maybe this is what Aerofly is aiming at? a simply to learn, viually impressive self-contained sim/game that they get a decent amount of $$$ for and don't need to invest anything further in it? I hope not. I haven't used Aerofly 1 FS, but I get the feeling this is what happened to it - it was a fairly well polished and visually-appealing product, but stayed that way for years and was never really updated (price always stayed high too!).\n\nIf IPACS are serious about developing this into the next-generation of flight sim and attract established flight simmers then they've a lot more to do to stand a chance. I hope they do, I like X-plane a lot, but get frustrated by the amount of tweaking and time it takes to improve visuals, get scenery to work etc (I know some people do this with ease, and kind of obsess over it!) But I honestly dream of a good next-gen flight sim, where plugins and DLC are auto-installing and don't require hours of work and frustration. I suppose I had some hopes in this product....\n\nIn summary - visually - very promising and good initial FPS. But the 'simulation' lacks any real depth - nothing to challenge anyone and therefore not a simulator.... yet. It is worth trying out though, hence a 'cautious' recommend, but at £30 it is bit a gamble depending on what direction IPACS decide to take.","May 19","true","2.6"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

I always felt AeroflyFS was more about the feeling of flying rather than the technicalities of it. To that end they made sure it looked beautiful and ran smoothly, and yes they made a lot of compromises to acheive that. Aerofly 2 seems stuck in the middle, it tries to be more technical than the first but falls flat compared to FSX, it tries to be grander in scale than the first one and in doing so sacrifices it's gorgeous looks. Yes it looks great around the airports, but I'm struggling to find anywhere to fly where the textures don't turn to mush 1km past the runway. There is an actual line where the textures go from fairly hi res to just a big blur.\nI'm going to see if I can import the new aircraft into Aerofly 1 and maybe then it won't have been a total waste of money.","May 19","false","4.9"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","32","47","2","5"

The photo-based approach lacks ugly roads cutting through houses, airports cut out of the background, and all the other unnatural disadvantages of landlass based simulators.  It's just this unique, consistent view I like best on Aerofly FS 2. The airports I visited are well done, not quite to compare to the best payware FSX/P3D airports, but given two of those cost the same as the whole Aerofly FS2 they are very well-done.  I am not a pilot to judge the flight model, but with 25 years of simming experience I find the C172 (that's the only one I tried in depth) properly behaving and not overly simplified. Performance is outstanding on my dated (i7-2600/3.4GHz GTX970) system, but it has to be seen if this will survive after adding more features. All my Saitek controls (including the TrimWheel) worked out of the box, buttons can be programmed, however I would like to see the Panels/FIPs working as well. Overall I like the User Interface, while a few points (e.g. on the controls screen) could be improved.\n\nThe one single feature which in my opinion MUST be added for VFR pilots like me is some sort of 3D buildings. While high-rises in SF, LA etc. are there and look pretty well, downtown SF is essentially flat, which I am willing to live with for early access but not for the final sim. There must be some sort of generic buildings - either OSM based like X-Plane has (preferred) or at least autogen based as FSX/P3D does.\n\nThe next important thing is to get others (payware as freeware) developers involved. IPACS said they are committed to this, and I only wish them (and us users) success.","May 23","true","4.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful, the photoscenery really adds a nice touch.  However, there are many blurry areas in it.  And the scenery only covers CA and AZ.  Some airports are very detailed while others are bare bones.  It won't please the low and slow flyers, both those into aerobatics and high flying jetliners should be pleased.  The weather system is complicated and no real-world weather ability exists.  There is also no AI or ATC.  I had the occassional stutter as the scenery tiles attempted to load but that may just be my PC as others are reporting smooth results.  Overall, I like it, and hopefully it improves over time.

This is not a high-fidelity, complex, by-the-book flightsim like X-Plane; it's a sim for a Friday evening after a long week, when you just want to experience the sheer joy of throwing an aircraft around the sky and looking out the window at the view. The scenery captures the bright light of California and the crisp desert air of Arizona and Nevada really well, and if you happen to live in the area that's a bonus (I just found a hiking trail near my apartment that I didn't even know was there!). But it's such an iconic area that most people in the world will find the locations oddly familiar and well worth sightseeing. An evening flight around the long shadows and red rocks of Sedona, soaking up the clean morning light along the Pacific shore, or taking a high-speed buzz up the Vegas strip at night are just a joy. Even the moon is the right size, which is unheard of in flightsims...\n\nI do hope the flight models develop a bit further - the planes are too easy to fly right now and they lack the fluidity, rushing air noises and incipient sense of panic that flying normally provides, but it's still early access yet and I've only had it a few hours - maybe cranking up the turbulence will help.\n\nEDIT: After a couple more flights I think the flight models are really pretty good after all. And the graphics are just beautiful. If they can add a few more of the systems this is really going to up the ante for flight simulation.","May 23","true","12.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Also, the aerodynamics require quite a bit of work, especially with the heavy metals.

They'll raise an eyebrow at the possibility to have a HUD that displays flight info, and the straightforward, fairly simple interface for creating a flight plan. Yes, this is not a sim for people who love to spend 6 hours of time planning and executing a 2 hour flight. It's a sim for people who want realistic flight physics, systems that do not require a real-world pilot's license to operate, and who want to focus on experiencing flight on a working person's schedule.\n\nThe main downside of this sim is that it is currently limited to the southwestern US (Arizona, Nevada, California, basically), and players from other parts of the world won't find familiar cities and airports just yet. The rest of the world is included theoretically, but doesn't have any airports. These will however likely be released later and hopefully be part of the core game, not DLC.\n\nVisuals are excellent, although this is negated somewhat by the empty world. There are as of right now no other planes in the air, and only static ones on the ground. Weather simulation is also a bit barebones, as is the UI (which was ported from mobile but will be changed later, according to the developer). However, one thing I have to stress is that the game's performance is absolutely top-notch. It runs far better than bug-ridden FSX and badly optimized X-Plane. If performance is a concern to you, do not worry.\n\nAll in all, I recommend buying Aerofly FS 2 to anyone who is looking for a mid-core flight sim. There simply are no others out there. If you're after something more complex, you probably already know which sim to use anyway (it starts with a P and you're not supposed to use it :) )","June 4","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I figured that because this is a "light" simulator that there would be missions or things to do or maybe even a career mode or a mode where I can start my own Airline and whatnot... however it seems that there is nothing to do but fly around... also, the reasons behind making the advanced tutorials (flight school) only aviable after finishing the easy tutorials (things that are no challenge to a seasoned pilot) is very unclear to me as it prohibits free gameplay when the other (free flight mode) is nothing but free gameplay...\n\nAll in all it is nice eyecandy but not worth 50 bucks to me yet... maybe once there are cool addons and missions and a career mode it will be and at that point I will buy it again but for now I´m sorry to say but I will ask for a refund...\n\nDon´t get me wrong it looks good and the planes are cool but I expect more in the year 2016 than what I did back in 2000 and even that is not delivered (talking about FSX).\n\nA personal note to the devs from a game designer´s standpoint: Don´t try to compete with FSX on realism or content, try to beat it with awesome gameplay, career mode and graphics (one out of 3 done) ;)","May 20","false","0.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

The greater the altitude the more beautiful and crisp they are.\n\nFly around San Francisco and the Bay area just magnificent with KSFO the main airport.\n\nBeautifully textured interiors of the planes and exteriors.\n\nAutogen and trees. The trees are not always put in the right places and look goofy sometimes but nice addition to the photoreal textures.\n\nDecent assortment of planes\n\nOk flight planning given the limited implementation\n\nNight lighting is  poor - only some buildings and houses have lighting but no road lightning and thus the magnificent city SF looks way to dark and poor. Same with all other areas. Nightlighting needs huge amount of work particularly as it relates to roadways.\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nYou can scroll your plane to anywhere in the world and you will get there. Example Great Britain. No textures or anything  (there is elevation data and basic ground texture which is blurry) but if you have place markers on, the relevant names will show up. So the skeleton is there to implement worldwide going forward.\n\nThis is 64 bit and the framerates are great with everything maxed.\n\nDecent UI.\n\nThere is huge potential here. With the developers getting on board, creation of capable and fully functional planes, airports, worldwide data, AI, etc. there is the making of a significant flightsim.\n\nWhat exists, is nice, fun, in a lot of ways beautiful with the photoreal/autogen combo, but leaves you waiting and wanting more. Best suited now for VFR flying in uncontrolled airspace. But this is early access. Good luck developers because this could be a very fruitful sim going forward.","May 23","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
