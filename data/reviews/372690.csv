After doing a little digging around (there are only like... 3 youtube reviews; the game released today), I decided to take the plunge and purchase the game.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nChiptune Champion is a Guitar Hero clone that exclusively uses chiptunes for the tracks you play to. Being a kid from the 80s, the music definitely brought back memories of summer vacations spent on the NES and Gameboy. There's a wide selection of music to choose from the outset, and the ability to create your own tracks in the track editor or download tracks from the Steam Workshop gives this game the huge potential for massive replayability.\n\nSo that's the good part.\n\nThe bad part is the control scheme. What Chiptune Champion wants you to do is take your keyboard and hold it like a guitar. The 1-5 buttons are used for the "strings" while the enter and shift are used for the strum bar. Holy smokes is that unintuitive.\nIt took my wife asking me what I was doing to the keyboard to convince me to go down into the basement looking for one of my old Guitar Hero controllers. And surprisingly, it worked.\nWhile there is no ability to use a guitar controller from inside the game, downloading a free program like JoyToKey will allow you to map the game's controls to the buttons on your guitar, making the control scheme infinitely better and nearly identical to playing Guitar Hero or Rockband.\n\nSo do I recommend the game? Yeah, but only if you have a guitar controller that is compatible with your PC. The game is pretty fun and the music is great. The controls could use a little work and hopefully the game will eventually support an in-game guitar control scheme instead of players needing to use a third party.","January 8","true","8.2"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","34","41","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gammalyrae/recommended/372690/","gammalyrae","NEKØ | Gamma Lyrae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gammalyrae/","207 products in account","Note: The developer updated the game to address the two biggest complaints I had with this game. I have updated this review to reflect this.\n\nI'll start off with the negative. Often when I read reviews about a game, I want to know what's wrong with it first and foremost, so that's what i'll provide.\n\nThis game has a few technical problems. There is only one lag compensation setting, forcing you to synch the game to line up visually or line up audibly, just like the original Guitar Hero game on the PS2. Guitar Hero 2, a game released in 2006, had a separate compensation value for the video and audio to account for each device having separate latencies. It's frustrating that a rhythm game released this year has overlooked a problem that its influences have already solved. Additionally, on Windows 10, closing the game crashes it. Some process related to the game remains open, causing steam to track additional playtime for it. If you're on the fence about keeping this game and are a part of the 30%+ people on Steam that use Windows 10, be aware that this bug may cause you to run over the 2 hour window for returns.\n\nThe interface isn't perfect. Many rhythm games will give you a preview of the song you've selected when you highlight it in the track list, but this game keeps playing the menu music for you. It can make it a little harder to find the songs you like.\n\nOn to what's good!\n\nThe developers read my review and took into consideration my feedback, as well as the feedback of others. A patch came out addressing some major issues within 36 hours of this review, which buys them a lot of respect in my book. It's a sign that they care and weren't just looking to dump a game on Steam and never touch it again, as some other Indie devs often do. To be perfectly honest, I am waiting for another patch or two before I personally re-invest in this title. But the soundtrack is quite nice (i've listened to it outside of the game), and reports from other users suggest that the changes to note timing have made the game much more fun to play. I think this warrants a purchase and would recommend this title if you like rhythm games and chiptunes.\n\nI fully anticipate that i'll have to continue to update this review to reflect changes made by the developer. When I re-invest in the title myself, i'll be able to talk more objectively about what I enjoy in the game.","January 9","true","7.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","35"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/372690/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Chiptune Champion is a rhythm game that fully takes gameplay from games like Guitar Hero, but has retro design and ubiquitous 8bit chiptunes.\n\nThere are two mods: Strum mode for those who want to experience it in Guitar Hero style, and tap mode for those who rather prefer the StepMania gameplay. Those two mods are further deepened by three difficulties, with rookie really friendly for new players without built reflexes - if you are new to the genre, you'll definitely have to start there. Other two difficulties expect some training from you, but beating songs on higher difficulty is mentally rewarding.\n\nThere are many 8bit chiptune songs (about 40) and if that's not enough for you, there is the track editor and Steam workshop support! You can already find there, for example, tracks from Sonic the Hedgehog, or for true internet connoisseurs there is John Cena's theme in 8bit ready. Due to possible copyright problems, you have to download the mp3 songs externally and then link them with proper note file in-game, but that small bother is worth for the result.\n\nOnly one thing I didn't like about Chiptune Champion is the resolution scaling. You can play only in windowed mode or on scaled fullscreen with black borders around. Otherwise it's definitely nice indie game that brought me many years back when I was playing Guitar Hero III and wanted to crush my keyboard.\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Chiptune Champion was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 31","true","0.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The game, for whatever reason, gave me a horrible headache and had the room literally spinning for about 20 minutes, after an hour of gameplay. This issue doesn't seem to be widespread, but keep it in mind if you have any motion sickness issues with games. Text review continues below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDQKi6RlDk\n\nThis is basically Chiptune Guitar Hero, played with your keyboard. The music is great, and the interface (while extremely limited) works well. The controls are customizable, but on default you're using 1-5 (1-4 on easy) for what would be the colored buttons on the guitar if you were playing GH. It took some getting used to, and I found it difficult to get back on track when I flubbed once, but I don't think the controls could be any better. With more playtime I'm sure it would feel 100% natural.\n\nUnfortunately I won't be playing the game anymore, but if you aren't sensitive to visual issues like I discussed in the opening, then give the game a shot.","January 10","true","0.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/372690/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Rhythm games were always a guilty pleasure of mine. The genre regained something of a small resurge thanks to Crypt of the Necrodancer and Chiptune Champion looks to open a new year in style with some toe tapping melodies. Chiptune Champion is a challenging rhythm game with an interesting control concept and the ability to create and add your own chiptune songs.\n\nThe game plays like a retro version of Guitar Hero, the only difference is that you hold your keyboard like a weird keytar (a guitar keyboard) as you time the buttons to the rhythm of the music to rack up score. The whole presentation is bare-bones, but it gets the job done. Notes come from the top of the screen and the appropriate number key needs to be held while pressing the enter key on time, very similar to how Guitar Hero and Rock Band are played.\n\nGames like this live and die on their music. Chiptune Champion comes with 40 ‘official songs’ from artist like MegaWolf77, 8BitHeros and Rymdkraft. They cover a broad range of different types to chiptune and the majority of them are pretty great songs. Each song comes with 3 different difficulty levels that add an additional challenge to make the game harder to master. Of course, games like this wouldn’t be complete without leaderboards to compete against the world. Players who score high enough can get featured on one of the leaderboards, weekly or all time. Only your highest score on a song counts, so no worries about a single person holding multiple spots on the leader board like in an old style arcade game.\n\nOne the best parts about this Chiptune Champion isn’t its Guitar Hero style gameplay, but the fact that you can also create your own songs and then share them across the internet. On top of the included 40 songs the game also features the Track Editor which allows players to create their very own chiptunes songs and share them on the Steam Workshop. The tutorial for the game links over to YouTube. According to the developer Blake Garner the tutorial was so long that he found video to be a more appropriate medium than a giant wall of text. The tutorial video is clear and easy to follow. Everything is explained very well, allowing you to start making music in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe graphics are simple but fun. They fit the game perfectly and work wonderfully with the 40+ songs in game. Despite all of the songs being chiptunes, there is a surprising amount of range to the music included in the game. Some songs are very poppy and catchy, while others seem like they fell straight out of Castlevania. This does a great job of preventing the game from becoming stale or the songs from becoming annoying over time.\n\nChiptune Champion strips away a lot of the rubbish that other games have. No gimmicks, no cumbersome cross genre game play. Just good old fashion tap along to the beat. It’s hard, sure, but that means that when you eventually manage to get through a song it feels all the better. It’s something that steam until now surprisingly has seemed to have lacked.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun rhythm game with cheerful graphics and fun chiptunes that are guaranteed to trigger your nostalgia. With over 40 songs and latency adjustments to fit your device, this game is already a pretty good buy at $9.99, but the Track Editor is by far the biggest selling point to this game. The ability to easily create your own song and share it with players on the Steam Workshop is just amazing. I won’t at all be surprised to see this game stick around for a long time just for that aspect alone. If you are a fan of rhythm games, I definitely recommend checking out Chiptune Champion.","February 16","true","16.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I feel there's a lack of Guitar Hero/Rock Band-like games on Steam and this one delivers. All the official songs are chiptune music as you would imagine, but you can find some "normal" songs on the workshop. I feel the game still lacks a few relevant features, like a countdown timer after you unpause and controller support (you can use Xpadder for that, though), but overall it's a pretty fun experience.","March 5","true","19.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Yes you do have the option of using a guitar controller, but you have to download a program to make this work.  In my opinon though, you should play with a keyboard, it really is not that bad.  I was very skeptical at first, but after rebinding the keys to my liking I was playing with no problem at all.\n\nLastly, there is workshop support, this is what makes the game worth buying.

I routinely practice on games like O2jam, SM5, LR2 and others, so i was extremely hyped to see a VSRG on the Steam market for the first time ever!\n\nLet me start off by saying that the music is absolutely awesome. Great Production quality and sounds are fantastic. Fourty songs at release is also pretty good, and the best thing is the Workshop implementation, that is crucial!\n\nAnnnnd Its completely unplayable for me because of the strumming mechanic. I get why games such as RockBand and Guitar Hero would implement that, because on a guitar you STRUM the notes. You dont do that for pixel Chiptune music, and even less on a keyboard, no matter what type of instrument we are supossed to be playing.\n\nIm refunding the game until a No-Strum mode will be added, as the Dev so said in the Discussions tab for the game.\n\nI really, really hope that this game is going to go big. Our genre is dying, and seeing a VSRG on the Steam market just let my jaw drop instantly. For the current state of the game, I really cannot recommend it, but I will anyways because I have faith in the game and hope that this will be a popular game, sparking other Devs and Companies to finally try to produce more Rhythm Games and attract the crowd.","January 9","true","0.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pembury/recommended/372690/","Pembury","Papa Pem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pembury/","199 products in account","NOTE: This review is only based on the No-Strum mode and aimed at people who have seen this game and are players of VSRGs like stepmania, osu!mania, o2jam, anything like that.\n\nIf like me you saw the introduction of the No-Strum mode and thought it was cool that there is a game like this on steam, be warned: the one fatal flaw with this game is that you cannot set a custom scroll speed, there are two options, "slow" and "fast", though IMO they should be renamed "slow" and "slow" cause that's what they really are to anybody who's even slightly compitent at any other game like this.\n\nthe second problem is the difficulty. I do want to say that this is only based on the official songs, as I'm sure once the community grows challenging charts will be available on the workshop. The expert mode is not that hard at all, if you've played any other VSRG for even a few months you will easily be able to 100% the expert charts, however like I said this is not really an issue I feel the dev should focus on as it's really up to the community to create harder charts. the steam acheivements are also very easy to obtain and I gained them all in around 3 hours and it only took that long because of the "clear 50 songs" achievement which takes the most time.\n\nAnother issue - No mods. not even the ability to speed up a song, I feel even if there were speed modifiers you could at least challenge yourself a bit with the built in charts, but no.\n\nAnother Issue that isn't really an issue more of a "I wish this feature was in this game", there is no timing judgements, only "hit" or "miss",  so there is no real accuracy meter in this game, the percentage it gives you at the end is just the amount of notes you hit, it doesn't go deeper than that. though like i said I don't really think this is an issue that needs to be fixed, more of something I'd like to see in the game.\n\nDespite of all these flaws, I have actually grown to like the game in the short time I've played it.\n\nI feel I've been harsh considering this is not supposed to be the kind of game I went into it thinking it was, at it's heart it's supposed to be more like guitar-hero than anything else and you should really consider that before rushing in to buy it.\n\nThe songs that come with the game are good, and the charts (although not as challenging as I'd like them to be) are mapped fairly well and the majority are honestly fun to play.\n\nHonestly, if you're wondering if you should buy this game or not, it really depends what you're looking for in it.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun 5-key experience with nice songs, nice charts, and you're not really looking for a challenging experience. go for it, the game is genuinely fun.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a new VSRG to play to actually challenge you and maybe improve your 5k skills, I don't think this is the game for you, you could literally go play any other vsrg for free and get more challenge and improve your skill much faster.\n\nSo Overall, I would reccomend this game, but make sure it's what you're looking for, I bought this game thinking it was something it wasn't and initially didn't like it, but I've grown to like it for what it is. I'd like to restate that this whole review is based only on the No-Strum mode and all my points are aimed at VSRG players who are decent at their games. This review kinda turned into more of a "things i wish were in this game" but I think I made some valid points that would help others like me decide if they want to spend the money and buy this game or not.","January 16","true","4.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","1"

I had no problems with lag or off-beat notes as I could easily set up my offset! The only real "problem" i encountered is having the fullscreen not scale to my screen. Sure, it plays in fullscreen, but with a big black border around it. This is not a problem though as I normally play games in windowed mode. Don't listen to the people who say you can't use controllers or the game being off-beat. It works fine!

The mouse clicking between charts, while feasible, is slightly annoying. I just wanna be able to control it all with buttons so it would be easier and faster to play.\n\n- More visible combo meter. I want to be able to see if I have a wicked combo goin on without having to look to the far left every single time. maybe have it below the buttons or on top of them with a low opacity?\n\n- The ability to have the white notes be registered while you strum. guitar hero had it this way and it makes it so much easier when the white notes are being played in slow sections.","January 8","true","8.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

When I stop these buttons from sticking, you better believe I'm coming for #1 on every leaderboard.","January 9","true","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Out of the entire games they released I would only really like 3 or 4 songs. In This game I really enjoy a majority of the tracks they have, and having your own track editor and workshop to download user made songs and such is really great. I did play StepMania a bit before this so I was used to how tap mode works, however this game seems to be a bit more unforgiving, and you have to be a bit more precise with your taps (maybe? I could be paranoid). Over all I really enjoy the game, still trying to get the last achievement for 75k score, and I highly recommend it.","January 26","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

This is more like guitar hero, hit the strum button while keeping the highlighted notes pressed, but the game throws a curveball with the notes that have the white dot, which you just hit the note without pressing the strum button. Developer, if you're reading this please allow a way to customize the play styles so that players can choose whether they want to include the strumming, or strum-less keys. For what it's worth, it's still good, has lots of tracks, custom track feature, etc, but could use some more options on the player side to customize play style. Also doesn't let you change things like note drop speed, which would be a nice addition. Also, the graphics aren't flashy like the beatmania arcade games. Developer, I suggest possibly adding some fireworks, light shows, and a streak counter that's placed a little more towards the center for visibility. Also the ability to change how tracks are sorted in the list, as well as a track audio preview so we can hear the song before we decide to play it. Please treat this current version of the game as an alpha, and keep updating it! Please take cues from the beatmania arcade game! Otherwise, love it!","January 8","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can only scale it up 2 or 3 times and then there is a giant black border around the entire game.\n\nThere is no automatic sound/monitor syncing, you have to exit out to the main menu, go into settings, and manually enter a number between -100 and 100, then go back into a level and try again.\n\nThe game uses prerecorded audio tracks rather than playing the notes live as they are pressed. Better for low-end computers, but it causes the gameplay to suffer. If you miss a note, the music continues to play, you just hear an annoying sound that the note was missed. It should not play the music if you miss the note. Worse yet, the music and the notes occasionally desync, because the notes were just placed there by someone who thinks that is where the music plays at, not EXACTLY where the music plays at.\n\nThere does not seem to be any progression, not even a tutorial. You can pick any song and the difficulty does not go up as you play the next song available. The next song is sometimes MUCH easier than the previous.\n\nThere probably should be 4 difficulty levels, not 3.\n\nDifficulty level 1 would be 3 notes playable and few notes of the song show up.\nDifficulty level 2 would be 4 notes playable.\nDifficulty level 3 would be 5 notes playable.\nDifficulty level 4 would be 5 notes playable and all the notes of the song show up.\n\nThat would be better for personal progression of getting better at the game. Those who have never played a music rythm game like this will most likely be overwhelmed by 4 notes at the current easiest difficulty.","January 9","false","0.3"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

The game is very simplistic, but contains an incredible amount of potential for different situations.\n\nChiptune Champion creates such an interactive situation for itself where players can play along to 8-bit tracks designed for the game, it gives a gameplay experience that can leave players joyful, energetic, and humored. The tracks are very well-designed, and are so catchy that you'll want to replay quite a lot of them in order to get better high scores. Players will always feel challenged, and creates a situation that can motivate players to take on that challenge.\n\nAmong this is a great amount of customization, with the ability to download custom songs, or to make your own with quite a level of ease. If you are to grow bored of the songs that come with the game, or require a change of scenery, you can always search the workshop for the game and find custom songs created by other people. A downside to this, however, is that since this game is relatively new, not many songs have been created, and there isn't much of a dedicated community for this game. Hopefully in time that changes.\n\nMy only main criticism for this game is the bright backgrounds of the game. Playing this game for long periods of time can and will leave you nauseated and dizzy, and you are required to take frequent breaks from the game if you suffer from these effects, and if you're epileptic, it can cause some massive issues. I believe that there is a way to turn it off, but the only option is to turn the background into a solid black color, which can be quite demotivation, and takes away from the environment the game is trying to create.\n\nThat being said, I would still highly recommend this game if you have played StepMania, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, or DDR in the past, and are a fan of in any variety.","May 9","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Original review is below:\n\nI'm loving this game thus far, but I'd advise others to wait until a patch or a few. The mechanics work well, at least for me, and the addition of being able to chart whatever songs you want, and upload them to the Workshop, is really promising (note though that this feature only uploads the chart itself, anyone who subscribes is required to locate their own audio). And I myself dig the soundtrack; chiptune isn't everyone's thing, though, so take that with a grain of salt. The note charts are also fun and challenging; if you're like me, and can pass most songs on Guitar Hero and Rock Band with flying colors, then this game has you covered with fun charts.\n\nThere are a few bugs, and some things that need to be worked on. For starters, I've experienced a crash during a really fast segment of a song, which is rather troublesome for a game with some really hard songs on it. The song editor could also use some features, such as time signature settings (I guess technically most chiptune is in 4/4, but what if someone were to chart something a bit more proggy, and it has a time signature of X/8?), more specific BPM (as well as higher BPMs thans 200), notes faster than 32nds (a lot of chiptune has really fast sweeps, so I'm surprised there isn't anything higher than 32nd notes), and some sort of visual display of where the audio is, so you can line your chart up right without having to rely mostly on your ears.\n\nI don't recommend this game yet. But the dev says they'll work more on it. Maybe after a patch or two, this'll be the kickass game it has the potential to be. I'll update this review when that happens.","January 9","false","19.9"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","3"

So a lot of my opinions and comparisons are from such point of view.\n\nNow let's get into "Chiptune Champion"!\n\n----Main Description----\nThis game is wonderful, it's filled with amazing chiptune tracks, and fun to play charts to go with them. It has a very usable chart editor, that doesn't take too much of your time to learn and use. Though a few things are different from the formula/engine of the official Guitar Hero franchise (none of them are really "bad" they're just different):\n\n1.The menu navigation uses a mouse:\nNothing really too bad about this, it can't just get a bit tedious if you're doing a marathon of songs and trying to stay in the groove.\n\n2.The HO/PO's (Hammer-on/Pull-offs) cannot be strummed unless the previous note/notes have been missed:\nThis is a bit of a problem for people who are used to the original Guitar Hero mechanics (like myself), and can take a day or two of playing to get used to. But this does create some interesting difficulty in certain songs, so I wouldn't say it should be removed from the game entirely.\n\n3. No "Game only" controller compatability:\nThis is a bit dissapointing for me, and would be a total game killer if there weren't other ways to use your controller anyway. But still, I can't get over the fact that I have to start up my copy of Joy2Key just to use my licensed guitar hero controller for this game.\n\n----Aspect ratings----\nGraphic: 9/10\nLove the 8-Bit style of the art, it fits very well with the music, and keeps you in the mood to play the game. Though the background colors constantly changing, you can get distracted easily when playing a song or just sitting around on the menu.\n\nMusic: 99999999999999999999/10\nIt's chiptune, do I have to say much more? Okay, fine, the music is very great, and is perfect for the casual or non-casual chiptune lover (and if you don't like chiptune, then what are you doing trying to buy a game with chiptune IN THE TITLE)\n\nDesign: 8/10\nThe design of the game is FLAWLESS other than the menu portion (More specificaly the mouse navigation I mentioned earlier)\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nGreat! Great!!! GREAT!!! Recreates the Guitar Hero engine flawlessly! Plus it gives some extra quirks to make it fresh and new!\n\n----Overall Rating: 9/10----\nTakes a bit to get used to it, but after that, wonderful game! Great for anyone who loves rhythm gaming, or just the guitar hero part of it!\n","January 11","true","24.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Chiptune Champion is basically a sweet little refreshing treat after playing all those main bulky rhythm games. And to add on to that, it is also that taste and satisfaction of eating your most favorite dessert, to give a better analogy.\n\nIt is a quirky little chiptuney masterpiece that makes you giddy on every song you play, and I don't think any other rhythm game nails this experience better than Chiptune Champion. (Not that I have encountered, atleast.)\n\nIt seems to usually be upbeat and every note of each song strongly follows each beat of the song, which makes it extremely fun when you've gotten the pattern of each song. This is especially fun when switching from Medium to Expert difficulty.\n\nThere are two (2) modes, TAP and STRUM.\nBasically, TAP is how any other vertical rhythm game would work, i.e. O2Jam, Osu mania, and some arcade favorites. You tap when the note gets to the beat pad/line.\n\nSTRUM is basically how Guitar Hero, Guitar Freaks, and Rock Band guitars would work. You hold the note, then use the strum key as soon as it hits the beat pad/line.\n\nI am used to TAP vertical scrolling rhythm games, but STRUM is also fun because I don't really get to play the three stated guitar games that often.\n\nOverall, Chiptune Champion is simply a delightful vertical scrolling rhythm game that no rhythm game fan should miss!\nI am a huge rhythm game fan, and as soon as I saw this hitting the market, I bought it immediately and I do not regret my decision one bit.\n\nRecommended.","May 7","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The timing is clunky, and it feels like I missed notes I should've hit, even on beginner. And worst of all, the songs are just boring.

If you're looking for a Guitar Hero clone on PC you can try Frets on Fire which is also free, though I can't vouch for it personally. Just... whatever you do, you probably want to skip this game and keep your $10.

The way I saw it before I bought the game was that people would put songs on the work shop that you could then download and play, Super easy and convenient. HOWEVER this is not the case. To play a song downloaded from the workshop you must already have that song downloaded on your computer. All you download is a "beatmap" that the person made for a song. So if you want say a song from Sonic, you would have to download it off the workshop (or create the beatmap yourself), then find the same exact version of the Sonic song they used to make there beatmap on the internet and download it, then import it into your game. So if you are looking to increase the low number of songs in this game with the workshop good luck, you have some tedious work ahead of you.\n\nTLDR - Workshop is cumbersome and inconvenient, and should not be looked at as a feature for this game.\n\nBuy this game if you love rythm games, if not wait until it goes on sale.","January 14","false","13.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It presents a five button rhythm game, and unfortunately kneecaps itself immediately, by having easy mode be only a four button game.\n\nRhythm games are always too easy on easy mod. As an experienced rythm gamer, I naturally want to double tap, and that's not a part of easy mode. Like in all rhythm games, easy mode is just too easy: it's not any fun! And when you can't even practice using five buttons, it means that there's no enty point into the real game.\n\nMedium difficulty level, is just that. There is no "easy" song, to practice five notes on. With no way to turn off the life meter--that I can see--there is literally no way to practice five button mode. You actually have to go into, frankly a pretty difficult song, everytime, and grind out 45 second practice sessions until you make it through a whole song.\n\nIn my view, that is a critical mistake. Only a hardcore player will do that, and I expect that a hundred previous reviews of this game, are by hardcore players.\n\nYes, if you can play an entire five button song: it is fun!!! The visuals are great, and the music is fantastic! And there's a great number of songs, too! But unless you're already a hardcore rhythm game fanatic, then this game does not offer a learning curve that lets you have fun on the way to reaching that level.\n\n\n\n\nEasy mode is too easy! And without some genuine "beginner five button stages," the experience is not fun, unless you're willing to put in the practice.\n\n\n\n\nThe music is really great. That works against this game, because being unable to hear ->any song<- to completion, is just unsatisfying. Yes, it's fun, if you can get there: and I believe a lot of players will not be willing to make that journey. And until they do, the game is not fun. I have a pretty good amount of practice, so I can learn this game and make it through a five button song, but it wasn't fun to reach that level. Without "fun" being easily reachable by many players, I do not think this is a game I can recommend for most players. I like the difficulty of these songs--as an experienced rhythm game player--but there needs to be some easier points of entry for new players; otherwise I'm recommending many people have a not-fun experience.\n\nCan I recommend it to hardcore rhythm game fans: yes, absolutely, and I encourage you to play it.\n\nCan I recommend it to beginner players -> or to intermediary players, of any type!! <-  No.  I can't. Easy mode is not well enough made to be fun. And there is no way to practice five button mode, so players can become better by practicing a song in a relaxed way. It's not a fun game for these players.\n\nCan I recommend this game? No.","May 25","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's very much like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, except instead of using a plastic guitar, you use your keyboard! It actually works and feels more comfortable than I would've imagined ( plus it gives you that guitar feel ). Also the game has a song editor which means limitless music for everyone to enjoy! I've already published a song and uploaded it to workshop without any issues. I found it very easy to understand and it only took me an hour or two of my time to learn and finish my project. I highly recommend this game, because with a bigger community this game could be the definite music game for Steam 9/10.","January 8","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just needs some touching up. First of all, I wouldn't even consider the workshop to be usuable at the time. You need to have the EXACT song used already downloaded as a mp3. And this mainly applies to me... but damn this hard. Not so much the game itself, but the controls. The keys on the end are hard to play, mainly because a lack of dexterity in the thumb and pinky finger. Maybe its just me, but I find myself only able to play rookie comfortably. Anything above and my hand cramps. Add controller support or something, I'm not sure. Or fix the workshop, because I'll forget the hand pain to jam out to songs I actually know.","January 19","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know if its the feeling the beats are off, or the fact that chiptunes just don't seem to have the beat for it. Don't get me wrong, the music is great, the art and polishing too. But be prepared to play a hard game, not an entertaining one. This is not a game, it's major league baseball. But if you're up for it, and willing to invest a lot of time, it might be a challenge.
