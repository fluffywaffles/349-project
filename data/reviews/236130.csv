There are just so many things that are not ready, not implemented, not documented or explained, that it is simply not an enjoyable experience.\n\nThis review was written with the current "release" version of the game as of February 9th, 2014.\n\nSo, the list :\n\n--Build Queue--\n\nNon existant. You mean you want to build 3 of mother ship 1, 2 of mother ship 2, and 4 of mother ship 4? Not gonna happen unless you manually go back to each planet where ships are building and do that manually.\n\nNot only is there NO build queue, you are locked into 4 ships of each "class". 4 scouts, 4 transports (including colonizer), 4 cruisers and 4 motherships. What does that mean? That means you can only have 4 ship designs of each type and if you want to make a new one you have to over-write another one.\n\nThose two aspects of basic functionality being missing or kludgy really reminds of games from 1980.\n\n\n--Combat--\n\nThis is probably the most tedious space combat of any of this genre I have played in a long while. I started playing games on the commodore VIC20/Commodore 64, and I've played quite a few of these over the years. It is just very convoluted and tedious.\n\nWant to turn your ship so your weapons face a target? Good luck! Click on the screen and it may rotate 1/8th of a rotation...PER TURN.... Which may or may not be the direction you wanted.\n\nTargetting in combat is flaky. If an enemy ship occupies the same square as one of yours or very close to it? You can't target that enemy, at all, by anything. Zooming in or out does not help and all you can do is move that ship which now means you have pointed one or more of your weapons away from combat.\n\n--Quests---\n\nIts hard to call these things quests. You get a random message, about something that happened that you may or may not be anywhere near ( it tells you your "fleet" flew by XYZ even though you had no ships anywhere near there, ever.), then when you try to step through it, the next "step" may or may not exist, work, or even be understandable.\n\n"No Mr.Pirate, i want the REAL hammer!, Fine, come get it! meet me at XYZ".  Go to XYZ, nothing. Survey entire system. nothing. Survey each planet. Nothing. Station fleet at XYZ for 3 real time hours, nothing.\n\n--Technologies--\n\nTerraforming - This is probably the most confusing tech in the game. The "manual" has exactly one occurrence of the word terraform in it, and it is a sentence that basically says "Yup, it exists". What does it do? nothing. Researched to level 10 and those limited habitat planets arent improved. Sure you can now colonize "toxic" planets, but it is not at all clear if terraforming made that possible, or other techs.\n\nThere is no information, the description in game says nothing useful, there is no method to initiate it no discernable effect from it, and the manual is utterly silent with respect to it.\n\nWeapons and other systems are normalized to the point of simply being clones of each other with a different name. Yes, there are minor "effect" differences, but again, like most systems/things in the game, you have no idea if it is really happening, working, or even implemented.\n\n\n--Ship design--\n\nAside from only having a maximum of 4 ship designs for each type before you have to over-write a previous one, there is no method to modify one design to the next as in a refit. In fact, the only "refit" in the game that exsists is that you have to fly a colonizer ship to a planet with a starbase before it can colonize again. lets say you have a cruiser with laser cannons on it and you want to instead have that existing ship re-fit with a newer design that uses plasma cannons. Nope, Can't do it.\n\nThis is a base feature of almost every game in this genre.\n\nThere is absolutely no customization. Ships have 8 "hardpoints" for weapons, 2 on each side, 2 front, and 2 at rear. There are no ship layouts as in its appearance, no anything except, put weapon here or not, make it light, regular or heavy.\n\n--Strange stuff, bugs, etc--\n\nAfter playing for 10 hours, the Varaians (the ancient energy race and progenitors of EVERYTHING) are the strongest, largest, and most powerful empire in the galaxy and all of a sudden, without being attacked by ANYONE, they are simply "defeated". Poof. They evaporate. No one was attacking them (I am in all of their systems with an alliance with them). They just simply decide to stop existing.\n\nThey had so much military power that the very few times anyone aside from me (with an alliance with them) wandered in, just a couple of their ships utterly wiped out whatever flew by and then bam. Gone.\n\nThis was the third occurrence of this happening to a race, they just decide they don't want to be in the game any longer and poof.\n\nThere are more issues, oddities, and things (most notable documentation) missing, but this is long enough already with enough specific examples.\n\nThis game is simply not ready for prime time yet.  I applaud a new indie developer for trying to break into the market, truly, i realize its a tough thing to do, but even with that said, it can't change the reality of what this game is and is not.\n\nI didnt go into it expecting a multi-million dollar budget production, but I certainly did go into it expecting something with far more playability.","February 9, 2014","false","20.7"," 415 of 457 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","415","457","4","10"

And now, for the cons.\n\nCONS:[/b]\nWith the governor system, city management is practically non-existant\nWith auto-resolve, combat is avoidable and pointless. Would've been better if it was done automatically like Civilization\nCapturing planets does nothing to aid your empire once you reach a certain point in the game, aside from keeping it from your enemies\nAI is dreadful. They will ask for an armistice and cancel it the next turn, repeatedly, over and over. Also, they repeat their moves in every other thing they do too\nOnce you hit a certain point in the game, you can start a colony and get it maxed out in 5 turns, because of how little the currency matters late game. You can easily defend a large system by spawning in motherships (more on that in a second) on every planet in the system in a single turn. This is something the AI is oblivious to, apparently\nOther than a colonizer, there is no reason to get a single other ship than a mothership, as long as you have a shipyard\nTech system is confusing and serves no purpose. This includes designing your ship.\nGames drag on. Games can go on for over 800 turns and have only 2-3 enemies defeated, with no end in sight.\nOverall, this game fails in most everything people look for in a 4X game. I do NOT recommend it.\n\nSUMMARY:[/b]\n\n[/table]      Gameplay    Graphics    Replayability      Terrible    Passable (doesn't affect game)    Very low (for that to happen, the game has to end in the first place)","December 30, 2014","false","21.6"," 146 of 167 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","146","167","8","6"

Combat usually comes down to numbers/technology and on a game that is not massively graphically interesting this means battles are dull and also very long as they are also turn based. Even when I manage to win a battle I find the opponants have so many more ships that any progress is nerfed pretty quickly.\n\nThe tech tree is fine as you can discover new technologies (although this happenes randomly thorugh a breakthrough system), but it is difficult to see any positive results of better technology and it takes an age to research or build anything. The technologies mostly just improve something you already had rather than giving you a new item/building.\n\nThe turn button will become your best friend in this game. Building a medium ship, say a cruiser, even at a reasonable point in the game with a few planets will take at least 20-30 turns and each turn equaltes to a year. This is a long time for anything to be build and means that unless you have at least 5-10 decent planets building a fleet takes so long to build if an enemy declares war on you suddenly you don't stand a chance.\n\nGraphic are suitable to the task but there is a lack of any real customisation on your ships other than put laser here and cannon here, you also can't really chose what core systems (engines etc) you use as the games just choses whichever you have reasearched furthest (this makes it impossible to create armadas of large, cheap ships). Planets also don't have any 3D models but just a picture of the building which is very behind the times and I expect a game in 2014 to be visually much better than games I played 10 years ago, this is not.\n\nFleets are limited to 10 ships (for some unknown reason) but you can send more than one fleet into a combat zone. I don't see the point of the artificial limit on fleet sizes then as again this just means a lot of clicking to move all your fleets into one area.\n\nThere is also not a lot to build on your planets, most planets are limited to 9 building overall, when you consider there are 5 different types this does not leave much scope for development.\n\nLike most games diplomacy seems to rely on the AI demanding things on a whim for no real reason and refusing any request no matter how reasonable or bennificial to them it may be. Also there is no espionage/spying aspect to the game.\n\nI want to like this game and can forgive some its less developed aspects if I had been rewarded with good, or even adaquate, gameplay. It is good good have a simple game, and in its defence this is a simpl,e game to understand and play, which is easy to get into unlike some 4x4 games which are very complicated.\n\nOn a more positive note this game uses a credit system and most items/ships costs billions of credits. Its nice to see a more realistic game where a planet's output is not 120 credits and its costs 400 credits to build a unit, I do like a more realistic financial scale! Although saying that and back to the negative there is no way to really change you financial settings to improve morale/make more money other than a simple click button for each planet, not a great fine tuning financial system.\n\nSadly though the lack of any real strategy/tactics along with the ridiculous pace at which the AI progresses in its technology and ship building means that I would steer clear of this game presently, if it was reduced to £5 it may be worth a purchase but at £11 I still feel cheated.","June 27, 2014","false","8.3"," 140 of 169 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","140","169","0","7"

Vidoe/Graphics are quite well done. Some of the alien planet video is just simply wonderfully beautiful. And i can tell the animator of this game really enjoyed their work and made jokes in some of the videos.\n\n2. Music is a little subpar. But for indie game it can still be tolerated. Please improve this if you can for next game.\n\n3. Gaming interface is quite linear and it doesn't feel 3D at all. It's a universe so it should look like one.\nIf you turn off the grid the universe interface just look like a mess but if you leave the grid on it doens't look good at all.\n\n4. Tech is weird for this game too which you don't really get a tech tree. You reach base on % of you send in 6 types and you can focus on 1 specific tech one it become available. IT's just too much of a random chance. You need a Major Breakthough for a tech to show up and you need another Breakthough to start finnal getting advantage of it.\n\n5. Race balance is really bad. This game is a colonization sim so if you can live in poison/metal planet from start you gain huge expansion advantage. Since tech research is based on random breakthough. If you play a race that's not native to bad enviromental planet you will have to cross your finger and hoping terreform research pop for you.\n\nThere is a guide here on steam that shows you exactly how you break the game using these none-balanced ability and with that guide. The game become super easy but without it. if you play regular human on those high difficulty you will have a lot of trouble.\n\nThe Achievements in this game is actually really simple and straight forward. But it does take you to play many games to grind them.\n2 of those main story mission that will give you a normal ending.\n\n7.5/10 and i do recommend this game for 4X lover.

If you haven't played galactic civ, that is far better, and endless space wasn't too shabby. This is probably the last indie title I'm going to buy, these games are like early 90's throw backs.

I can't really think of anything I like in this game. The techs are boring because they are balanced to the point of repitition. For example, all the engine techs give you the same speed bonus per level. They only have slight variations in power/size but it means you really just stick to researching 1 engine the whole game. You don't seem to ever discover a tech that is truly "better" which makes it uninteresting. Seems even more so for guns. For example I start with laser cannons and then suddenly once I reached a certain level of laser cannon I discovered plasma bolt cannon. OK now I can kick some ♥♥♥ right? It has the same exact qualities as the laser cannon! Same size, cost, damage and the same perks, though maybe the perks come at slightly shuffled research levels than laser. Boring!!!\n\nThe game does have a tactical battle feature but it's pretty tedious. You can't automatically have ships flee, the rotation mechanics are busted (doesnt seem to rotate ship direction I want to). Then there is the annoying tendency of the tactical battle view to watch neutral ships wander around space near your colonies.\n\nSomething is really weird with the game economy. I was truggling with money at the beginning and then suddenly I was drowining in money. I look at the stats graph which shows graphs comparing all the races and everyone got this sudden sharp cliff up at one point, what is that all about?\n\nOh and allies don't seem to mean anything. I ally with races, and then I get declared war on by others, and my allies never show as enemies to the races I am at war with. Just me.\n\nI feel like I wasted my time with this title.

It's better than many of the generic half-baked 4X games which are flooding the market as disposal-ware, but there are some very real drawbacks which limit the enjoyability of the game.\n\nFor newcomers to the 4X genre who are looking to sink their teeth into a strategy game with some structure and a relatively low learning curve and don't mind the dated graphics, I'm giving this game a thumbs-up.\n\nFor veterans of the genre, who are well-versed in games like Endless Space, GalCiv II and III, Distant Worlds or the Sword of the Stars franchise, I'm giving this a thumbs-down.\n\nFor starters there are some very unique strengths to this game which are stand-out from the rest.\n\nAlthough almost every 4X game features the same exact tropes (types) of races, Horizon manages to give the in-game civilizations a sense of substance and personality which many other games lack. The in-game universe may not necessarily be as flushed as Endless Space, GalCiv or SotS, but the races present in the game are tweaked just enough from their stereotypes to make themselves unique---and the uniqueness of these races lend themselves to an almost genuine interactive quality. Species traits are certainly more than just window dressing, but the mechanics from one species to the next are mostly identical (unlike, say, GalCiv or ES, but much better than the generic games on the market).\n\nThe research and development process in the game is a refreshingly unique take on R&D systems. Unlike most games, where R&D focuses on one single tech at a time, Horizon has a system similar to the research points and tech levels structure found in Paradox's Hearts of Iron 3---with a measure of blind development to make things even more interesting. The way breakthroughs are often realized isn't through normal R&D channels, however, but by finding artifacts and other neat little details hidden throughout the stars. Exploration directly leads to new technological development, which makes the R&D system a lot more dynamic than most other 4X games out there.\n\nUnfortunately, the R&D results don't feel particularly "real" in-game. For the vast majority of them, they are simply stat-modifiers. Advancements in construction technology will make colony-building construction faster, but it won't change the buildings which are available. Advancements in weapons and propulsion will add new weapons and subsystems which can be deployed, but ship-types are fixed from the start. Just as planetary development is strictly linear for each class of building, so too is ship design and deployment.\n\nShips are limited. Significantly. In contrast to some of the generic disposal-ware games on the market, 16 unique ship-models, limited to four variants in four size-classes may seem like a nice spectrum for deployment. When contrasted with the dynamic models presented in Endless Space, or the complete from-scratch construction system for GalCiv II and III, or the custom-function design approach used in Sword of the Stars, ship design feels incredibly flat. Ship design is very strictly limited to a handful of weapon placement positions and placeholders for whatever systems are available for use. All four hull sizes and variants are accessible to the player from the start, no additional R&D required.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad, but the models for these ships look extremely dated once they engage in combat. The graphics look like they would be perfectly comfortable in the mid 2000s, but even against some of the generic disposal-ware 4X games, they look dated. Similarly, it's a very nice touch that Horizon has animated cut-scenes for first contact moments and other milestones, however, these cut-scenes too look like they are from the mid 2000s as well.\n\nIn summary, Horizon is a very mixed product. Some components feel incredibly well thought-out and they look great. Other components look rough, even dated, and seem to be poorly conceived and weak in implementation.\n\nOrdinarily, I don't care about sales----usually, I'll argue that a game is either worth buying full price, or not worth buying at all---but this is not a product worth paying full-price for.\n\nAnd the conclusion? If you want a straight-forward 4X game with some meat but not the level of complexity which the best-in-class games demand, then Horizon is a good solid choice, as long as you don't mind some of the graphics and other limitations. If you're a veteran of the genre, looking for the next breakout product, this probably isn't it. If Horizon has a sequal or a complete overhaul to ship design and deployment, and creates new cut-scenes from scratch, Horizon could start moving towards its' potential.\n\nThe potential is here, but it has yet to be realized.","January 1, 2015","true","15.4"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","48","51","0","0"

I love 4x games, and expecially when they're in space. However, after an hour of gameplay, the thrill was quickly worn out. While it seems fun and immersive, the galaxy is only so big, and it seems like I've started countless games starting in one corner of the galaxy only to find myself surrounded by other AI players, even when there were only one or two. One game I started and found the nearest AI had already colonized 12 worlds, despite the game having just begun. The AI cheats a little, but not enough to make victory impossible. But since you can't adjust the size of the map, only the density(from crammed to not too spread out), it's hard to really stretch your legs and get a feel for the game. Plus, since you often start so close to the AI, it likes to think that any planet it sees belongs to it. And if you colonized that planet, even if it's right next to your home system(literally), the AI will either demand it, or simply declare war on you in a few turns. This can be even more frustrating due to the limit on how far you can go from your colonies. You may want to invade your enemy's planet, but it's just out of your supply range. Meanwhile, he's sending attacks like he has no supply range limit, leaving you on the defense.\n\nSo really, while it looks fun, and may start out fun, it's not that fun. It could be so much better, but it really is a bunch of stuff crammed into one little thing.","December 16, 2014","false","8.0"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","37","44","0","0"

"Playable" at best.\nWorst thing for me was painful planet micromanagement starting from middle or end game (depending on overall number of stars/planets). Custom build templates are desperately needed here.\nA lot of things are counterintuitive, e.g. building a farming facility can make a planet much worse in terms of output and not improve anything; impossibility to intercept a non-combat ship (in most cases they retreat without taking a scratch); 5 000 000 000 people with the same level of tools produce about 5 times more research points than 5 000.\nDiplomacy is mostly random. You can get completely different results by save/loading: a friendly civilization may offer a tech or demand your system. And you never can be sure that your proposition will be accepted (save for gifts).\nResearch is nearly impossible to direct: new techs are given at random (if not acquired by random diplomaty) and improvements made in "classical" linear way are subtle.Of course, you can still explore, expand, exploit and exterminate, but this game is hardly better than anything else.","December 20, 2014","false","110.7"," 45 of 59 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","45","59","0","4"

Yet the game  simplifies many aspects of its famous reference, sometimes for the better, sometimes sacrificing features which made its 21 and 18 years old elders become legend.\n\nI can recommend this MOO-lite 4X game to people who are new to the genre as a very decent introduction, although seasoned 4X players (who have tried Imperium Galactica series, GalCiv series, Endless Space, Space Empires series to name a few) may find it pretty shallow and fielding little replayability at the end. Also its graphical style, general atmosphere and pretty easy to grasp gameplay are perfectly suitable for children (even overgrown ones) while still offering enough challenge at first.\n\nHorizon suffers a lot from staying too close to the original MOO, even when MOO2 already had introduced simple yet enjoyable battle animations for ground combat. Nearly 20 years laters, the design choices are less limited by technology like they were at the time. While space combat has been drastically improved in mid and end game compared to the infinite fights of MOO2, the asynchronous turn-based game still suffers (like most 4X indeed) of a painful mid-game where AI turns may start to take round 5 minutes on bigger maps, and still requiring the player input at many stages of the process (which it stops until the player provides feedback). For this reason, I do not recommend playing on the largest galaxies like I did, enjoy several smaller and faster games instead, as the game mechanics also contribute to make the end game pretty painful (i.e. you can only capture/destroy 1 planet per system per turn - and actually destroying-recolonizing is slighty faster than invading several planets -, AI will spam colonizers and attack ships on any free/weak spot in you territory prolonging its own agony, and final diplomatic solutions like "make vassal or protectorate" are non-existent meaning should you go for the 4th X, then you really have to exterminate every last single planet - also note there is no "steam achievement" for succesfully ending the game like that, been there done that!).\n\nOn the other hand, many excellent features from the original "source" did not make it to this game, like - to name but one - infinite research (i.e. Miniaturization technologies) making it completely redundant at some point to have any research colonies. Talking about research, there as well the concept was very much simplified: nearly everything is available from start and you only get to pick the priority of one of the 6 fields and can put emphasis on one specifc technology in each of the fields as well.\n\nHorizon brought some new things to the table though, with a quest system, which has you making some choices on how to deal with with each particular event and toward the greater goal of completion (although their is no "alignement" consequences for those choices, generally just economical ones). Also I was pleased with the survey mechanic, which makes you not only send scouts to systems and abracadabra it's uncovered but instead make you "explore" the planets one by one to discover potential bonuses (you can still colonize blindly if you like, something I like too). Introducing Command points also is a good call to limit the size of players armadas and force the player to make some ship and fleet design choices both in terms of tactical and strategical goals.\n\nThe digging feature is also an interesting idea, although it does not feel so much rewarding in its current state and could significantly be improved... which leads me to what follows.\n\nOne of the most positive things about Horizon though, it is the small team of developpers who cares about their product. 18 months after release (confirmed at the time of this review), they still patch it and add features. They read user feedback and even take time to respond to it, and that alone deserves the thumbs up.","July 13, 2015","true","66.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","33","39","2","0"

As far as 4X games go, it has most of the desirable features available in other games of the same genre. The Technology Tree is expansive enough to keep you researching new techs forever it seems. The ability to customize your ships equals that of Space Empires V; however, you can't custom design ground forces. I thought the ability to custom design your own player race a great feature, but I wish there was a greater selection of possible portraits to select from. At the start of a game, you can custom design your galaxy, the number of stars, random events, etc.\nSpace combat is strangely satisfying. You get to move and target your ships unlike in Endless Space where you play combat cards. However, ground combat is sit back and watch, you get no input on how it unfolds. Just have the better techs for your troops and hope for the best.

Finally the 4X space strategy game that is at least as good but probably much better than master of orion I and II. I can't believe it, especially with the mixed ratings that it got. I could write pages and pages of text about it to show how good it is, but nobody would read it so ill try to keep it short and simple. Here it goes:\n\n- The game is a typical 4X strategy game where you build and colonize new planets to expand your empire. You build ships and conquer worlds! The strategy part can be pretty deep. Long range view of things is needed for you to succeed at the highest level of difficulty.\n- The game looks like it started with the freeorion game package and expanded from there. The galaxy map looks good, the planetary interface is good too, but the ship combat and research interface are a bit underwhelming. They are functional, but not great.\n- Each planet is independent and must be colonized. Systems can have as many as 10 planets or as few as none! You can also automate the planet building and management with governors who will develop it just like you want to. For example: Agricultural governor, Industrial governer, Research governor, etc.\n- On each planet, you have 3 to 4 ship queue(depending if you have a shipyard built or not).  So you can actually build 4 ships at the same time! Each queue is for each ship size which are 'small', 'medium transport/colony', 'cruiser' and 'mothership'.\n- You have default designs and named ships but you can redesign them at your heart content! Space on the ship is your limiting factor (also how much it will cost to build, but hey if you're rich, why not put all the bells and whistle on it!)\n- Starting Technologies with random tek tree every game. If you are very unlucky, too bad for you! Adaptation is the key here. Also, you can't see which tek leads to what so you never know when you are going to get a new tek. You get surprised often! (Like when i got terraforming by increasing my tek level in bioweapon! I was like Da ♥♥♥♥? Yeaaaah!)\n- You can find all kind of nifty things by digging on planets with archeology sites. Especially new tek that you don't have in your tek list. Or greatly improving one or more of your teks.\n- Tek research is slow. It takes awhile to build your colony and the needed research labs that will boost the speed of your research. This means you got to use your tek plenty before you get to something better.\n- Ships can be refitted with better tek components or new ones for that matter. The cost of refitting depends on how much change has been done to the design.\n- Diplomacy is actually pretty good and the ai is not insane. Each race seems to have a distinct personality too, but nothing too mind blowing. Still, it is pretty solid. If they like you, they are not suddenly going to war against you out of nowhere unless you did something bad! (You naughty you!). The interface is functional, but not very good graphically speaking. Still, it works fine so who cares!\n- You have a limited number of war ships that you can have at the same time until you improve your logistic tek and build a ♥♥♥♥ ton of starbases. This means you have to weight carefully your needs before building a new ship. And scrapping ships is actually a good thing to do when your needs change. The limit of ships is a soft one before you start paying INSANE maintenance on each new ship, so if youre very rich, you can still bust the limit with little problems, but the maintenance cost gets very high very fast so i do not recommend doing this very often or for long.\n- There is ground invasion. I haven't tried it yet but you can bomb and invade with troops. There are many tek you can improve to help you with ground combat: tanks, hovercraft, aircraft, bombers, personnel carriers, rifle slugs, neutrino guns and plenty more! You can become a god at invading planets or defending from invasion too!\n\nNow the cons of this game:\n\n- The graphic are so so. This is not a game with pretty graphic. They are not horrible, but they look like they have been done without any artist or a bad one or they just didn't have the time to pretty them. I'm very glad that they didn't waste their time on graphics honestly because then we would have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game like master of orion 3 with superb graphic and good looking interface (that wasn't functional nor intuitive nor very usable) and a bad game to play. They concentrated on making the game fun to play and plenty challenging too!\n- The sound is appropriate and the music is good. You don't get tired of hearing the same music, it fits the space age theme of the game very well.\n- Going with the graphics, the cutscene are note very good either, but hey you don't care!\n\nI'm giving a 10/10 on this game for the overall awesomeness of it. You like long winded, slow building, deep strategy game? This game is your next lover!\n\nSee ya!\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","66.8"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","0"

They often pit you in control of massive armies, whether it be soldiers in the medieval era, futuristic ground combat, space or naval warfare, or any other possibility, they have always given you a god like perspective.  Waging war through physical might, mass numbers, stealth strategy, greasy politics or even just being friendly.  Something the typical shooter or adventure game just can’t provide when you’re typically in control of just one, or a few characters.  Even the most robust RPG doesn’t give you the options to play the way you like as much as a 4x game does.  So Horizon already has this going for it right out of the gate, but how does it compare to the plethora of turn based strategy games being released on a regular basis?\n\nTurn based strategy games rely heavily on their interface and menu systems, as that’s pretty much how you get everything done in game.  These systems are very involved, with text books full of key information at your fingertips.  The hardest part is giving the player everything they need to see without overwhelming them, but also not making them have to go and look for it.  Some games have these interfaces perfected pretty well, such as Sid Meier’s Civilization.  Granted, Civilization has had 5 games and many expansions to perfect this, but that also means they are a great place to look to see how to accomplish this extraordinary task.  L3O Interactive seem to have decided to go it on their own, using nothing learned from previous successful games from other developers.  This leaves Horizon with a very clunky, unintuitive interface that makes the player click around guessing and hoping to find what they are looking for, even for the simplest of tasks.  A prime example are your build queues; something so integral to gameplay that you should always have easy access to them at all times.  Instead, you have no visible queue what so ever.  You will need to click on each solar system (aka a settlement), then click on each settled planet in that solar system to see what it is currently building.  By the time you have several settlements, this task becomes tedious at best, often causing you more headache than enjoyment.\n\nAlong with the issues of the interface itself is the complete lack of help or information the game gives you as you are playing.  Basically, Horizon is not friendly to new players, even seasoned 4x veterans like myself.  You are stuck at guess work most of the time, just wondering when things will happen for you.  You can fly your Colony ships out to new solar systems and colonize habitable planets and make them your own, and there are no shortage of them around.  The thing is, sometimes the best solar systems require some terraforming to be done in order to colonize a planet first.  Sure, sounds great in theory, until you realize that you colony ship doesn’t have the ability to perform this task.  Okay, so I go into the ship builder and see if there is a ship that can do this for me.  Nothing.  Okay, not an issue, let me check my tech screen to see if this is something I can ‘train’ or unlock.  Nope, nothing there.  At this point I was lost.  I had all but given up on the idea of terraforming planets for my empire’s expansion throughout the galaxy, even though this was clearly a feature that was built into the game.  I just had no idea how to do it or where to find it.  I shouldn’t have to try this hard to locate a built in feature, a pretty important one too, of the game.  In fact, most games would give you tips or hints as you are playing, or at the very least when I’m looking at a planet that requires terraforming, give me the details of what I need right there.  Instead, as I’m skilling up existing technologies, I suddenly unlock the Terraforming technology as a new tech that can be trained.  This was apparently done by increasing my skill in a different skill, perhaps Xenobiology?  Who knows.  Not me, that’s for sure.  And there’s no way to find out either.  This is just one of many issues with the lack of information given to the player throughout the game.  The tutorial was fine, but very simple, and literally just stopped after teaching you the most basic features of the game and interface, at which point you are 100% on your own, without a single tip or guide given to you as you play.\n\nOne thing 4x games aren’t really known for is their campaigns or story modes.  Heck, some don’t even have them in game at all, rather they just give you an open map and several win conditions and let you loose.  Horizon is different in that regard, as they give you not one, not two, but a story mode for each playable race.  That’s 10 in total.  Of course you can play the classic open map version I mentioned above, but at least you’re not limited to it.  The story missions can be quite interesting too, giving you a good backstory and view on each race, from each other race’s perspective.  They give you goals to strive for in the form of exploration, diplomacy, military might and much more.  Of course you can choose whether to complete these missions, or which sides to take in each of them, so the variety and customization is definitely there to keep anyone busy for a long, long time.\n\nCombat is rather unique in Horizon as well.  It does a great job of no longer being a simple numbers game, where your two units beats my 1 unit.  Instead, when combat takes place, you are brought into the action, allowing you control over each unit, assigning individual attacks, defense maneuvers, and more.  All weapon have varying arcs that they can target within and each side of each of your units has its own shield, and once that shield is down you start to take hull damage, so placement and facing your units is of the utmost importance.  With all of this at your fingertips, Horizon allows for a small squad, an underdog, to emerge victorious if played right.  A lot of turn based strategy games don’t allow for this type of gameplay, which is a shame on them, but a big plus in Horizon’s column.\n\nContinued...\nFull Review (with pictures and rating): http://www.gamingv2.com/2014/02/25/review-horizon/","February 25, 2014","false","53.1"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","28","42","0","0"

For the normal price I'd be a bit more hesitant to recommend it, though not to the point that I'd leave a thumb down.\n\nThis is a fairly standard 4x game. The economy is less complex than the avarage, but I don't consider that a bad thing.\nThe research management is well done in this game. It introduces chance with the discovery of new tech, preventing you from looking at the end of a tech tree and ignoring all the tech before that when deciding which path to follow. Don't worry, you decide the priority on which tech should be refined, which is something I really enjoyed.\n\nWhat I really disliked in this game is the controll scheme during tactical combat. It's inconsistent with that of the galaxy map or with any other game for that matter.\n\nNow for the reason that made me  hesitate to really recommend this game: I feel like there could be more do differentiate builts between the planets. What's there is mostly a differences of quality, not function. This leads to me making 1 or 2 production planets and put everything else on research first and money second. There are some unique bonusses that can appear on planets, but only one of those actually made me consider changing the build (by increasing the tourism more than the trade).\nOther than that, the game can use some more polish, though it doesn't do bad there compared to most sci-fi 4x games. I haven't encountered any bugs in any case.\n\nTo conclude: not a great game, but not bad either.\n\nThis game reminds me a bit of armada 2526 and that's definetly not a bad thing.","April 1","true","21.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The choice is yours.\nYou get to pick your race, a nice variety of them exists, including of course the humans.\n\nResearch, you have several fields/genres of research you can spread your research to, each of which has several "topics".  You can choose to have either the field and/or the topic to have special focus/draw on your research points,   Or not, leaving everything balanced out.   Not all researchable itens are visible, for that you need a combination of luck, diplomacy and even finding a topic by accident during.....events.   It's a very nice way of still getting surprise topics for research, even well into the game.  It works really well.\n\nThere are sizes of ships you can use.  From fighters up all the way to starbases.  You can't design the outer looks of your ships, but you can do whatever you want for what they carry.  Based on your research and limitations such as the size etc.  For each size of ship you can save few schematics so that when you choose to produce them, you just pick what you want.  Do you want a missile cruiser, check!  Do you want a jack of all trades, check! Etc.  Perhaps you want to add boarding troops to try and capture enemy ships, check!  etc\n\nThe main galactic map is split in sectores (squares) similar to BOTF.  Depending on the technology, engines, supplies, forward bases etc, you can move a number of sectors per turn.   There is no limitation such as moving only through sectors which have systems in them.  The map is zoomable with the mouse scroll wheel and focuses where your cursor is.  When you click on a sector with a system , if there are any planets, a list of the planets in that system appear on the right side of the screen.  There you can have a quick look of what the planets are (terran, barren, gas giant etc) and their size.  Also if they have starbases or shipyards, at least if they are your own planets.  Cause if they are the enemies' the intelligence might be innacurate... :)\n\nYou can survey planets and find "goody huts" in them, or nasty surprises orbiting them.  You can terraform planets and of course colonize them.  When you have a planet for yourself you can give orders to contruct builing types of specialization.  Production, trade, research etc.  You can build (or buy) as many as you want, limited by the size and type of planet and how many "slots" they have available.  When you reach that limit you can't build anything more unless you demolish something else.  That thankfully does not include military buildings.  Military buildings which  can be any of Starbase, Shipyard (allows constructing mothership type of ships, and better resupply and repairs of ships), missile defenses for the planet and barracks.\n\nYou can construct any number of ships you want, as long as you don't exceed the command points cap  you currently have.  Cap which can be increased for example by building starbases.  When you exceed them you are going to pay a very large "fine" for each CP over the limit.  If your economy can afford it, no problem, if not....\n\nBattles.  There are two types of battles, invasion of planets and space battles.  Invasions take place in a static screen with a list of each side's army and equipment and a numbers only show of what is going on in the battle, ie, reduction of each side's army and equipment.  At the end of the battle of course there is a result and one side wins.\nThat is of course if you want to invade a planet and not eradicate the population.\nSpace battles are in turn based format.  There is initiative for each ship, based largely on the type of engine they have.  Then you proceed and move, fire at an enemy with all or just a selection of your weapons, use boarding troops, launch fighters, etc for each ship.  When you are done for a ship, if there is something more that can be done with it, but you don't want to do it, clcik Done and you given the control of the next ship if any.  If there isn't any other friendly ship to "move" then it is the end of your turn and the enemy side/sides start playing.  Yes sides, you might have battles with mor than two sides.  Even if they are not allied to each other.\nThe battle are done really well and very fluid without any cumbersome gui, as the rest of the game is also very well designed for smooth playing.\n\nDiplomacy, there are a ton of options you can choose, or the AI to choose.  A variety of agreements from the simple non aggression pacts, to trade, research, supply, military agreements.  And more.\n\nOh, and yes more than one race can have planet(s) on the same system.  It can be very interesting. :)\n\nAll in all, a great strategy game, a great 4X game and a must play fo the fans of the genre.  Just make sure to spend some hours first to get an idea of the scope of the game.\n\nI have started a Let's Play of it, you are more than welcome to have a look.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtpqh8ebqvxd6FUfWDn5Kj2DHC65ngY2U\n\nGreat game.","May 1, 2015","true","49.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

It basically makes next to no Difference what you build, just to make sure you have some Trade- and Tourist-Income on each Planet and you soon wont know what to spent the Money on.\nThat even makes building a solid industrial Base unnecessary. You can colonize a new Planet and just rush-buy all of the Buildings it needs to be fully developed in up to 5 Turns. (I did this with several new Colonies at once, without having Money-Issues, from a Core-Empire of 7 developed Worlds and never ran out of Money)\nTerraforming is laughable easy and happens just by the Way once you have the Tech and activate it on a Planet. My whole Empire was transformed into Earthlike Worlds without having the slightest Drain on my Economy.\n-The Auto-Battle (and Movement-) AI is terribly bad. It managed to have the Ships of one of my Battlefleets blocking each other and then abandoned moving that Fleet at all, while it sent another Fleet forward, just to be massacered by the enemies planetary Defenses and Ships.\nFleets are limited to 10 Ships and while the AI tries to keep a Fleet together (which easily leads to it either being mega-slow or blocking itself), it has abolutely no concern about keeping all Forces in a Sector concentrated. So it throws single Fleets into Battle while the Sister-Fleet is lightyears away.\n-The Tactical Maps are way too big. If you think of managing the Battles yourself be very patient, or think again. The Tactical Map is basically the whole Star-System and you need to move all the Ships ONE-BY-ONE.\nSince the Economy is so overpowered you'll be needing massive Numbers of Ships because the AI will field really big Fleets (and the planetary Defenses are quite powerfull).\nSo moving even one 10-Ship-Fleet (and mind you, a real attack will need several of those) from the Entry-Point to a actual Planet you want to attack can easily take you 15-30 minutes (in which you wont do anything, besides moving those Ships, no actual Fighting).\n-Enemy-AI swarms you. No that is not a complaint about Cheating-AI, since the Economy is so strong the AI can field massive Fleets and it does so (prefering armed Scouts for crying out loud). It uses those for the Zapp Brannigan-Strategy. And sends wave-after-waver against your Planetary Defenses, just to die there. Its not only a dumb Strategy on the AI's Part its also tedious, having to watch those Battles (which can easily take another 15-30mins), knowing how it will end.\n-Stratgeical movement: remember what I said about the Auto-AI being too dumb to move Battle-Fleets without one Ship hindering or blocking the Others? Yea here comes a treat. The strategical Movement doesnt happen on another Map, in fact the Strategic-Map is like an Overlay to a big Tactical Map of the whole Universe (seperated in the Sectors nonetheless). So the same Problem occurs with just moving your Fleet between Systems.\nBasically the Game will tell you that your Fleet will need 1-2 Turns to move through a System, when in fact (thanks to the Bad Auto-AI) it will take 3-5. So reaching a neighboring Homesystem (4 Turns away according to the games estimation) took me 15-20 Turns with my Battlefleet.\n-One minor Point is: the Game lacking any kind of Colony-Autobuild feature (seeing I can buy everything in a very short amount of time its not really a thing, but even now more then 10 years old Master of Orion 2 had one that wasnt great but ok)\n\nIf you arent the kind of Player that has a really high frustration-tolerance and loves moving Starships over-and-over-again\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS","February 9, 2014","false","75.1"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

There is also community that can help you. But still game need more explanation about some weapons /armor etc. After losing lot of ships in battle, i learned that you need to put nuclear weapons in stand of laser canons if you are going to bombard and attack planet defense :)\n\n\n\n2)most people hate battle system - actually that is true. after some 10hours of game i play space battles in "auto mode". Just put right weapons on your ships and press "auto" and enjoy in battle. Conquering planet could be confusing, i dont know why my transport ship goes first with battle ships, in galactic civilization transport ships stay behind in fleet battle. So i just bombard planet, destroy the colony and settle my colony :).. There is an option when you conquer with invasion to - exterminate alien race, assimilate, and third option... nowhere is written what that means... i guess u need some time of learning the game to fully understand ship battle system and eventually manually play  -\n\nEdit: i played few hours and i couldnt counqer one heavliy defended planet. So i proceeded manually and manage to conquer.  -well some detail tutorial could be fine.\n\nBut also in Galactic Civilization space battles are done automatically.\n\n3)most of sounds and animations in game are just great expect of some races - i think Tactic race :D - so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying sound.  no a big deal.\n4)some things are "unreal" - like terraforming Pluto planet - its fine to terraform Mars because it lies in habitable zone, but it is impossible,  even in any possibility to terraform Pluto- to looks like small Earth.. no way.. and terraforming some Volcanic planet to Earthlike planet. Noway.  And terraforming although you have to pay, still it is going very fast... in few turns from Mars to Earth... In reality it would need centuries or at least few decades for  "future high tech race".  I ll put this on Horizon forum and ask developers to "fix this".\n\n5)expansion oriented game - so far didn't see that you can skip expansion and try aggressive game play... so formula is simple - expand and expand. because investing in expansion gives more in return. Developers should make some patch to make expansion little more expensive or something.. but then they need to tweak A.I :) lot of work\n\nBut mostly those are tiny/small negative stuffs that i noticed - with current discount price - game is ♥♥♥♥ing great.\n\nIt has nice micro and macro management of your empire (i read that they fixed it in last few patches -for me its works nice) , very nice atmosphere ,  very real economy system, nice planet development, so far excellent AI  -and you can automate your battles or planet management. Graphics if also fine for this kind of game, interesting tech system. Game looks like very solid simulation of realty for hardcore science fan (♥♥♥♥ i hate terraforming its so unreal :D )\n\nEven if there is something negative about this game, it could be fixed /upgraded.\nI think that i ll play this game very very long :)","November 19, 2014","true","20.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cleverwisenow/recommended/236130/","cleverwisenow","CleverwiseNow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cleverwisenow/","3 products in account","Horizon is my second favorite game of all time, right behind Birth of the Federation (which I still play to this day).  The two titles are extremely similar and probably why I like Horizon so much.\n\nI really like slow paced space exploration games.  In general I prefer the turned based method where you can plan more strategy and take your time over real time titles.  In a real time game you just don't have the ability to really get into the environment with slow paced thought and plans because things are happening continually and must constantly react verses sitting back and exploring at your pace.  You can think of this as the chess vs checkers models.  While there is nothing wrong with the real time method I am just one that prefers space 4x games that allow you to slowly plan out your moves and look at the overall picture in a low paced time frame.\n\nI really like the story line and attention to details.  For example, the unique music played when you enter into the communication screen with a species.  It was enjoyable to play the game and see the different powers come to life with the provided story line.  You can also turn this off if desired which is an excellent feature for times you just want to play without the interruptions of the Horizon canon.\n\nI also really like the advanced diplomacy engine that allows you to enter into many different kinds of treaties with other powers.  Plus the graphics are fairly good for this kind of game.  For example seeing moons circling planets along with the planet animations themselves.\n\nThe music is very soothing, calming, and low key.  This just adds to the peaceful calming pace of the game and in our society where so many things are rush, rush, rush, hurry, hurry, hurry this is very welcoming IMO.\n\nI am also glad one can now play other powers besides just the Earth Alliance.  It seems to me the developers have and are listening to the community and that speaks very well of them.\n\nOf course no software is 100% perfect and there is always room for growth and improvement.  For example, an intelligence engine where you can spy on other powers by stealing their technology and commit sabotage would add to the game.  Of course there would need to be a way to counter act this threat for your own empire.  Also it would be cool to have plasma storms and dust clouds on the galaxy map that move around and reduce sensors.  It would be interesting if those storms were shown on the combat screen and thus change combat with limited visual-ability and reduce some weapons.  Worm holes and Nebulas would be cool too.\n\nStill overall I find this game excellent and am sure I'll be logging a lot of time in this title.  I finished my first game win around 30 game hours with three alliances and over 200 planets colonized and over 300 command points.  I had received over 30% of the achievements on Steam with this one play through.\n\nOf course there is a learning curve to any game but if you like turned based 4x space titles that are low pressure and provide a wealth of options check out this software.","May 19, 2015","true","43.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

But horizon manages to keep away anything from the game that's interesting about scifi 4X Games. You dont have the feeling that you develop your civ in any way. There i nos feeling like rising your civilization from some space monkey to an intergalactic empire with godlike power. This was in my eyes the most motivating aspect of games like MoO. In this game you get Laser 1, Laser 2, Laser 3, Laser 4. And so on. Then you find "Gravimetric Beam" which is the same as laser with a different name.\n\nIn MoO you started with a space shuttle with little guns and ended with a death star and the ability to destroy whole solar systems. In this game you end with Laser 7 and Atomic Engine 5 and the same shipsizes you had from the beginning.\n\nI also don't like the building-system of the game. Without doing anything special im able to buy everything in one round. I develop a colony to max in about 3-4 rounds. I build whole fleets in a few rounds, too, just by buying everything. The economy seems pretty broken to me.\n\nI think would like this game if research and therefore exploration would be more interesting. Atm there is a mediocre diplomacy system(no spies, no intrigues). A boring research system. Boring combat(because there is no tactical versatility in cause of boring research options). Boring exploration(only thing to find seems to be some passive bonuses(like + to income from tourism).\n\nThis game is pure 4x mediocrity.\n\nMy recommendation is to get:\n-Endless Space if you want Multiplayer\n-Galactic Civilizations 2 or Sword of the Stars 2 if you want complexity.","February 10, 2014","false","3.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Definately some work to be done, but so far the best turn based 4X game I've played,   At first the tech tree and combat seem simple, but when you have gotten a few hours in, ♥♥♥ gets a hell of a lot more interesting,\nMuch of the wait has to do with the way technology is available and that combat has a learning curve.  The tech tree starts off with a bunch of technologies split up into categories.  These beginning technologies are based on race (Organic creatures start with organic engines, humans with nuclear).  You can focus research in any category and further down into specific technology.  As you progress and meet new races and get tech from them, new alternatives open up (organic , fusion or nuclear engines, etc..)  Each alt has different costs and simple benefits and they all level up.  When you get to a certain point, you can find out about shields and bio energetic field, even bioarmor which becom game changers.  (First time I did shield equiped combat, amazing).   The big thing about combat is realizing the cost benefit of weapon size and location.  Each of your ships has 8 life bars, when one of these is ruptured, the ship sinks, so managing your ships damage intake and direction is important (easier said than done, the AI moves to attack the weakest  point).  And this leads to the big thing, weapon placement and size.  You need to decide between heavier weaponry on limited to 120 degree attack with the risk of destruction or lack of attack as you shield it and weaker but full constant 360 degree attack.   Weaker 360 can be more powerful on smaller ships.  This is due to ship based placement size restrictions. (H class arebt cost efficient).

For every deeply satisfying game like Master of Orion 2 or Galactic Civilizations 2, there's a frustrating failure like MoO3 or Sword of the Stars II and a host of in between offerings such as Lost Empire, Endless Space, Star Drive and Armada 2526. Horizon turns out to be an all-of-the-above game. It's early game exploration and expansion is top notch with lots of meaningful choices as to colony development, resource management, research decisions and risk-benefit assessments.  Unfortunately, things go south almost as soon as the neighbors show up. Transactions with your AI opponents are frustratingly limited and their responses often seem so hard-wired as to totally ignore your choices. Their lack of any discernibly responsive intelligence becomes even more apparent if you modify all your opponents into what should be a pleasantly “passive” attitude only to have them declare war on you shortly after first contact and absent any aggression on your part. Speaking of modifications, don't bother trying to modify the AI race names or the names of their home worlds. Much like the AI responses, the original names are hardwired in most of the screen displays so you end up with a confusing mix of your creations and the “throw the scrabble tiles up in the air and see where they land” originals. Disappointment with the AI will sink to despair once you reach the exterminate portion of the game. It's turn-based which is fine by me but it's also visually unappealing, saddled with awkward positioning mechanics and quickly becomes an unrewarding chore best left to auto resolution. The vessel customization is serviceable but absent excitement when your personally sculpted death dealing armada goes into action becomes more of a book keeping chore. The graphics in the game are dated but well done and the music isn't memorable in any positive or negative way. Running the main themes from MoO2 while playing Horizon makes for a nice effect. The tutorial is adequate if you have a good background with the 4X space genre but does leave a newcomer with a lot of figuring out left to do. In summary, what you get with Horizon is in essence a 51-49 gaming experience with enough good stuff to draw you in and enough disappointment to let you know this isn't your 4X gamer heart's desire.","June 26, 2014","true","76.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wastingsanity/recommended/236130/","wastingsanity","WastingSanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wastingsanity/","167 products in account","Horizon is a sandbox 4X space strategy game. For those who are new to the strategy genre, 4X means eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.  The graphics remind me of a game that was published probably in early 2000s. The grandfather of this game has to be Masters of Orion. I say this mainly because I see a variety of similarities. But then again, the same could be said for many 4X space strategy games.\n\n\nThe game play is what you would expect a 4X game to be. Ships traversing the stars, colonizing and warring with other races. The research is different from typical 4X games. Traditionally additional levels of research were levels in name. For example: Laser II, Laser III etc. This is not the case in Horizon. Instead of merely unlocking an item in research, the player has to level it up which can be confusing because I felt like I was not certain what was a solid level to research before focusing on a new area.\n\n\nAcquiring a new level 0 weapon felt less advantageous because it was level 0 compared to the level 8 laser the fleet was using. The player can focus 50% of the research to a certain category and then focus the research further in said category. For example: Click Weapons and then Lasers. There are also some areas of research I considered to be a little to micromanage oriented for the empire. Ground troop types are available to spice things up, but this means additional research.\n\n\nWhile playing this game I discovered a few additional things that are not as common to this style of game. Digging on certain planets to reveal game elements. The player can also explore the system or just a singular planet. Colonization ships would deposit pods on the surface, and then became available to fly back to port in order for it to be refitted with pods once more. It was a nice change over colony ships being lost with every planet. The flaw is that there are command points for the empire. This means that the player is only allowed so many ships in service at one time.\n\nClick the link below for more details!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IngL♥♥♥wrS0\n\nFor some strange reason the video does not want to appear here.

The game is being patched rapidly now, but there's still soooo many flaws, bugs, and missing items / descriptions. DEVS: if there are things in a product that have no explanation ANYWHERE of their effects, the product is not ready to release.\n\nYou can really see where the developers drew major influence from the classic 4X titles of days gone by, and tried to extend them to create something fresh, new, and modern. Unfortunately, it falls flat: The UI is clunky at best. The graphics are laughable at times (all the ground units look like someone created them with a 3 hour trial of a modeling program). Research is atrocious (no option to spend 0 research on something you don't want, being "gifted" a tech just lets you start from scratch on it). Combat is an absolute mess and takes forever, especially if your opponent spams small ships (and they do). The intent is to be able to manage multiple combats simultaneously, but really you just only get to control one at a time and the others are forced to auto-complete. There's no way to target military facilities with bombing, so I normally wipe out a populace before getting to an invade-able state.\n\nI could go on for a while about my issues with the game, but I'll stop here while some of you are still reading. This could have been a great game, and in some ways it is, but right now, as of 1.0.0.74, it's a decent Alpha test.","February 10, 2014","false","13.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Not a bad game, but not very complex. Entertaining for a few days, not more.\nThe games UI is somewhat confusing...took me a while to figure out how to do things. The tutorial helps a bit, but doesn't explain all. Also, the UI doesn't really help you to keep an overview when your empire grows.\nAI is acting pretty stupid, on both sides.\n\nThe game seriously lacks some information, for example, what do I need to order my fleet to do to bring down a planets defenses? Orbit? Bomb colony? Go into Sector activate and attack the fleet/rockets manually? Also, the planetary defenses seem ridiculously strong. Once I got starbase+rocket defense, I don't even need to place additional ships in a sector to defend it. The same is true on the other side, unfortunately. I never managed to invade a planet, even large fleets of motherships are shredded apart by rockets/starbases.

That is the only positive thing I can say about this game. Everything else about this game, from the sound to controls to the ship design system to the system management system is horrible. I've heard better sound quality from third-rate games released in 1995. The CGI and graphics look like they were produced by a first-year 3D modeling student. There is no build queue. Seriously? I understand that the way the system buildings work doesn't require it, but build queues are an absolutely essential component of any strategy game that involves building things of more than one type or design. Want to build a couple destroyers, a colony ship or two, and a couple more destroyers, without having to remember to come back and manually adding the colony ship and then the additional destroyers once the previous ships are built? Find another game.\n\nThis game is not worth the list price. It's not worth $10. I might, MIGHT consider buying a game of this quality, for $5, but then only if it's on sale for half-off and I'm bored out of my skull, or drunk. The list price of $30 for this game is absolutely, ludicriously, absurdly INSANE. I paid $27 for this piece of crap that tries to pass itself off as a game, and I want my money back.\n\nAnd, no, I'm not saying that just to emphasize how bad I think this game is, I really do want my money back. I generally like supporting indie developers, but if I'm going to fork out almost thirty bucks for a "full release" game, I bloody well expect a decent level of quality in the product I'm purchasing.

It has two modes: classic sandbox (think Master or Orion) and a story mode with a couple different endings. The tactical combat is fun and the AI is pretty good. The only thing I don't like is there are only 4 ship sizes and you can only design 4 ships of each size at a time. I just don't need 4 different small ships by mid-game. But I'd like to have many different cruiser and mothership sized ships.\n\nThe devs are very active on their forums and have provided regular updates including a few major overhauls. They also listen to their community. I'd really like to see an expansion pack to add more cool stuff to the game.\n\nA major improvement would be to add more things to research. Right now research is mostly improving a few small techs. I'd like to see more cool sci-fi things that you can unlock and a wider variety of weapons.

The craft offers first contact with an alien race almost brought to extinction, offering new insights into technology that will finally let you explore the greater galaxy. It also offers cryptic warnings of an ancient light-based alien species on the hunt for a compatible organic ‘companion’ race, and a nasty habit of declaring genocide on those who don’t fit their specifications. Subtle seeds are sown as to how you can be a part of either avoiding them of help destroy them. I didn’t feel especially ennobled.

The game has a built in tutorial and a very pretty manual that tell you maybe half of what you'll want to know. Ingame tooltips are buggy and uninformative.\n\nSecond, mechanics. The game's controls are clunky and unhelpful. Moving the map deselects your unit and the game loves popup windows right in the middle of where you want to be looking. Trying to use the map is more like boxing with your computer rather than playing a game. Combat is even worse, learn to love the AI.\n\nBut the meat of the problem is in game design. The 4X genre is defined by exploring, expanding, exploiting, and conquering. This game fails at all four.\n\nExploring is hobbled by supply limits -- the game enforces a maximum radius your ships can travel from any given outpost. So in order to explore, you need to expand.\n\nExpansion requires colony ships to found outposts. This isn't too bad, settler units are always expensive. The problem arises in how that cost is expressed. Building a ship requires a flat amount of currency as well as turns elapsed as dictated by a planet's industrial production. This double cost is ruining in the early part of the game, but it doesn't end there!\n\nExploitation means upgrading an outpost to a colony, which is another huge expense and a delay of about five turns after you established the outpost. Your new colony will then need more expenses to establish agriculture and trade facilities just so it won't be a drain on your economy.\n\nConquering is ironically compromised by how small the map is. You will start ridiculously close to your enemies, and have I mentioned how ruinous expansion is to your economy? Trying to maintain a navy in this mess is a good way to give yourself an ulcer. And you can forget outsmarting or out manuvering the AI, because the supply limit forces you into border fights.","June 23, 2014","false","3.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The tech tree seems rather short (and lacks anything "cool", mostly just different guns that get slightly better over time and various other incremental improvements to your ships and planets). Diplomacy is okay, but it has the usual problem of allying with an alien race, who demands you go to war with another race, but then never helps, so you take the brunt of the war.

MOO2 had it's day, came out in 1996. You'll play this once or twice and then put it to rest. Definitively not worth the $30 dollars they're asking for. I got mine in a bundle so I'm not overly upset over it. As far as I can tell, everything in game was stolen from MOO2 and then some of the names were changed. I played 2 games, one on easy, one on hard, really didn't see much difference in them. The game looked fun until I played it.\n\nIn Game it's best not to encounter any races at all. Once you encounter them they'll always tell you not to colonize any planets unless you want to displease them. However this doesn't stop the ai from colonizing. Late game I was pretty bored and declared war on everyone. Eventually just like in MOO2 the Galactic Council meets and who has the most votes wins. In MOO2, if you disagreed, everyone would ally against you. Sadly this is not the case here.\n\nLike with most games, the faster you expand, the better you'll do. No penalties for rapid expansion except the ai's demands, once you meet a them.\n\nYou can have command points or turn them off, pointless either way. Once you've researched the mothership, game over. I don't understand why command points are base on how many space stations you've built. I got bored with tactical combat and just did auto-resolve all the time. You can design your own ships, but many of the weapons are pretty much identical. Plus there really isn't much variety in the ship's systems either.\n\nI should also mention you only have 4 designs per size, except the spacebase, only 1 of those. So 4 small, medium, large & huge, I only used 2 of each (except huge, only need 1). Late game, I scrapped everything except the motherships. Scapping anything is a pain, you have to do one at a time. Once I researched everything (level 10), I had to go thru every single planet and scrap every single reseach facility. Since the facilities upgrade, I had to do each one several times. Yeah, try scrapping a 100 systems with 1-9 planets each. Frankly I really didn't see much improvement in the facilities after the 3rd tier, I believe there are 5 or 6 tiers for each facility. You're only allowed 8-20 building tiers per planet depending on planet size. Of the 6 different building types, 5 are upgradable. After the 2nd or 3rd tier the prices jump astronomically, so only late game when I didn't need them I could afford to upgrade beyond tier 3.\n\nNot really much to do, colonize & build until you go to war. Everything is mostly manual, so lots of repetative micromanagement.","February 5, 2015","false","36.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You're looking at a picture drawn with 1999 software, and you will be staring at this fugly "galaxy" the whole time you play this game. Galaxies should be breathtaking and beautiful, not meh, and certainly not fugly. How is it even possible to make a galaxy look ugly? More importantly: how is it possible for a dev team to look at a fugly drawing of a galaxy and then decide to use it as the main background shot for your whole game?! Answer: that is the best that was available back in the late 90s and early 2000s, when they were creating this game. Don't be fooled by the video. Look at the screen shots.\n\nGameplay is meh, not terrible. You must learn the interface by trial and error because the help files suck. All of the mechanics are a bit clunky and not intuitive, not polished.  Example: this is an empire-building game, so you have lots of planets. When planet X13Z or some other forgettable name gets attacked you must respond, but you don't get to remind yourself "OK, which one is that again" before you decide how to respond to the attack. You can't look at the map and see which system it is. You either remember the name or you don't. Now choose your tactical response from the list of choices while we keep the map hidden. X13's fate is in your hands, but you can't remember is that the planet you're building $20 billion worth of infrastructure or the one you haven't started working on yet. Please choose now: Flee or Engage. At least there is AutoSave if you pick the wrong choice. Oh wait. There's not. You just lost an hour and a half of gameplay because you forgot to hit save. That's just the way things were back in 2003.\n\nIt actually plays like an OK game if you embrace it like a family member who you simply have to get along with, but that hardly matters. This is a 2003 game trying to pass itself off as something new. No one buys a $30 Grand Strategy Space game these days expecting to stare at a 2D checkerboard and move cardboard cutouts of spaceships around while staring at a fugly drawing of a galaxy painted onto that 2D checkerboard. I was hoping for a game that would make me feel like I'm in outer space. Horizon fell short by a 2D parsec rendered in 680 X 1020 on a freaking CHECKERBOARD PLAYING FIELD.\n\ntldr: 5/10. Clunky but playable 4x space game with some depth and challenge. Never crashed. Occasionally entertaining. Storyline alternates between engaging and lame. Profoundly weak graphics. Don't pay more than $10 for this, even if you're a fan of the 4x space genre. Minimum requirements include Windows XP, and that should tell you when this game was actually made. Decent choice if your computer was built when Britney Spears was shockingly new, otherwise get a game that was made after Windows 7.\n\n[EDIT] I've played about 40 hours now, and it does get a little better. A lot of early stuff in the game is confusing and will point you in the wrong directions at first, but if you can get past that, there is a decent game here. If you get it on deep discount, you could do worse. Deep, complex, outdated gameplay.","November 24, 2015","false","14.5"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","0"

It was vaguely competent, perhaps, but didn't really shine in any way that would motivate me to play more of it than I did.","October 29, 2015","false","15.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

This isn't my first 4x strategy rodeo - I was around for the original Master of Orion days and I heard this was another attempt to copy it. MOO and MOO2 were, and arguably still are, pretty much the pinnacle of turn-based galactic 4x strategy, and it's sort of sad that a game made almost 20 years later still can't do what MOO2 did.\n\nWhat I was really interested in was the tactical space combat in this one, because as good as Galactic Civilizations II was, the combat was pretty much "here, watch this movie of how your ships did." So I fire Horizon up and my first non-tutorial combat was pretty much "the enemy flies in and one-shots you." Ok, no problem, build bigger ships maybe? Yeah that soooorta helped in that I didn't get one-shotted, but I still ended-up losing. Well, on a whim I re-loaded and did the autoresolve, because I heard it pretty much magically made you do better than the tactical combat, and voila, I won.   : |\n\nEDIT - the developer posted that the auto-resolver isn't any different blah blah blah. Look, I'm just telling it how I experienced it. This came in a pack of other games and I'm pretty sure whatever I paid for it was too bloody much. If you see this selling for more than about 20 cents, it's a ripoff.\n\nGod, I'm not gonna sit here and go on and on about how terrible this game is, I've already spent enough time figuring it out. I'll just leave this here for folks who don't want to heed my warning :\n\nUse the autoresolve\nBuild a starbase at every colony - they're pretty much unbeatable\nIf you want a good turn-based galactic 4x strategy, check out Endless Space. There are a few really interesting bits in that one, even if the space combat is a little... strange.","February 24, 2015","false","5.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

Bad news is it still is a beta quality in key areas.\n\nThe combat is atrocious. Just flipping between ships to give orders appears to advance the turn. Consequently I've seen ships destroyed in combat that I never got a chance to go to because there was combat in another sector I was engaged in.  And enemy ships and even planets don't even show on the mini-map. I mean the whole planet is not there but if you manually scroll in the right spot you can find it and the ships. And too many aspects are discovered only by trial and error. Example, the enemy can blow my missles out of the sky, but I can't seem to target thiers. You don't know if your light guns are supposed to be like point defenses that auto fire or what. There is nothing to indicate missles could be intercepted based on weapons descriptions.  The numbers on the armor are not explained but you can guesss at what they mean. And power is very poorly explained. Basically my cloked ship had no power to move, shoot or do anything but sit until it broke cloak. But the item information indicates that should not be the case, it should have been able to move.\n\nThe quests feel odd and difficult to figure out what to do. You really don't have enough info to decide.\n\nThe research is ok, but control over critical investments is not very granular. Basically you can focus more on an entire sector or on a specfic tech but you still work on everything out there, diluting what goes into stuff you want.\n\nI hope they continue to fix and address thins, but they shouldn't be charging for it without the pre-release/beta disclaimer yet.","May 25, 2014","false","11.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Horizon however is a breath of fresh air in a stagnating genre, it is well written and the AI is challenging at times without the need to cheat against you. a good game can take several days to win and you are constantly wanting to play just one more turn... and as anyone who plays 4x games knows if you desire the next turn its got you hooked. There are however a few thing missing from this game and it is in beta so hopefully they will be added soon enough. It would be nice to be able to pay to upgrade a ship to the new settings, right now it will upgrade your level X lasers to level X+1 lasers but if you change the template from lasers to crystal cannons it won't.

At first I thought it was just me, and that I couldn't figure out what the tutorial was telling me, but then the whole picture became clearer and that was just that the mechanics of this game are not friendly at all, on any level.  There is 10 steps to, what honestly should be, very simple things to do.  Like boarding a god damn ship.  Innitiating battles, going from one mode to the next, and switching between anything in this game just goes the most absolute round about way you can imagine.  Its not fun, its clunky and feels like I am wasting time instead of playing a game.  It is not intuitive, on any level, for someone new trying to play these type of games.\n\nI know there is a crowd out there for 4x games that enjoys making games as difficult as you can for people because it makes them feel like they are adding depth to the game, but this game, (which is supposedly not even as "deep" as other games) showed me that the genre is just not for anyone but those people.  It just seems like the interface leads to a whole lot of nothing and as a casual this because extremely irritating to have to go back to the tuturial every two seconds to try to read between the lines on what they wanted me to do exactly.  It could be so simple, why make it so ♥♥♥♥ing irritating to do what should be simple tasks.\n\nPeople can downvote this as not being helpful, but I will stand by the fact that I did not find this game to be intuitive at all.  There was absolutely nothing about moving around the map, interface, or game modes that felt like it made any sense at all.","February 12, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

My god it is bad.\nIt's also the sort of game that gives you an achievement merely for starting it up and clicking a few buttons.\n\nAs a 4X game, it definitely has potential, yet it's also notably unfinished. Balancing is really off (you either make infinite gobloads of money or lose infinite gobloads of money), a simple FLEE PLZ combat button does not exist, there's no overview ledger to help you determine which of your planets could use what kind of upgrade right now, there's no way to remember planets worth colonising or even a sortable list of those, you aren't exactly warned upfront of the large maintenance costs of some buildings, etc etc etc.\nAlso, the combat system that somehow takes places in the entire universe at once at the start of a turn makes very little sense as far as I can tell. As it's essentially a contiguous world map it does make sense for it to work that way, but controlling all battles at once looks impossible even without considering the lack of AI encounter instruction buttons. I can't decide whether to fight or to flee, to attack to abstain -- if I don't manually control my ships, they're in rambo mode, and often they needlessly get themselves killed.\nAlso not sure whether planetary ground combat actually exists. There's tons of tech and equipment for it, but my ships just shoot planets until their inhabitants stop existing altogether. I've been unable to land my ground troops anywhere.","July 10, 2013","true","7.2"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","6"

Obtaining a research should be a game changer in some way. This is the most important negative point. Games with incremental research have it very wrong.\n2) More aids are needed regarding colonies, navigating between them, viewing the summary, knowing what each is working on... many other aids. The queue and understanding of how that all works is needed. It appears the colonies can work on 5 things or 1 thing with equal speed. Only the cost that must be paid limits it. Is that intentional. It would imply that max efficiency is to work each aspect in parallel. Is that intended. I like that individual colonies are controlled, verses ordered en mass, but managing large numbers of them should be relatively easy.\n3) I like the way scouts and colony ships work, such as the ability of scout ships to survey and the ability to refit used colony ships.\n4) The look and feel of the game universe and sectors is also interesting. I have not played enough to fully evaluate those but I like it.\nNote: By saying "Yes" for recommended it is actually more yes than no, maybe 5.5 out of 10, where the research is -2. The research is not all bad, as things like Terriforming pop up, but otherwise nothing researched seems significantly different than before.","July 16, 2014","true","16.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

You can't even interact with them at all, they are just there once you build them, performing their function. And if you upgrade them they perform their function slightly better, giving you a small increase in your stats.\n\nThe diplomacy aspect is so simplistic it's barely even worth mentioning, let alone reviewing.\n\nResearch happens on all areas all the time. The only decision making part you have is to focus your scientists' efforts slightly more on one area. Once a new technology is discovered, you don't even notice its effects in the game. Some of your stats might get slightly better.\n\nThe tactical combat is also way too simplistic. All you can do is tell your ships to move around on a 2D plane and shoot at other ships.\n\nThere is no ground combat aspect, other than the log messages telling you each turn what happened.\n\nThe "exploration" goes like this: you tell a ship to survey a planet, it does, then you can read a short descriptor of the planet.

It has a clumsy interface, uninspiring tech tree, and amateurish graphics.  Its biggest problem, though, is the way it invites comparison with Master of Orion 2.  The grouping of technologies, refinement bonuses (including names!), the way you have to punch through one shield quadrant and immobilise to board... there are so many things that are clearly in homage to this classic.  Which should be a good thing, except it keeps reminding you that you're not playing MOO2.  It seems sad to make this comparison - afterall, worse than MOO2 can still be quite good - but the trouble is it doesn't bring anything significantly *new* to the table.  So what you're left with is a game that just feels like a cheap knock-off of one of your favourites, rather than a successor.  Horizon makes the equal and opposite mistake to MOO3 in the way it pays homage to MOO2 - it too slavishly replicates its structure, and often removes the more fun detail.  Fortunately you can still pick up MOO2, and it holds up just as well as it always did; whether you're new to the genre or haven't fired it up since you were running a DOS machine, get that instead.","December 18, 2014","false","1.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

A traditional 4X with turn based tactical combat is something I would very much like to see.\n\nUnfortunately this game not only fails to deliver quite spectacularly, but feels clunky and poorly finished. With some love and some polish this could be a revolution in 4X design. As is, the tactical combat interface is quite possibly the most counterintuitive and confusing thing ever to have graced my laptop screen, the soundtrack sounds like something I ate yesterday making a reappearance and the art style and graphics would look more fitting in a 1990 release. Overall a solid concept, but a terrible execution.","February 19, 2014","false","8.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Now imagen it redone by a game dev who doesn't what made GalCiv good.\n\nI should start this by saying I've only played a few hours of Horizon before refunding it. It's completely possible that everthing i say here does not apply to the late game\n\nAll of my friends recomended this game to me, they all said it was good and interesting and had a lot of cool lore. but when I finally caved and bought this game it just felt so hollow and lifeless. I felt like it had no charm or personality despite every one telling me that it did. The reviews for Horizon seem to mixed at the time so I can't be the only one who feels this way.\n\nEveryone seems to praise the tech tree and it's alright. But it'j just a tech tree. theres nothing special about it it functions almost the same as any other 4X game. I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the game for this, But I'm tired of all the reviews praising it as "New and inovative" there's nothing Special about the tech tree, despite what it might seem at first. Which is fine. Simple does not equal bad.\n\nThe combat can be really tedious and theres not a lot of substance to it, it basically falls down to who has more ships and bigger guns. there are a few things you can do like position your ships to focus fire on a single point rather than spread it out, which is neat but if you have more ships and bigger guns than why would you even bother? And if your opponent has more ships and bigger guns than what good is it going to do?\n\nThe colony managment system is kind of cute. It works and there really isn't a whole lot wrong with it. to colonize a planet you drop a outpost which you can upgrade to a colony anytime. once you do the colony will start it's trait( science , industry, farming ect) at zero and you can upgrade them to suite the planet type. it's simple and i like it. it's a shame that this part of Horizon is so easy to grasp and funcional when most other aspects of the game leave much to be desired.\n\nI struggled quite a bit with the UI, constantly switching between menus got really annoying real quick. But I think that might be a me thing. I will through a fit if the UI isn't crystal clear, as simple as it can possibly be. Maybe the Game's UI is perfectly functional and I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so I think I'll give the game the benefit of the doub't.\n\nSpeaking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the AI couldn't plan it's way out of a card board box that doesn't exist. theres really not a whole lot to say othrt than: it wouldn't suprise me if it turned out that there wan't an AI and all of the computer players are actually completely controled by a pair of dice.\n\nIn conclusion, No I would not recomend this game. After a few hours of playing it the only thing I remember is that the girl in the opening cut scean is clearly checking her Facebook. It's funny but......That's all there is.","July 19, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"
