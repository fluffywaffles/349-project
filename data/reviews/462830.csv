There might be a game here, but the tutorial is so poorly implemented that you're left trying to figure out what seems like a fairly complex game with absolutely no guidance.\n\nAfter setting up five routes and less than a couple of minutes, your tutorial friend tells you "there's nothing left I can teach you" leaving you to figure out the vast majority of the game play and mechanics by yourself.\n\nNo exit button, have to back out to Windows and close from there.\n\nPoorly thoughout cash grab of a game.","April 28","false","0.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","2"

All the others are $200,000-$400,000 in debt, yet they are still able to continue to play? What's the point in being profitable? Due to this, the other airlines still dominate certain continents/areas with their hubs (and flying to a competitor's hub costs quite a lot)\n\nOverall, this game is plane bad (pun intended). Aa the miserable person I am, I played this game too long to refund it, but please, until this game gets updated (in the good way), spare your pennies, and save it for something more useful, as this game will disappoint you.","April 29","false","13.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I played it way longer than I should have and i think i actually fell asleep with it running too. Heres a run down probably explaining better why people are hating so much on the game.\n\nSummary : Probably best to avoid in its current state unless heavily discounted or in an offsite bundle.\n\n+ Concept and game idea\n+ Plenty of planes\n+ ...\n+ Really wish I could put more here.\n\n- Tutorial ( non-existant , see below)\n- Map view shown with city names isn't in the game\n- 'Competant AI' - Spreads like wildfire , making big profits early game, soon bankrupts self after\n- ' AI is thinking ... ' even on fast forward, later on can take 30+ seconds / turn to decide\n- Music loop gets quickly irratating ( same loop in the video )\n- Only 153 cities? (Advertised 156)\n- Economy either booms or goes into crisis ( Random event)\n- Turn based action points ( see below)\n- Leaderboards? Not implemented , links to achievements\n- No campaigns, win/lose goals etc\n- No Detailed information on profit / loss / routes etc ( expanded below)\n- So many useless plane models\n- Planes are 'free' no research needed\n- One type of plane / route ( can only send a max of 3x planes / route)\n\n\n... I wrote some follow up stuff but it didn't seem to post , so i posted in the discussion board instead -\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/462830/discussions/0/364040166678051154/","April 29","false","26.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

I dont need any instructions having played this back when it was called "AeroBiz" on SNES. Basically this is one of your grandads tycoon games and Ive been wanting a new one to come out for a long time. This isnt even as in depth as the SNES version and I hope they refine this ported update but for %$ or whatever its delivering exactly what it should, no more no less. I reccomend, all things considered and put my vote out there for something like this but even more in-depth, ala a paradox game perhaps.\n\nGoogle : areobiz SNES" if you cant figure out how to play. Their instrunction manual was about as in depth as this one and I figured out how to play it when I was 9 so....I have faith you can too.","May 1","true","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game is exactly what one would expect from such a low cost game. It is not one of these cash-grab type of strategy/sim game. In fact with some added and needed tool tips, expanded purchasing options, and a bit more flexibility it could be a really great simulation game.\n\nThe strategy involved is engaging, but you will have to play at least two times to grasp the concepts. Essentially, you are trying to figure out where to make the most money. When you have a market segment to yourself and no competition, you will do well. However, as the game progresses you begin competing with other companies for passengers along routes other carriers have. You will have to be smart, watch connecting flights, and be sure your planes are giving you a good rating. Additionally, sometimes the biggest planes aren't the best for certain routes. Sometimes multiple small planes will net you a larger sum of cash.\n\nThere is no tutorial worthy of mentioning. So you will be dropped into a game unsure how its components interact and unsure what the point of it all is. There is however an actual strategy to the game once you discover it.","May 4","true","3.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I like getting into the information and numbers and figuring out how to make things work.  Having played some spread-sheet games in the past with a similar look to Airline Director 2, I thought that was what I was getting.  Not the case.  This is more of a clicker-style game.  Just set up new routes and let them make/lose money.  You don't have much to do beyond that & I quickly lost interest.  That being said,   I do see a nucleus  of possibilities within the game.  I don't recommend it at the moment, but will be keeping an eye on it to see if its potential can be realized.","May 8","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
