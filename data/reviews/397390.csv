"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rixtopia/recommended/397390/","rixtopia","ELRIX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rixtopia/","119 products in account","I decided to write a review on this game after seeing a few negative comments about the game mechanic and deck size problem. There were also people who don't like the chef who keeps cycling through the deck until you get the needed cards. That is you problem, YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR DECK SMALL. The chef could not do anything related to his main duty when the ingredients are not found yet, that is why he has more than one skill card to destroy other cards (this might actually be his role aside from cooking). USE THEM. Keep on destroying cards and make life easier,\n\nHere is an example to maintain a small deck is via the chef skills. The chef should always destroy cards whenever he got the chance with his skill cards. He could also help other class by using his FREE SAMPLE card to steal other character's cards and destroy it himself while helping other to draw cards quickly. If you're going to do this, you should always shrink the chef deck as small as you can, destroy one of his COOK card if necessary. Use the scientist to mutate his single remaining COOK card to have at least 2 power if you want.\n\nThere are also a number of non-job cards to destroy cards. Burnilizer and the Gamma Toaster for example. We just need to think one step ahead before doing anything just like in many card related games. If you have THE CLAW, use it every time you get it in your hand to grab any card destroyer in your discard and destroy cards again if you don't have anything important to do on that character's turn.\n\n\nThis game is difficult, but I think the challenge is great to keep us away from being bored. The RNG also DOES make life a bit harder - but in my opinion, it is still reasonable and it is at a very good standard board game difficulty. I can recommend this for anyone who loves the challenge of a fun cooperative board game.","March 27","true","15.4"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","1"

You will laugh and cry at the same time, and that will bind you and your friends (Or strangers if you play online) into a closer knit group than you may experience in many other games. (My friends list has grown by 5 already)\n\nThe things that i think you the reader should know.\n\n-You can play this game locally at home, i plug the PC into the tv in the living room and we pass the mouse around like any other game we would play on the table.\n\n-You have to talk to people in online and use actual teamwork. If you don't, you will miss out on opportunities that will most likely explode your ship and chalk up another win to the PC.\n\n-On medium a normal match for me runs about 1h30m to 2h30m. Depends on the team, your luck, and just how angry the game is at you.\n\n-For me local play is perfectly stable, *****online is less than perfect at the moment. This game is pretty new out there so i'm giving it the benefit of the doubt that the hiccups of online play will be ironed out (Adding a server for posting games to join would be great so people who crash or leave can return to the same group instead of hoping that the host will rehost at the same time you rejoin and land in the same server.) *****\n\n**** Online play has been improved, bugs have been cleared out more, and a lobby system has been implemented.  Still not quite perfect as there is some crashing, but worlds better. :D\n\nPurchasing on steam gives people the opportunity to use the chat channels outside of the game to match up again.\n\nOverall i give this game my deepest approval because it delivers an experience that ive been wanting and i hope that you are willing to give it a chance with your friends and be patient with the online!","April 5","true","50.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

It's heavily randomized, with the goals of the game being to focus on cards that shrink your ever-expanding decks. Unfortunately, random negative events are far too frequent, and it does not seem to be generally possible to complete more than 1/3 of the game with any kind of reliability. It will, for example, throw an event at you that completely removes your shields, then hit you for unavoidable damage on your next turn - in the intervening time, none of the crew who can raise shields have had a turn.\n\nThe game needs a serious look at it's game logic for how it throws these events. While rogue-like games can be fun, they need to be able to present unique challenges each time to be truly fun, and the player needs to feel like they could have done something better - that there is a degree of learning. Space Food Truck offers that level of difficulty, but success and failure is ultimately random, removing the sense that one is improving at the game with time.\n\nAs it is still in alpha, this review should be taken to apply to the late November 2015 edition of the game. A greater variety of cards and the introduction of more skill-based components may yet improve the game, as might a full multiplayer community. The game is reminiscent of the board game 'The Captain is Dead' and has a lot of opportunity, but they need to realize that, particularly in a multiplayer game, completing the game should happen on 50-70% of attempts, not 0-5%.","November 27, 2015","false","21.3"," 80 of 137 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","80","137","0","4"

Above is our video of a co-op game where we are able to get the first recipie delivered! Below are my initial thoughts on the game.\n\nThehiddenlevels.com was provided an early preview copy of Space Food Truck by One Man Studios and for that we thank them greatly.\n\nThis game is DIFFICULT. My first 4 games ended without the delivery of a single meal after an hour a piece, and I kept trying again because it really is that much fun. I enjoy a good deckbuilding game, but this offers a level of depth beyond what you may have played before. Not only are you trying to manage up to 4 decks (1 per person in a 4 player co-op game), but you are dealing with outside factors like asteroids, pirates, and wormholes making your culinary tasks more difficult.\n\nThe learning curve of this game is a bit higher than average. Andrew (my co-op partner) and I design board games for YanaguanaGames.com so we are fairly well versed in tabletop game mechanics which made him the perfect partner for this preview. We did very well compared to my initial attempts by myself and were given a one star review by the patrons, an achievement we are relatively proud of considering the difficulty level and addition of random events.\n\nThe one thing we felt was a bit of a frustration was repairing our shields to full, only a jump later to have them completely drained by a random event and then take damage to end our expedition as seen in the video. While random events are fun, game ending events can frustrate players. We like to ask what we could have done better to complete more or get more stars, and I think really scouting your route as well as preparing for everything to go wrong at once can set your ship up to do well.\n\nThis game has incredible replay value and is played on a procedural map, so each game will bring new adventures and challenges. I am very pleased to see such a well designed and strategic deck building game in early access. I will also add that this game is far more polished and playable than many in Early Access and other than a couple of odd crashes (which I was able to reload a previous autosave only a half a turn eariler) this game plays like a finished product.\n\nI reccomend this to anyone who likes deckbuilding games like Dominon or Star Realms. We all know expansions are a huge part of deck building games and I have to assume that is part of the plan for Space Food Truck. It's a great game with a really fun and quirky theme that suprisingly works incredibly well.\n\nThanks for watching and reading, check out www.thehiddenlevels.com for more news and reviews.","November 24, 2015","true","14.8"," 30 of 47 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","30","47","4","0"

Myself and a few friends brought it and really enjoyed the game initially. But we quickly realised that this game is too hard, and not even hard in way that challenges you properly. We have been playing on mild difficulty, since the upper difficulty was seemingly impossilbe.\n\nThe game is hard beyond the player's control, since much of the game mechanics are the result RNG. 90% of the RNG is bad! You receive negative effects that can see you wiped out very quickly. For example, we upgraded our shields to the max very early on, but in response, we started taking much more damage from RNG events.\n\nIt is also laughable that the skill trees for each character is so good, since you will never have the resources or ability to upgrade to obtain them all. The game also suffers from online problems, with several of my online games being ruined by game-breaking glitches, such as players not being able to end their turn.\n\nThere is also an RNG event that you cannot prepare for. This event removes ALL of your ship shield points leaving your unreplenishable HP vulnerable. This event alone has cost me the game multiple times when I have literally been a few turns away from victory, and it's not just once. It almost feels like this event is designed to hit you when you are so close to finishing.\n\nFinally, the biggest problem is that your deck constantly increases in size. There are a few cars that can be used to remove ONE card from your deck and destroy it, but you get new cards at much faster rate than you can destory them, making it increasingly harder to draw the cards you need.\n\n\nIN SHORT: I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME, BUT THE GAME MECHANICS ARE SO UNBALANCED. -and bear in mind this is on the so-called easy difficulty.","March 26","false","27.4"," 74 of 130 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","74","130","2","5"

It doesn't feel super deep in complexity, but a lot like the recently released Tharsis, it can often be brutally difficult keeping the ship in one piece long enough to achieve your objectives.\n\nI think I've read others point out, that although, much like Sentinels of the Multiverse, this could be played multiplayer, I think it works better as a solo game as each of the roles, on their own, I think feel kind of 2 dimensional, whereas tyring to coordinate them all as a team is fun.\n\nIt might just be my own inexperiencce with the game so far, but I find the toughest part of the game is having characters meetup in a given room, especially if it is not the character's room.  I mean I think I know how to do it but being able to coordinate at meetup where both characters can meet in room x while there is always pressing class based activities (which then instantly whisks the player back to their room if they attempt to do them), screws up most of my feebly attempted meetups.","January 15","true","3.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

That is the first thing you need to understand. It is not like FTL (Faster Than Light). It is more like a card game called Dominion. I will therefore explain what that means so you do not get the wrong idea.\n\nDominion and similar card games have deck mechanics designed for four players. Space Food Truck has four characters that take turns in sequence. You are not allowed to check your main deck unless you play cards that allow you to. You may check your discard pile, though. Your decks will grow in size, and there are cards that allow you to attempt to thin your deck of unwanted cards.\n\nMost of the challenge comes from trying to keep your decks from getting too congested. The other challenge is to try and keep a mental note of what may be in your current deck, or what may be in the other decks.\n\nIt is not like Magic the Gathering that allows you to build your deck the way you want.\n\nDominion has certain deck mechanics that must be followed, or it changes the game. Space Food Trucks card mechanics are very similar.\n\nPerhaps the best example of this is Blackjack in casinos. We all know that digging in the dealer's cards is not permitted there. Card games operate in a different way.\n\nIf there were no deck mechanics, this game would simply be a board game with assorted pieces. Keep that in mind before you decide the mechanics aren't to your liking.\n\nRandom events also keep you on your toes. You must always decide whether to stay or keep moving. Sometimes parking in a spot can lead to your downfall real fast.\n\nKeep playing, and you will get better. Space Food Truck is quite fun and a very welcome addition to my library. It is way better than the same ole copy cat games out there.\n\nA special thanks to the developers for not sticking me with another crumby zombie game. I am personally sick of zombies.","March 31","true","34.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Played it with 3 friends and we had a blast. Judging off the screenshots alone I wasn't expecting much from this game. And the $20 price point seemed very steep for something I thought I'd get maybe 10 minutes out of. Almost 5 hours later and I was still craving more.\n\nIn multiplayer you take turns controlling your character, and you all assume the role of one character (assuming you have a party of 4). Turns are not simultaneously taken, and cannot be, as each new turn has the potential for a good or bad event to happen which would or could then affect the turn of the next player. So it takes a bit of time to get back to you, but it was still entertaining enough to keep my focus and not get bored waiting around.\n\nThe game is exceptionally unforgiving though, you can very easily get stuck with a single broken door that you just can't fix one turn and that very rapidly spirals out of control until your ship is near falling apart at the seams and your game ends in a spectacular failure. Due to it being a card game it relies pretty heavily on RNG which can get pretty frustrating. That being said, once you learn the importance of certain items for certain characters and when to prioritize power over worth it becomes less of a cross-your-fingers-and-hope-for-the-best game and more of a if-I-get-this-now-it-will-save-my-butt-later semi-strategy card game.\n\nVery fun as a party game, I'm sure I'd have just as much fun playing it solo.

Let me share those with you:\n\nExpect "Very Bad Things" to happen to your crew every single turn. Sometimes you get lucky, but don't count on it.\nDeck building isn't just about adding cards. You need to aggressively use every job and item card you can to remove excess cards for every character's deck. Keep your deck small. Don't keep cards you don't want to draw often.\nThe types of cards you want will change over the course of the game. Don't be afraid to destroy expensive cards when they're situational or you just don't use them often.\nSome of the expensive cards are really, really bad. That's probably intended, so you have interesting choices (instead of leftovers), but don't let them fool you into keeping them.\nActively swap cards among characters. Getting rid of a card usually helps that character - especially if the character who receives currently has a way to destroy it (think beyond the Chef as card destroyer)\n"Research everything" is not necessarily a great idea. In fact, this can actually create a lot of problems.\nSometimes, it's a great idea to destroy a job card.\nWith that in mind, I guarantee you'll have a blast touring the universe in your comedy-rich food truck - especially if you have other people to play with.","March 29","true","8.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But there are two big problems: the game system is broken and the there are no players online.\n\nIn medium and high difficulty you are completely at the mercy of RNG.

Its a unique deck-building game with some innovative systems layered on and some FTL-like randomization and thematics. I highly recommend it to any fans of deck-building style games.\n\nThe game is played like a cooperative team card game, where you must tailor the deck of 1 of 4 unique characters in order to complete various goals and eventually win the game. You can play it completely single-player (controlling all 4 characters on your own) or play online multiplayer where you control only 1 role and make the decisions for only that character's deck. The various added systems and other elements keep it interesting and are actually very fun to engage with.\n\nRarely do I post reviews on Steam, but this game just gave me such a unique and fun experience that I felt compelled to share my positive feedback. I wish there were more creative strategy games like this being developed.  2 thumbs up from me!\n\nEDIT: I've noticed many other reviews for this game that claim the game's balance is out-of-whack and that the gameplay is simply too hard (or even impossible.) I'd like to comment on those feelings from my personal perspective.\n\nMy only criticism of the game's difficulty is that there does not feel like much of a difference between the easiest and hardest settings. On the hardest setting, your ship's starting stats are worse, researching new cards costs more, and the ingredients become harder to track down... however, everything else is seemingly the same. The random aspects of the game are identical on all modes. This means that once you overcome a bit of discomfort at the start, and get your decks properly tuned, the overall difficulty feels very much the same. I could see some adjustments being made so that the easiest setting had more 'postive' random events each turn (or on discovery of a new planet) and the harder settings more negative outcomes, but it's a pretty minor gripe for an otherwise excellent game.\n\nAs far as the game being 'impossible' to beat -- I have played through the game 3 times thus far, once on each difficulty setting, and I have not yet even come close to losing my ship. I think that success or failure will often come down to whether or not you really understand the game's core mechanics (or the general principles and strategies of deck-building games).\n\nSince not everyone is as familiar with the genre, I'll try to share some important tips here: First, it is important to have a goal in mind when you are buying new cards. Don't just add a card to a deck because it sounds cool, think about how it will affect the other cards you already have in that deck and what you want to accomplish with that character/role. Second, you should constantly be destroying the weakest cards in each deck whenever possible, so that each turn you draw as powerful a hand as possible. The game will force you to add new cards each turn, so try to utilize card destruction effects to keep your deck as small and focused as possible. Lastly, you want to be exploring a new planet on every turn, so that you can restock the available cards in the shop.

The best way to describe it is probably as a multiplayer Diner Dash game with a space exploration theme. The game does a really great job of emulating a board game experience, as well. I heartily recommend this game for the board game crowd, and the cooperative multiplayer crowd.\n\n*As of December 14, 2015 early access play*\nDifficulty has been drastically changed with a recent patch, and is now a lot easier to win. A ton of deck control/management options have been added to the game, making all notes from my November review below obsolete.\n\nThe developers have been showing a lot of updates and patches so far based on the forum discussions, which is always a great sign for early access games. The difficulty of the game feels a little like Castle Panic (an easy to win board game) at the moment. I am hopeful that this will get improved with multiple difficulty options upon final release (I enjoy an intense, but winnable  cooperative game)\n\n\n\n*As of November 27, 2015  early access play* [OBSOLETE]\nAbandon all hope at the door. This game is sadistic with the difficulty. So far, I've done 10+ matches as a 2-player game. All have been horrible failures to the point where we consider it a "win" if we can even get 1/3 of the cooking quests completed. The game has great potential, but a game should at least have a 50% win probability (such as Resident Evil: Deck Building game or Pandemic). Right now, the win probably is likely closer to 5%.\n\nThe game describes itself as a deck-builder, which it is for the first 25-30 minutes. After that, it loses the critical feature that allows deck-building games to work: deck control. There aren't enough ways to destroy (permanently remove) cards from your character's role deck. On top of this, you are forced to always draw 1 card from the deck shop (Zmart), further diluting your deck if your only option is "Last Resort". Even further, the game has vermin cards (Vexyl) that pollute your deck and weaken your purchasing power, making it harder to purchase cards other than Last Resort. Your deck quickly becomes filled with trash cards, and you can now longer get the critical cards you need to play on your turn (eg repair/Trusty Wrench).\n\nYou have what feels like a 80% chance of a bad event occuring every player turn. Shields down? Pray that the deck gods give your Engineer a Trusty Wrench card to repair them, otherwise you'll be facing death from either Life Support failure, Asteroids, the Chef's Dancing, the Captain's Bad Dreams, Planet Invasions, and other events just by sitting at the planet while waiting for the Engineer to hopefully draw it on their next turn. If your Captain jumps ship to dodge Planet Invasions, then there's a chance to get attacked by Pirates, have the Scientist's Accident, or if you're lucky, find a Handyman to repair the shields (really small odds with this one). Every single game we've played has been lost to Short Circuited (wipes out ALL your shields), followed by a barrage of destructive events while we wait for the damn Trusty Wrench (repair card) to show up.","November 27, 2015","true","25.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But after playing it for a few hours with 2 friends, I really don't think this lives up to the dream.\n\nThe Engineer and the Captain seem to have no interesting choices to make: repair what you have points for, and travel whenever the store is low on cards. The Chef is a frustrating slog; you keep cycling through your hand until you happen to get the exact right 4 cards you need.\n\nIn contrast to the rest, the Scientist seems pretty solid. The choice of which card to research or scout is an interesting one, and he interacts heavily with the rest of the team. In contrast, every other member of the team works in relative isolation.\n\nI was VERY surprised and disappointed that co-op turns CANNOT BE TAKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY. I know this is common in board games, but it is RARE in co-op video games, and for good reason. Heck, even the XCOM:TBG has (partially) simultaneous play.\n\nSome of this could be fixed, in later patches. By adding more interesting cards, the devs could increase the interactivity between players.

The theme and presentation are even better when you're playing the game instead of just watching the trailer.  It's confusing at first to figure out what cards you want, and the randomness might make it take awhile to find the first two ingredients for the first of three recipes.  Personally I'm just exploring the map until I'm more used to everything.  It looks like the randomness and the sudden events that can really screw you if you're not over-prepared will give this lots of replay, if you want another unique card game I can recommend it.\n\nThe different characters are pretty fun.  You need to travel each turn to restock the shop, but other than that I'm building up my captain's wealth to buy high price stuff.  Same with the chef, except I'm making the chef my highest priority character and using him to filter everyone's decks.  I have the scientist and engineer ignoring wealth and focusing on using as many actions/"power" per turn as possible.  And it's not the end of the world if as a result they end up having to take a "last resort" card every now and then.  The scientist is fun because you can choose between rushing for as many power cards as possible, or using "foresight" to get the cards you want in the long-run; and you have to adapt based on which character needs new cards first.  And if things go badly for your engineer, the ship falls apart into pieces.  Having your engineer locked out of the engine room can be awkward sometimes...\n\nOn the downside, there were no rooms when I searched for multiplayer.\n\nThank you for the Linux version!","November 24, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As a MTG fan, I was really drawn to this title as so should you. The first hour playing might seem a bit slow or boring but once you get to understand the concepts a bit better, you really get to appreciate all of the effort put into the gameplay. You really have to think about what will go well in each of the characters deck and how to manage it so that luck plays the smaller part in it. It's the basics of any deck building game.\n\nYou have to balance card power, card worth and utility in order for your deck to grow properly or you'll get stuck with crappy cards which will really hurt you once the events start getting harder to deal with.\n\n10 hours in and I've yet to deliver all 3 recipies although very close. It's the kind of game that could be expanded on very easily by adding new cards, events and objectives. 20$ is slightly overpriced for the current amount of content but I'm sure once the game is done, this will offer at least 20 hours of gameplay. That'll give it the 1$/h of entertainment which I deem is the norm nowadays.\n\nThere are certainly some frustrating parts of the game like when your shields completely drain on one turn, an expiring crisis hits you for 1 damage and on the next turn you get hit by an asteroid for 2 damage killing you in 2 turns (I had 3 life remaining and full shields) just purely based on luck. The randomness adds to the replayability and fun (sorta) but I feel like that aspect needs a bit of polishing. I feel winning because you made the right decisions rather than winning because you have all of your delivery points close by and didn't get many harsh events would be better. I guess the developpers might have wanted to be a bit like FTL (lotta randomness) . Once the game has more scenarios (I'm assuming that's the goal), I guess this might improve.\n\nAll in all, in the current state, as a pre-release game, I would give this a 9/10 and a must for any deck building fans.","November 26, 2015","true","26.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is insanely fun and exciting while also being surprisingly relaxing.\n\nThere are 4 roles, The Captain, The Chef, The Scientist and The Engineer. Contrary to really any of the negative reviews, all the classes work very well with each other and the game is not overwhelming.\n\nThe Captain's main job is to move the ship and refill the ZapMart. You should expect to move the ship each turn you can, as keeping the ZapMart full and stocked is important to getting utility cards and food cards. Use your investigation cards to plot a safe route and save some events for emergancies i.e. don't travel to Handy Man planets if you have full shields!!! Another thing to remember is that while that's your main job you have a secondary "ghost" job which is to oversee the ship. Consider putting 3-4 Diplobots on the Captian to keep the "Crisis" events in check and not get out of hand.\n\nThe Chef is reasonable for cooking the meals! You need to collect whatever ingredients are needed for the 3 meals. You have to cook each meal in order but you don't have to turn in any of them to continue, in fact you can cook all three and then drop them off. In the beginning, you should grab all the ingredients on the Chef, later after you get your Free Samples and Discard Dives you can afford to have others grab food that you can take later. There is a second job that is probably almost as important as the cooking and thats burning cards. Consider having the Scientist research Flambe's earlier and grab Gamma Toasters and Burnilizers whenever you can. It makes it easy to have the Chef burn all trash and grab more trash from others. THIS IS LITERALLY THE WAY YOU KEEP DECKS SMALL. Anyone who complains about the decks getting to "big" obviously doesn't know how to play the Chef.\n\nThe Scientist on top of being one of my favorite roles, is important to unlocking more cards for other roles. It seems simple and for all reasoning it is, but its also sort of a guessing game. You start off with one "node" unlocked in each role and for every node unlocked the cost goes up. In the beginning you should be pumping AS MUCH power as possible in to the uncovering skill card so you can see all the nodes (this is important since they are in a random order each time). You should try to get the Chef's Flambes, Engineer's Wrenches and Duct Tapes and The Scientist's Breakthroughs and Mimic Cubes. On that point... The Mimic Cubes are AWESOME! They allow you to make a temporary copy of any card in anyone elses hand non-job related. This as allowed me to Mimic a Powerr Glove to draw two, to get a Claw to grab A Claw Of Duty from discard, to get another Mimic Cube to Mimic an Exchangetron and push him over 20 power and 15 worth in one turn... It's just crazy. It reminds a whole helluva lot of playing a simple Blue Mage from MTG. In fact, I'd surprised if the guy that worked on The Scientist wasn't a Blue Mage player :P\n\nThe Engineer is one of the most crucial jobs and yet kinda boring. It's not a bad boring, just wish he had something else to do. He really only has one job and thats to repair stuff... which breaks, a lot. You have Wrenches, Duct Tapes, Upgrade Ship and Exterminator cards. The first two give you repair points to fix shields, broken lab equipment and busted doors. The Upgrade ship allows you to iincrease the max shields and FTL drive by one point in one or the other. This becomes a relatively useless card late game when they are both maxed out and you can even burn them at that point to save space. The exterminator card allows you destroy Vexels, which are cards that get added to players decks (through a random turn event) and while they are in your hand they only give -1 Worth. 2-4 of them isn't a huge deal, but anymore then that and your average worth starts to decline and they just become annoying. The Exterminator card (theres only one) can only be gotten from the Scientist, so grab it fairly early to mid game to keep ahead of the Vexels. Other then that, make sure you put AT LEAST 4 Claws Of Duty on the engineer, as not having a Wrench or Duct Tape on a round that had a lot of damage or breakage can be quite bad and possibly make you lose.\n\nAll in all, this game is super fun, can be relaxing and forces you to work AROUND the RNGesus not against him! This game can be hard and yeah, sometimes you're going to get Life Support breakage, Xanus attacking, Shields deplete or pay 4 power (which you probably won't have on that guy) and Cyber Punk all in the same round. It will ♥♥♥♥ you off and you may lose, but just try again! I love what's in the game so far and can't wait to see what DLC they add! More cards? More Roles? Maybe Themed Galaxies with corresponding events? All that and more please!\n\nEither way, this is worth $20 and if you still are "sold" then wait till a sale. If this game goes to $10 and you don't get it then you never wanted it in the first place!\n\n9/10 - The Engineer could use more fluff.\n-YeOlePopoff","April 11","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And the continual response of the developer to raised issues makes me feel secure that this game is easily better than before.\n\nNov 28, 2015\nAs it stands this game is WAY too hard. And it's not hard in a good way. Like many rogue-likes, it falls victim to arbitrary RNG. The game is really quite fun, but I have gotten to the doorstep of victory twice now and just can't win because it's one crippling event after another. And that's only when I'm lucky enough to take no hull damage early on. More and more near the end-game you'll find yourself wishing you could keep at least one card in your hand to carry over, but the game doesn't allow this. It's a brand new hand each round. Also, your ability to thin out your deck can't keep pace with how quickly it bloats beyond effectiveness. That's not necessarily a bad thing--it enforces a sort of time limit and incentivizes you to move quickly. But in tandem with the progressively brutal random events and your inability to do any sort of round-to-round hand management, the game basically takes control away from you and you're left sitting there watching the RNG hoping eventually you might have a choice to make. You feel less and less in control of your strategy or your ability to even act. Again, late game is complete chaos. This game desperately needs some kind of mechanic to make it more like a traditional table-top deck-building games. Seriously, these problems have been solved. There's no excuse for a game like this not to be aware of successful inovations in the genre. Dominion came out like over 10 years ago, and deck-builders have progressed beyond these punishing mechanics long since.\n\nWell, it's early access, so I'm hopeful they'll fix it without simply dumbing down the difficulty of the random events. I want a challenge, just not a nigh-impossible luck based one.","November 28, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It achieves this by having the worst-ever UX and game mechanics seen in the past three decades. Any card you play can be wasted, and the only way of making sure this doesn't happen is to check everything twice before you click anything. A game with this level of presentation focus has no excuse for not warning you when you are about to play something substantially suboptimal, or to consistently waste your resources when you click a card too many. Instead the game merely appears to cackle at the failure it tricked you into.\nTo explain, you have a hand of cards consisting of cards with associated effects and other cards that serve as 'power' for these effects. There is a card that boosts your spaceship's shields or drive by exactly one, and it does so no matter if you play it with 1 power unit or with many power cards. In a game designed for a non-masochistic audience, you would at least get a tutorial-ish warning that this is going to happen. The most infuriatingly unjolly moment was when the game offered me hints about multiple nearby planets of my choice, and then the user interface let me spend multiple hint points on the same planet while I was trying to properly access the first hint. Turns out it was just a single-word popup one can read by mouseovering, and clicking on it again wastes another hint point to no effect. Who designs and playtests this? 75% of the gameplay is the player working around the horrible interaction design.\n\nAs the cherry on top, the 'Local Co-Op' tag is false advertisement. There is absolutely no difference between playing this with one human being in front of the PC or with 12. Only one can play the actual game. This is as much of a coop game as Minesweeper or Solitaire are.","December 1, 2015","false","0.8"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","6"

Beat it second try (third technically, but the first was learning the ropes, and I quit after ten turns). The gameplay is solid, albeit a bit repetitive.

I've twice played as the Chef and on both occasions a turn would never give me the chance to end a turn or use any of my cards, forcing me to quit the game.\n\nHopefully these do get fixed over time, but in its current early state, it's making the game unplayable. Numerous issues such as connection problems, infinite loading, and rare occasions when cards suddenly had different values, makes it too much of a back and forth experience that I can't recommend right now.\n\nOh and if you hate Random Number Generators, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Too much RNG elements aswell as negative effects to make your experience more frustrating. Seriously, the easier difficulties of this game should not be this hard, but thanks to RNG, it is.","March 26","false","3.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

For the tons for bad things that can happen there seemed to be only 1 good thing... getting an additional card at the start of your turn.  (I may have forgotten some of the "good" things because of all the bad ones.)  You start out with an event that immidiately does 1 damage to your ship or you have to give up 2 power cards.  I thought this would change because of the RNG, but every time I've played the game its started like this.  I have only played on mild difficulty and have not had a win yet.  I've made it to turn 63 before my ship was destroyed.  That was after over an hour of very careful play. Obviously the game gets more difficult as you get farther along, the events doing more and more damage to your ship.  And like some people have mentioned, there are very few ways to get rid of cards in your deck so getting cards you need becomes impossible.  So as you're taking more and more damage, the only cards you can seem to get are leftovers.  For an hour I thought I was doing well, then the ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan.

I am writing this review though because this game is so beautiful. Unique Characters, beautiful artwork, awesome design. The creators of the game are awesome guys, and deserve a lot of attention, they make some of the best games there are. I've been hooked on outwitters for almost 2 years now. can't say that for any other app on my phone.\n\nThis game is difficult, so if you are looking for a walk in the park don't think too deeply about things this game might not be for you, but if you are looking for a challenge and to test your mental abilities, this game is perfect. I love it.","November 27, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

Assuming you can find a group or have people to play with locally it might be fun. However on each characters turn something can break but only one of the 4 characters can repair and only on the 1/4 of his turns he draws a repair card. On the easiest difficulty with luck and blessings from the rng you can get far enough to enjoy the game and learn strategies to win maybe?. Even on the easiest difficulty you could spend hours wandering around the galaxy trying to find the cards you need with random events randomly warping you and breaking your ship. Where on the normal difficulty if you dont find what you need in the first 30 mins you lose. Unless you're a fan of the genre and want to see how hard it is for yourself skip it.","March 26","false","5.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

If Found, Please Return To Earth” calling in. We were required to jettison our entire stock of pizza to distract a space kraken and the engineer has been captured by small mammals who are worshiping them as a god. Despite this we were able to deliver the sandwich. Mission Successful.\n\nSpace Food Truck is a co-op, deck building game about making and delivering food across the galaxy. Now I should point out that deck building games are my jam (my space jam you could say) and I’ve spent more hours playing things like Dominion, Epic and Star Realms than I care to think about, so this game was already off to a good start.\n\nThe most immediate thing about the game is its very strong theme. A fun cartoonish romp of a small spaceship full of colourful characters, trekking across space to make and deliver odd foods. All of the items, flavour text, art and even music add to the wonderful atmosphere.\n\nThe objective of the game is to gather ingredients, cook them into a meal and then deliver them to the hungry customer. However as you do this you encounter lots of dangers thrown at you by an uncaring universe that means you need to get shifting. You play the game with four different characters – you can either split the roles up amongst friends or play all of them on your own. Each character plays differently as follows:\n\nThe Captain: A veteran space fearer with big dreams and low motivation. Their deck focuses on moving you around the galaxy allowing you to resupply the shop, deliver goods and find new items\n\nThe Cook: An Ex-Con with questionable tastes and a habit for break dancing. Arguably the most important character as he is the one that can actually cook the meals, although he can’t do much more.\n\nThe Scientist: He who knows all! Eventually. He forgets. Used to unlock the unique cards for each of the characters and create new items.\n\nThe Engineer: Likes tinkering so much they tinkered themselves a new body. They allow for the repairing of doors and workstations as well as upgrading various components and getting rid of some of the nasty bugs that can infest your ship.\n\nSo how does the main gameplay work? Each card you have has a power value and a credit value. Some cards require you to ‘use up’ the power of others to get effects such as research, repairs or moving. At the end of your turn all cards in your hand and play field have their credit value totted up allowing you to buy things from the store. Everything is then put into the discard pile and when you run out of deck your discard is shuffled up and turned into your deck. Better cards cost more credits and need more power and you try to fill your decks with good cards so you can be more effective.\n\nHow does it compare to other similar games? The different characters with their different roles makes a huge impact and makes it pretty much unique. The random events that happen each turn and as you travel to each location keep the game different each time you play it, as most deck builders rely on player vs. player interaction to change up gameplay.\n\nI don’t have any major issues with this game. The tutorial isn’t great and there are a good number of bugs. Maybe more items and events will be needed to stretch out the appeal, but I think that’s why this is an early access game – to figure out how to make these improvements and finish off this game’s already stellar finish.\n\nI’d enjoy this game more was if I could play it either on tablet or as a physical board game. This is a game I really can recommend, even though it’s only in an alpha state and I’m sure that by the time it’s actually released it will have even more great gameplay to it.","December 5, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoverArtist/recommended/397390/","CoverArtist","CoverArtist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoverArtist/","229 products in account","I really, really want to like this game. But as others have pointed out, the RNG engine is tiresome and near impossible to feel satisfaction from. As soon as you clear first meal, you will get what feels like a 60% chance of the RNG events to be negative. After you finish the second, it feels more like 90%. I went through 4 rounds (a round being each character playing) and got a negative RNG event EACH ROUND. The only positives I found were from planets that are pre-determined at the start of the game.\n\nAnother thing is card-draw. The aspect of forcing a player to buy a card that's useless makes it extremely hard to make a clean deck. I had multiple hands of just leftovers, solely because everything else in the shop was 7+. I have only a handful of times got enough money for a 7 item, and the last ingredient I needed was /10/. I couldn't even reach 6 most of the time, let alone 10. This combined with the idea of forced leftovers makes it feel like the game is designed to go against you, even in the lowest of difficulties.\n\nLastly, this game is labeled as a deck-builder when it only takes the very small aspect of a DC- the deck- and everything else is just chaotic. I have never seen a deck builder that didn't have structure, something this game lacks. The starter cards give no value whatsoever, so you have to rely on your job cards for the first part of the game. Which wouldn't be too bad if the value cards you get were in an easier range, instead of pulling 5-7 cards constantly.\n\nTLDR; The game is extremely unbalanced, and is not worth the 18$ tag. It's fun for a half hour with friends, but without buffs to the player's chances of winning, there is no real value in this game.","March 30","false","9.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perennialsorc/recommended/397390/","perennialsorc","perennialsorc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perennialsorc/","133 products in account","I would really like to recommend this game, being a huge fan of coop board and card games in general. The asymmetric roles and decks keep everything interesting, game after game. The game mechanics are pretty intuitive and very thematic. The digitization helps with all of the countdowns that would be so difficult to keep track of in tabletop form. The RNG doesn't bother me and its use actually makes sense to me in this context - this is a card game at heart, and events should resemble pulling a random card off the top of the deck. I have played physical games with mechanics similar to this (Pandemic, Eldritch Horror) and know that Bad Stuff happens on a regular basis. This type of game is NOT supposed to be easy, and it's not for everyone. This is for the type of person who can enjoy a game without beating it, but who can also get a great sense of accomplisment on that rare, skin-of-your-teeth win.\n\nAll that being said, I can't recommend this game in its current form. Not because of the game rules or any balance issues (all roles are critical to your game's success), but because of the Vexyls in the programming. Hall passes randomly cannot be cancelled, the game stops responding entirely after the Chef plays any of their role cards every once in a while, the Next Phase button sometimes decides to shift a little to the left to sit right under the trash pod and become unclickable... the list goes on. While playing online with 3 friends, we had to leave our session and be reinvited by our host no less than 20 times in a single game, so the current player could try to get their deck to work properly. It is nice that we didn't lose much progress, but this shouldn't be happening in a game that we as a group spent $80 for.","April 4","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun and you can spend more then enough hours in it to get your moneys worth. Specially if you decide to play multiplayer (which imo is more fun then the singleplayer).\n\nPros:\n-Slick animation and style. It doesn't have much animations but the game feels smooth and polished. The style fits the theme and the humour is great in a game like this.\n-Decks are unique and fit their own unique purpose. This means you need to get to know every deck before you can play this game well and end it on the higher difficulties.\n-Card and deck balance are well thought out.\n-Game mechanics like keeping your shop stocked + mandatory buys are a great challenge.\n-The events are meaningfull and impactfull.\n-It's alot of fun.\n- trying to figure out what to do with others in multiplayer makes for a great multiplayer puzzle and great multiplayer interaction. (although i've only played this with friends and not with random others online, so my experience might be different)\n\nCon:\nThis game has one major flaw that might keep you from buying this. I've read several reviews and I keep reading that people find this a very hard game, meaning even more playtime to master. This may be the case for those who are not used to deckbuilder games. However if you are experienced in deckbuilding games then there is a very likely chance you figure out how this game works fairly quickly. You will most likely have seen all the events and cards when you do your first playthrough so the only thing that you can then change is the difficulty level. And that's where the problem lies. The highest difficulty is not achieved by adding new or harder challenges, it simply gives you a maximum time and an bad starting setup (-1 card per character). Once you figured out how to optimize your plays/decks, there is not much new for you to do. Simply rince and repeat untill you find a playthrough that gives you the right events, cards and draws. This means that instead of increasing the challenge it simply becomes a factor of luck whether or not you can actualy finish the hardest setting.\n\nnote that i'm still recommending this game despite the flaw, simply because the fun i've had playing it was worth the money imo. I just lost my motivation to keep trying to play the hardest difficulty setting, which is a shame.","April 29","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/397390/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: A challenging and deep deckbuilder roguelike game that is made for (but does not require) cooperative play - where you run a food truck in space.  Charming visuals, interesting gameplay, and replayability make this a must-buy for fans of deckbuilders - but the difficulty level means its not for people who aren't fans of this kind of game.\n\nSpace Food Truck's title is perhaps one of the most honest you'll see - you run a Space Food Truck.  Every game your goal is to complete three recipies and deliver them before the hazards of space send you to another line of work.  Truth in advertising.\n\nGame play involves four different members of the crew - Captain, Scientist, Chef, and Engineer - having to work together to keep the ship running, cook meals, navigate to other worlds, and find new technologies.  The game can be played cooperatively online, offline, or solo depending on your inclinations.  Each person can take one or more of the roles and work to deliver meals to the stars - or one person can play them all.\n\nThe core gameplay is deckbuilding.  Each character's turn starts with some random occurence (mostly hideously painful), and then they play their cards to have various effects.  At the end of the turn they purchase more cards from a resupply (chosen by the captain, who also acts as quartermaster) - and if they can't buy anything they'll have to take the dreaded Lefrovers to be added to their deck.  As player's hands run out, their cards are reshuffled and sent back to them.\n\nObviously the goal is to get new and better cards, get rid of bad cards, and keep moving from world to world to find new supplies and unltimately craft dishes you deliver.\n\nAs characters travel, various crises occur that may require expending cards, moving around the ship to solve problems, and so on.  Very careful planning ahead is necessary to avoid being overwhelmed with crises - this is where the roguelike nature comes in - the game is perfectly happy to smash your cosmic cullinary dreams.  Cooperation is paramount.\n\nThe roles of each character are also unique - and they have unique "job" cards they have - and can be granted - to do certain tasks.\n\nCaptain - Moves the ship around, choses resupply options, and gets special command abilities to move the crew and get information.  If the captain has a bad hand you can't move, and if the captain is locked out of the bridge you're really in trouble.\n\nScientist - Unlocks new cards for the crew.  Not only are these powerful, they also prevent their hands from becoming overloaded with bad cards.  If your scientist is incapacitated, no new cards.\n\nChef - Not only cooks the meals, but has card-manipulation abilities.  He can take cards, use cards in discard piles, and even destroy unwanted cards.  The chef is required not just to fulfill missions but keep everyone's decks in order.\n\nEngineer - Repairs and enhances the ship.  He makes sure the ship gets better and fixes what's broken on the gastronomic POS the crew is stuck on.  If the Engineer can't do his (its?) duty the ship will fall apart.\n\nThe game is tight, well-planned, challenging - and when you fail (and you will) you can usually see why - which makes you want to try again.\n\nThe music and visuals are excellent, with a fun, colorful, cartoony look and appropriate music.  The presentation really brings the entire experience to life, making a deep and challenging game even more fun and enjoyable.  Space Food Truck delivers the complete package.\n\nWho's this game for?\n* If you like Deckbuilders, it's one you'll definitely want to try.  There's a lot to explore in this game, and some clever mechanics.\n* If you want a team play game (each game is probably 45-90 minutes depending on how well you do) and have friends into Deckbuilders, it's a great purchase.  This would be an incredibly fun party game.\n\nThe only warning I can add is that if you don't enjoy deckbuilders, this is not for you - because it *is* a deckbuilder that just happens to have team-play and some roguelike elements.  If you're not ready to ask which cards you want in your deck and calculate odds, you probably won't enjoy it.\n\nOn the other hand if you read this review and went "Yeah!" it's probably worth your money.","May 15","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's unforgiving on the least difficult settings.  However, setting up a VoIP channel and bringing in a friend or two turns the experience completely around.  I've found myself howling and laughing at each other as the stack is decked against us. Also, the vector graphics allows the game to keep its crisp look and fidelity with resolutions reaching past 3000x2000 (est).\n\nThere's still room for improvement. It'd be nice if cleared zones could be skipped, so we won't see the same pop-up as we travel along. There are also a few connection bugs and glitches, though those can be quickly mitigated by closing and restarting the game. Hopefully, 1-Up can get that squared away, but they are more of a nuisance than anything.\n\nEasily one of my favorite indie games.","June 4","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
