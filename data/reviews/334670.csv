Seldom a break in action, and the more you play the better you get at knowing when to control the zombies in your favor. The maps are well designed for small skirmishes, and there are no issues that plague some of the larger shooters like bad respawn points and lag.\n\nPros:\n- It's fun: I can easily see myself putting many hours in to this game which is the most important benchmark to many\n- Great constant action FPS, sort of like Q3A meets a modern shooter\n- Tons of great stuff to unlock\n- Great game for teamwork, especially on point capture maps. There is a very clear advantage to hunting with a teammate or two.\n- Extremely smooth multiplayer, no lag\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat dated graphics\n- Takes a bit of time to begin unlocking the good stuff\n- Voice acting is pretty tame\n- In game UI or menu system is a tad confusing, would be nice to work with your unlocks immediately after a match\n- In the game's current state you have to level up to use the different classes. Personal opinion, I think it would be more fun if everyone could run each class from the start and just use XP/$ to unlock weapons and upgrades\n\nOverall\n- Incredible amount of potential\n- Highly addictive multiplayer, would happily sit here and play for hours\n- Classic FPS meets modern in many ways\n- As with all early access, needs some all around ironing out but there is no reason to think that won't happen\n- Even at $19.99 for early access, you can get your money's worth. I'll likely put over 20 hours in to this game if not way more if it progresses well","March 10","true","2.4"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","28","34","4","0"

The game has it's moments, when it works it's a fast paced call of duty style game with tactical elements like using the hazardous environment (well zombies) to your advantage. I knocked it as being another "zombie shooter", but got it any way because the screenshot of the zombie being knifed caught my interest and it turns out all the screenshots are ingame and not some fancy "ubisoft" style screens. The PVPVE approach does make it refreshing fun.\n\nPerformance wise i'm running a first gen i7 OC and an OC gtx 970 and get a solid 60 (vsync on) at 1080p and 40-55 at 1440p on ultra settings. The games hitboxes are on point as well, and didn't get any lag on the server, even though im on a rubbish connection. By the time i finish downloading half life source, the third one will probably be out -.-\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is hardly anyone's on it and the gun sounds are atrocious, makes it feel like your shooting a paintball gun instead of the assault rifle/weapon your using. Pulls you out the game a little bit, you do get use to it, but hopefully it'll get fixed.\n\n\nThe singleplayer aspect at the moment is just some sort of horde style mode, which is a work in progress, and online there's only one game mode, but zombies filling up the map spice things up on each play.\n\nIf you like fast faced shooters, get it.\nIf you like zombies, get it.\n\n","March 16","true","3.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

Thus far I've only tried the King of The Hill mode, and I must say; Our team was doing terrible for a while, but towards the end of the round we started using the grenades that temporarily turn zombies into your allies and make them charge the enemies. We made a comeback, but unfortunately they were already so far ahead that we didn't have a change.\n\n","March 10","true","8.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","22","27","3","0"

The game gives you a great survival experience not like most other zombie games. In Moving Hazard the zombies are your weapons and that is what I like about it. People say that the game is so generic and is like any other zombie shooter out there but I have to disagree with them. Most of the people that have been talking crap about this game haven't even played it yet like I have. I was in the closed beta and during that time I was having fun playing with the developers and other beta testers like myself and I gotta tell you I don't regret playing this game what so ever.

Runs good and looks okay. Game is very barebones but definitely playable. Havent played too much but I loved what I have experienced, the gunplay is pretty tight, maps are decently made, zombies are a nice addition, and it just feels fair. Playing against higher level guys, I feel as if I am not at a disadvantage which is huge for me as I take week long breaks from a game and only play a couple matches at a time so I dont rank up fast at all. I jumped right in and started getting top 2 players once I learned the mechanics. I like what they did with the zombies and being able to control them, matches do get hectic when people start throwing the grenades to control zombies. Overall this is a very good Early Access multiplayer game and I pray the devs stay on the right track with it. Can definitely turn into a very good game is they continue to add content and listen to feedback. I havent leveled up much so Im not sure how many weapons and if there is customizxation, so I cant respond on that .","March 13","true","0.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eshian/recommended/334670/","eshian","Eshy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eshian/","480 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAt first glance it just looks like a Call of Duty clone with zombies thrown in but the combination of the two genres created something unexpected.  There is potential to be had here in more tactical play.  After about an hour of playing I was growing accustomed to moving with zombies and using them as camouflage as well as cover.  Baiting other players to chase you around a corner only to surprise them with some zombies you twisted for your own gain was fun.  I imagine that when the game is fully released this game will have a lot of potential on the competetive scene.\n\nI write this review based on the Beta version alone and there were some issues I hope are addressed.  One of the first things I noticed was mouse movement.  It feels like there is some kind of mouse acceleration involved but there is not option in the menu to disable it.  Enabling Vsync sort of fixed the issue but I was having an incredibly hard time aiming normally.\nNext is the guns, these may have been aesthetic choices but I had a hard time using them.  The aim down sight option is incredibly slow and takes about a second to actually pull the gun up to your face.  Next is that EVERY bullet has some kind of smoke tracer on it so you quickly blanket your screen in particle effects and have a hard time seeing your target.  On top of the particle effects, the onscreen NAV points that direct you to your next objective frequently blinded me from seen targets at range, players were literally hiding behind it, I would definitely recommend that you raise the icon above the intended marker instead.\nThis next one may or may not be minor but the spread on the guns felt strange, the more effective players resorted to holding the trigger rather then using burst fire.  Im not entirely sure if I was missing half my shots or maybe it takes nearly a whole magazine to take down opposing players.  I may just be spoiled on other FPS games though so I dont really know.\nLastly is sound, I dont know if my game was glitched or not but there was a distinct lack of sound in some areas.  I found myself dying quite a bit to zombies you had been nipping at my ankles for a distance because I couldnt hear them.\n\nMy list of notes to the devs is a bit long but that doesnt change that I feel this game is good and has lots of potential to become better after its Beta stage.  Im certainly looking foward to what its going to look like after its been out for a while.","March 10","true","1.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

Using zombies as weapons couldnt be a cooler idea! I really enjoy the warehouse level with TDM. Its a fast FPS that definitely deserves more players then it has! Ive unlocked the AK and it doesnt have a big advantage over the starting M4 so everyone has a chance to be a badass in this game. The jumping is a little wonky but thats because they dont want you to be able to get away from the zombies that easy i think. Upgrades are easy to get and it doesnt feel as grindy as the other FPS games with prestige level 100s.

It's hard at first not to not kill all the zombies, but once you get the hang of using them as weapons it can work towards your advantage.  This isn't a typical early acess game, it's playable and very few bugs.

Third, I LOVE ZOMBIES XD so being able to "control" them is super cool. The only downside is the lack of community but that can only get better as more people pourchase it. so give this game a try and lets get it known, i Stream it everyone once in a while, so if youd like to see some gameplay, give me a follow on Twitch and ill show you what its like. :)","April 25","true","2.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You have an aray of weapons that includes grenades that manipulate the control of zombies to your advantage.\n\nWhile playing a little bit over an hour, Competitivly. I have concluded that this is a pretty nice FPS with a nice change of space with the whole implication of zombies.\n\nIt really makes for some tatical game play while you dont wanna spray and pray due to being caught by a horde of zombies in the process of reloading.\n\nI will say (Although i havent played enough to really conclude) that the health might need a little nerfing. I feel in the early stages before you unlock any guns, it takes about almost a full clip to kill someone (Although my aim might just be utter garbage).\n\nAnd i also didnt see any indication of ammo pick ups?

Let's make you spawn infront of 2 ennemies, or right behind the guy who killed you, depending on your karma.\n- Feels a bit COD-ish, but It's up to personnal preference.\n\nIn short, the feeling of the game isn't there, I would like to feel more into it, make the guns meatier, better animations, better sounds.

The reason why I hate to say it is because the game is great. The problem I have has nothing to do with the gameplay, it's a very interesting and intriguing concept, my problem starts with the community-or the fact that there is no community. That's right a Multiplayer FPS with NO community. There is usually 4 players on around 3 pm est but past 8pm it is hard to find anyone.\nNot to mention the fact that it is 20 dollars, and simply not worth that at this point. Of course there are very few players, who's gonna pay 20 bucks for a game that nobody plays? Even 5 dollars would be too much. This game should be free, or maybe even one dollar at the moment. People will buy a free game they have never heard of before they buy a 20 dollar game they have never heard of.\nI understand that the developers need money to fund the game, but you're hardly getting any sales for 20 dollars so why not discount?\nThe devs spent a whole bunch of money to have their own booth at pax east, and people really seemed to enjoy the game(I was one of them). However, i'm not surprised that it didn't bring in that many new players because the game is 20 dollars. It's could be a great game but it is poorly marketed.\nI really like the concept of this game, and the graphics are nice and all that, but there's just not enough people playing it, and that won't change without a price drop.","April 26","false","3.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","4"
