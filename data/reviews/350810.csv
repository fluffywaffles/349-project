"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/350810/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4009 products in account","What is Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime?\n\nPixel Puzzles 2: Anime is a strong contestant for the "doesn't know the difference between anime and manga" award. Other than that, it is a puzzle game. You are presented with 25 puzzles that range from 60 to 350 pieces each, with only one having 350 pieces. There is one assistant flying around giving you bubbles you can use for optional help.\n\nThe graphics are fitting for a puzzle game, but the puzzle pictures sometimes, as you will know from the puzzles by a big German company "Ravensburger", if you ever laid them, make it difficult to see where you would want to fit tiles. This however is remedied by the gameplay (see below).\n\nThe music is not disturbing and fitting for the theme, but the spoken words are annoying. In fact I shut the sound off completely after a while and heard podcasts while playing this, as I prefer to do with relaxing games. Your (fairy?) helper always tells things that are funny the first time but get annoying later. For example while she gives you energy bubbles (see below) she says "This is because I love you" and such nonsense. I'm not certain if this is aimed at cliché nerds with anime bedsheets or a parody of their hikikomori lifestyle, in either case it is an annoyance to me the third or fourth time, losing its fun to become a Navi-esque bother.\n\nThe gameplay is where a puzzle game rises or falls. There are several aspects to be considered by a developer, and I think in this case they are well covered. At first there is progression: The levels can be progressed through on a grid. Progress within levels is - surprisingly, I must say after playing the previous game - saved even after exiting a puzzle. Great plus! I did not test if you can have multiple puzzles saved at the same time, but I assume so since I started others up in-between, although not laying any pieces there, and the developer says on the forum that every piece laid is saved.\nThe second aspect is on the puzzle itself, the motifs. These are okay but repetitive. You usually see some kawaii guy or girl, rarely a couple, in front of some background. The third aspect is how you grab pieces. This is well executed in the entire series. Around the puzzle there is a basin filled with water (see the store page screenshots). You can take any piece at any time. If you want to save it for later, just lay it somewhere on the board. A propos "laying on the board" - if you lay a piece correctly rotated close to where it should be, it snaps in automatically and can't be accidentally removed. This is the same in the entire series, but worth mentioning. The fourth and final consideration is what to do if you get stuck. There are some optional hints which you can use. I never used any of them, so I can't say how they work, but from what I gathered you can see the board motif (which could be done outside the game in a gallery as well, but here you see it directly on the board) or show where a piece you hold belongs to. There are several other buttons but I didn't press any, as I said. Probably you can also change the background color of the cardboard you lay the puzzle on.\n\nThe controls are easy: You only need a mouse, and once the space key to enter the main menu. This is actually annoying, as each time you want to play, all puzzles except one are accessed on the second screen only for which you need an additional click and spacebar press.\n\nSo what is the length of the game? Assuming you take your time without resorting to any of the help features, you can realistically expect 15-25 hours of gameplay, depending on how good a puzzler you are. If you use the ingame help, this might be shorter, I can't say it since I did not test it.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Only to puzzle fans or such looking for a relaxing gameplay. If you need fast action, you're wrong here. If you want puzzles, you can grab this. While this is far from perfect, it is a game puzzle fans will enjoy - even if most likely with at least the speech turned off.","October 5, 2015","true","27.8"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","35","41","6","8"

Then I discovered that the fairy can be removed with the delete key and life was suddenly much better.  This does, unfortunately, also disable her hint functions, but since I personally wasn't interested in using hints (what's the point in that, it's a puzzle!), getting rid of the fairy was well worth the lack of hints.\n\nThe game itself is a straightforward jigsaw puzzle set, with various piece counts and pictures.  The pieces do require rotation which adds some challenge that was absent from previous games in this series (I enjoy the other installments but they went much faster).\n\nSo in the end, since I was able to disable the fairy from hell, I will recommend this for anyone who likes a good jigsaw.  However, if you do want to use the hint function attached to the fairy, bear in mind that you'll either have to listen to her prattle or you'll have to shut off the sound for the whole game (as there is no separate volume control for voice vs music/sound effects).","April 20, 2015","true","21.7"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","26","28","5","0"

Perfect for someone who likes jigsaws but doesn't want half finished puzzles lying around the house. But Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime....ugh! I really regret buying this game.\n\nFirstly, unless I'm missing something, they have still not installed a save function. So unless you are certain you have enough time to finish a puzzle of several hundred pieces, don't start. Mostly though, I haven't met a "helper" I've hated more since the Microsoft Office paperclip. With constant jibberish like "I know where that piece goes but I'm not gonna tell ya!" the only answer is to turn all the sound off since there is no option to get rid of her or turn her annoying voice off. Not that losing the sound really matters as the soundtrack seems to want to turn doing a jigsaw into some sort of aciton platformer with it's stress inducing rushed melody.\n\nAnyhow, if you want a jigsaw puzzle game, for for the very zen Pixel Puzzles: Japan. Much MUCH less stressful. Because hey, if I wanted a game to stress me out, I'd play Dota2!","April 29, 2015","false","27.4"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","25","35","3","3"

The music was not terrible and there are plenty of puzzles to complete.\n\nMy one big gripe with the game is the puzzle slices, generally the way a puzzle is cut up makes a huge difference and the way they are cut in this game is incredibly frustrating. The pieces are stringy and hard to tell where exactly they go, being that the colors are so bright and there isnt a huge amount of contrast on some of the puzzles so its hard to tell where exactly some of the pieces fit. When they are floating in the water though its hard to pick them.\n\nIf you enjoy anime and puzzle games though id suggest giving it a shot.","March 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

The previous ones are about Zombies, Japan or Birds. Here, you'll get images in an anime style - remember, anime is the term often used to describe cartoons from Japan.\n\nThe goal is the same: unlock more complicated puzzles (more numbers, more shapes, etc..) and rebuild the picture. You can use bonus if you collected enough fairy dusts, like the right place of the piece, or the complete image shown for a few seconds. While the pieces are floating in a sort of water, they're not necessarily already in the right direction. I mean by that that you'll need to rotate them to find the exact fitting.\n\nI enjoyed the art as it was well drawn, like I've enjoyed the soundtrack. However, while I understand the pseudo-need of putting a fairy in the game, she was speaking too much with her screams or her reflexions. After a while, you just want to make her shut up because her voice is really really striking your nerves.\n\nTrue, it's a classic jigsaw game but every game in the series is bringing something different: Japan is probably the basic game, UndeadZ added more actions and Birds got a new menu and a new way to bring bonus. Anime is adding rotation and a character to guide you and to help you. However, I can understand those that can be bored by it, as it's a question also of patience. Some puzzles requires really time to be finished and once it's done, the satisfaction is great.\n\nYeah, I recommend this one. I suppose that the fairy will annoy many of the players but don't let the game being reduced to that. It's still a good moment to pass.\n\n","January 27","true","14.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","5"

This means you can blindly try pieces in all the locations until it fits... but since some of the puzzles have hundreds of "slots" to try, you're going to be blindly slapping around for hours if you try it.  Unfortunately, the oftentimes repeated patterns or large swaths of flat color, combined with the same piece ends repeated over and over result in blind guess-and-check play, like it or not.\n\nAlso, the "harder" puzzles (although there's no lose condition, outside of getting bored and quitting,) have pieces that are at times downright TINY, and you're going to be staring at them for a while.  If your vision isn't so great, prepare for headaches and eye strain, beause we're talking about searching for straight edge pieces when the pieces are only about 12 pixels across to start with!\n\nThere's a few "pixel dust powers" you get whenever the insufferable "pixel pixie" feels like giving you "pixel dust" (which is at random time intervals and randomly after placing a puzzle piece) that let you automatically rotate the piece to the correct spot, get to view what the picture is supposed to look like, or just tell you where that one individual piece goes, but they cost progressively more pixel dust for each one, and so it's usually best to just use it to get the (cheapest) right rotation on the indistinguishable background pieces, so you only have to blindly push it through every possible slot once, instead of once per possible rotation.\n\nI only got this game in a bundle, and would never have bought it specifically because the art is only mediocre, and the pixie mascot character is such a terrible Deviant Art monstrosity even BEFORE I heard her speak.  Move over, Navi, there's a new champion of annoyingly excited lines said a billion times.  Prepare for a fairy that will shout "WOOHOO! YAY! YOU GOT THIS! THIS IS EASY! YAY! YOU GOT THIS! YOU GOT THIS!" for every piece you place in puzzles that have hundreds of pieces.\n\nThere IS a button (appropriately enough, delete,) that makes the annoying pixie go away, but it also means you give up your pixel dust powers, so you're stuck blindly moving your background pieces around until it snaps into place.\n\nUltimately, if you're someone who would like to make a jigsaw puzzle of anime characters, you're probably better served getting a real one, and sparing your nerves the annoyances of this game.  Then again, real ones cost more, so maybe you can consider this a discount puzzle game where you have to put up with the infuriating mascot as a pennance? Still, I can't imagine there aren't free browser games like this that don't have that horrible fairy in it.","October 5, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

For example the floating pieces around your table don't get stucked anymore and the puzzle is saved on exit, but pieces on the table which are not on the correct spot get resettet.\n\nAnother great improvement is the special abilities you can use (either show the original image, correct rotation or show correct spot). But the anime fairy which will grant you magic dust is very annoying after a while.\nYou can disable her, but then you won't get any dust and can't use those special abilities. The HUD element showing your current dust meter yet remains.\n\nThe big puzzle with 350 pieces was very hard, not because there were so many pieces and it took a while to get them all places, but the fact that you cannot zoom onto floating pieces. They were so small, my eyes hurt after a while.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601785193\nAnother "eye-hurting"-feature comes with the background. In some images yellow is a very common color. Too bad when the pieces with yellow color a floating on a yellow background, making it very hard to see textures. Especially hard when pieces contain horizontal or vertical lines where another color starts and you think: "oh yeah, an edge piece", but after picking it up it turns out to be something from the middle\n\nFairy and dust meter are above the floating area, makes it hard to spot the right piece, when those are floating under it.\n\nAlthough there are still things I didn't like, I can recommend the game.","January 18","true","26.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Controls are simple - click and drag - and it allows you to "snap" in the pieces that are in the right place.   The system requirements are low enough that it ran without complaint on my aging laptop, too.\n\nIf I had any negative comment, it would be that when you're doing one of the much larger puzzles (with many, many pieces) then it can be a little hard to select the piece you want, but it's a minor gripe.\n\nIf you enjoy this, then there are other games in the series - they're all just as enjoyable, especially the Japan one.","November 19, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunently a lot of severe annoyances prevented me from enjoyed it.\n\nFirst, having to continually hold the mouse button on the pieces I need to rotate it got rather tiresome on my fingers, the pieces floating around in the background made keeping track of them uncessarily difficult, and the lock in distance for the pices was huge, to the point where half the time I could just drop pieces on the board randomly in order to fit them in, negating any sense of accomplishment. I felt. The mascot fairy is annoying, though thankfulyl she can be turned off with the delete key. Also, not having cloud storage is really unforgivable for a game released in 2015.\n\nI could only recommend this if purchased as part of a bundle, and only then to people who really are desperate for a jigsaw fix.

I can't load the game with another computer.\n\nAll pictures are anime alike, but none of them come from real anime.\nThe gallery shows picture in small size and completed puzzle still have pieces curves and pixel pixie is floating in the middle of the image, I can't take a screenshot of them to make a desktop wallpaper. Too bad.\n\nEasy achievements. Basically finish all the puzzles = 100% achievements.\nTrading cards. Their prices are quite high.\n\nThere is hint level bar which filled when you put the pieces correctly. Pixel pixie occasionally fills the bar. Hiding pixel pixie will stop her to fill your hint level bar.\nLv 1. Flash Ghost Image (Temporarily shows full image for about 3s)\nLv 2. Correct Rotation (Press <ctrl> while holding a piece, and it will be rotated correctly)\nLv 3. Show Location (Press <space> while holding a piece, and it will flash its location. The piece rotation is not corrected)\nThere are 25 puzzles + 1 DL-TV puzzle to play.

To be honest, i planned on enjoying this game. Unfortunately some of the features ruined it for me.\n\nWhat i like:\n+ It's anime, anime is always good\n+ Background music sounds nice\n+ It has a good amount of nice looking pictures\n+ And it's doable despite the weird looking tentacles on each puzzle pieces, which makes it look harder than it is.\n\nWhat i hate:\n- The super-duper wonderful, praiseworthy, and unquestionably annoying little fairy that just won't give me 10 seconds to relax. It was cute at first, but after a couple of minutes it's like listening to my little sister. Over and over and over...and over.... again. I can mute the game, but then what will be of use of the background music?\n\n- What can make the situation even worse? Answer: The "wait until you have enough pixie dust in order to rotate" feature is just absolutely excruciating. I can probably urge enough patience to listen to the fairy, but not enough to play with the fairy AND with this "wait-to-rotate" feature. That's just double the pain.\n\nOverall, the game just didn't do it for me. As the saying goes, nothing's perfect. Once you find the positives, you will also find the negatives. Sadly, for this game, the negatives overrides the positives.

I thought to myself "why would this kid spend ten dollars on a weeb game just to make me cringe a little bit?" Unfortunately for me, "a little bit" was a huge understatement. I load up the game and am met with a extremely cringey transition, and the words "PRESS SPACE TO PLAY" appear on my screen. At this point, I could feel my organs begin to fail, but am kept alive by the fairly catchy beat of the song in the background. I push space, and the cringe hit me all at once.\n\nThe catchy song turned into some f**king J-pop sh*t, and the title screen appears showing some anime girls with at least 90 lens flares in the picture. A high pitch voice tells me "Welcome to Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime!", and that's when I knew what had to be done.\n\nI ran downstairs, and quickly grabbed some bleach, and a half empty bottle of Antifreeze. I ran back upstairs into my kitchen, opened the cupboard, and grabbed a large Coca-Cola glass. I began to mix the Antifreeze and bleach together into a nice delicious beverage. The glass was about three-quarters of the way full when I stopped. I then reached down under the kitchen sink and pulled out a couple Cyanide tablets. I dropped them both into the mixture I had just created, and listened to them sizzle as they dissolved. Satisfied with my creation, I quickly ran to the fridge and grabbed a freshly bought Kiwi. I took a knife, cut the Kiwi in half, took the half slice, and cut it again. I put the quarter slice of Kiwi onto the side of the glass to add a nice decoration, and began to down the toxic mixture.\n\nI finished the glass, and I stood there surprised at the fact that I was still alive. In fact, I didn't feel sick at all. I was completely fine.\n\nBut that's when things got way worse. I heard the voice again. "Welcome to Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime!" I wish that was all, but it kept repeating itself over and over. I then saw my walls change into the design of the title screen. I fell to the ground, blinded by all the lens flares in the picture, I was defeated.\n\nI am broken now. I sit here writing this review begging you not to play this game, and if you gift this to one of your poor, unsuspecting friends you are a terrible person. The voices won't stop.\n\nThey never stop.","April 13","false","0.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","3","8","3","1"

A "zoom on set" function is now also available.\nThe help system still uses the gauge you fill while placing the right bits at the right places.\nIt now has 3 options: short preview of the whole picture, correct rotation of a chosen bit, and highlighting of the correct place of a chosen bit.\n\nBits now appear in a random display in this episode. You have to rotate them frequently before placing them on the set.\nThis feature would have deserved to be a full option and not a forced feature. It's a pity.\n\nThe only real bad thing about this game lies in the soundtrack. Above the only "Rock" track looped again and again, the real pain comes from Pixel Pixie.\nThis character's voice is rather high-pitched and if its speeches are funny during the first puzzle, you may want to mute her and listen to your own music instead.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is a really good puzzle game. If you played the previous episode you will probably like this "Anime" one better.\n\n▬\n\n[FR]\n\nPixel Puzzles 2: Anime propose 25 puzzles à débloquer progressivement, répartis de la manière suivante:\n6x60 pièces / 6x112 pièces / 6x153 pièces / 6x220 pièces / 1x350 pièces\nQue peut-on attendre du successeur du mitigé Pixel Puzzles: Japan?\n\n+ Système de choix des pièces amélioré par rapport à l'épisode précédent\n+ Système d'aide amélioré par rapport à l'épisode précédent\n+ Sauvegarde régulière des pièces correctement placées\n+ 6 puzzles supplémentaires par rapport à l'épisode précédent\n+ Difficulté progressive bien dosée\n+ Variété des couleurs et des illustrations\n+ Format des pièces parfois atypique\n+ Possibilité de mélanger les pièces restantes sur le plateau\n+ Possibilité de changer la couleur du plateau\n+ Possibilité de zoomer sur les pièces du plateau\n+ Succès et cartes Steam\n+ Possibilité de désactiver Pixel Pixie\n\n- Voix et remarques du personnage Pixel Pixie rapidement pénibles\n- Une seule piste sur la bande-son, qui finit par être répétitive\n\nPixel Puzzles 2: Anime est la preuve que certains développeurs sont capables d'écouter leur public.\nAvec ses illustrations variées et colorées, il permet de passer de bons moments dans de bien meilleures conditions que son prédécesseur.\nToujours destiné aux amateurs du genre, il bénéficie d'améliorations notables qui font la différence.\n\nLe choix des pièces est désormais simplifié et plus agréable, les développeurs ayant abandonné le principe de progression de l'épisode "Japan".\nUne sauvegarde automatique a été ajoutée au jeu, ce qui constitue un excellent point. Un zoom sur le plateau est également disponible.\nLe système d'aide repose toujours sur le principe de la jauge que l'on remplit en plaçant correctement les pièces sur le plateau.\nIl propose désormais 3 options: affichage temporaire de l'image complète, rotation adéquate d'une pièce désignée, et surbrillance de la destination d'une pièce désignée.\n\nDans cet épisode, les pièces apparaissent dans un sens aléatoire; il est souvent nécessaire de les faire pivoter pour les placer sur le plateau.\nCette fonctionnalité aurait gagné a être proposée en option, et non pas imposée. Dommage.\n\nLe seul vrai point noir réside dans la bande-son; outre l'unique piste "Rock" qui tourne en boucle, le personnage de Pixel Pixie devient rapidement agaçant.\nSes remarques aigües (en Anglais) prêtent à sourire le temps d'un petit puzzle, mais vous gagnerez à la désactiver et à diffuser votre propre musique.\n\nEn résumé, ce jeu est un très bon jeu de puzzle. Si vous avez joué au précédent, vous apprécierez probablement davantage ce deuxième opus.","January 20","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Make sure you turn the sound off on the 'helper' beacuse they she will drive you insane. The fact that you have to rotate pieces can get crazy frustrating on some of the larger puzzles though, I wish you could disable this added challenge as I just play it to relax.","May 20","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say, I got exactly what I expected for a sequel to that game. I recommend it to anyone who likes jigsaw puzzles or has enjoyed a previous Pixel Puzzles game.\n\nBest Features:-	Really nice artwork featuring a good variety of anime art styles\n-	Helpful user interface for those who have trouble with puzzle games\n-	Enough puzzles to justify its price\n•	(Although, it's always better to just buy it on sale)\n-	Easy achievements\n\nWorst Features:-	Subpar soundtrack\n•	(Just mute the game and listen to your own music)\n-	 The fairy who:\n•	Blocks your user interface\n•	Is needed to make the puzzle easier\n•	Has a really bad art style\n•	Will not be quiet for 10 seconds","June 4","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now there are 3 powers 1- Correct rotation for piece 2- Ghost image 3- Show placement on board for current piece.\n-The "puzzle moat" where the pieces are is much improved in this series\n-It's a puzzle game you really should know what to expect\n\nCons:\n-Unplayable with sound. There is a "helpful" fairy that won't shut up and there is no options to disable so just turn off audio and put on whatever you like listening to since the sounds don't add much anyway.\n-Each puzzle only has X number of pieces you can't play any with different piece counts, same as the first series.\n\nIMO it's worth it on a sale. I play this afk at work so this is great as it never requires 100% of my attention.\n\nEdit: They apperently did update where you can press "Delete" and it will remove the fairy but the game does not tell you that, had to read it on a forum.\n\nHad ~25 hours when I finished all of the puzzles but that is time the game was open and not actual gameplay.","June 4","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
