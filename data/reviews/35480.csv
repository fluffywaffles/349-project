I played this game for about 2 hours and put it down as I was not particularly compelled to continue. The game isn't terrible; there are certainly far worse out there but the gameplay is just "OK" to the point where it's not worth playing in my opinion. There are several gamemodes but the main gamemode is called "Arcade Mode" where you essentially go as long as you can for a high score.  This game would be good as a tablet/phone game that I would play on the subway but as a PC game I need more of a reason to play this.

You use arrows, walls and dynamite to guide them towards treasures and away from danger. The dangers that await the dwarfs are lava, water and nasty creatures like goblins and spiders. And the dwarfs love looking for treasure, so much so that they will dig into a lava pit to find some. Fortunately you are given the tools to prevent this from hapening. You get guide arrows to switch their direction, dynamite to create holes for water and lava to flow in and walls to block the flow of water and slow the flow of lava. You can also seal up areas permanently by hardening rock, but this can cost a lot of gold (especially in the harder difficulties).\n\nWith the game's multiple mode, difficulty and time settings you can enjoy a nice long high score game, or go for a quick 5 minute hardcore challenge. There is also an alternate game, akin to a carnival shooting gallery (throwing axes/shooting at side scrolling targets), which can be fun for a bit.\n\nFor the achievement & perfect game collectors, this game offers a 2 for 1. Any achievement you get in the paid version will also be unlocked if you play the free version. The achievements themselves are fairly easy to get within a few hours. The only issue is that some of the achievements will not register in the paid version, unless you unlock them in the free version (you can meet the criteria in the paid version and not need to buy the dlc).\n\nOverall a nice game, 7/10. Definitely worth picking up in a sale.\nI wouldn't buy it out of sale (£7.99 / $9.99), but it may be worth it to some, so try the free version first.","November 23, 2014","true","12.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

THE DWARVES ARE MINDLESS IDIOTS!\n\nThe game encourages you to let the dwarves do the work themselves, and makes controlling them very difficult as a way of forcing you to sit back and watch them work. But the mindlessly dig through ANYTHING, including the walls you build for their own protection! Their mindless digging can make the most trivial problems, such as a flood, to become a serious problem as you try to block them off with walls that they simply dig through. To seal off a flood, you have to spend gold to seal off the surrounding area and then bomb the entryway (and suicide bombing is the only bombing available) to make sure a dwarf doesn't dig through the wall blocking the flood, even though the wall blocks the flood just fine.\n\nSeriously people, if you can't control the dwarves then you're not really the one in charge are you? Did I mention how difficult it is to try and control them? (You can't actually do it, but you can try to) This game is just endless frustration due to the Dwarves constantly making montains out of mole hills.

Lava does the same, only it's slightly more dangerous because it also eats through brick walls that you build in its path. And that's about it. Water or lava, and your efforts to dynamite it and plug it back up, while your dumb dwarves keep on multiplying, and finding new routes to burrow in to the lava or water. (Which kills them.)\n\nA real one-trick pony, this one. Obtained as part of a bundle, and only played to unlock an item in Tripwire's far more successful game, 'Killing Floor'.

But as it just so happens to be, this isn't a bad little game. It's simple enough in design but can yield a nice challenge.\n\nBetween the lava rushes and floods, mother nature can be one hateful ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. You may think having only two environmental hazards would quickly become stale, but I didn't find that to be the case. They can be unforgiving.\n\nThere are several modes in Dwarfs?! but for the most part your goal is to mine as much of the map as you can, without your base being overcome before the time runs out.\n\nIn each game you'll have ups and downs contained within caves of unknown content until entrance that could either hold Gold, a Boss, mini-hoard, lava, or water.\n\nYou can spend in game currency to use blocks that block off cave systems and prevent your workers from breaching the containment area but be warned, if you block off the entire system without first discovering it's contents there will be a penalty in the form of a deduction from your gold... an important item I may add. One tactic you may want to try is blocking off all but 1 square then send in 2 workers with dynamite equipped in case it's lava or water. In that event it's best to sacrifice a worker to make a drainage hole in the earth and completely sealing that hazard, which will give you a bonus.\n\nAlong the way you may construct outposts with your gold and train warriors and workers. Good thing they put this in because the map is rather large and this will cut down on travel time during combat or intervention.\n\nIn the harder modes controlling your workers becomes extremely important. There are more hazards to be found and they flow faster so having 2 or 3 workers tap into separate conduits will be a quick death for you.\n\nSo that's the general idea, I'll let you explore the rest of the game for yourself :)\n\nOh yeah, don't forget about the Killing Floor award, whatever it was.

That alone makes the game worth the small price you'll pay for it. Seriously, give it a shot if you play Killing Floor. You may decide you hate it, but I don't think you'll regret unlocking that axe one bit.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Look, playing the game does not unlock the achievement for some reason, but they claim that owning the full version that you paid for in Steam and having your profile set to public so the servers can pick up the fact that you own it should unlock it automatically in Killing Floor. If you get it, it will appear right beneath DLC on your Killing Floor page as Dwarfs!? Promotional DLC. Good Luck. BUT if you have the free version, I think you have to unlock the achievement--which seems not to work for a lot of people. Check the forums. Good luck.\n\nOriginal Review: Addictive little arcade game about dwarves, not to be confused with that other more trendy game about establishing dwarven settlements. For what it is, it's a fun diversion when you're bored or need a little PTSD therapy. The limits eventually get old, but while it lasts, it's a bit of fun. After a while, if you're careful, it just comes down to juggling things until time runs out.... then the replayability fades somewhat, though to be honest, I haven't even tried all the game modes. There's a tower defense mode a shooting gallery, and more. Get it on sale if you think you might enjoy it and give it a try. For the day I've spent playing the game (24.1 hours), if I had to make the decision again, I'd spend $2.50 on it.\n\nOkay, that's a bit snarky, admittedly. It's simple, but fun. I recommend it for kids, young and old, who don't mind playing a game with older-looking graphics. Buy it on sale.\n\nP.S. Developer appears to have taken note of my complaint regarding monitor resolution issues and made it easier for me to get to options and reset the settings to something that works better for me. That or the game fixed itself. That or I imagined the whole thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MageRanger/recommended/35480/","MageRanger","Mage Ranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MageRanger/","195 products in account","This is repetitive but really fun. It's a casual 2D strategy Indie game which includes a bonus Tower Defense game-mode, and more. This game is more of a game where you run in the background whilst doing other things in the non-virtual world. For example: I love to paint my Games Workshop miniatures, so I play this game in the background, listening to calm, enjoyable music while i'm painting my miniatures. If my Dwarfs need help or require micro-managing so they won't release Doom, I pause my painting and micro-manage them. When it's all safe, I return to painting.\n\nThe main game-play or game-mode is the, 'Arcade mode'. This is where you select a difficulty a time limit, so a random generated underworld spawns. Your Dwarfs will go mining anywhere they like, although you can set them paths to mine for a bit of gold. Caves will spawn in the map which can contain good or bad things or nothing for your Dwarfs. It could be an empty cave, it could filled with water of lava that will spread killing anything in it's path until contained or until it reaches and destroys your town. It could be filled with goblins, or even a boss goblin; 'Shaman'. It could be filled with treasure or with rich minerals to mine. Minerals will spawn around the map to be mined so it can be turned into gold.\n\nThe 'Campaign' are basically challenges as well as a tutorial.\n\nThe 'Skirmish' are basically bonus game-modes. The first one is 'Sandbox'. This is basically where you can play around with the underworld. Spawn in everything you like and mess around with the settings of things like: water or lava speed. You can make the world for your dwarfs to thrive, or just die. It's basically arcade mode but instead of a random generated world, you get to create the world before or during when your dwarfs mine, with no time limit.\n\nRush mode is basically Arcade mode but with one difficulty and no time limit. The catch is however, new Dwarfs spawn all the time and you have 200 lives (so if 200 dwarfs die, you die/loose).\n\nDark mode is like Arcade mode but there is only one difficulty and no time limit. However the catch is, everything that isn't mined is hidden. So you don't know where the minerals are or the caves.\n\nEndless mode is basically Arcade mode but you decide how big the map is as well as there is no-time limit.\n\nCarnival game mode is basically a bonus game mode. You are a dwarf and you have throw axes at moving targets. You can move within a small area but you only have 10 axes. This game-mode is fun to compete with friends to see who can get the highest score.\n\nThe last game-mode is called 'Base defence.' This basically tower defence but with a twist. You get to create your own paths with digger Dwarfs. Whenever a portal spawns, just before the goblins spawn, a digger dwarfs spawns. He'll try to dig to your village the quickest way possible, but you can always create him your own paths, for some money. Whenever you kill a goblin, you get money. And like any other tower defence game, you can buy towers and then upgrade them.\n\nOverall I think this game is great and fun to play. It's worth getting this game if you like casual games.","April 26, 2015","true","12.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I played a good 4 hours of it.\nBut the balance between control and escalation in difficulty is not very good and kind of makes the game as simple as tetris.\n\nYou start off with your base. There are 3 types of enemies: Actual enemies(there are 3 types, bosses, small goblins and spiders, all as easy, since goblins and spiders are easy to get and bosses are based), water and lava.\nYour base pumps out 1 worker/half a minute or so who starts digging.\nAfter awhile you got so many workers that you cant control them, and you'll just let lose. They'll find lava and water which you'll end up walling off over and over since your workers are suicidal. Eventually you lose.\n\nI only recommend getting this if it goes on sale.","June 5, 2014","false","8.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

If you like action puzzlers like flight control, droplitz, devil dice, bombastic and miner disturbance you will love this game. Dwarfs!? is nothing like dwarf fortress, the best way i can think to describe is a mixture of flight control and lemmings. Iv had allot of fun competing to positions in the high score board and i know i will continue playing for a long time to come.\n\nThe carnival event is the weakest part of the game, it was added a free dlc back before dwarfs was "f2p", its just a pointless little addition, completely disjointed from the main game (which i consider arcade mode to be the main game) The campaign made serves as a good tutorial but definitely isn't long enough to be a selling point. I had fun with it but its only 10 minutes long. The base defense mode is playable for a an hour or so but is very bare bone, if you have already bought the whole game it can be a bit of fun but i would not recommend buying it separately.\n\nIv found most of the fun or this game to be chasing a high score in arcade mode, its mostly free of hacked and glitched high scores which is great. There is a few scores at the top which are over 50,000,000 which i obviously glitched or hacked but i can attest that the rest are legit including all of mine where i can be found in the top 10 of most game modes.","December 22, 2013","true","64.3"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I ended up really enjoying the gameplay, learning how to efficiently collect resources and defeat the various bosses.  A lot of how each game plays out is up to chance (map generation), so sometimes even the best orders don't work out the way you expect.  Especially on the harder difficulties, gold is at a premium and preventing dwarfs from flooding the cave with water or lava can be a challenge while balancing hiring and training warriors to fight endless goblins or spiders attacking your outposts.\n\nThe axe-throwing mini-game is easy by comparison and gets old quickly.  Overall, the game is good fun.","May 5, 2014","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But that's where the Dwarf Fortress comparison ends. If you're expecting a pure strategy/sim hybrid like Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper, you need to play the demo before you buy because it's not one of those.\n\nOtherwise, pretty good action strategy game. Decent replay value; aside from the main 'arcade' mode, there's a set of five campaign maps that task you with mastering different game mechanics, four variants of normal play, and a tower defense game.","May 5, 2011","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(This version is the full game; the F2P version allows you to buy individual parts of the game.)]\n\nDwarfs!? is a strangely addicting game. If you enjoy arcade games, where the main objective is to beat your high score (or someone else's high score), you'll probably love this game.\n\nThe way you score is by getting as much gold as you can, while trying to stay alive--but you're dwarfs aren't the brightest and will insist on digging into caves filled with water, lava, and monsters, so you'll have to keep a close eye on them, which becomes harder and harder as the game progresses.\n\nThe game has four difficulties which can be played in 5, 15, 30, and 60 min sessions (but beware, you cannot save the game mid-session).\n\nThe only problem I've encountered is in long games, where you have thousands of dwarfs in the field at one time, my computer starts to lag--which makes the game very difficult and frustrating to play.\n\nOverall, this is a fun, simple, casual game that can keep you entertained for hours or opened for a quick 5-minute session.","July 6, 2011","true","69.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What, you ask? Looking at screenshots I was sure there is more things to do - like building your own dwarf village, exploring limitless caverns and such. Well, even tho it was nothing like I thought it would be, I was still surprised. Maybe a little annoyed at beginning, because everything was happening way too fast: just got few dwarfs, "gave" them some arrows and there are plenty new ones, something happened on west and OH WAIT WHAT IS ALL OF THIS WATER AND WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I'M IN TROUBLE!? Everything that is happening in this game is fast - you need to have an eye on whole map every second. Little dwarfs are really curious and when you will leave them alone for few second they will for sure find some nest full of monsters, water or lava. Even tho it seems hard, in reality it's not, all you need if focus and some strategy. Once you will have both it will be really enjoyable adventure with this game and hardest difficulty levels will be easy and fun to play.\n\nI don't regret playing and buying this game. Challenges, minigames were really fun and free mode is where you can show your skills.

Some story mode with different quests would be really great. Currently the game is fun, but you probably won't play it for twenty hours or more.

Well now I always thought Dwarfs were supposed to be smart, but playing this game one would think they were the dumbest collection of inbred idiots ever... Now don't get me wrong this game is not that bad actually, it's a good way to pass time if you are in the mood for something similar the old "Dig Dug" game from Namco we used to play on our ancient Box style TV's...\n\nThe aim of the game is to try and control your little idiot dwarfs in a big square of dirt with random black areas which are supposed to be caves, inside these caves can be a number of good or bad things like Lava (Bad), Water (Bad), Goblins (Bad), a Boss to fight (Bad), Sweet Blow Nothing (Bad) or 3 or 4 blocks of treasure (The only good thing in the game)\n\nAnd while you are trying to get your little idiots to get to the treasure they just keep on reproducing themselves up to a point ( Doesn't take very long actually - about 10-15 minutes ) where you are no longer in control of the game at all... you just have to try and keep an eye on the many warning messages that pop up to try and save your little idiot dwarf strongholds and village... My opinion these dwarfs are so stupid I think you would be doing them a favor to kill them.\n\nThere is one good thing about the game though and that’s the mini games... well its not that amazing, to give you an idea, if you can remember playing the Olympics game on the old tv games where you had the archery challenge well this is the same thing, except you are throwing axes at 3 board targets with a bunch of wood poles getting in your way.\n\nWow this is probably the most sarcasm I ever put in a review... so the verdict.\n\nTHIS GAME IS CRAP !\nMy Rating - 4/10 - You have absolutely no control of the game whatsoever, you can just as well sit and watch the computer play its own game.","January 26, 2014","false","1.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

At its core this game is like a very basic version of pacman meets minecraft.  Dwarfs spawn continously and move about the mine map on their own.  You guide them and coax them to do your bidding to explore, gain money/increase score.  As more dwarfs spawn the harder it is to control them.\n\nThere are no complicated elements to distract you from the main aim of the game which is to guide your dwarfs as they mine the map uncovering resources or caves with rewards or dangers.  You can build outposts with guards to fight off monsters, use dynamite to cut-off dangerous traps or turn earth to concetre to block of sections you dont want your miners to explore.  These simple mechanics mean you can get into the game very, very quickly.  However just because it is simple to play does not mean it is easy to master...\n\nThe game has a lot of depth with several game modes including a set of campaign challenges which plays like a tutorial that gets harder and encourages you to develop your technique.  These will become vital in the Arcade mode or the Skirmish challenges.  Gameplay remains the same throughout with the difficultly and the achievements being the driver for you to take on harder and harder challenges.\n\nOverall I found this fun if the last few challenges a little frustrating but, its great to start up if you just want some quick frantic fun for an hour or so.  It is repetitive with only the randomly drawn maps changing from game to game.  Though for what it costs its value for money.  Just dont expect AAA graphics.\n","March 12, 2014","true","30.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am shocked this game is priced at $10; it is barely worth half that at best.\n\nI was looking forward to this game for some time and recently bought a bundle just for this game....what a disappointment.\n\n\nPROS:\n-It works\n\n\nNEUTRALS:\n-Graphics are bare minimum.\n-A number of game modes, but several of them are more like a one time play level rather than a game mode (although some are randomly generated, several others are not).\n-Gameplay is very shallow and repetitive (just watch until your dwarves screw something up, then build some walls)\n\n\nCONS:\n-EXTREMELY simplistic game. It looks complicated on the surface, but the bulk of gameplay is build a wall or blow up dwarves.\n-Bulk of gameplay consists of you sitting waiting for something to go wrong (usually because one of your dwarves does something stupid).\n-Lots of random involved.\n-Dwarves will destroy walls you just built to stop water....you can blow up the dwarf but this is purely aggravating design.","February 18","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You have certain game modes to choose from: challenges, survival or campaign. Make your units dig until they are drowned, burn to death, killed by enemies or blown up by their own explosives.\n\nI enjoyed playing survival more than any other mode. Survival has great gameplay, at least until you don't die by digging into fire or dangerous liquids. By digging, you will gain coins and veins such as gold veins will give you a ton more gold, explore caves for treasure or discover enemies to fight.\n\nCampaign is really nice, along with the tutorial on how to play. The challenging part is when striking water or fire, they spread and can ruin the game by making you lose everything. Once the fire or water reaches your main base, it is over!\n\nThe more you dig and the more money you're receiving, build more bases, hire more diggers to help. This is a really enjoyable game and I'd recommend it to anyone.","September 22, 2014","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And it is. There isn't much to it. The UI and unit control is clunky and difficult to work with. It's a bit buggy and it's not much to look at. However... it's pretty addictive.\n\nThe poor UI seems to be part of the difficulty of the game. When you are trying to cope with a river of Lava consuming your tunnel network, two Giant Spider Queens infesting your mine with hundreds of spiders, a flood, and all the while trying to mine gold to fund your efforts, things get pretty frantic and desperate.\n\nYou may find it very annoying in fact, as often the game will give you virtually no time to react. There is a slow time ability on a long cooldown, but even with this often it is impossible to stop a lava flow in time for example.\n\nYou have no direct control over the dwarves. Instead you can choose to spend money to force them to walk and dig in a particular direction. This makes every decision difficult if you are trying to conserve money, which you will need for military units, and for blocking off fatal sections of the mine, or forcing your miners to commit suicide to block off a tunnel.\n\nThe gameplay kind of reminds me of Dungeon Keeper (i'm sure there are better examples though) and makes me wonder if this game doesn't have a better approach to unit control. After all, you wouldn't expect to be able to rapidly redeploy your forces and execute manoeuvres underground.\n\nThere are a few random mini games thrown in, a few different play modes, even a tower defence for some reason. But the main game is where it's at. Try it on Normal mode for an hour and see if you can last that long! Definitely worth a look if you are interested in strat or managment games.","November 12, 2014","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game also have different modes from Sandbox to Endless to even Challenges to test your skills you've leant from experience. I love the Arcade mode. Arcade mode is the mode where a randomly-generated map is made and your dwarfs will dig literally mindlessly to look for gold or any other materials. But be warned, apart from Trasure Caves, there are also caves that contain enemies, water that would flood your village and lava that would burn everything in your village. Your enemy will attack your base and kill all the dwarfs they come across. Fortunately, you have guards to guard your village a.k.a. base from evil.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to those who love cute, time-wasting, offline games with a bit of curiousity and a small touch of adventure.","December 17, 2013","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had pretty well told myself from the beginning that I wasn't going to enjoy the game, the decision based on screenshots & videos I had seen of the game.  After playing the game for a while, I actually began to enjoy it; I believe the fact that the maps are completely randomized is what drew me in.  I hadn't decided whether I was going to pay for the full version of the game or not at the point, but eventually did.  The way I see it, it's better to have the full version where gameplay modes are added for free, rather than having the free version & having to pay for each game mode separately.  On the other hand, if you only plan on playing a certain mode & won't be touching the others, you probably don't need to the full version (and is otherwise cheaper) & can just pay for the modes you plan on playing.","January 25, 2014","true","31.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didn't expect something good, since it looked 'just' alright and I didn't exactly know what to expect. But it's the best €4,50 I've spent so far during this 2011 summer sale. Allow me to explain what you have to do in this game. You basically control (not directly, it's more like micromanaging) dwarfs who dig on their own. Along the way you find caves, which contain treasures (hooray !), water (nothing you can't handle, if you're quick), lava (prepare to spend your money), or enemies (boo ! boo !). Plus, you can get achievements by digging through 500 blocks, 1000 blocks, killing a shaman, things like that. It all adds up to your total score in the end. Even though it's a score-based game, I'm having lots of fun with the digging and managing. And it's always random. It's awesome !\nIt's similar to a lot of other sandbox games, since you have no real objectives. You just have to survive for xx minutes and try to do as much as you can.

You have certain game modes to choose from: challenges, survival or campaign. Make your units dig until they are drowned, burn to death, killed by enemies or blown up by their own explosives.\n\nI enjoyed playing survival more than any other mode. Survival has great gameplay, at least until you don't die by digging into fire or dangerous liquids. By digging, you will gain coins and veins such as gold veins will give you a ton more gold, explore caves for treasure or discover enemies to fight.\n\nCampaign is really nice, along with the tutorial on how to play. The challenging part is when striking water or fire, they spread and can ruin the game by making you lose everything. Once the fire or water reaches your main base, it is over!\n\nThe more you dig and the more money you're receiving, build more bases, hire more diggers to help.

I had read about it before hand so I didn't feel disapointed about it being completely different, I think one of the developers said "don't think DF, think lemmings" (or maybe it was totalbiscuit, can't remember I'm afraid). Like lemmings, your dwarfs will happily walk to their doom or do something that screws up your entire game. This is where the majority of the challenge comes from and I think the game suffers for that a little. In order to help with that you can change the direction that your dwarf is digging with arrows, make an infintiely deep hole by sacrificing your dwarf (this will allow you to pour water/lava away) and hardening the walls which makes it impossible to dig through. These tools cost you a lot of money so its important to be smart about how you are spending. Yes, those rare crystals would be faster to get to using an arrow but if a dwarf uncovers lava in an open area then you are in real trouble. As the game goes on you will gain more dwarfs which will make earning money much quicker but also opens up problematic areas more quickly too.\n\nThe nice things about it is that there are a lot of difficulty levels and it requires a lot of concentration. If you enjoy being challenged, you will find that itch scratched in this game. Another nice feature is that you set a time limit before you go in, great if you have a specific amount of time to burn. The graphics and music are nice too.\n\nTheres quite a lot of comedy here too. The narrator is voiced by one of the yogscast youtube starts. I'm not too into the yogscast myself but I know it has a lot of fans and some people will just eat that up! The acheivements are fun to get too and its very self aware in its humour.\n\nI give it 5/10, to me that's an average game. This doesn't mean I say you should completely ignore it, it's fine and it may turn out that you love it. I think I will pick it up from time to time as it does have an entertaining value to it, but unless its on a steam sale you might want to pass up on this one. I can imagine that people who don't like the "hands off" simulation game like dwarf fortress or dungeon keeper then the on purpose dumb AI could drive them absolutely mad. Personally I think that if you watched a gameplay video of this and you think it looks fun, then you will find it fun. I feel a little bad giving it an average score as there are a lot of fun nice little things here there just isn't too much of it, but what is here is very well polished.\n\nI'd love to hear what other players think.","February 24, 2014","true","10.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeaslyTripod/recommended/35480/","MeaslyTripod","MeaslyTripod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeaslyTripod/","979 products in account","Developed by an indie studio "Power of 2" and published by "Tripwire Interactive" known for "Red Orchestra" and "Killing Floor", this is a unique RTS of multi-tasking for single player, while you protect your base from lots of troubles, you simultaneously need to get more scores for online competition.\nThe main mode of the game is Arcade, in which you aim to get high score for the online score board within limited time which can be set to 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes.\nYou take the role of an overseer for dwarfs who randomly moves towards caves for minerals such as gold or silver and direct them at randomly generated map, the more minerals dwarfs get the higher points for score can be gained.\nWhile some caves contain gold or silver that give point for the score, others contain dooms you must stop to save your dwarfs such as lava or flood or monsters.\nAlthough these troubles can be stopped by putting arrows to direct your dwarfs, each arrow consumes gold which can be gained by getting minerals.\nIn addition, each dwarf gains experience and levels up so careful plan and management for both resource and units are vital.\nWith 7 other game mode and 4 difficulty levels and 29 achievements to unlock, this game can be your long time friend for its low price.\n\nNot only simple to play and easy to learn with tutorial but also has its depth which makes the game quite addictive, worth buying if you're ok with fast-paced RTS that will keep you busy during the play.\nPlay F2P (free to play) version, and buy the full version if you like it, it's just for 2.5$ during 75% off sale!\nPurchasing the full version or unlocking an achievement by collecting a cumulative total of 40k gold on the F2P version, unlocks "Dwarfs!? Axe", a two-handed melee weapon for Berserker perk in "Killing Floor".\n\n(Japanese translation below)\n\n==================================================\n\nインディメーカーのPower of 2によって開発されRed OrchestraシリーズやKilling Floorで知られるTripwire Interactiveにより販売された、複数の作業を同時にこなす一風変わった1人用RTS、本陣を守りながら稼いだスコアを他プレイヤーとオンラインで競い合います。\nメインは制限時間内(5分、15分、30分、60分から選択可能)に稼いだスコアを他プレイヤーとオンライン上で競い合うアーケードモード、プレイヤーはランダムに生成されるマップを舞台に、無作為に壁を掘り進んで鉱物を集めるドワーフ達に監督官として指示を出してより多くの鉱物＝スコアを稼がせるのです。\nドワーフ達は自動的に壁を掘り進んでゴールドを集めてくれますが、時には溶岩や洪水や魔物の群れといった災害を発生させてしまうのでプレイヤーが指示を出して助ける必要があります。\n矢印を設置することでドワーフの移動方向を変更できるものの、矢印は鉱物最終によって得られる資源ゴールドを消費するので無闇に指示を出せば良いものではありません。\nまた各ドワーフは経験を得てレベルアップするので綿密な計画に加え資源とユニットの両方の管理が必要です。\nアーケードモードの他にも7つのゲームモードに4段階の難易度と29の実績があります。\n\n単純なシステムに分かり易いルールとやりこみ要素が加味され何度も遊べるのが売り、展開が速くプレイ中は休めないようなRTSが好きなら買う価値があります。\n無料で遊べるF2P版で試遊して気に入ったら買いましょう、価格に対して長く遊べる良作RTSです。\n75％オフセール中に買えばたったの2.5ドルです。\nなお製品版を購入するか無料版で累計40000ゴールド稼ぐ実績を解除することで、Killing Floorで使うBerserker用両手持ちの近接武器Dwarfs!? Axeが解禁されます。","October 16, 2013","true","1.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","2"

But I will state for thoses that may wonder both the full and free to play version share between each other is all progress, score and achievments.\n\nIn the game you have the campain, challenges which tests out your skills. You have arcade mode which has easy normal hard and finally tedi difficulty. You have base defence which pretty much says it in the title, quite a fun experience, also there is a bonis mode which has a ray of diffrent game types, from sand box mode to throwing axes at moving tartgets at the carnvial. Lastly you have the score menu which shows all your scores, achievments, medals and so on.\n\nEven though for me I don't play fast paced arcade games, however I found myself really enjoying this game and I would say if you are intrested, try the free to play version if you are not sure.

Hilarious.\n\nA very cheeky RTS in it's own right. The campaign has an increasing level of difficulty, some borderline impossible at times - depending on how smart you are with your limited Dwarven friends. Sometimes they're smart, travelling to the nearest ore and making you plenty of money - other times their route takes a turn for the worst and enemies will filter through.\nIt's a great timewaster, like most games I review - but put enough thought and energy into it, and you'll realize the game can open up a few doors of complexity not found in even AAA games.","July 7, 2011","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like a combination of Lemmings, Terraria and Lord of the Rings. Essentially you play a dwarf overseer watching over constantly spawning dwarfs as they dig their way in the earth in search of caves that could contain treasures or peril such as monsters, water or lava. It's up to you to dig up the treasures, train warriors, neutralize threats to your base and direct your dwarfs where you see fit. Thankfully the game doesn't require a lot of micromanagement which makes for a game that is deep and exciting at the same time. The game features multiple modes for a lot of replay value and even ... a tower defense mode. Definately recommend this game!","July 24, 2012","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you go for an 60 minute session the dungeon/mine becomes confusingly big rather quick. Even on maximum distance you easily have 20x20 screens full of something that happens. And since we can't save camera positions (suggestion #1) I have serious trouble of remembering what happend where and we're forced to being depended on the annotations.\nSuggestion #2: In such a big dungeon the number of outposts becomes overwhelmingly big. Somewhere I trained some dwarfs and in some other locations I build more diggers (both for an expense in income). However after a while I had an emergency and no gold left and even had some minus income. I needed several minutes to figure which outpost is draining my gold. But when I found out it was too late. Thus I would really like to see an overview for all outposts in an window and whether the outposts trains dwarfs or build diggers.\nNumber 3: When an outpost becomes destroyed we cannot rebuild it? The warrior dwarfs always are confused and so am I. Do I need to build a new outpost from scratch for the full prize?\n\nI think these small Quality-of-Life fixes would greatly improve the experience since they give the player more control.","April 8, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/recommended/35480/","FlyingShisno","Flying Shisno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/","769 products in account","This is a fun little Arcade/Sim/Strategy game. You start out with a base, which is constantly generating miners which will go out and mine on there on, usually in the general direction of minerals. You can also set down a path that the Dwarf, and any other Dwarf that steps on the path will follow. This is great for getting them to go mine the good stuff. Eventually it gets to the point where there's simply too many miners to micro manage, which is fine and part of the fun. They'll eventually, whether purposely or accidentally  mine into a water reservoir. You have to quickly wall it off and mark the tiles surrounding it as a "don't mine this!" warning, else it'll drown everyone. They'll eventually also mine into lava, which acts almost the same, except it'll burn through your man-made walls, so you have to make a hole in the floor, using dynamite and a Dwarf sacrifice, then mark the walls with a no-mine warning. You have to be quick though, since Dwarfs move slow and the lava needs to be secured before it burns through all your walls.\n\nIt's fun just mining around, then suddenly one of your Dwarfs off screen will tunnel into lava, then you have to rush to fix it.\n\nIt's a fun game, though perhaps a bit overpriced at $10. I recommend playing the F2P version, and if you like that, buy the paid version, which offers much more. Though try to get that on sale also.","April 27, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as an overseer whose goal is to manage the dwarve's mining operations and make sure things go smoothly.\n\nAs an overseer you have to control the safety of your mine through moving units, dealing with environmental hazards and building new structures. Gold is the main currency in the game. It is obtained by simply letting miners detroy blocks on the map. Miners will go off on their own detroying blocks and earning gold and aren't all directly controlled by the player. However, the direction the dwaf is moving in can be manipulated by selecting them and draging  (which creates a path) in a direction to make them move somewhere else. This can't be done sparringly however as it costs gold and the further the direction you send the dwarf, the more it costs. That is why it is best to let the dwarves do their own thing and simply resolve problems when they arise (like lemmings). There are also traps such as water and lava (which floods the mine). When they reach your town hall, the game ends. To deal with this, you have to block the entrance with walls. Lava will break down walls over time, so you have to set explosives to create holes for lava to fall into. Further hazards are enemies such as goblins, spiders, skeletons etc which can be found within the mines. To help deal with these foes you can recruit soldiers. All units gain experience as they complete their tasks, which makes them perform better when they level up. Besides building walls and dynamite, you can also build outposts. Outposts can be used to train your soldiers which increase health and damage. Training takes time and the more time it takes, the more gold it costs.\n\nThere are plenty of game modes to play. Campaign involves completing challenges which range between getting a certain score, number of units or defeating foes with limited troops. There is also a tower defence mode, where you have to defend your town hall against waves of foes through clever tunnel and tower placement. Arcade mode has you explore a massive map in timed game, trying to get the highest score. Skirmish includes a variety of different modes including a carnival game (where you have to hit the targets) and endless mode (play a 60 minute game). With all theses game modes available, there is plenty of replayability.\n\nAudio is decent. The music is alright and gives a somewhat light-hearted medieval feel. Voice acting from the tutorial guy is decent as well.\n\nGraphics are dated. Textures don't have alot of detail to them and the models are basic.\n\nIf you enjoy games where you can sit back and let your workers do most of the work, and solve issues when they occur, as well as having plenty of game modes, this game is for you.\n","April 25, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's something very satisfying about watching your dwarves dig out a massive underground empire. Just an all around well crafted game that allows you to play at your own pace: with more involved path-carving for individual dwarves or simply sitting back, holding down the speed button to prevent boredom and seeing what happens.\n\nThere is really nothing I can name about this game that i dislike. (except the lack of a high-score list on endless mode? but i guess the fact that it's endless is the reasoning behind that decision. heheh...)\n\nThe list of things I like about it is too tediously long for a sloth like me to bang out.\n\nI will simply say 10/10\n\nwhether you have 5 minutes or 4 hours, it's hard to go wrong with this game","April 14, 2015","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you go for an 60 minute session the dungeon/mine becomes confusingly big rather quick. Even on maximum distance you easily have 20x20 screens full of something that happens. And since we can't save camera positions (suggestion #1) I have serious trouble of remembering what happend where and we're forced to being depended on the annotations.\nSuggestion #2: In such a big dungeon the number of outposts becomes overwhelmingly big. Somewhere I trained some dwarfs and in some other locations I build more diggers (both for an expense in income). However after a while I had an emergency and no gold left and even had some minus income. I needed several minutes to figure which outpost is draining my gold. But when I found out it was too late. Thus I would really like to see an overview for all outposts in an window and whether the outposts trains dwarfs or build diggers.\nNumber 3: When an outpost becomes destroyed we cannot rebuild it? The warrior dwarfs always are confused and so am I. Do I need to build a new outpost from scratch for the full prize?\n\nI think these small Quality-of-Life fixes would greatly improve the experience since they give the player more control.","April 8, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of those games you can enjoy a few drinks and have a good time. I played it usually as a side thing while I semi listened/watched to something else while delving into it. The gameplay is similar to minesweeper where a cave system opens up with a bit of RNG involved on whether or not it's a dangerous opening or a rewarding one. The main reason I purchased it however was to obtain some DLC for Killing Floor but fell into it's quirky unique nature almost immediately. The micromanaging on the dwarfs is very addicting and the simplicity it presents makes for a memorable experience that kept me returning. Don't let the seemingly sub par graphics disuade you.

The campaign has an increasing level of difficulty, some borderline impossible at times - depending on how smart you are with your limited Dwarven friends. Sometimes they're smart, travelling to the nearest ore and making you plenty of money - other times their route takes a turn for the worst and enemies will filter through.\nIt's a great timewaster, like most games I review - but put enough thought and energy into it, and you'll realize the game can open up a few doors of complexity not found in even AAA games.","July 7, 2011","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it's even not a game. It's just a thing to kill the time. I do not have anything against killing the time, but the game with a such goal definitely shouldn't cost $10.","February 20, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I put my time in Arcade mode and maybe some day I will try other modes too. The dwarfs never know where they are going and might just end up flooding their new tunnel with water or lava or even enemies and then you have to block away the tunnel and make sure no other dwarf open it up again. You can give the dwarfs orders where they should dig but they still like to do whatever they want a lot of time so mostly you are just trying to prevent everyone from digging their way to their deaths. The more dwarfs you have digging in and bigger your map is, more hectic the managing will be! It is lots of fun and even challenging on times! There is no story other than... dwarfs dig for gold.
