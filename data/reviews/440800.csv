"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/440800/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","You are the viking, a hero who probably wouldn't look out of place in Final Fantasy 4's Dwarven Kingdom. I mean, just look at that magnificent beard. Anyway, you've been summoned by Odin to rid Asgard of Loki's minions. The story is a standard Norse tale, but the final boss being determined by choices made at pivotal moments in the plot is a nice touch. Oh what am I saying? Not even one paragraph into the review and I'm already talking about the end. So let's step back for just a minute.\n\nYour progress in Trial by Viking is determined not just by being able to reach the end of the 100+ levels. You also have to find sun-crystals. These shiny gems are used to purchase abilities, tools, and weapon-upgrades. This is one of the interesting aspects of this game. Eventually you'll need certain items in order to progress, but there's nothing stopping you from getting them early, in order to make certain levels easier. However, you also have to be considerate of the fact that there are only so many crystals in each level. You can't expect to repeat levels in order to farm them.\n\nBefore I start discussing the controls, I want to briefly touch on Super Metroid. As fantastic as this game is, its controls could be considered "floaty" by some people. The jump physics, while extremely flexible, might even frustrate a handful of gamers. I think that this is a unique quality, and the identity it helps create is part of the reason why Super Metroid is so revered. Trial of Viking has controls that are quite different as well, which also gives it an identity of its own. Now if you're thinking that I might be giving this game a little too much credit, by comparing it to a genre-stalwart, then you're probably right.\n\nThe Viking in this game moves in a very loose manner. Moving around will take time to get used to, and for some players, the pure-platforming levels are going to be especially difficult. However, this can work to your advantage. If you get some momentum going, you can quickly move past a lot of danger. Also, unlike some other games, taking damage typically won't knock you into the nearest pit. You'll get pushed around, but you have ample time to recover. You might even purposely get hurt just to give yourself a little boost. Oh and even though there are a wealth of spikes in most levels, they don't cause instant-death.\n\nAll that said, if you're playing with an Xbox 360 controller, I highly recommend that you change the dead-zone settings.\n\nFor the most part, the level-design in this game is great. Each area is well-paced, and offers a good mixture of puzzles, traps, and monsters to contend with. The tools are all very effective, and it's not too much trouble to switch between mid-level. You can expect to use bombs to destroy walls, daggers to hit far-away switches, and so on. The one trap I don't like is the dark hole. These appear very late in the game, and you're liable to struggle for awhile until you figure it out. It's odd to learn a new mechanic far into the game, especially since it only makes a few appearances. Aside from those annoying holes, I don't have any complaints about the level-design.\n\nUnfortunately, the melee combat isn't particularly good. There are numerous ranged options, including throwing your axe, that help mitigate the problem. Until you get used to how the game operates, you'll clumsily bump into the monsters. Basically, there's not a lot of finesse to fighting. For most of the bosses, you'll learn patterns and figure out strategies. Still, that doesn't mean you won't run into a few bruisers that fall to relentless attack-button mashing. Anothing thing to keep in mind is that your survival rate is liable to go up, if you ignore certain monsters. A key aspect to keep in mind is that there aren't any ambushes. Monsters won't appear out of thin air nor will they respawn, unless they're summoned by others. It might be worth clearing the area of danger, so you can explore at your leisure.\n\nAltogether, Trial by Viking is not only a pretty good game; it also offers a fresh spin on the "Metroidvania" genre. Instead of one large world, there are many small levels, and you have to purchase your upgrades. The controls aren't perfect, but they have their own appeal. Most gamers shouldn't have too much trouble adjusting.\n\nIn short: I'm impressed.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 29","true","12.1"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","29","43","0","1"

It has a unique premise and interesting level designs. There's a LOT of content (over 130 individual levels in 9 worlds) and I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nThe levels I played are certainly challenging but not unfair like other platformers I have played.The controls are not exactly intuitive; there is a chance to change them before you start the game at the "Input" screen but it would be great if there was an in-game option with a screen showing a controller or keyboard and being able to change each key individually. I often ended up using the keyboard to jump and the controller to control the direction but with practice it is achievable. There's no mistake that it is worth the practice, either.Your viking will likely slide around a bit as well.\n\nThe graphics harken back to an era when games like Castlevania Dracula X and Super Metroid were all the rage, for good reason. I cannot speak for the developers intent but I like to imagine he was writing a bit of a love letter to those classics.\n\nBefore you start a level you're able to choose from a variety of main and sub-weapons as well as passive bonus items. You will be able to upgrade these with Sun-stones collected during each level. There are health potions, "mini-viking" potions, invulnerability potions and more, typical fare for a platformer of this type.\n\nThe story is obviously influenced by Norse mythology although very loosely. I say this as someone who owns academic copies of the Heimskringla, The Icelandic Sagas, and the Younger and Elder Eddas, among other books about the subject.The monsters are stalwarts of fantasy games(kobolds, orcs, and wyverns for instance) and there are dragons, kraken, and other legendary boss monsters.\n\nOverall I give this 3.5  axes out of 5.I will definitely be playing this game to the end.\n\nOh also...vikings did not wear horned helmets.","April 22","true","2.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

During the story, you will be able to make some choices that will alter the ending of the game.\nThe story itself is nothing to write home about, it's pretty standard stuff. But I did like that, for once, we got to play around with Norse gods, even though many monsters are not inspired from Norse mythology and they feel kinda generic.\n\nGRAPHICSMade with the Unity engine, the game doesn't look half-bad. The backgrounds and level design are easily the best aspects of the game: there is good variety between each level, and they all feel different. However, the character models look a bit off, like not all of them belong in this game: some are a bit too cartoonish, others are a tad too "realistic". But for the most part it's polished.\n\nGAMEPLAYLet's just say that this game is not for everyone. It is an hardcore platformer: some levels are more focused on fighting, others more on jumping around, and others on finding keys and beating puzzles. The controls are a bit floaty, meaning that you will slide a little bit when moving the viking, but I got used to it. Your main objective is not only to get to the end of each level, but also to find every sunstone (in-game currency) hidden in the level to buy upgrades for your axe, as well as seconday weapons (bombs, knives) and tools that will help you finish some levels.\nThe fighting is very weak, and you will mostly rely on ranged combat since it's very hard to avoid getting hit by enemies. Also, I found the game to lack any type of excitment: playing every level felt more like a chore, and after a while I was getting more and more bored. And while many are comparing this to metroidvania games, I (as a huge fan of Symphony of the Night, Guacamelee and Metroid Fusion) don't think this belongs in that genre at all.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game has a very good difficulty curve, even though it gets very frustrating in the later stages of the game especially in platforming levels due to its controls.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is pretty good and the voice acting (which is kept to a minimum) is pretty good. But the sound effects are very weak, and I am not a fan of the "PUFF" sound when an enemy dies.\n\nREPLAYABILITYOver 100 levels, lots of upgrades, and different choices to make will make you replay this game at least once.\n\nOverall, this is an average platformer that gets more frustrating and less enjoyable as time goes on due to its poor controls and high difficulty. Worth buying to fans of platformers and of Norse mythology; the others should wait for a sale.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 7.5\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 6.5\nFRUSTRATION: 8\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","March 31","true","7.4"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/440800/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================\nTrial by Viking is a two-dimensional platform game with puzzle elements set in the worlds of Viking mythology.\n\nYou play a bearded Viking, referred to mostly as "Me", who looks a lot like a Lord-of-the-Rings-style Dwarf. At the beginning of the game you are shown a brief cut scene in which you hack down a dragon and are visited by Odin, who requires your help in tracking down and defeating Loki. Never shying from such a heroic task, you accept and Odin teleports you off to the first world.\n\nSo begins what looks like a rather long platform game of 13 realms, each with a number of 'constructs' (levels), through which you must progress and reclaim as many pieces of the stolen and shattered Sunstone as you can.\n\nYou wield your large battle axes (of which you have an unlimited supply) with great strength as you leap a little awkwardly around from platform to platform, slaying enemies, flicking switches, drinking potions, teleporting, and performing various other platforming feats, all while collecting Sunstone shards.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The in-game graphics are good, with an appealing and consistent style that is easy on the eye and doesn't detract from your tasks. I do find some breakable objects tend to blend in to the background a little, but that's only a minor inconvenience, quickly overcome once I worked out what they were.\n\nThe common Unity pre-game graphics option and control settings launcher is displayed when you first run the game, with the usual resolution and full screen / windowed options, as well as the typical detail settings from Fastest through to Beautiful and Fantastic. I'm not sure what the settings actually change, however, as the game ran perfectly smoothly on my gaming laptop in full HD and the highest detail.\n\nSound - Music is 'large' and theatrical, building up to crescendos at appropriate times and fading away into the background at others. It's well done, if a little loud in its default configuration, tending to drown out the sound effects. Sound effects are good, doing their job without showing off.\n\nThere is some voice work for the main character, which is actually pretty well done, but it's only used in very few situations. This actually makes it seem a bit out of place; I think it would have been better to be removed completely, or expanded and used everywhere -- or at least in all of the cut scenes.\n\nGameplay - The heart of a platform game, in my opinion, is in the gameplay, and Trial by Viking doesn't let the player down. The many levels all have the same goal: to collect as many Sunstone pieces as possible and make it to the exit. But the platforming skills, combat reflexes, and mild puzzle-solving required in each level add up quickly to make even some of the levels in the first world quite tricky to finish perfectly. The addition of occasional 'boss levels' is appreciated, if somewhat expected, and the bosses themselves add a welcome distraction to the pure platforming levels.\n\nYou control your Viking using WASD with the left hand to control left and right movement, crouching, and zooming the camera out for a better look at the level around you; and the arrow keys with the right hand to control weapon attacks (melee, ranged, and sub-weapon), as well as jumping. It takes a bit to get used to, and even after an hour of play I found myself occasionally missing a jump and falling to my doom due to pressing the wrong key. The Steam page says the game has partial controller support, which may be preferable. Alternatively, remapping the keys to something a bit more intuitive is probably worthwhile.\n\nThe game also has various upgrades available to you for Sunstone shards, and you can also find some new abilities while playing. There are five difficulty levels, but no explanation given as to the differences between them, which seems to be a bit of an oversight.\n\nThere are a couple of little niggles, like two-handed keyboard control being required while playing, but having to use the mouse to advance the story dialogs, and I think that the main character is a little too 'slippery', reminding me a little of Superfrog at speed, which doesn't seem quite appropriate for a bearded Dwarf-like Viking. And the story itself, while mostly well, but fairly simply written, does have some grammatical errors and rather too many ellipses... .\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Interesting setting and story, which is mostly well presented\n+ Appealing graphics and atmospheric music\n+ Achievements and trading cards\n\nCons:\n- The main character has a little too much inertia, and not enough friction, making some platforming more frustrating than it should be\n- Minor inconvenience with the default keyboard controls and mouse being required for story progression\n- Some errors in the writing\n- Voice acting is minimal, standing out at odd times\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Don't take the fact that I've listed more cons than pros above as an indication that this game is bad. The cons are really very minor, with the exception of the frustration due to the character's inertia and slipperiness, coupled with the unintuitive control scheme, which have caused me to replay some levels far more times than I care to remember.\n\nNo, Trial by Viking is a solid platform game that shouldn't disappoint anyone who enjoys the genre. It's well presented and mostly fun, with plenty of content and no bugs to speak of. I'm very happy to recommend it. Just be prepared to take some deep breaths.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","April 6","true","3.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

It starts off relatively easy and then becomes gruesomely difficult over the course of 130 hand-crafted levels. You run around collecting Sunstones which can be used to purchase better stuff - magic axes, a grappling hook, double jump, etc - which you'll need to take down tougher challenges. Levels can be repeated to collect Sunstones or bonuses you may have missed, or just to get a better time (the game is speedrun-friendly). There's a lot of level variety: bosses/minibosses every 5 levels, mobility challenges, puzzles, lots of new mechanics being introduced throughout the game, hidden areas, etc. Impressively, the whole thing was put together by pretty much one guy.\n\nI Kickstarted this a while back and I've logged over 60 hours as I write this; I can easily see myself logging 60 more as I try to beat it again on the highest difficulty setting and chase those last few achievements.","March 29","true","69.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","3"

The game feels balanced, using the gems to customize your equipment adds a great dynamic to the game. I've had to play a level multiple times before I figured out the proper weapons and sub-items to bring. I never feel that the levels are over/under balanced because of the items available.\nPuzzles, the game is full of them, and they more and more challenging as the game progresses. Holding UP on the d-pad to zoom out is the best way to plan out your attack, an extremely valuable tool. I've meticulously completed the first 35 levels with 100% completion, that's just how I play. I'm looking forward to unlocking all the items and seeing how difficult the later puzzles can get!\nCons: Resetting the items takes some patience when re-equipping/buying. It's easy to get button mash happy and accidently jump right into the next level. Also the story, though entertaining, doesn't grip me. I'm more eager to jump into the world and explore. The good news is that you'll get a cut scene about every 5 levels or so, making it predictable and  easy to fast forward if you've already read the dialogue.\n\nOverall I recommend this game, it brings a nostalgia from the SNES games I grew up with and loved.

My attention span for games seems to be around 15-20 hours but this kept me interested the whole time, up through about level 103 out of 130. And I'd still be playing it if it weren't for the dark holes.\n\nThey are not fun. At all. They are like gravity holes that suck you in and spin you around them. They are highly annoying and hard to escape without falling to your death. It was a ton of fun for the first 100 levels but I lost interest after fighting dark holes for 30 minutes.\n\nHonestly, I almost think the game is *too* long. 100 levels and a bit faster upgrades would be better, imo. The upgrades are nice and for the most part keep you motivated, but I fell behind in the "passive" upgrades. I then came to a level that you apparently need one of the passives to get all the gems. I will have to complete 10+ levels and not upgrade anything else before I can go back and finish that one. So...don't do that.\n\nThe levels also get progressively more elaborate and a few of them in the 90's got a bit tedious, but the level design overall is very good.\n\nMovement is defintely not perfect, but it's workable once you get the hang of it. It can be a bit frustrating at times, like when you need to jump through a one-character high hole.\n\nThe boss fights are mostly on the easy side. A couple of them took 4-5 tries but most were 1 or 2 tries.\n\nOverall, it is a very fun game that is worth the price even if you end up wimping out at the dark holes as I have. I will probably go back and finish it at some point but even if I don't it was money well spent.","April 12","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
