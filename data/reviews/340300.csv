The minigames can certainly be considered educational for the younger kids as well.  The adventure game aspect helps you along by always reminding kids what the next quest is via the map function.\nThere is also a parent guide, which helps out if a kid gets stuck.\nMy only two issues (1.5 really) is the game was fairly short, but considering the low price isn't unexpected.\nThe other being a persistent crash on the Linux version, entering the Uncle's garden.  But I'm running an unsupported distribution (so maybe my own fault), and thanks to the cloud save, I just used a save version past that scene on my Linux computer.","May 18, 2015","true","32.3"," 64 of 65 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","64","65","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GFJmember/recommended/340300/","GFJmember","GFJ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GFJmember/","771 products in account","Whilst the backgrounds were beautiful, the gameplay is attrocious.\n\nThe game conists primarily of talking to an NPC which gives you a problem which you have to go back two screens and talk to someone else to solve.\n\nFor example, at one point a shepherd asks you for a painting. Your uncle who is a painter is two screens back, however when you go back you find a goat has blocked the bridge and won't let you past. The shepherd tells you that you can get a cable car a bit further on which will bring you back to town, basically going around the goat. En route you run into a marmot who asks you to help tidy up the rubbish in the area, which results in a minigame. Then you get to the cable car, but it isn't running because an eagle is on the line and won't fly off. The eagle is one screen back and another down a side route (which you cannot access before talking to the cable car operator) and he tells you he can't move because he lost his glasses...which you tidied up before. So you have to go back a few screens talk to the maramot to get the glasses to give to the eagle so you can finally ride the cablecar down and get a picture...\n\nA better game in the genre would have had your uncle give you the painting for helping him, and the maramot give you the glasses for helping her.\n\nFurthermore, despite being a kids game, they use words that I don't know the meaning to. And I'm 24. Your uncle uses the term "plein air" assuming that Teddy Floppy Ear should know what it is. When questioned he describes it as an outside atelier, another word that Teddy Floppy Ear or a young child is unlikely to know, unless they are super obsessed with artists. Further on in the game you have to collect carabiners. Whilst there is a picture of them, so the task is completable for those who don't know, an explanation as to what they are isn't given until after the task is completed...\n\nOn that note, the guy who asks you to get them could reward you with the string needed a bit later on in the game before you need it.","October 28, 2015","false","1.5"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

It's about a growing bear who's parents both die in a viscious car wreck, and Teddy Floppy Ear is faced with a growing issue of mortality. So after their funerals, he goes off on a mountain adventure he promised his parents he would take before they died but sadly couldn't. So with that in mind, he decided to do it in their honor, hoping its what they would had wanted to do. The whole game is a real downer, especially when it starts to heavily revolve around Teddy's confrontation with mortalilty, and living an unhappy life that he wishes he could escape. Other than that I really enjoyed the visceral landscapes, deep story, amazing graphical quality, and the rich lore that surrounds the game. Not to spoil anything but the ending is a nice close to the game, and really opens it up for a sequal (that I hope they make soon) of which could further the story of Teddy's ongoing struggles of discovering himself through his passion of outdoor exploration. I hope you can find the time to pick up this game of the year contender, because it's been a real sleeper hit for quite a long time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Erika_/recommended/340300/","Erika_","Ｅｒｉｋａ {Ｃ²}","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Erika_/","94 products in account","Teddy, Teddy, Teddy..\nIf this game was named Teddy Fappy Ear, it would be much more interesting!\n\nThe Story:\nYou're a Teddy bear and you arrive to mountain village. First of all, you realize that your uncle is a DOG! Instead of that a poor homeless bear, who has to beg the bees for a bit of honey in the canine's garden! What has your grandma been doing in her marriage, that's an unsolved mystery! The story is poor, tbh.\n\nSpoiler:\nOnce you find the uncle dog at the railway station, he tells you to join him in his cabin and leaves you alone. I call this totally irresponsible. But, what could I expect from a dog, right? I just wanted to be sure, the place is safe, also I talked to the train dispatcher, but he didn't even knew the train schedule.. Just great..\nA bloodthirsty wolf, disguised as a cute goat granny, offering me a cookie at the next corner - something was telling me these mountains are dangerous.\nAnd I wasn't wrong. I quickly ran to uncle's cabin and that a**hole left me alone again, right after he told me that he was going to paint nearby the lake. Before the selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ left the cabin, he ordered me to bring with me a camera, which was in the dark basement. And of course he lost a key to the basement! So I had to talk to a bee, go back to the train station, my feet were already hurting me and then the stupid magpie told me she has the key in her nest.. I had to head back to the cabin. I was cursing the dog for not having at least bike or something I could use for a fast transportation. Magpie gave me the key, then I was solving homeless bear's food crisis..  And so it went further. Once I solved someone else's problem, another problem popped up. I cannot ignore them, because otherwise they didn't let me pass to the next area. Soon, I wasn't sure, why I either arrived to the mountain village, what was the adventure supposed to be and where is the irresponsible uncle. Once I found him, he ordered me again to take a pictures of five flowers and five animals across the mountain. I had to deal with dangerous eagle, visit a cave with sleeping knights and I was alone the whole time.\nNo matter I took a sandwich and an apple before I left the cabin - I didn't even had time to stop for eating my snack!\nWhen I finally took all the pictures, I felt I literally wanted to kill the dog. He just left back to the cabin without letting me know and I was looking for him by the lake. Another few miles in my legs. I finally reached the cabin, gave the pictures to the dog and he painted the animals and flowers into the picture.\nThe dog totally broke my heart, because I realized, he just used me; I found his damn key for the basement, brought him a camera, took pictures for him, brought them back to the cabin and once he finished the painting - he didn't even offered it to me as a souvenir. Instead of that, he gave me a photoalbum, which was supposed to be mine anyways, because I took the pictures, right? And then, I had to head back for the train. I salted my sandwich with tears in the train later.\n\nThe Graphics\nKinda cute. I've seen better and worse as well.\n\nThe Controling\nSad. It's just point & click. But how to make the game longer? You have to click click click to reach an arrow for a next map. I don't like this.\n\nOther features\nOnce you finish the story, you are able to play the mini games.\n\nOkay...\nPros:\nMinigames\nKinda cute Graphics\n\nCons\nHOW THE **** IS POSSIBLE, THAT A BEAR, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE AT AGE 6 - 12 IS NARRATED BY SOMEONE, WHOSE VOICE SOUNDS LIKE 50 YEARS OLD?!!!! IRRITATING! And the dog's voice sounds much younger. *facepalm*\nControlling.\nStory poor\n\nI still recommend, cuz of the mini games.\n\nWorths like for € 0,20 - € 1,00 but I wouldn't pay more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/habbuh/recommended/340300/","habbuh","Rörmokar Hannes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/habbuh/","62 products in account","An incredible adventure in the mountains!\nThis game is a part of the world-famous and highly ambitious and beloved series Teddy Floppy Ear. It was made by the AAA game studio Forever Entertainment, which is located in Poland, one of the greatest countries for games in general.\n\nGraphics 10/10\nThe game looks and feels great. It supports all kinds of system and graphics card configurations. It can run at an incredible framerate of 144 frames per second! The game is beautiful, and it's artstyle is very nice. It has a very lovely and calming atmosphere to it. It also features some of the latest and greatest advancements in graphics technology, such as fullscreen mode.\n\nGameplay 10/10\nThe gameplay in this game is very enjoyable and well-crafted. It is both calming, relaxing and fun to play through this game, and it will both challenge and reward the play with clever puzzles and mysteries. It is an open-world point-and-click adventure, and the world is also very unique and well made. The player will need to explore and think to make it through. The game is reasonably lengthy, and it can both be played casually or all in one sitting.\n\nStory 9/10\nThis game follows the story of young Teddy Floppy Ear, who is going on a trip to the mountains to visit his uncle. Teddy Floppy Ear will meet several unique and lovely characters, who all are very unique and have something interesting to say. The story is family friendly, altough some parts might be a bit too violent for children. Teddy Floppy Ear is not very intelligent, so you will have to help him, and he will solve several mysteries and problems while on his adventure. The only complaint i have about the story is the fact that the most interesting and funny character, the bear, does not appear alot in the game.\n\nControls 10/10\nThe game controls smoothly and logically. It features mouse controls, and the cursor will change when you hold over a relevant object, so that you can know when something is interactable. There is also a button in the top-left corner, which makes Teddy talk for a few seconds while you can't do anything at all, which is great.\n\nSystem Requirements 7/10\nThe game is very well optimized, but it will still require a heafty graphics card to run smoothly. This is mainly because of the intense graphical effects and the realistic fur rendering on the bear i mentioned earlier. It is possibly one of the best looking titles released in recent years, and i personally believe it will be a hallmark for what humans can accomplish. The game still works well on alot of different system configurations, and it supports both Windows, OSX, and Linux. Linux is incredible, and you won't even need a good graphics card if you run it on Ubuntu or something similar. I run Ubuntu, so i found this to be great, and i really respect the developers for it.\n\nOverall 9/10\nI found this game to be a great title, and well worth the very low and almost unjustified price of only 4.99€. It features an amazing story, fun and relaxing gameplay and beautiful graphics. It encouraged me to buy the other games, which are a continuation of the story of Teddy Floppy Ear, and i highly recommend getting all 3 games.","December 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

It suits the game well.\n\nSound: Good music and voice actors did a good job. (The Sheeps are funny, but can get a little bit annoying after a while, especially in their minigame.)\n\nControls: You can completely play it with the mouse and only the left button. It's uncomplicated. They could have made use of the second mouse button sometimes and improve some minigames. In the puzzle-minigame you often turn a piece, when you just want to move it around. In the minigame where you have to catch notes, you have to grab the pot everytime to move it, instead of just having it locked on the mouse.\n\nGameplay: Some different minigames, which can selected from the main menu screen, after you've played through the game. You can talk to all of the characters in the game which guide you through your quest. If you get stuck, then you still have a map where your next location is shown. You have to walk a lot sometimes, just to hear a short dialogue. This is quite a downside, since the game is very short.

Still, I didn't like it, but that requires some explanation. The game is essentially pedagogic in its approach, which means it is designed from the perspective of an adult who "knows what's good for you" and tries to make you exercise your intellectual skills and teach you basics about art. Because of this perspective, it misses a lot of chances at being fun:\nThe English voiceover for Teddy sounds like his grandpa, and the original polish voiceover isn't much better. Everthing is voiced by adults.\nYour uncle seems to make up errands to get you out from underfoot, and sends you off into the woods with no compunction.\nSome wild animals don't shy away while some do; in RL, be extra careful, as they'd be likely to have rabies.\nAn eagle with glasses.\nThe game could be open-world, go anyplace, but instead it removes exits that it doesn't want you to take right now.\nBecause of the foregoing, you do have a game map that you can consult, but fast-travel is not possible.\nThe game teaches you how to mix colors, but when it has you paint your own picture, you can't.\nThe game states that "everything can be drawn using simple shapes", but everything drawn that way in the game looks weird and unnatural, subverting the point.\nYou have a camera, but you can only use it when the game tells you to, and you can't look at your own pictures.\nYou give your own picture away right after painting it, and you won't get it back. (You can still see it via the "minigames" menu, but best take a screenshot then; I don't think you can save it.)\nThe photoalbum you get as a reward afterwards is also only available as a minigame, you can't go back to the world and explore afterwards.\nAlmost nothing in this beautiful scenery is animated, it's basically "dead".\nYes, this game's decent, but there are better games for kids (and adults), e.g. Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise. These games are much more fun while still engaging the players/kids intelectually. So I do recommend that you get a better game instead.","July 22, 2015","false","2.8"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","39","13","33","6","0"

Played all the way through and only needed grownup help twice. Has educational components of logic and problem solving and a little bit of art and puzzle problems, too. The graphics are cute and age appropriate, and the adventure is delightful.  I can't imagine anyone getting stuck, but there is a manual/walk through on the parents section.  Not as much replay value for us, but some may enjoy the minigames that can be done again.","January 15","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He arrives at a quiet mountain town, gets abandoned by his uncle a few times, and proceeds to go on a charming mountain adventure taking pictures of flora and fauna whilst simultaneously being a slave for everyone around town. Seriously, Teddy Floppy Ear's instinctual reaction upon meeting someone is to tirelessly labor for them with little reward. Frodo's burden has nothing on this guy, the game might as well be called Teddy Floppy Ear - Mount Doom Adventure. Absoloutely tragic.\n\nPros:\n-Hang out with your uncle (until he abandons you again)\n-Meet a sexy bird who's a compulsive thief\n-Draw a pretty picture of Hiroshima\n-Realistic sheep sounds\n\nCons:\n-Lack of sexy bird sexy scene\n\nConclusion:\nGet this game right now.","April 2","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
