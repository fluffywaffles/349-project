"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/recommended/461840/","dragoonsz","± Roger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/","4396 products in account","Product received for free\n\nZenge\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing.\n\nZenge is a puzzle game. Almost literally a puzzle game. It reminds me of a physical jigsaw puzzle, but the thought process to actually playing the game reminds me more of a game of chess, or solving a rubik's cube. Every stage/level of the game, you're tasked with sliding pieces of the puzzle into the correct place. The challenge in this is that moving a piece to a certain spot might block the path for another piece to slide through. As you continue to play, the stages become more complex and a lot more thinking is required in order to figure out which piece to move, and when to move it. After you complete each puzzle, a picture of the completed puzzle is presented.\n\n--------\n\nGraphics: 7 / 10\n\nThe game graphics itself has a nice sort-of minimalistic design but the initial graphics are used to help you keep track of the puzzle pieces and show you where they go. They do their job and I would give that a 6 / 10 if it weren't for the wonderful artwork you receive when you complete the puzzle. The completed images are really nice and calming to look at. These alone, I would give an 8 / 10, so I averaged it out to a 7 / 10.  The game should have no problem running on most graphic cards and CPUs. The artwork also depicts the underling story of the game.\n--------\n\nSound: 7 / 10\n\nThe wonderful art is also accompanied by a very nice, soothing soundtrack. It's calming and something you would listen to when you want to relax. The sound assets are also fine, they don't get repetitive, and you hardly notice them over the soundtrack, but they get the job done.\n\n--------\n\nMechanics: 7 / 10\n\nThe mechanics of the game are solid. It's a straight forward puzzle game, and you understand how the game will continue to play out within the first few stages. As the game progresses, more mechanics are introduced and ways to interact with the puzzle pieces. You can flip, rotate and teleport pieces to different locations and give yourself more options to complete the image.\n\n--------\n\nFinal Personal Remarks:\n\nZenge is a nice little title to play when you want to take it easy, enjoy some calming music and artwork. Although it's not a game I would play regularly as I'm terrible at puzzles, I can see how some people would enjoy this, or even use this to take a load off after a day at work. The story of the game is also very interesting, and told in a unique way via the beautiful artwork.\n\nThanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.","May 20","true","7.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Enter Zenge, just what the doctor ordered for such a thing.\n\nZenge is a puzzle game where you slide various shapes along tracks and assemble them to form a picture. Initially they must simply be slid along and put into place in the right order so they can freely move along the tracks without colliding into one another. But as stages progress (70 in total), new features are added, like junctions along the tracks where pieces can be flipped, rotated, teleported or even embiggened or ensmallened to add some spice to the challenge. It's all fiendishly clever and really gets the grey matter firing in a very satisfying way that rarely ever frustrates.\n\nThe game is incredibly beautiful, too. From the simple yet striking art design, to the gentle, lulling music, everything seems made with the intention of relaxing the player while they try to unravel the conundrums. There is a story told through still images, each one revealed as reward when you assemble the pieces that make each puzzle, but I'll be honest with you, I don't know what the hell it was about. Something about some Ludo pieces finding artefacts related to the game then playing with each other or something, but it pretty much lost me by the end. Though, that said, even if I didn't get it, I still loved the artwork all the same and am happy enough with that.\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles felt maybe a little inconsistent on occasion? I had a few moments where progress slowed a little toward the back half, but then I was breezing through the later stages.  But that may simply be human nature and not everyone will find the same parts as easy or hard as others may. I imagine most will finish the game in around 90 minutes or so, and there isn't any real replay value, but at such a low cost I really can't see many complaining by the time they finish. I know I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nSo, for hardcore puzzle lovers and casual enthusiasts alike, this gets a resounding thumb being jammed onto a fist, rotated into an upright position, then slid upwards from me. Two of them, in fact.","May 7","true","4.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

After solving each puzzles(a variant of sliding puzzle) in the game you're shown an image. Story is told through these gorgeous art images and an excellent soundtrack to set the otherworldly theme of the story. The difficulty pacing is just at the right frequency i.e starting from easy difficulty to then challenging but yet relaxing as always. Since only images are used to convey the story to the player, the game lets our imagination to leap inside the story.

I went in expecting a puzzle game similar to Hook, and to be honest that's not far off of what I got - an exceedingly polished, aesthetically pleasing, no-pressure puzzle game.\n\nIt took me 70 minutes to beat - which when combined with the price paid, well exceeds the standard "£1 to 1 hour" rule that so many people seem to hold in such high regard - which personally I don't, if I enjoyed the experience then it was probably worth the price. Of course, it's a puzzle game, so YMMV - I could imagine people beating this in a solid half hour, or even taking several hours to never beat it.\n\nWhile it's not an excessively or inherently difficult puzzle game, it does require some decent spacial analysis - although some people will be pleased to hear that it seems to be impossible to 'trap' yourself and be forced to restart a board. I didn't manage to do that in any of the levels, although I did restart a few purely because I need to work something out from the beginning - that's just how my mind works when solving problems.\n\nIf you're looking for a chill experience, with some wonderful art and music, with a little bit of story thrown in - I'd say go ahead and drop the sub-£1 fare for entry here and just have an hour of no worries or distractions, just solid puzzle solving fun.","April 16","true","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I know that moves arent counted for relaxation reasons but I am used to move stuff right along and not being stopped all the time.\n\nbut this little point doesnt stop the game from being a seriously epic piece of ART, especially considering the really short list of credits.\n\nI really hope there'll be another Zenge or an expansion or WHATEVER someday, because this has made the last 2 evenings the best that I had over all of 2016 up to now.","April 27","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The puzzles varied from simple ones to more elaborate solutions with some interesting mechanics that were expanding as you progress resulting in some very entertaining and creative puzzles. Experienced players who love puzzles must be aware though that this game is , like the description says: "A realxing puzzle game" so for some, the puzzles might feel a bit too easy. However, especially for the price, the game offers a wonderful little distraction which rewards your puzzle solving with some great artwork (telling an abstract intriguing story) and a great atmospheric soundtrack.

In order to do this, you'll have to move other pieces out of the way, makes the piece smaller, rotate the pieces, or teleport them. After you finish a level, you are given a beautifully designed illustration (for lack of a better word) that makes up the plot of the game, which, according to the developer's website, "[tells] the story of Eon - a lonely journeyman who's stuck between the worlds and time."\n\nIt took me 7.5 hours to beat the game, which is think is a good length for this game, The game itself is free of any point system, which does genuinely fit in with the developer's intent of the game being a relaxing experience. While I wouldn't go out and purchase the soundtrack, it is very nice to listen to,\n\nIf I do have to find some criticisms with the game, I'd say that to turn the sound on or off, you have to go to the level select and it would be nice if the options were also available in the levels. Another problem I have is this game being rated EC, as this indicates that the game is intented for a very young audience. I also feel that this game may not have any kind of replay value if you already know how to solve all the levels.\n\nFor an asking price of just $0.99, this is definitely worth checking out.

I was hardly ever actually stumped. Rarely did I notice having made actual mistakes.

The mechanics are introduced well and the difficulty ramp is smoot. Also, the puzzles seem to be designed in a way that you can easily work your way to the solution step by step. I've also played a lot of puzzle games, so you may find these puzzles more challenging than I did.\n\nBut I was just left wanting just a bit more challenge.","April 16","false","3.3"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","20","40","3","5"

In a similar vein to Journey there is no “win” or “lose”, just advance or not. The puzzles are thought-provoking, and do not overly drag on. You learn a concept, you move on.\n\nThe story though. I don't know. It's meaningless and meaningful all at the same time, because it's told through very simple, yet beautiful artwork, where the player is left to connect and assemble the pieces, which is hilariously exactly what the game itself it.
