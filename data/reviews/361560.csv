"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/361560/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\nA poor port of a game that's missing one of the basic mechanics you need in a shoot em up: fun. While having an interesting premise and some cool character designs all around, the game fails to deliver as levels are way too easy at times and literally lack any sort of oompf to them whatsoever. The game's graphics could use improvement overall, but the bigger problem comes when character designs clash against the background in terms of being able to see enemies and or bullets against it. Honestly, I can go on here about what the game did wrong, and what the game needs, but in the end: it isn't fun, and that's a major problem for a game that's attempting to get your attention, in particular in this genre. It lacks the energy and the execution needed to really stand out.\n\nGameplay and Video First Impressions:  http://youtu.be/KnxvsW6Ky10\n\nLists:\n+:\nSome good character designs, in particular with boss monsters, and using the material of ice cream/veggies well.\nCute premise and could work well with kids. Audio of characters are fine and reasonably well done. Was unexpected\nDifferent characters play differently with a reasonable change up in what they do.-:\nLacks a fun factor. Boring, repetitive, and down right just meh.\nThe game's inconsistencies within its world and gameplay will show up right away, whether it be attempting to pick up a powerup only to find you have to shoot it first, or what you are fighting. A very uneven experience.\nMinimal effort to port. Coop players score elements show up here, controls for controller don't bind themselves naturally to industry standards, and frankly transitions to other parts of the game are down right awkward.\nThe environment clashes with gameplay at times which is a huge problem. Don't put the same shades of white in the background and on enemies that you are expecting people to see without any issue.\nSpecials lack oompf in several cases, and feel like a waste. In one or two instances, I died when an uncontrollable special happened (which seems like a prime reason not to use it.).\n1 Achievement that literally was given when starting the game. If you're not going to use them, don't bother with them, you don't have to have them on Steam.\nWeird inconsistency in player models from character to character without anything to counterbalance it.\nCrackers in bikinis are just weird. I may be a horrible person for thinking this, but it stand out against the kiddish nature of everything else.","June 22, 2015","false","1.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","3"

Unfortunately there are some resolution issues on PC. It flips everytime into fullscreen here, even if windowed mode is bewished. The controls are totally unknown in the first moment (m for menu? seriously?) . So is the button how to exit the game. The graphics and music are nice but you can hardly distinguish enemy bullets from power pickups. So I played the first level for the achievement.

Well, I am glad I did, because I didn't really like it. Let me explain you why.\n\nAt the beginning, there was this game called GRADIUS by Konami. Konami thought "Let's make a parody of it!" and made created one of the best gaming series ever: PARODIUS!\n\nMemories! I remember playing that game on the SNES and on the very first Playstation console.\n\nYes, THIS game is similar to Parodius.\n\nOh, I wish there was an original Parodius port on Steam available!\n\nUnfortunately, there is none. And this game failed me...and I will tell you a few lines later why.\n\nRemember the humour the Parodius series had to offer? Well, I do.\n\nVegetables, natural food, goofy bosses and angry animals are trying to kill you this time and you have to dodge them and/or their bullets, hearts or whatever they are shooting at you.\n\nI must say the creators did a good job with the character and level designs. Everything is colorful and humorous. Now you might think "wait a minute, seems you like it! Why the thumbs down then?"\n\nK, here is the answer: The controls are the reason!\n\nI started the game after a couple of issues (I will explain that a few lines later), and pushed the down-key after the 1st level started. I don't know if you know this Arcade game called Tapper's, where you move up and down and switch to fixed positions. It felt like my character in this game moved down and stopped at certain position where I thought there are some kind of "lanes" and you move your character up and down to swtich between these.\n\nNo, the thing was, there weren't any fixed positions, you can move your character by keeping the direction keys pushed.\n\nGuess what: You can't tell if your character will stop moving after you release the direction key. It might still be moving a little bit more, or stop immediately.\n\nWell, imagine you release the direction key and your character keeps moving to the same direction before it finally stopss...at the wrong position where it catches an enemy bullet! This happened to me.\n\nAnd then, there is this thing with the control settings in the main menu.\n\nRight after I started the game, I didn't know which key I had to push to enter the selected menu.\n\nRushing over all key on my keyboard, I made it to the keyboard settings menu.\n\nIt didn't show you any list of the keys, but instead it asked me to choose which key shall be used for what (left, right, up, down, attack, super-attack, pause). First it asked me "", then "Press a key for right", etc...\n\nOh, that "" I just mentioned is true, the words "Press a key for up" are missing, so I saw no text instead.\n\nRight, did I forget to mention anything? I guess not. If they can fix the controls, it'd be great. But with these broken controls, it's not fun.","June 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Not even worth 50p.\nCan`t recognise two standard Xbox controllers. With one plugged in you still have to use the keyboard to get back to the menu. On the game over screen I don`t even know what key I pressed to get back to the menu as ESC doesn`t do anything and neither does the Start button on the controller.\nOnce on the menu screen I couldn`t even exit the game. Had to CTRL-ALT-DEL and End Task. If there is a way to exit then it`s not very obvious.\nOnly bought this because the kids wanted it after seeing the trailer. Never even got to play the game properly as the controller and menu bugs put me off before we even started.\nJust wanted a simple two player shooter for my boys to play together using controllers but it seems that`s too much to ask on Ice Cream Surfer.\n\nDidn`t expect much for a couple of quid, but expected a slightly more polished menu and controller system.\nYet another piece of software released before being finished.\nI look forward to the first update, maybe I can rate the gameplay then.","June 22, 2015","false","0.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","1"

Unfortunately, while the developers behind Ice Cream Surfer appear to have had their hearts in the right place, their execution simply does not do justice to Twinbee, Parodius, and the other more illustrious goofball shooters to come before it.\n\nAfter picking one of five characters to blast off with (be advised that some are much less effective than others), you traverse a handful of side-scrolling worlds, shooting down various cute and/or ridiculous baddies and collecting the shiny gems, power-up popsicles, option helpers, and bonus letters they leave behind, expending a bomb when you need a trump card. This, sadly, is often, since your player sprites (and hitboxes) are so large that maneuvering through gaps is very difficult, and enemy shots are very small and difficult to see. This is especially a shame since the candy-colored visuals are not bad to look at, and it would be nice to have the opportunity to admire the scenery a bit without worrying that a pinprick-sized bullet will steal a life away from you in the meantime. Even discounting that, there's no auto-fire either, which means you have to mash the shot key to keep a steady stream of attacks coming; this would be merely irritating if the fire rate was decent (or if a charge shot was available), but no matter how quickly you tap there's a strict limit to how potent your offense can get, especially when at your default pea-shooter power level...and the fact that you lose everything when you die means that you'll be dealing with that frequently.\n\nOut on the periphery there are numerous additional unfixed issues that are unlikely to ever be addressed: the screen options don't work, controller support is sometimes sketchy, the post-stage roundup screen scrolls by too fast to read, and so forth. I hate to do it, but I must insist, even if you're hungering for a throwback to the good old days when you'd beat up a bunch of ninjas to earn a burger invite from Ronald Reagan and nobody batted an eye, don't let this game lure you in: your fond memories of those times will only end up melting away into an unsightly puddle, like a forgotten bowl of vanilla fudge swirl on a summer evening.","October 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

While the game is set up to allow two players doing local co-op, we couldn't get that to work properly using keyboard controls. The actual stages can be played using keyboard or an Xbox controller.\n\nIf local co-op worked, I would recommend it for some nice cheap 2-player fun.
