At first glance, the game may look light and simple but very quickly you begin to see that this is a deep, well-designed strategy/god-mode game. The graphics are very detailed, the artwork is beautiful, the mechanics are flawless. If you think that because its a god-mode strategy game that it will be boring, then guess again. There is plenty of action/activities to keep you busy without having to micro-manage your units and economy.  Research will increase the options and powers available during gameplay while continuing to upgrade and expand your alien colony. For any strategy gaming fan, I strongly recommend picking this game up. Most games are only moderately worth their sale prices, especially indie games. But this game is well worth the full price.\n\nThe big name gaming developers should take a few lessons from the Squatting Penguins Studio. This is how a game is supposed to be released. Out-of-the-box, ready to play. 100+ hours of gameplay and I have yet to experience a single bug. No glitches in gameplay, no graphics hiccups or units falling through maps, no game crashes. The game runs smooth and seamlessly like any released game should. Even more amazing is that this is still an early-access game so bugs and glitches are normally accepted and typically expected. A lot of care and effort went into this release and true gamers will notice and appreciate it right away.\n\nWithout going into a lengthy game description, The Mims Beginning will have the typical RTS simulation components, but with its own distinct approach. Expect a well-balanced economic system, a rich story to tie the campaign missions together nicely, an assortment of interesting buildings and units to build as you establish your camps, and a variety of research.\n\nThe one area that is lacking when compared to most games of this genre is the variety of units. In this game, you have only a couple of types to choose from. The basic, or generic Mim performs assorted tasks as you assign them rather than being specialized. Perhaps in the future more unit types will be added, but the game functions just fine with the current unit structure. The developer has stated that more features and game modes will be added as development progresses. As for the game's mechanics and features, here are some things that you should know:\n\nThe Good:\n========+  Graphics are top-notch and run flawlessly even on the highest settings. Great detail and color\n+  Absence of bugs/crashes (Makes a game much more enjoyable)\n+  Gameplay is rich and deep with a clever resource economy and challenging goals\n+  Learning curve is acceptable for beginners and an in-depth tutorial campaign is included\n+  Camera controls are included and easy to use while navigating the maps\n+  Although this is a God-mode game, autonomy option is able to be turned off when desired\n+  Simple game controls / Window mode available if desired\n+ Well-developed story for the campaign mode\n\nThe Bad:\n=======-  No save feature included in current release\n-  Limited options for adjusting graphics in the event your system has trouble running the game\n-  Window mode is restricted to specifically selected screen resolutions only.\n-  Currently not a lot of replay value (likely to change in the final version with Survival Mode)\n- The AI for units is sometimes frustrating as they seem to wander aimlessly about rather than perform their assigned tasks (possibly by design?)\n\nFinal thoughts:\n===========Keep in mind that at the time of this review, the game is still in Early Access beta and will likely improve and include more features. Considering that, this game is very impressive. At first glance it looks like its going to be some simple cartoon-ish indie that will fill an hour or two of free time. But nothing could be further from the truth. Hours of challenging and entertaining gameplay awaits and a good bit of light humor is mixed into the storyline as well. Rarely do I enjoy an early access game this much. I anxiously await the final release.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 10","true","126.9"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","46","53","0","8"

Getting taught the basics of colony management you are then left on your own to proceed through the story, which not only is amusing but somewhat believable, mostly because of the wonderful art direction and accompaning soundtrack. Intro gameplay involves getting your power stations running, researching new plants and species for exporting to markets on alternate planets, giving your Mims a place for some well deserved R&R, all while trying to deter or kill any invasive 'pests' that may land on your rock in the sky.\n\nWhile I've only played through the earlier stages, for an early access product so far it's more polished then most games at final release. This team are obviously fans of the genre as everything about it screams a labour of love. Highly recommend checking it out, fantastic game which is only getting better.

I won't reveal too much about the story but basically you are a god of some-sort going from island to island, creating living conditions, protection and technology for the lost Mims. You, as the god, have various powers and abilities to aid the Mims as well. Like most real time strategy god games, The Mims Beginning has other elements implemented into game like structure/city building, unit and resource management, as well as upgrading buildings and units. There are two game modes, the campaign and survival.\n\nThere are a few things I'd like to point out before I quickly break down the game into separate sections. Although the game is in early access, I encountered no bugs or glitches which is impressive. This is one of the only god games I've played that let you select individual units to perform tasks as well as letting them be autonomous, which I like, but other people might not agree with that. Lastly, with the easy progression and lightheartedness of the game itself, it's a good game for beginners who want to try to get into this genre of game or games similar to this one.\n\n--------\n\nGraphics: 7 / 10\n\nThe art-style is subjective, but I enjoyed it. It has a playful, colorful, fun vibe to the game. It wasn't too hard on my PC, and I'm running a mid-tier Nvidia Card and CPU. I do feel the animation quality could be a little better and smoother though, but it is in early access and I know everything has not been fleshed out yet. Although after staring at the game for awhile, it does start to get a tad monotonous, though that is to be expected with such games.\n\n--------\n\nSound: 6 / 10\n\nThe sound assets are fine, there isn't much that's extraordinary or below standards. I will say that I didn't get tired of the noises or background music, so that's good. However, there was this one theme in a cut scene, in between the campaign scenarios that I really liked, it was this gospel-ish tone and it was really soothing.  There isn't any voice acting in the game from what I can tell.\n\n--------\n\nMechanics: 6 / 10\n\nThe mechanics were solid, but there wasn't much that really set it apart from other god games or made it more enjoyable that others. That being said, like stated earlier, the mechanics are perfect for someone who would want to give this genre a try and then try other god-games. Aside from structure placement, there isn't that much customization in the game, the only terraforming in the game is burning down trees. There are however quite a few animal and plant types to mess around with, as well as cool abilities your Mims get as well as yourself as the god.\n\n\n--------\n\nFinal Personal Remarks\n\nThe game is good for beginners in this genre, it's not the best god game ever created, but it's not terrible. It's impressive that it was done by two devs. The game is competent and does what it set out to do. This type of game didn't keep me hooked as it's not the kind of game I'm used to playing or have too much experience with, but I can see how some people would enjoy it. One thing I will say about this game, despite all that, is that I liked the narrative and although I've only played for 10 hours, I'm interested in the story, and would like to know more about the Mims, their homeworld, their experiences. The game did a great job of keeping me hooked into the story.\n\nThanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.","May 16","true","15.6"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","49","68","2","0"

Probably pretty routine and slightly boring if you think about it. Then again, you’ve never lorded over a tiny alien sharecropper farm on a small slab of asteroid. Owned by a crew of crash-landed aliens called the Mims, you will soon be call to aid them in defending it from every other form of life out there. Once you’ve established your ramshackle farm, you begin to branch out. First a few more workers, maybe an upgrade to the city hall. Oh, you need to have a trading port! The game is cutesy, but much deeper than the child-friendly design would lead you to believe. Eventually an alien metropolis spreads out as far as the eye can see. Farm animals swarm the gardens, devouring anything they can in order to grow strong and be sold to what I assume is a cutesy alien slaughterhouse. The tiny Mim workers, and the tough Mim guardians, all working in harmony within the little slice of heaven that I’ve so benevolently created for them. Maybe you see a worker or two slacking off? You’d be perfectly within your rights to burn them with a fire spell. How else will they ever learn right from wrong? It feels good to be a God that’s so involved! Whether you are a benevolent ruler, or a vengeful one, The Mims Beginning is a real pleasure to play.\n\nFirst off, I’d like to state that I’m quite impressed by the graphics that indie studios can put out these days. This game has been in development for 3 years, and while the age shows slightly, it is far above the average indie game. The buildings are strangely designed and outlandish, just like the little orange minions operating them. The multitude of pests and predators that will eventually make an appearance pulls it all together and makes for a nice comfy experience that is pleasing to the eye. I feel a lot more could’ve been done with the sound. The soundtrack is passable, mostly because I’m largely distracted by the beauty of my adorable alien empire. Don’t let appearances fool you though. This game doesn’t hesitate to teach you through pain. After building a village for thirty minutes, it is pillaged by spiders. How did this happen? Glad I asked. The gameplay mechanics at work here are intricate. To build almost anything, you need either Gems, Biomass, or both. Farming Biomass involves creating a garden, the fruits of which can be thrown into an Extractor. The resulting Biomass currency can be used for a multitude of things, but you will always be in need of more. So you plant even more fruit trees. Eventually the pests show up because fruit has been sitting under a hot alien sun, and pursuing the pests are predators which won’t hesitate to devastate your town. Predators can clear a lot of pests, if you have an infestation don’t hesitate to let them do some dirty work. They can also clear a lot of Mims, so keep a watchful eye and have a haste or heal spell handy.\n\nThe other form of currency is received by selling farm animals at market. This requires a spaceport and a bio lab, and if they aren’t built with your first handful of Gems it’s basically a game-over. I feel this requires reevaluation but tweaks and balance changes have been promised so I won’t judge that too harshly. Aside from all this farming business, sending minions to work or combat, controlling the electrical grid, and averting natural disasters with your ability to predict the future… A truly good God will find time to better his underlings, teaching them skills. He will bring new Mims to replace the ones that have fallen in combat or a misplaced PSI spell… Even if I did sort of do it on purpose. I’m sure even immortal beings are permitted a small giggle of laughter when watching an adorable alien scream as he plummets into nothingness. The Mims have some silly one-liners during cut-scenes that let me know this game has a good humor about itself. It also covers two genres that are sorely lacking, RTS and God-likes. I count The Mims Beginning as a cool breath of fresh air for lovers of both genres, as long as they aren’t afraid to enjoy some downright silliness.\n\nOn the negative side; the music seems quite generic, which simply shouldn’t be the case on an alien world. Survival mode is not yet implemented, and story-mode levels take a long time to beat. About or more than thirty minutes for each one, so not the type of game you can pick and and play if you only have 10 minutes (though this is likely to change with survival mode). The Mims have their own personalities, but as far as I can tell each one looks almost identical. Making them more individualized would add a great deal to the experience for me. Finally, the camera controls threw me off as well. Q and E are used to zoom in/out, while panning can only be done by mousing to the edge of the screen. Despite its few flaws, I found The Mims Beginning to be an extremely intriguing game that never failed to capture that “one-more-turn” feeling when close to unlocking the next structure or upgrade. Wonderful game, and a big thank you to the folks at Squatting Penguin. I hope that The Mims Beginning is just the start for you guys.\n\nSummary: Alien city-building RTS with adorable graphics and deep strategy.\nFinal Score: 8/10 for aesthetic, replayability, and innovation.\n\nFull text/photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-mims-beginning-early-access/\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsJf7exqciY","January 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","29","38","5","0"

There currently are not too many of those available on Steam which is really a shame. You play the role of the first powerful looking being the Mims have seen since they crashed. This causes them to assume you are their new God. Use your PSI powers and colony building prowess to aid the fledgling colony build up the resources needed to continue their trek to recover the fragments of their crashed ship.\n\nGameplay Impressions\nThe Mims are a rather cute looking alien race that sort of have the appearance of gloved hands. The way they speak and act further emphasizes the fact they are a charmingly sweet race. You want to do your very best to protect them from the nasty evils of the world. For the most part, those evils are pests that are either herbivores that try to steal the Mims food/building supplies or carnivores that attempt to eat anything meaty, including the Mims themselves, their livestock and the herbivore pests. Natural disasters can also plague the land from meteor strikes to earthquakes; the Mims sure have it rough. Luckily for the Mims, you are there to lend a hand. For example, you can put out the wild fires or help plants grow by making it rain, use PSI blasting or burning to take care of pests, cheering up the unhappy Mims or use some of your other “Godly” PSI powers to aid them. You also guide the Mims on how to build their colony in order to fulfill their objectives in that land.\n\nThere are two primary building supplies, biomass and gems. Biomass is produced from refining plant matter. Biomass is far easier to keep in stock than the gems. Gems can be acquired by mining any exposed gem deposits but those are few and far between. The best way to earn gems is through raising livestock and selling them off-world. This can pose a problem if you were not paying enough attention while building your initial colony. If you don’t ensure you have enough gems to produce the buildings required to produce and ship the livestock, you will find yourself having to restart the level. It would help if you could find a few gems laying around the map in areas you can hit with your powers or, if you have one available, are able to send a guardian to blast.\n\nMims can be classed into three main categories. Guardians are your main line of defense against the pests. They will shoot at any enemy near them and try to kill it. Unfortunately, if they are hunting alone, they tend to get scared and unhappy rather quickly. They may end up running around being attacked by the pests rather than focusing on trying to kill them. This often leads to your guardians dying. You can put them into a formation but that automatically disables movement autonomy leaving you having to manually control the formation. Workers build your buildings, collect the plant matter to make the biomass, and generally carry things from one point to another. Officers and other hero units generally have a special ability that sets them apart from a Guardian or the general worker Mims.\n\nThe building construction in the game is simple enough. There generally is one building to fit each of the needs and for the most part, that building can be upgraded to enhance its effect. Power generation is an exception to that rule. For example, you can build wind turbines that keep your buildings powered so long as there is wind (which unfortunately is often blowing too slowly to keep your buildings consistently running), or you can build a generator fueled by biomass (unfortunately it burns through biomass like crazy). Unless you have a lot of workers and biomass producing plants around, you will still often find yourself without power. There are enough building varieties in the game to satisfy those of us who like base building games. It isn’t the most complex building game ever, but it isn’t branding itself as an in-depth city builder. For a “God-Game” it is perfectly sufficient.\n\nI mentioned planting extra biomass producing plants to keep the generator running and you probably were thinking, that seems simple enough, what could possibly go wrong with doing that? Ignoring any expense involved as most plants don’t need gems and therefore pay for themselves in time, the problem is they make your island smell. Livestock (the gem producer) also smell! Smell in this game is what attracts the pests. If your floating island smells of fruity plants too much, herbivores will show up and start eating your crops. If you smell of meat too much, carnivores will show up and snack on your livestock and Mims. This makes you have to carefully consider and weigh the consequences of your actions. You could change the tide of the game very quickly just by rushing your gem or biomass production faster than you can produce the guardians needed to defend it.\n\nEven if you have a ton of guardians and workers, you may find yourself overwhelmed by pests. The reason for this is simple, as mentioned earlier; your Mims can become either unhappy or scared. Unless a Mim is happy, they will not do their job efficiently or maybe won’t even do their jobs at all. Workers not collecting biomass fast enough will cause even more pests to show up due to the smell. Guardians who are too scared or unhappy to fight will often find themselves being killed by the pests rather than clearing the pests out. You can use your PSI Power to cheer them up if you can target them and you have the energy available to do so, but that is highly inefficient and is really a losing battle. You can build houses to help make your Mims happy, and that works great… but I often found myself with multiple houses scattered around with a ton of unhappy Mims aimlessly walking about. The houses were turned on so I’m not sure why they didn’t really use them much. The ones that did though, came out of them chipper and willing to work. I’m thinking this is just an Early Access bug or perhaps I am missing something that I need to do to make them use the houses more often.\n\nOverall, The Mims Beginning is a satisfying “God-Game” that I hope leads the way to a sequel or in the very least other developers jumping on the “God-Game” bandwagon.\n\nPros:Many of the Islands (if not all) contain an Easter egg for you to find. Doing so will give you some kind of perk for that mission as well as an achievement on Steam for finding it\nCharming characters. The humour in this game is well done\nEnough buildings to keep your satisfied but not so many that it is overwhelming. Technology research helps add an extra layer of strategy.\nSmell/Pest system adds a fun element to the game that other games don’t really have\nNatural disasters and bosses help keep you on your toes\nFuture predictions helps warn you when something bad is going to happen\n\nCons:\n\nSaving only occurs between levels.

Your job is to guide and assist a small race of beings known as Mims by directing them around the small asteroid on which they live. Gameplay is simple, just click on a Mim and tell him where to go. The game shares a lot of similarities with other genres as well, such as real time strategy and city builders. This is made evident by the building menus fulls of structures that you can have your Mims build to aid in their way of life. In addition to building, you also have a menu where you can use a number of "God Powers", known as PSI. These can range from refreshing your Mims' fatigue levels, or offering protection from outside threats.\n\nThe gameplay can be a tad slow, but the devs have stated that they are working on numerous fixes, including an adjustment to the camera controls (which are solely keyboard keys, no mouse involved). Anyway, once you select a building for your Mims to build, you choose where it is to be built. Once placed, your little alien friends will go and build the selected building. Thankfully, there is a meter when you click on a building in progress that shows how long until building is finished. There are 2 main resources: Biomass and Gems. Gaining biomass requires creating a garden, where food and organic material are harvested and then thrown into a machine to create biomass. Gems are acquired by selling things at the market, which comes bit later into the game. To do this, you need a bio-lab and a spaceport, but if you don't spend your starter Gems on these 2 items, you are pretty much stuck. Something that needs adjusted for sure!\n\nGraphically, things are a bit behind for our standards in the recent year, but for a small indie studio they are quite impressive. Everything is also bright, colorful, and eye-catching. As for the sound and music, they are a bit bland but they work well for the setting in which they are used. The game just looks great and has a lot of personality. The Mims themselves are a comedic bunch, prefering to slouch around and eat instead of work, which I guess is why they need you around for guidance! There is a story as to why they are now stranded on this asteroid and repairing their ship, but it just serves to make silly jokes via dialogue. And that's not a bad thing. The game shines in it's gameplay, not the story.\n\nDespite the many issues the game may have right now, the devs have stated that they are working on improving things.  It has potential, and it shows easily. With a patch or two this game can be great.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 9, 2015","true","6.0"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","1"

But fear not! The Mims possessed an item which has the capability of restoring planets and before the horrific destruction of their home world they were able to jettison it to safety. Unfortunately it's ship was hit by debris from a meteor and all systems were shut down leaving it floating helplessly through space and no way for the Mims to reach it. With the help of you, their new God, the Mims must locate this if they ever want to flourish happily again and have any hopes of seeing their home rebuilt.\n\nThe Mims Beginning starts with an awesome little story and I found myself captivated right away. Your job as a God is to guide the Mims to safety and help them slowly rebuild and become prosperous like they once were. There are two modes to the game, the first and main being the Story mode. This is the mode that you'll want to start playing as not only does it contain the tutorial but also progressing through this this mode allows you to unlock the buildings and god powers in a specific order and will help you learn what they each do one by one. The Story mode follows the story of the Mims and you'll make your way through it by completing the objectives you have on each level/map which will in turn unlock the next. Survival mode on the other hand has all buildings, research and God powers unlocked and may be a little overwhelming or confusing to those new to the game. Survival mode has four difficulties that you must try to survive through starting at Easy up to Very Hard. You can also customize your own difficulty so you can choose if you want a relaxing sandbox style play, or something much more challenging to push yourself.\n\nTo help the Mims survive in either mode you'll need to guide them by telling them which buildings they need to create much like other God games. Your Mims will build what you tell them too and can also be told to go to specific places but other than that your Mims will carry out the task they most feel important. There are different types of Mims which you will encounter as the game goes on and these vary from Mims like Workers who do the day to day jobs, Guardians who patrol and protect the other Mims and even Shamans who can sense other Mim colonies that are in danger and allow you to help them. You also have various unlockable God powers to help you influence the Mim world further such as a group heal to revitalize and heal your Mims, fruit rain for when you run low on Biomass and things like a Psi cage used for trapping enemies and a Psi bolt for when you need to get offensive. All of these can be cast using Psi energy which is generated over time.\n\nYou'll need both Biomass and Gems to build/create in your world, the main being Biomass. Biomass is harvested from Fruit which can randomly be found growing in most worlds, but can also be created from your own fruit plants. Biomass is used for almost everything from building things to creating animals or powering buildings. Gems, however, are harder to come by as you can only receive them from a few sources. Buying and raising animals will be your main source of Gems but you can also find limited deposits on your island and some God powers will help you also but those these aren't unlocked right away. Once you've grasped correctly managing those two sources its up to you to build, survive and complete your objectives as you see fit.\nThe dialogue throughout the game is both charming and humorous and the cutscenes give the Mims  substance rather than just being 'things' you control like it is in most God games. I started to feel rather attached to my Mims and in one particular mission (I won't give any spoilers) I found myself heartbroken at my helplessness during a certain event.\n\nAs with most games The Mims beginning does have some little flaws. My two noticeable cons with the game are minor ones to me but some might find them much larger as they do impact the gameplay. The first is there is NO save mode. I'm going to repeat this as there are many negative comments I've found about this simple fact. THERE IS NOT A SAVE FEATURE. This applies to both story and survival mode so if you're looking for a game that you can come back and play the same save later this is not it. If you are like me, however, and enjoy smaller sessions you won't find any issues with this. This is something that'll not be added either as you can read here (the devs tried for a month and a half to implement it and it reaped no results and detracted from developing content). My second issue is more of a personal one but things can become rather overwhelming if you're not careful as there is a lot going on. Guardians are rather weak on their own so you'll heavily rely on using your god powers at first to destroy enemies so you'll constantly have to be checking your map for any new mob spawns. Speeding up the game increases the speed that enemies spawn so you have a choice between speeding through production and risk being overrun by enemies quickly or playing most of your game on a slower mode which can become a little tiresome especially since there is no save feature. You also have to produce animals manually one by one so you can't have the game running fast for any long period of time or you'll end up wasting time as you often forget to keep producing them. I did ask the devs if they plan to change this and they've replied saying they will look into it which is awesome! :D\n\nThe Mims Beginning overall is a fantastic game with a charming story and the kind of gameplay that keeps you coming back. Despite it's lack of a save feature The Mims Beginnings trumps most of the other God Games out there and really is a wonderful project and a great example of just what Greenlight can bring to Steam.","May 9","true","4.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

If you're patient, however, The Mims Beginning is a solid god game.\n.Story/Premise.\nThe Mims are strange, multi-eyed orange aliens who have landed on this scattered collection of floating islands as the result of a meteorite rain in space. You are their Saviour who will lead them to the missing parts of their space ship and their lost DNA Orb, which has the power to settle entire planets. The writing is amusing, though sometimes the humour felt a little forced.\n\n.Game play.\nIn typical god game fashion, you have to plant, build, and use your powers in order to keep your little Mims alive.\n\nPlants are important in both animal husbandry and building. Species require specific fruits in order to mature so that they can be sent to market and those same fruits can also be ground into biomass, which serves as a currency for creating animals and building structures. Gems also serve as currency and these can be gotten by selling adult animals or by breaking nodes found randomly around the map.\n\nThere is a total of 16 buildings, ranging from resource refinement to unit production. Placement is affected by the range of your Psi Tower, which acts as your HQ and allows you to launch rescue parties into space and recruit more Mims. The Psi Tower also allows you to use your powers.  Other buildings such as the Science Lab allows you to procure various species and the Port allows you to sell them for gems.\n\nOne interesting thing about The Mims Beginning is the smells system. By planting plants, you raise your plant smell meter and by raising animals, you raise your animal smell. As the smell level rises, critters both troublesome and deadly appear with increased frequency. The system forces you to pace your expansion and maintain a balance between production and military strength.\n\nYour powers range from fire, which is primarily used for terra-forming, to speed buffs and debuffs, to spells that replenish your Mims' energy. You can use any of these powers as long as you have the energy to do so and energy replenishes naturally--though you can build electricity-producing structures in order to speed up the process. Electricity is also used to power your buildings and having enough means that everything will run efficiently.\n\n.Graphics/ Art Style.\nThe Mims Beginning is cute. The art style is bright and colourful in a very family friendly way. The story is told in faux- cutscenes which are shown in the form of gameplay with a text box displayed at the bottom.\n\n.Longevity/Difficulty.\nI found that the difficulty spiked at random intervals during my play on the normal difficulty. Some maps took me near/longer than an hour to clear while others took only a few minutes once I figured out how to approach my objective.\n\n.Pros and Cons.\n+There are a host of abilities for you to use, which keeps dealing with the various problems that come up interesting.\n+Clean, uncluttered U.I. Everything is clearly labelled and easy to access.\n+Cute, sometimes funny story.\n+Clear objectives, which are always available for you to review.\n-The Mims very rarely clump together, which means refreshing their energy takes time and careful positioning.\n-Limited structure selection.\n-The Mims' artificial intelligence leaves a lot to be desired. I found that I had to do a LOT more micromanaging than I wanted (which means selecting Mims one by one and turning off their autonomy so that they'd do as I instructed) just to ensure things would run smoothly.\n-Your godly powers can hit friendly units. This would be fine if it wasn't so easy to punt one of your workers off the side of the map while attempting to rid yourself of other enemies.\n-No ability to select a group. Even when your warrior units are in formation, sometimes they won't all move together as one.\n\n.Bottom Line.\nFans of god games and RTS will enjoy The Mims Beginning, and even those new to the genres could get their feet wet. Assuming you have patience, of course. I can't say I'd recommend it at full retail price, but if it sees a substantial (40~60%) price cut and you're really looking for a god game, then go for it.","May 22","true","4.0"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

I got this game for free for reviewing purposes >\n\nThis is a very colorful strategy game that I just fell in love with.\n\nThe Mims beginning tells a story about you being an invisible "god" helping the Mims to bring those planets back to life!\nThe Mims are funny little creatures that you need to use and to protect.\n\nKnow this, I am so very impressed of the fact that this game was created by 2 Developers, One for designing and the other one for Coding and a 3rd one working as a translator ( This is what i know ).\n\nThe character and level design reminds me so much of Spore as for the animations and sounds, And thats a good thing because Spore is a great game.\n\nBare in mind that this game is still on  EARLY ACCESS  so it gets updated every now and then and they are working very hard on it, so this is a + for the game, Even though its early access the game it still offers a lot of content, And many levels to play that gets harder every time ( And sometimes to the point of frustration but i will get to that later )\n\nThe music in the game is really beautiful I just gotta say 10/10 for that, Classic type of music that stimulates the need to play this beautiful strategy game.\n\nStory so far is lovely, Every level you get a few objectives as main, And some secondary objectives to try to Achieve.\n\nGather Biomass and Gems to build your colony, Create more Mims Build Research centers, Spaceports, Windmills, And much more.\nUpgrade your base and use your special PSI abilities to cast fire or to buff up your units or to defend them, Survive catastrophes, Keep your Mim's energy up and turn some of them to guardians to defend your base from predators and pests.\nWith various challenges to overcome, Surviving depression, A black-hole, Monsters and more this game brings out the need to strategies your movements carefully.\n\nThere are so many features that are just so good in this game, here I will try to explain the gesture of the game.\n- You can speed up the game if you like ( normal , Fast, Fastest ) because the game progression is slow and sometimes if you want to retry a level faster its a handy thing to have.\n\n- You create animals and help them grow to send them to the spaceship and sell them for Gems which are important to build and upgrade and research abilities.\n\n- A lot of plants to place, They grow Biomass which your Mims take and throw at the Extractor so you get Biomass and use to build stuff ( The biomass is easier to get and used a lot , gems are harder to obtain and have certain uses ).\n\n- Build windmills or Generators to create electricity (its not really that important, it just makes your Psi energy ( Mana ) refresh faster, and makes creating animals also faster .. and important in some objectives )\n\n- Research center to research abilities and new stuff, Houses for Mim's to rest at ( you can also use abilities to replenish their energy ), Build Silos to increase your Biomass cap and other buildings to increase the electricity cap, and later on you get to build towers to protect your Mims.\n\n- 3 Type of abilities ( Offensive , Defensive and global ) They are all explained from their name I hope.\n\nAlthough the game graphics and details are spectacular it can also run on older machines, The graphic options can be reduced significantly so it would work on them.\n\nAfter explaining all that, Going to the short point.\n\nPros  :\n1 - Beautiful colorful worlds to go through and lovely design with characters and everything.\n2 - Great music and sound effects in the game they are as good as the game looks in the screenshots.\n3 - Challenging and funny story, The game requires strategy and thinking instead of just randomly building stuff.\n4 - The fact that the game is created by 2 and still gave me that wonderful experience is a good thing because I know that they are hard workers who worked on this for so long, hopefully in about Six months it will be fully released.\n\nCons :\nThere are 2 minor cons that exists in the game currently, They are so minor I am sure they will be fixed soon just thought i'd make this review completely honest and show everything in it.\n\n1 - Remember when I said sometimes it gets a bit frustrating ? Well its a simple point that can be fixed easily (They are probably working on it ), You cant use the circle or square selection to select units in a group, and they keep wandering off sometimes if you don't put enough plants to give them a reason to stay to gather biomass.\n\n2 - Sometimes when they pickup the fruit and throw it at the extractor just sometimes it would hit the edge and fall down on the floor again so they will pick it up and redo it , This mainly depends on where you put the extractor ( Make sure there are no tall trees next to it so it wouldn't bump into them )\n\n\nSo Considering this is an Early Access title it brings out a lot of game time, Internet goes off frequently because i have about 15 Hours so far,\nThere's a lot of content to go through the game does not feel completely polished but it is great for its current state.\n\nI Recommend this to anyone who played Spore and enjoyed it and loves strategy games, And loves an adorable adventure that combines mystery and comedy.\nSupport those amazing devs for their outstanding work.\nOverall Rating 9/10 and i am being completely fair here\n\nThis review was written while i was a part of the original traders group OTG, however you can trust that the review was not effected by that fact, I was not forced to lie or anything, you can read it and judge for yourself, all my reviews are honest and I am no longer a part of the group.","February 10, 2015","true","9.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","5"

How is the game? read this review and find out!\n\nPlot/Storyline\n\nThe "Mims" a race of alien critters, with tentacles eyes and short orange bodies, crash on a strange island and need to find a missing part for their crashed freighter ship, they then discover "you" and decide to drag you into their turmoil and help them survive the harsh new world.\n\nI like the story personally, and feel as tho others will too.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n"The Mims" play style is similar to that of populous or Godus (I know, The title we do not speak of)\nbut also brings its own unique style to the God game genre. Control are fully explained during the tutorial and are easy to learn and you will find yourself shooting around the map in no time.\n\nThe general gameplay is calm and you may start getting bored but the game always\nhas exciting moments just around the corner, such as predator attacks or harsh weather conditions (Some natural, others not so much).\n\nGRAPHICS/TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nThe graphics aren't marvoulous but they certainly give you the full experience of the quirky characters and bright alien worlds.\n\nI had extremely fast load times, when first booting up the game and between levels. I also had a good smooth framerate\nthroughout all the gameplay, even when a lot of effects were on screen at once.\n\nSome textures appeared blurry or low quality on menus but the game is still early access and they might get resolved by the time the game is fully released.\n\nI didnt see any graphical anomaly throughout my playthrough, or any clipping issues.\n\nSOUND\n\nOverall sound quality is fantastic, the developers really put a lot of work into the sound effects,\nyou can hear wind turbines spinning or the spacecraft taking off. Ambient sounds are plentiful and add to the atmosphere\n\nThe Mims aren't voice acted in cut scenes yet but i could see at least their alien voices being added to the dialogue in the future.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nThe Mim's doesn't feature multiplayer at this time.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMy final verdict is, Its worth the asking price for the amount of content and playability you are getting, the game is frequently updated and the developer's are highly active.Its far along in early access at this stage and i doubt the full version is far away.

It reminds me of Spore in some ways, but with more content and added features. The Mims are primitive tribesman that consider you their God and as such follow your every beck and call. The controls work well, although there is some room for improvement. The levels are fun, they do feel more like a puzzle than anything, and they can be rather challenging whether you've played the level or not. Finding new ways to complete levels and streamline your overall goal is exciting. From the pictures you can more or less judge the art style, graphics, etc. for your own.\n\nIf you're considering buying this game now, however, there are some negatives to consider:\nThere is no saving in the middle of the mission. For a long mission this is quite the problem, so, although it definitely adds challenge, if you don't have some time set aside to complete a level you can't really enjoy the game.\nSteam Achievements don't seem to be working, I really wish I would have known this before diving into survival mode (a save feature reeeeally would have been helpful here)\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 7/10 - worth the buy. +1 for the idea and creativity of the game. -1 for the controls, and alpha issues.

Ever since Populus on the Amiga I've loved the genre but The Mims misses the mark for me.\n\nEach mission takes place on a floating island, each of which contains new dangers to overcome.  The developers have clearly made an effort to give the game a semblence of plot although the transitions between missions feel a bit sudden with no real explanation of why the little aliens are choosing the next landmass or what happened to everything you left behind on the last one.\n\nThe gameplay for the most part is fairly simple.  Plants generate fruit, fruit gives you biomass and feeds your livestock and selling your animals gives you gems.  Both gems and biomass can be used to build and upgrade structures to further advance your camp with gems generally being your bottleneck.\n\nTrying to over extend your production of fruit or livestock will result in pests coming to eat your resources or hostile life being attracted to your island which will attack your animals and Mims.  You need to balance production to minimise threats.  This system of discouraging over production is a really nice mechanic.\n\nSadly, the good news stops there.  The AI and some game mechanics feel poorly optimised which leads to more frustration than fun.\n\nMims get tired as they work and will need to rest up in a house to get their energy back.  On one level, despite having one house for every two Mims they just refused to rest regularly.  My guardians, essential for defense of my village are particularly guilty of not resting up when they have the chance and are frequently all out of energy when I most need them.\n\nDespite being told early on that my Mims love nature, destroying trees is often the only viable way to get enough building space.  I could overlook the backstory hole here is the process of removing foliage wasn't so painful in it's own right; setting fire to some of the bigger trees just reduces their size, usually requiring three bursts of flame to get the job done.  The trees will grow back a bit though so if anything interrupts your pyromania while your Psi power build up (like needing to heal some guardians) you'll find the tree back to full height before you can have another go.\n\nPlants can be a source of annoyance in other ways too.  Several of the fruit providing plants will throw their finished product across the island and despite my best efforts to ensure that they're aimed at a building or that they have plenty of space for the fruit to land, I frequently find my new fruit tree throwing their resources off the edge of the island.\n\nA little trial and error with placement of my plants could maybe be forgiven if it was at least possible to sell my plants back or reposition after they've grown but this is sadly not possible.\n\nThe final straw for me though is the lack of a save feature.  Missions aren't particularly quick to complete and I've had a couple of occasions now where I've had to stop playing mid mission for one reason or another and have to abandon my progress.\n\nOverall it's a game with some neat ideas and potential to be fun but seriously marred by it's shortcomings.","May 27","false","4.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The different structures and how they chain together can take some getting used to, but I was able to figure it out after a few playthrus on the first level.

It does feel a little Pikmin like at the start - especially with the description of your main/first goal in the story mode.\n\nPros:\nIt's fun and it works, a nice little god game.\nWhat's in the game seems to work as it should (eg limited content but it works properly) - honestly the biggest thing for me.\nEnjoy the sense of humor (it's no Startopia but it got a few laughs).\nTutorial does a good job of explaining what you need to do and what each building does.\nExploding the slugs feels so so so good.\nCons:\nSome typos in the tutorials (nothing major, still understandable just noticeable).\nDoesn't appear to be an option to save.\nOnly the story mode is avaliable now.\nSpeed options are there but don't seem to be functional (correction: not functional in the first two missions until it is introduced in the third).\nAt least one of the plants distributes its fruit randomly (it can go pretty far) and I'm not sure if it's actually as random as it should be. I watched one plant repeatedly throw all it's fruit off my island (and only a tiny part of it's arc was off the island but it always threw there).","January 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's currently in early access and only the story mode is available, nevertheless I have not yet encountered any bugs and the game is very polished (short of a few typos) for day one early access.\n\nYou must harvest resources, create buildings, keep your Mims happy so that they can work productively, create and grow animals that you can then sell for more resources, defend your base, fight off creatures, and search for the parts you need to rebuild your spaceship and go home.\n\nIt starts off fairly simplistic but does gather depth as you progress. Problem is it takes a while to get there playing the story mode. If you're finding it too easy - it does get more complicated once everything is unlocked. I hope that when sandbox is implemented you can build on a much larger scope and hopefully set conditions that provide more of a challenge. I'll return to edit this once that is added!\n\nI'd also really like an option to save in the story mode, especially considering some maps have a fail condition, ie. if your special hero dies - you lose a solid hour of play.\n\nThe (currently not rebindable) camera controls are the biggest negative and take some getting used to. I hope the developers consider reworking with the standard right click hold to rotate and tilt rather than having to move to the edges of the screen as well as adding bindings. Otherwise I can see the current system really holding the game back and frustrating players from the start.\n\nDespite some negatives that need to be smoothed out, the game is charming. Beautiful graphics, runs very well, cute, entertaining and fills a niche in a genre which is sadly devoid of recent titles. I don't think this is the deep strategy god game some people are still hoping to appear in the genre, but it still has an absolute ton of potential at this point.

I'll try to make an extended "beta review", adding some personal considerations.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe Mims is an addicting, funny game to play with elements that remember Black and White. In particular, you are in control of your own tribe of "mims", that are semi-autonomous (they can be controlled under a certain degree), and your aim is to make them evolve and colonize these islands.\nI've seen much improvements since the first alpha version, and I have to say that the game is quite enjoyable, even if it needs in my opinion some fine tuning: scenarios are overly difficult at the beginning (and often make you start the scenario again just because you miscalculated the resources needed for a certain development), while become easier the more you develop them.\nSomething seriously lacking, as I have always said to the devs, is the ability to save game in the middle of a scenario (that can last even for some hours, if you take your time developing everything to the max).\nThe controls are quite simple and improved in relation to the alpha version. It takes a little time to get used to it (in particular it's not explained how to rotate the camera), but befor the end of the first scenario you can easly manage everything.\n\nSTORY MODE\nThe main feature of the game is the story mode, as opposed to the survival mode, that will be relased soon. My opinion is that during the alpha relase the story did actually make sense (it was about this mims lost in the universe, and every scenario was directly consequence of the last one, even if there were only three). As for now, i've played 5 o 6 scenarios (finding also the ones i played already) but the story was completely unrelated, just some random connection that doesn't seriously makes sense. I sincerely hope the developers work out something better for the story (even if it's not the selling point of the game).\n\nGRAPHICS\nGraphics are quirky and fun. They will surely not stress your video card, but despite being simple and cartoon-like, i find them very enjoyable.\n\nMUSIC\nMusic also is simple and enjoyable. What seriously lack is the character dubbing during dialogues. Now it's only textuals, and they definitely don't exploit their potentiality.\n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\nI think the price for the early access is definitely too high, for a game that is far from being complete, and will take at least another year to be. But in the end I reccomend it, because it is fun. Don't be fooled by the graphics, this is not a casual game: it requires patience and calculation more than quick wits, but it's not for everyone. I especially recommend it if you liked Black and White.","January 15, 2015","true","111.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/337820/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3537 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nThe Mims Beginning is a “god game” style real time strategy survival game where your goal is to gather up and maintain order in your civilization while you search for things from your old planet before you had to leave and inhabit new ones.  Once you can presumably find these things, you will be able to reestablish the old planet and once again live as you once did on your old planet.  You can use the mouse or keyboard to adjust the screen and angles as you play.  You’ll be building various types of structures to use resources, or create new things in order to make your area more stable and self-sufficient.  It reminds me of some other games I have played in the past, like Populous, Darwinia, or the Act Raiser games, for instance.  The gradual improvement system, and management of resources to continue to progress towards your goals is very fun in this game.  In story mode, there are factors that can really help or hinder your ability to get to the next steps, whatever they may be, depending on many different things that can happen.\n\n\nPros\nSome good humorous dialogue, which is always refreshing for me to see in most games.\n\nThe seamless and gradual progression as far as putting different tools you have to practical use  is well done and I am enjoying it very much from scenario to scenario.\n\nCreatures are interesting looking, and I like the artwork and graphics quite a bit.\n\nThe control scheme isn’t too hard to get used to, and quite friendly to someone not as familiar with RTS games.\n\nThis actually works well on my laptop with integrated graphics, which is really great!  I was not sure if it would be able to, but with enough memory, my laptop held up very well.  Some slowing when a whole lot of stuff was on the screen, but overall I was impressed at how well this handled on my weaker laptop computer.\n\n\nCons\nI hope there will be more building types later, and extra variety in what all you can work with.  It’s still nice so far, but I do want more for such a great game.\n\nI find it takes a while to get certain goals, and fighting and fending off some more trivial  things, or having slow production can cause me a bit of frustration.\n\nThe Mims themselves can be a little bit cowardly, and they are hard to control when their moods dip down.  They go into a chaos or fear mode, and controlling them can be a bit of a challenge sometimes.\n\nIt’s a bit strange how you end up with certain buildings up as you go through story mode, but your old structures are gone.  This kind of breaks up the story for me a bit, and I wish my gems and creations could carry over too.\n\nDestroying things nets you nothing, as far as I can tell.  I think you should get some of what you used to create the structure back when you break it down.\n\n\nOther Thoughts\nI found the tutorial helpful at the beginning to get used to some of the basics.   Your Mims will move slower if they are tired, so ideally you want to keep them happy, or let them rest between work, so they can be productive and gather what you need to build whatever goals are set up for your colony.  Raising creatures up in the Lab can be beneficial to gain some gems by sending them off to trade, which can be extremely important for building and progressing.  If you run out of gems with a lot more to do, you might find yourself in real trouble.\n\nI love RPG elements in games, and having perks or a carry-over sort of leveling would be great on this.  I’d love to have a bit more experimentation, or secrets or other things that contribute and possibly can change your overall progression depending on what you want to increase or focus on for a “build”.  Just a personal bias, but I think it would really suit the game well to have a little bit more of this involved in the overall RTS elements.\n","May 11","true","4.8"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Everything works as it should. The graphics look great and you won't witness placeholders or game elements which do not work. The Mims Beginning is essentially a  'god game', meaning a RTS strategy game where you govern a tribe of Mims (funny looking creatures, that are highly likeable). You need to gather resources, build and improve your buildings and face dangers which lurk for you around each corner. The game consists of easy to learn basics but mastering all of the options given to you may sometimes be demanding. As a 'god' you can give orders to the little guys  (although they can fend quite good for themselves) and cast spells (an important part of the game). If you think the game looks too childish, don't worry, the gameplay is very good and it should be a great title for people of any age.

The learning curve is very steep when you play close attention to what's happening and how "things" interact with each other, so even a level that seems unsolvable and due to randomness probably even unfair can be solved. With careful (and often enough slowtime :P) observation and reactive change of the "environmental parameters" or "interaction chains" and some strategical planning the Mims is definitely beatable, but hard and riddly enough to scare off people who don't like the roguelike-concept.\n\n\nThe Mim pathfinding AI could be worked on, because from own work I know that even jumping spiders seem able to optimize their expenditures by taking some 'shortcuts'. (Mind my wording, no quotes please) No, that's not it. It's how they react to sudden changes, like when fruit go bad and explode. They go back to a very far-away fruit instead of some that lie right next to them that must 'smell' as well (I loved the smell-o-meter!!!).\nSo yeah, that's "unrealistic", because it's not impromptu-adaptive. I guess, in some more abstract way, it's cracking a nut with a sledgehammer/breaking a fly on a wheel/shooting sparrows with a a MARSH if you get me. Still convincing enough for fun!\n\nA player controlled or even regular autosave-feature would probably help to reach a broader audience.\n\nNot actually being legally qualified to make such a recommendation, I would also say this game is ok for kids, too!","April 18, 2015","true","65.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

A Real Time Strategy? A City Builder? All of the above!\nI went into The Mims Beginning expecting a typical god game, like the others that I've played many times. Godus and Reus, the comparisons are bound to get made, but I enjoy the The Mims Beginning much more than the others. This is going to be a somewhat long review, so you may want to grab a beverage. I'll summarize it by saying this: I've paid a lot more money for games that deliver much less - the fact that this is early access and I was totally willing to drop the money on it to give it a chance should really say something. Now for the long version:\n\nGraphics\nI'm usually not hard to please with graphics, but these have well exceeded my expectations. Squatting Penguins will have me looking into them much more in the future as a result of everything they have put together here, and the graphics are a big part of that. Very colorful, and I'm a total pushover when it comes to cute characters. This game has the cute in high supply.\n\nGameplay\nYou better not skip that tutorial! There is a LOT of game here. I'm not saying that you couldn't just jump right in and play it, but with the influence of the other game genres factored in, it's a good idea to make sure you're ahead on the learning curve.\n\nI enjoy the controls, they're simple to get used to and, most important, they work correctly! If you've played a lot of god games, RTS, or City Builders, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. There's not a lot that I can say about the controls, it's as if they've simplified something that's pretty standard across all of the mentioned genres. There isn't anything wrong with this, and I'm betting this could become a game favorited by children. Combined with the graphics, it's a winning combination.\n\nThe Characters\nThe onomatopoeia I would use to describe my reaction to the character graphics is so obnoxious that I'm not going to bother typing it. Suffice it to say, there was a lot of me saying, "Cool!" out loud. My dog looks at me like I'm losing my mind when I do this, but he knows I'm happy. I don't talk to myself about character designs that are ugly. Very, very cool.\n\nThe Soundtrack\nCould the developers please, please write and publish a book about making soundtracks for other indie developers to learn from? Especially with this type of game, I'm extremely hard to please when it comes to soundtracks. The games I've been playing lately have had great music to listen to, and this one definitely stands out. The ambient noises are interesting, the music is ambient and relaxing, but interesting enough to keep from getting boring. A good musician, or musicians, worked on making the soundtrack enjoyable. I hope they include it as a DLC when the game is released. :)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis feels oddly complete for an early access game, which really says something about the developers! They're taking the time to make sure their game is great, and they seem to engage the community and take suggestions, without compromising the integrity of their creation by falling victim to groupthink.\n\nWhat they have here, as-is, is a fantastic game that's fun to play and fun to look at. Admittedly, I haven't played it all the way to the end, yet, but it's certainly something I'll be paying attention to.

Build a few standard resource structures (in this case for one single resource, Biomass), gather enough of said resources to build other structures, rinse and repeat. And in the meantime you can burn trees down or throw bugs off the edge of the floating island while your space chickens slowly eat bananas and grow into sellable chickens so you get more gems to build more structures.\n\nFurther into the game you probably unlock more God powers that could be fun to play around with but I found myself wondering "Why am I playing an inferior remake of the game I played and thoroughly enjoyed beating about 10 years ago?" and the answer eluded me. That game of course being Populous: The Beginning, a far superior experience in nearly every regard. I guess I respect the developers for trying to resurrect the God Game genre but this was pretty bland from start to very hasty finish.\n\nP.S. If I was allowed to save the game I might have returned at a later time to see if gameplay improves but alas I don't have 3 hours to spend on a speculative gaming sesh when I have this mountain of other verifiably Good Games to play.","May 24","false","0.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

I don\'t know how such a horrible oversight gets into a modern game, but there you have it.  As a result you must generally rely on the AI of your units to ensure that they are doing their jobs correctly, because selecting them to tell them to do something will be a pain in the bum.  Happily enough, the AI for the worker Mims is generally sufficient to accomplish tasks in a timely manner.\n\nThe gaurdian Mims, your soldiers who deal with threats, are another matter.  They wander around alone, patrolling for threats, which becomes a serious problem the moment enemies which are stronger than a single guardian Mim are introduced.  They can be assigned into formations by selecting one and ordering him to add nearby guardians to his formation, however in doing this removes their original desire to patrol.  So!  You can either have lone patrollers who can find threats, then die.  Or you can have large groups of stationary soldiers who do nothing but response to nearby enemies unless ordered.  Great.\n\nThat aside, it\'s not a terrible game for the casual gaming crowd.  It\'s easy, relaxing, slow-paced, and the various creatures all have a nice cartoony feel.  It\'s just not worth $19.99.

Unoftunately it's not there yet.  While the formula of mixing a bit of Populous with The Settlers, and adding the humor from Kerbal Space Program is a good one, and the game is fun to play, I can't recommend it for 3 reasons:\n\na) Non-intuitive keyboard controls with no way to rebind them.  Who uses the Q and E keys for zooming?  Every other game with a 3-d map uses them for rotation.\n\nb) Lack of information.  There is too much stuff under the hood with no way to get to it.  The tutorial is 2 missions and just barely scratched the surface.  For example, it tells you that houses are the best way to c ombat fatigue and anger, but how many Mims does a house hold?  There is no in game or out of game documentation that I could find.\n\nc)Most egregious, no in-mission saves.  There is one save slot, and restoring it takes you back to the start of the current mission.  Missions can take an hour or more, which is fine if you have the kind of time to play a single game, but for those of use who don't, it makes the game unplayable.\n\nI would advise everyone to hold off until these issues are resolves, especially the no-save-anywhere.","January 15, 2015","false","0.8"," 33 of 73 people (45%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","45","33","73","5","8"

It also surprisingly runs really well, even if you have a real old PC this game should run fine, most of the time I get over 100 frames and my computer is averagely powerful as of writing this review.\n\nSadly... that's about all I praise the game for right now, I ended up getting it because so many people praised it so highly in their reviews and I’ve always wanted to play another god game but I’m really not seeing why, and being disappointed only afew hours into the game is never a good thing. I don't know what I was expecting from this game but whatever it is it doesn’t deliver it. Never just go off good reviews people, learn from others mistakes like mine, read the bad reviews then the good ones, they at least brace you for the bad things you may expect in the game before they rudely surprise you. =/\n\nAnyway, this game just doesn’t feel right to me, surely this can't be late beta it really doesn’t feel finished or polished much, I mean yea it's better put together then most early access games and there -is- a game here but... not much of a fun one. The main problem I find is I get bored alot in this game... that shouldn’t be a thing in a game really should it? Thank god they put in a button to double speed and another to triple speed or I can imagine this game really not gaining much of gamer’s limited attention span for long these days. That should solve the problem right? but then again you can't really do that every mission anyway because when sheet hits the fan the chaos goes down so quick you end up failing the mission... somehow, happened to me on the third mission, yea, I felt really stupid, so if you plan on getting this game I hope you have alot of patience, and time. =P\n\nThis brings me onto the games difficulty, there is no game difficulty setting... that's already a problem, because this game is actually really frustratingly stubborn and long winded for being such a cute little game, well it is for me anyway, every time you want something done the game throws a pile of stuff at you to slow it right down almost to a halt. You'll be plopped on a tiny floating island and be like oh yea this will be easy enough and end up spending an hour finishing the mission somehow. That wouldn’t be a problem if there was any kind of auto save or a save button put in! Yes you can't save, that’s not good at all is it? There are lots of things here the developers need to re-evaluate to make it less annoying to play and you only have to play the game to experience what I mean, I can't even explain it, it’s just abit of everything mashed together to make ugh. Like the wind turbines being so expensive and making so little energy you have to build three or more just to get a good flow coming in, then your guys needing energy to sleep in their expensive house which you can't get because they are too tired now to bring you in a decent income to make more turbines and it takes an hour before you even get that crap together to actually do the objectives... you see where I’m going with this? You hit brick walls non-stop for no apparent reason and you’re not sure whether to blame yourself for being a derp or if it’s the game not telling you what you need to know enough and just being mean. This game is just brutal for new players starting out full stop! so if you’re not a fan of that... yea stay away for now until the devs be fairer with this game, at least give us more starting gems or other ways to earn the blue gems, cmon! Multiple times I was happily building away then I ran out of gems and I didn’t have the buildings to earn more and I was just like, *sigh* why is that even a thing? And had to restart, again, yea that might just be me being forgetful but it’s such an easy thing for a new player to frick up on they really need to fix it else it’s just a make yourself an idiot simulator for only 20 dollars!\n\nI'm probably going to have to force myself to finish this one and that should be saying enough. This game just isn’t addictive or desirable, it's already starting to feel repetitive after the fourth mission and what does that mean? Not enough content and not enough to do. I mean you have powers you can help out with, but they recharge slowly and really don't do alot in the long run, you don't really feel like much of a powerful god when it takes four bomb strikes to kill a caterpillar... these seem easy enough to fix so I really hope the devs get on it or this game is never going to feel satisfying to play. =(\n\n\n\nIn conclusion I would really suggest waiting this game out for as long as you can make yourself if your excited about it, hopefully it gets lots of updates because it seems to need them, especially content, there’s like... 10 buildings, 20 god powers, (half you don't get until the end of the game of course) 5 animals and 10 plants you can make roughly, and all the floating islands are almost the same, that's not much diversity is it? I was hoping for more but there isn’t more here sadly, oh well, not much I can do about but hope this sparks another dev to make an interesting god game because come on... ever since Black and White 2 we have been deprived of a good god game for years, I would hoping this would break that but maybe not.\n\nThis game is still in beta tho so this review may change, if the game changes enough ill just delete this review and re write it! If anyone sees a big change in this game let me know and ill play it again to see, but for now... this game is really time consuming and boring, I can't recommend it much at all, sorry god game lovers out there. =(\n\nOh yea and ill give it a 5/10 right now, just to conclude this opinion review nicely.","January 15, 2015","false","5.4"," 19 of 90 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","19","90","0","16"

The items roll down the hills in the right fashion, and some times the mims even miss when they throw things.\n-Story is fantastic and funny\n-Nicely priced\n\nCons-\n-Some elements of the physics are annoying, such as trees are solid, and when you throw an enemy by them, they can hit a leaf and bounce off.\n-Similar as above, if you flick a mim in the air, sometimes they can get stuck in buildings etc, and there's no real way of removing it at the beginning of the story.\n-When you fail a mission, you have to start over. Spending hours on a good mission, and having to start again is annoying, but I'm sure save files later on would fix this.\n-The animals AI can be annoying, as they can drift off to somewhere else that has fruit, instead of where you want them to stay, would be nicer for the animals to have a feeding area the mims stock up instead.\n\n\n","January 21, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
