Decent enough being the key words here. In a world where indie games come in job lot, decent is barely enough. Of course, it already has a solid enough mechanic, decent graphic, simple control, a game that you can get into without much problem, but that's it. Since this is an Early Access title that does better than many of its broken brethren, I'm inclined to give it a benefit of a doubt.

I wish there was a wider variety when it comes to guns. Having some creative weapons could really up the replay value, and pushing people to fight over those and maybe some useful powerups around the map could make the game more intense.\n\nI really do enjoy that you can destroy the environment. The voxel maps are perfect for that, and allow for some cool tactics. However, as I said before, the game becomes a bit boring after you've played it for a while. I hope a few improvements can keep the game interesting in the future.","October 12, 2015","false","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You liked that mechanic? Then go and buy this game!\n\nGunjitsu makes a lot right. The whole game is built around the grappling hook and that is, how a game should be. Take the the mechanic that brings the most fun and add some features that support it. The swinging around works great and is really fun, once you figured out how to use it best. Generally, the movements in this game just work. Swinging, jumping, dashing, it all makes you feel like some sort of sci-fi ninja. Awesome!\nThe shooting part is a perfect addition to that. You quickly pick up all the controls you need and can start playing with bots or online with friends. While it's easy to learn the basics, it will take some time to master the controls and perfect your timing. I had not a single frustrating moment in this game, even when I died several times in a row, as it is very fun to watch. Getting shot with a pumpgun in the middle of a jump let's you skid away like ragdoll.

It isn't a bad game and I would say worth $3-5 if you like the genre and had regular friends to play with.  As is, my opinion is it is a bit overpriced and not many people are playing.  There isn't really a goal and I think that would help it somewhat as nothing really stands out here from the crowd of other similar shooter games.  Adding something like scoring goals on top of the battle or maybe a capture the flag mode might help.   Also needs some different environments as the platforms here are all pretty much the same.  Overall I will give it a recommend if you can pick it up on sale based on how it currently stands even it wasn't developed any more.

There's no Campaign mode or anything, sure you can play with bots but who buys a multiplayer game to play vs bots?\n\nThe game itself can be fun, there is a lot of mobility based gameplay with lots of jumping and throwing hooks and blasting your opponents with weapons but if nobody plays it none of that matters so I can't really recommend it unless that changes in the future, which if the current situation is any clue, it is doubtful that will happen.","September 19, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But servers are kinda empty at this stage, controls sometimes feel weird, sometimes you respawn at the same spot as another player at the same time and game lacks cool action music. With bigger arsenal, more pickups, support for more than 4 players on 1 map and not so dead community this game will be pretty fun. But right now I'm getting bored too quickly. I hope that everything will change after early access stage.","September 21, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's an intersting take on the 2D battle arena.  It's got a mixture of that Smash... uhm Uncles? game and Speed Runners.  You get  weapons and a grappling hook.  It's nothing inovative yet it is a fun one to play.  Trying to play the training mission was a bit frustrating when my system exceeds the requirements and it's being choppy.   Overall, Gunjitsu is a fun battle arena game.  This is the type of game that needs a 4-pack option if you want to take on your friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavenlyRage/recommended/280010/","HeavenlyRage","HeavenlyRage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HeavenlyRage/","387 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile this game is enjoyable it has some big major drawbacks for me. These drawbacks include the following:\n1) Hardly anyone (if anyone at all) is ever on multiplayer.\n2) I often find myself having a hard time walking over uneven terrain.\n3) Considering the lower graphic quality of the game, it is very laggy. The game could be optimized.\n\nI do want to say that I really enjoy grappling. I like the fact that you can shoot while grappling. I also managed to kill a bot in midair with a grenade while in midair myself, which I thought was pretty sweet.

Reminded me of Speedrunners, but it has diferent modes, wich make it a nice alternative. In general, i think its great, and i recommend you to give it a try, but there are two main issues i like to point out. First one is that it would be awesome if it had a local multiplayer mode (i love this kind of games for meetings with friends, and also, there arnt many online players), and second, i think it needs lots of resources for the kind of game it is. I imagined that it should run fine on my normal laptop, but that wasnt the case (tough it runs fine on my gamer computer).","September 18, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There isn't a lot to Gunjitsu, it's just a really solid sidescrolling multiplayer shooter. But it's the few extra little things sprinkled on top that build on the simple core gameplay to make it really enjoyable. Destroyable pixellated enviornments are a splendid touch that sometimes adds an unexpected dimension of fun or strategy to the match. The vertical arena layout makes kills extra satisfying, making blood and corpses tumble downward in copious amounts. While I hesitate to recommend a multiplayer game with a non-existent online playerbase, I found the bots to be surprisingly worthy foes. As amusing as Gunjitsu is, it can only benefit from additional development, so I do hope this one doesn't get abandoned.","April 12","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
