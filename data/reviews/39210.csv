You only need one character to play every class. The classes build off of eachother to add diversity to your play style as well as to upgade into more role focused jobs. You can craft your own gear, you can make your own food and you can play 90% of the game ALL BY YOURSELF! You don't have to be in a guild or part of a click. The people who play this game are shockingly friendly and supportive. Dungeons are part of a finder in game. The story line is epic and the cinematics are breathtakeing. The opening video almost had me in tears just because I knew what was happening without any words.

It is a pretty standard "theme park" MMO. That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well.\nSubscription model, I was almost tempted to put this in the Pros column. One of the few games to do this model well in a sea of F2P MMOs.\nCons:Tens of hours of monotonous fetch quests sprinkled throughout the game. Usual MMO fare.\nLong PvP queues, slightly unbalanced. (Not enough people play PvP)\nEndgame content can be very grindy at times. (Ex: Relic Weapons, and "Run the same 2 dungeons over and over to get currency to buy gear".)\nGil sellers - I realize this happens in pretty much every MMO. This didn't make the list because it happens, it is strictly on the list because of advertising chat spam. On an average day you will see a lot of messages (unless you're like me and are so fed up with it you go /away). Expect the spam to be cranked up to 11 whenever a large piece of content is released. I really feel SE could implement better countermeasures with respect to advertising. It does seem worse than in many of it's other AAA MMO competitors. On a side note, I'm told the JP servers are practically gil seller free. I've never tested this myself however.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LazyWings/recommended/39210/","LazyWings","LazyWings","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LazyWings/","196 products in account","I've never been an MMO player. Briefly played Tera - liked it but found progression slow - and briefly WoW - disliked the combat, just felt like button mashing. I also played Mabinogi for a short while and really disliked the game's mechanics. One day I felt the urge to play one and I knew a friend was planning to start this so I bought it but neither of us started. 9 days ago a friend of mine was looking for people who wanted to start and I decided that if it was in my steam list I may as well try it out. I am now 95.9 hours in according to steam and I love it. I've just hit level 50 and got my Paladin armour and I'm still looking at all the content coming up. As I speak server is going down to patch even more content into the game. So here's the detailed review:\n\nStory\n\nThe story is a good one as far as MMOs go (based on my limited experience). I'd equate it to WoW in some ways as FFXIV builds off of an already established lore but is still extremely easy for new players to get into. I don't want to say much about it but Square Enix really put work into making a good story. It teeters a bit at times, especially around the middle (lv30-40 is a bit slow) but it's very enjoyable if you get into it.\n\nClasses\n\nCombat classes are fairly traditional: tank, support, ranged DPS and melee DPS. Still within these wider definitions, each individual class is fairly unique. To add to this you are not restricted to the classes that you pick at the beginning of the game. You will unlock the ability to train any and all classses as you wish which allows for a lot of flexibility. But "Oh, the grind ¬¬" you say. Nope, all classes trained beyond the first receive exp gain bonuses which really speeds up the process. This is alongside the quick levelling options which I'll discuss in a later section.\n\nThere's more though! All combat classses have a progression called a "Job" which is earned by reaching a certain point in the story, getting a class to lv30 and the corresponding second class to lv15, and then finishing the job quest. It's actually really easy to do and it encourages you to try a different role.\n\nAll combat classes are unique and don't overlap much at all which is great.\n\nAs for crafting classes, there's a fair few of them and I have limited experience of them right now but crafting itself isn't just sit there and wait for things to appear. There's an active process and is fairly enjoyable. Just like the combat classes, new skills are unlocked and it becomes a sort of strategic minigame. Quick synthesis for bulk items is available as well so you don't have to do it for each item.\n\nStill I can see crafting becoming tedious. repetitive and boring at some point but that's no different from any other mmo. Also, unlike the combat classes, the crafting classes aren't really unique.\n\nCombat\n\nThe combat system is targetted, which honestly I was sceptical about when first going in as I'm not a big fan of targetted combat but it grows on you. This is mostly to do with how the game feels since you really have to think about movement, positioning, skill orders, skill timing etc. from more or less the beginning of the game. This is a big deal and playing the first 20 or so levels in WoW feels boring and just mashing buttons in a certain order. The 2.5sec global cooldown adds to the strategic element of it too. You have more time to think and decide what move would be appropriate, but you also have a longer window to be punished for choosing the wrong skill. I honestly think this is way more fun and interesting compared to other games with a much smaller global cooldown.\n\nAnother important point is that this game is very controller friendly. It's on the PS3/PS4 with cross platform support so that would be why. I personally play with a controller and it feels very smooth. I don't feel too overwhelmed with skills and I've unlocked all of them for my job with 3 cross skills in use as well (I have 2 full hotbars but it's very easy to switch between them). It's down to preference in the end but the option is really nice to have.\n\nLevelling\n\nThere are so many different ways to level it's crazy. Though the main story quest is compulsory, there are loads of side quests available.\n\nIf you think quests are repetitive you can switch over to doing FATES which are events that spawn that give gil (money) and experience to everyone that completes them based on the level of participation.\n\nIf that's boring there are many different dungeons to do with solid exp gain on all of them. Duty roullete will give you bonus exp once a day so deffo worth doing that.\n\nNo? Then you can do levequests which are contracts to do certain things in certain places which you can get by using one of your levequest allowances (which refill regularly). Levequests are available to crafting classes too and are considered the fastest ways to level them.\n\nStill not enough? Then Guildhests might be for you. These are very similar to levequests but you're put into a duty (instance) with a party and asked to do it as a group. There's a daily bonus on guildhest roullete as well so that's good.\n\nAlso, the first time you do a certain dungeon, levequest or guildhest you'll be granted bonus exp which is always a definite plus.\n\nStill too slow? Not enough content? Too repetitive? Well if you're that hard to please then I guess I should tell you that there are these things called logs which grant bonus exp for doing certain things. A hunting log will ask you to kill x number of y, while a crafting log will give you the list of everything you can craft. The king of all these is the challenge log which refreshes weekly and gives you a lot of exp for completing tasks like "complete 3 dungeons" or "complete 5 levequests".\n\nHonestly there are so many different ways to level that players can pick something that suits them and though some can get repetitive they're fun for the most part.\n\nEndgame\n\nYou only need to google the game to see the amount of post lv50 content. The game's been out for about a year and there are things constantly being added. The first expansion is coming out soon so keep an eye out for that. Most people will tell you that lv50 is just the beginning, and they're probably right. I'm only just getting into the endgame and I look forward to everything coming up.\n\nPrice\n\nWell. This is the one major downside I see to the game. It's very expensive. Though nothing new for an mmo, it is a pretty heavy financial commitment compared to most other steam games out there. Especially considering you can get Tera, Mabinogi, and loads of other mmos for free now. You can buy gametime online from other sellers for a bit cheaper but it's still expensive. I suggest playing the trial to give you a better understanding of whether you'll enjoy it. I highly suggest it and will be playing it, but I can appreciate that a few years ago I could never afford to play a game like this.\n\nConclusion\n\nI honestly think this is the first mmo to seriously impress me with its ability to keep you interested. It doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it leave you with nothing to do. Bosses are often really cool and have interesting mechanics, even from an early point in the game. I really do feel that besides the price this game is practically perfect. It's a great game - buy it if you can.","January 19, 2015","true","491.2"," 282 of 308 people (92%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","92","282","308","19","16"

The servers were terrible, payments were unfair and confusing, and the game just made it so difficult for you to enjoy. Square Enix realised, "holy hell, this is bad" and revamped the game, leading to the release of A Realm Reborn. And boy did they do good.\n\nA Realm Reborn is not only a more polished FF XIV, it is a new game. It offers so much more than the original. Better service, better gameplay, more engrossing quests, everything an MMO can offer is in this game. A Realm Reborn is by far the best Final Fantasy of the last console generation, and it is perhaps the best FF I have ever played. It stays true to it's roots, but still manages to not be a total copy cat of previous FF games. It borrows alot from the orginal series, when Final Fantasy was at it's best, but adds a sense of freshness so that FF new-comers could pick up the game and play it as their first FF and still have a wonderful experience.\n\nDetail is where this game excells. The amount of effort into making this as refined as possible is staggering. You could honestly sit at the character creation screen for an hour, picking the tiniest things about your hero. The environments are fantastic, and it's hard to believe that an MMO looks this good.\n\nAs well as being the best Final Fantasy in years, it is also groundbreaking in the MMO genre. It offers so much to the genre as a whole, it has made a name for it's self as one of the greatest MMOs in recent years. It is addicting. It is enchanting. It is simply bliss.\n\nSquare Enix have really made me regain my faith in them, and I hope that they let future Final Fantasies learn from A Realm Reborn. I cannot wait until more content is added into the game, and clock in a few more hours. Get yourself this game now, even just for the free trial, it's worth it. Even if you're a hardcore FF fan, or a newcomer looking for a game to start with. This is the one.\n\n+ Essentially has it all. Near enough limitless gameplay hours\n\n+ Environments look stunning, attention to detail is incredible\n\n+ Smooth gameplay, easy to learn mechanics\n\n+ Makes great homage to previous Final Fantasy games\n\n- A lot of fetch quests\n\n- Occasional bug here and there\n\n10/10.

Initially it came out, just as Final Fantasy XIV, on the 22nd of September 2010. Unfortunately, it was absolutely terrible, and is still regarded as one of the worst MMO's in recent years, if not ever. The UI was particularly bad, but the problems were pretty much onmipresent. Graphcis were gorgeous but ridiculously unoptimised, bad gameplay mechanics, etc. However! This is NOT that game! I can't stress this enough!\n\nIn December 2010, Naoki Yoshida was brought in as the new Director and producer, to try and make the game better. While some of these changes did start to make the game more playable, Square Enix, feeling (rightly so, some would say) very ashamed about this initial release (which I will call 1.0 from now on), and also worried about the damage it would do to the Final Fantasy brand, deciced to close down this game and completely rebuild it from the ground up. The servers for 1.0 closed on November the 11th 2012.\n\nThe rerelease, called A Realm Reborn (the current game!), launched on August 27th 2013, with a PS3 version coming out on the same day. With the transition to the new game, Square implemented lots of cool in game lore explanations for the upcoming dramatic changes, and it is now a part of the game's story (which I think is really cool).\n\nARR is a fantastic MMO in nearly every aspect. It does, of course, have it's problems, but I have yet to find an MMO which doesn't (not even WoW). I have been playing MMO's since Everquest, and would say ARR is now my favourite of them all, from WoW to EQ to SWTOR to EVE, etc. I feel they have gotten the formula just right.\n\nFor the purchase on Steam you get the game itself, along with a month of playtime, so I would definitely recommend this if you think it might be for you (there is also a trial on the Square Enix website, but this would mean you don't have to reinstall if youstick with it!).\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it follows what I think would be fairly described as a rough following of the Western style MMO formula, with some key differences:\n\n- Classes are not "one-per-character". On your character you can switch between and unlock every single combat, gathering and crafting class within the game, and even use some of the skills you have unlocked cross-class. It's actively encouraged to do this, and having more than one character is not really of any use, unless you just wish to have characters of different races, or something like that.\n\n- Great matchmaking system for instanced content, all instanced content can be tackled using player made groups, or with the ingame matchmaking. It has (for me at least) always been efficient and works well to build groups for all content that needs it.\n\n- Levelling feels reasonably varied. There are lots of different ways to level, from simple mob grinding (not recommended!), Main Story Quests, side quests, Levequests (repeatable minor tasks), dungeons, exploring, FATE's (random area specific objectives), etc. If you start to feel tired of levelling your "main" class, you can switch and level some of your crafting classes, or a different combat one, etc.\n\n- Storyline makes the game feel like a true Final Fantasy game, the Main Story Quests (of which there are many) contain the games main story (although there are plenty of side stories within the games guilds, etc), which, without giving any spoilers, is very enjoyable and definitely held my interest far more than anything like this in any MMO's I have seen, with the exception of maybe SWTOR. Definitely feels like a more story oriented game, which I love. I feel your character has a much more grounded place in the game world!\n\n- Combat, combat is somewhat similar to WoW in the most basic sense, abilities come on a bar, and are used in whichever way you want to fight enemies, heal allies, etc. The global tick rate (global cooldown) is longer than WoW, so if you are used to WoW, you might find it a bit slow to begin with. The abilites in game feel varied and are unlocked at a steady rate, letting you get slowly used to the class you play until you reach endgame.\n\n- UI, the UI is reasonably good. It provides all of the information you need, but is probably the one point I feel needs the most work. Once you get used to it, it's completely fine, but can be a bit confusing to begin with. It can sometimes feel like there are a lot of menus to click through, but the improvement from 1.0 is so huge, and it does do the job, that I feel it can be overlooked a bit.\n\n- Game World, the world is beautiful and full of diverse environment. The world is very large, and definitely worth exploring. One issue, is that (mainly at least) because the game is currently supported on PS3 (though this may change in the future), a lot of the world is accessed through loading screens. If you are expecting a WoW-esque free world with no loading screens, you may be dissapointed. To me, it's not a massive deal, but I know for some it could be a problem. The loading screens are not long and I don't feel it detracts much from the overall experience. It is also something that has been mentioned by the devs which could change in the future. For me, the quality of the world is enough to let me look past this problem, but for you it may be different.\n\n- Crafting/Gathering, for me, ARR has one of the best crafting systems I have seen in an MMO. Crafting is done with individual classes representing the different professions, for example Armorsmithing, Cooking, Leatherworking, etc. Gathering is done in a similar fashion with regard to classes, Miner, Botanist and Fisher. The crafting system is very satisying, useful to the actual game experience (not just a money sink, or waste of time), and very complex at the higher levels, with apporpriate levels of reward! The crafting and gathering classes can all be acquired, just like the combat classes, making for a character which is very diverse and can (technically, if you have enough time!) do everything in the game without the need for alts.\n\n- Updates, the game recieves frequent, and large updates. There have been big chunks of content added on a regular schedule, which I would say, puts other MMO's, especially WoW, to shame. The updates come frequently and add lots of content, making it worth the monthly fee, and meaning you never run out of things to do.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 9/10. I think that with a few improvements to the UI and world loading, aswell as minor things like balancing, this could easily be the best MMO that currently exists, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre. If you ever decide to play and need a friend, just PM me on Steam and I can help you in game!","June 28, 2015","true","377.1"," 123 of 127 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","123","127","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/recommended/39210/","Thomas-","Chargeback Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/","748 products in account","Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG. The rebooted/revamped version of the atrocious Final Fantasy XIV, and the 100th billionth game in the Final Fantasy franchise.\n\nFFXIV:ARR is much like what WoW used to be when WoW was good. They took much of what made WoW great back in vanilla/The Burning Crusade and used it to shape FFXIV:ARR, adding a modern touch on top.\n\nAfter the failure of Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix got rid of most of the development team and learnt from their mistakes. What they've ended up with is an amazing MMO with tons of content and fine details to keep you playing for months.\n\nThe game offers a unique class system much like FFXI, where you're free to change your class at any time you wish, by simply changing your weapon to that of the class you wish to equip. There's 9 classes to choose from, with each playing a different role: tanks, healers, and DPS's. Each of these classes later turn into jobs, offering more abilities for you to gain and unlock. There's also 8 crafting classes, and 3 gathering classes available.\n\nThe game is filled with various dungeons, raids, and trials which are essentially boss fights.\n\nMany MMOs lack true end game content, however FFXIV:ARR is mostly focused on end game content. Many consider the game to not start until you reach level 50 (which takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how you play and how often you play). The game offers many dungeons for leveling, and even more for late game. Many of which are harder versions of leveling dungeons. On top of this, there's multiple raids ranging from your traditional raids with many players (24 in this case), or smaller 8 player raids. Finally, for those who love boss fights there's plenty of trials to keep you entertained. These are mostly primal fights with varying levels of difficulty.\n\nThere's tons of gear in the game each offering unique looks, allowing for huge amounts of customisation. In terms of character customisation, there’s quite a few options for you to choose from. There’s 5 different races, with each offering two sub-races of sorts. For example, your traditional “human” race has both midlanders and highlanders. The game does not offer sliders for things such as eye shape, nose shape, etc., but instead has four different types for you to select, with each sub-race having a different selection. As well as this, there’s plenty of hairstyles for you to choose from, with a wide range of colours to select as well as a highlight colour.\n\nThe game’s OST is absolutely amazing, and possibly one of the best I’ve ever heard in a game. There’s tons of tracks with unique songs for each field location, dungeon, trial, raid, and everything else.  I highly recommend checking it out, even if you do not purchase the game.\nThe game is updated every couple of months adding more items, dungeons, primal fights, new music, and much more. So there’s always plenty to do.\n\nFFXIV:ARR is subscription based. You can pay $12/month for 1 character per world, with a maximum of 8 characters. Or you can pay $15/month for 8 characters per world, with a maximum of 42 characters. Though with the way classes work, you won’t be needing more than a single character usually, so the limit is hardly an issue. Some people are turned off by subscription fees, however $12/month is a small price to pay for such a great game, which constantly gets more content. The lack of F2P or B2P also prevents P2W aspects, and usually means the community is better in general.\n\nOverall, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn has to be the best MMORPG I’ve ever played. The sheer amount of content has kept me hooked for over 400 hours, and will continue to do so as the months go on. If you’re looking for a great MMORPG to play, and have the money to invest, I could not recommend this more.\n","February 20, 2015","true","940.1"," 125 of 137 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","125","137","11","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberstag/recommended/39210/","cyberstag","PUNKGEON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberstag/","53 products in account","「 Impossible is a word coined by the weak. 」\n(Alright, time to give this review an overhaul now that I've officially given this game 1000 hours of my life. Just gonna add in some extra tidbits here and there.)\n\nFFXIV has easily become my favorite MMO. Easily. And it's weird, because I just sort of downloaded it like, (shrug) yeah, I'll check it out, why not. But then after a while, I realized, 'Holy ♥♥♥♥, I'm having SO much fun.' The thing is, I've never viewed Final Fantasy as an MMO sort of game. It was always the main console games for me (FFVII, FFVIII, FFIX, etc.). So FFXIV, and FFXI for that matter, was never something I even looked at or took interest in. But hey, now I'm a full-fledged passenger aboard the FF MMO hype train.\n\nI really don't even know where to start with this review. A part of me just wants to go EVERYTHING IS AWESOME THIS IS AWESOME AND THAT IS AWESOME AND IT'S ALL SPECTACTULAR. A+ review. I don't really think I'll be able to cover everything I want to, but I'm gonna take a shot at (some of) it:\n\nStay awhile and listen (!!)\nWhenever I think MMO, I think, half-♥♥♥♥♥ basic story. And that's fine, because it's all about the gameplay and getting the gear and doing the dungeons and getting your rake so you can go farming. And whenever I think Final Fantasy, I think, five-star story that will leave you with great memories for years and years to come.\n\nFFXIV actually has a good story to it. And I got pumped for it when I saw that opening cutscene, a scene that I still watch over and over from time to time. Now, the story isn't out of this world, but I did enjoy it a lot. Everything built up to make the end boss much more satisfying. And there were cutscenes. Tons of cutscenes. So many. Which can be good or bad depending on the person obviously. I appreciated it, and it did immerse me into the story more.\n\nEdit: And now that I have gotten much farther in the story and, again, have spent 1000 hours of my life with it, I can say now that I absolutely love the story in this game. I mean, the story was good in 2.X (and got real ♥♥♥♥ing crazy around 2.55), but with Heavensward (3.0), I just sort of realized how much I love these characters, I love the story that's going on, and I care. I HAVE CRIED REAL TEARS MULTIPLE TIMES. I have gotten angry, I have been shocked, I have felt many emotions through the course of this game. Other games I'm like cool, cool, cool, let's get on to the fighting. Here, I will shush the ♥♥♥♥ out of anyone who won't let me finish my cutscene. Like a good mini-movie ayyyyy.\n\nEye Candy (!!)\nIn the manner of my kobold friends, this game is gorgeous, stunning, beautiful! I mean really, I'm not even sure how to phrase how much I appreciate the graphics in this game. I think I was killing this buffalo type creature the other day, and the sun was rising (Yes, there is a weather/day/night cycle system. Yeah, it's awesome.), and you know when the sun is shining in someone's eyes and you can see just how pretty their eye color is? Yeah, well I thought this buffalo looked sweet as ♥♥♥♥ in the sunlight. So that, but transfer it to every single zone and x100 because I can view the zones during night/day/dusk/dawn/etc. Also, the newest zones for the 3.0 expac are gorgeous, except now I can just stare at all the beauty while flying and listening to the banging music and ijustlovethisgame. And I still don't think I expressed how much everything pierces my soul. I can't guys, just. Max settings 4 lyf suck ittttt~~~~\n\n\nC-c-c-combo breaker (!!)\nCombat to me is great. I have never played a tab-target mmo before, so the entire system was new to me. I came from a somewhat action-combat oriented MMO, but I find myself really enjoying the combat here. However, in the beginning levels, it is a little lackluster. You don't have as many abilities open to you though, so obviously you're gonna be restricted to your basic 1-2 combo over and over (sometimes even less depending on the class).\n\nAside from just talking about combat in itself, there are an array of dungeons and trials to do. 4-man, 8-man, 24-man parties all there. There are roughly around 90 (I'm including all the different difficultly levels plus counting floors/turns as their own) dungeons/trials/raids so far. Some trials have a normal, hard, and extreme version, and some dungeons have a hard version as well (although the hard versions are completely different from the normal version, so it's a whole new dungeon in itself. Nice move SE /proudofyouthx). The mechanics for a lot of these are super fun to me, although a bit daunting when you first start out. Some say it's like memorizing a dance with how crazy some fights get. I dig them, though. A lot. I find myself replaying a lot of the dungeons/trials just because the fight is amazing, not to farm gear or whatnot (finalfightof3.0imlookingatyou)\n\nThe dungeon/trail/raid private instances aren't just it though. There's still plenty going on in the open world, like FATEs and Hunts. Tons of people party up for those, granted you are in a pretty populated server.\n\nWe are Sex Bob-omb (!!)\nOkay. If you haven't heard already, the music in the game is pretty stellar. Go on any FFXIV boss fight youtube video and people will be raving about how sweet the music is. And it's true. The music, especially for the boss fights, gets you SO pumped (finalfightof3.0lookingatyouagain). It's the kind of music where you hear it as the battle starts and you're just like 'Awww man. ♥♥♥♥'s gonna be intense'.\n\nBut it's not just the boss fights (although those are what get the most attention). Just about anywhere you go has some nice music playing. And I actually notice it (!!). I say this because there's some music that blends in with the atmosphere, like in most movies/games/commercials/etc., which is great (and perfect for most scenarios), but then there's the music that jumps out at you. That just compells you to look it up on the internet later. And that's the kind of music that I dig. And FFXIV has plenty of that. The soundtrack for the Heavensward expansion couldn't come out any faster. I crave it.\n\nIt's just not my style (!!)\nSo aside from the aforementioned lackluster combat in the beginning of the game, I figured I should put the couple of things that aren't so nice about FFXIV.\n\nWhen you first play FFXIV, you may notice the lack of people talking in the chat. It makes the game feel dead, but it's really not (so far from it). Due to gold spammers (or so I hear), everyone just moved over to linkshells, which is basically custom channels. So join a linkshell and FC (guild), and your chat will be lively as normal. But that can be a turn-off to newcomers. Heavily populated cities (depending on your server) may have people talking in the shout/yell/say chat as normal though. Also, the newest 'lobby' area that came with the 3.0 expac is very lively in shout chat. Mostly because the gold spammers haven't reached us there yet hah hhahHAHAH HA.\n\nThat brings me to gold spammers. Depending on the server you choose, you may not get that many gold spammers, or you may get a hell of a lot. And they do PM you or spam the chat from time to time. But, again, this can be a turn-off for some players, especially since this is a subscription based MMO.\n\nCutscenes that occur during party events, but I won't get into that here (!!)\n(Chorus)(Outro)(Fade-out)\nI still left out a lot of the tidbits that I just absolutely love about the game, but alas, this totally short review will have to suffice. I surprisingly ended up loving this game, and you should check it out if it sounds like something you're even remotely interested in. I love it lots. Square Enix and Final Fantasy have (again) taken my soul hostage and I'm ok with that.","July 17, 2015","true","753.1"," 106 of 113 people (94%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","94","106","113","15","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aluraine/recommended/39210/","Aluraine","(ﾜ・ᴥ・) woof","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aluraine/","212 products in account","Overview:\n\nIncredibly polished and well endowed MMO. Almost every setting is tweakable and supports controllers as well, you get a game that offers you everything you payed for and witholds none of it.\n\nIt also uphold the name of Final Fantasy in good faith, probably a lot better than the newer FF games. The combat is a bit repetitive however, you've got a wealth of content to discover and quests that reward you well; dungeons from level 15 and up and lots of end-game content (but be prepared for hardcore type groups for the real end-game content, statics with schedules).\n\nPretty soon there's going to be an expansion and new classes so there's much more to look forward to as the game ages. The developer has done a great job at supporting the game thus far and I've seen no signs of them slowing down.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\nHere's my breakdown between the positives and negatives of FFXIV:RR.\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\n-------(Positive things)-------\n\n+ Good writing!\n\n+ Lots of content!\n\n+ The Hildibrand questline is the best questline in any MMO hands down.\n\n+ You've got lots of customization for your character / your HUD / and homes if you're rich enough.\n\n+ Generally a nice community for an MMO except for the occasional try-hard who gets unreasonably upset.\n\n\n\n------(Negative things)-------\n\n- This game is fetch quest hell, if you despise fetch quests more than anything then I do not recommend you play this game.\n\n- The journey from level 1 to level 50 isnt that exciting. (this pretty much goes for all MMOs)\n\n- RNG will occupy the vast majority of your end game time spent. Repeatedly run the same content over and over and over until you get that pretty blouse you wanted to glamour.\n\n- If you want to stick to 1 class for running content, the gameplay will get stale fairly fast, which isnt unique to FF, many MMO titles suffer from this. There's no traits or choice options to customize your fighting or spells, just flat stat increases that don't change the gameplay in any way other than just becoming stronger. (And your strength primarily comes from your gears item-level) You will be at level 50 with typically around 3 abilitys you need to use repeatedly for combat, and then 3 special situation skills to use in.. special situations and 2 super abilities you save for oh-♥♥♥♥ moments.\n\nThis varies between the classes but I played as a White Mage, so basically my job was to repeatedly hit the 2 button to cast cure, and then sometimes use a spell called Esuna to remove conditions from myself or others, and then cast an AOE that made HP regen (which you need to keep refreshing for the party once it wears off). This was not very fun to me, so you have to rely on the game to throw variety in the dungeons or enemies to spice things up.\n\nUsually it just boils down to memorizing boss mechanics and hoping nobody screws up. So essentially you're a bot following a strictly scripted fight and if you deviate from that you're most likely going to fail; This might be different for other people, but this is just how I felt after a while of doing end-game content.\n\n-------\n\nBut, feel free to give it a go yourself! There's a free 14 day trial for FFXIV, so don't let my opinions get in the way of a potentially good time when you could test drive it for yourself. As far as MMOs come and whats avaliable at the moment, I still recommend you give FF a try since it's one of the best subscription based MMOs out there right now. But this one just isnt for me.\n\n(I Still recommend it for MMO lovers!)","October 15, 2014","true","528.9"," 134 of 154 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","134","154","8","2"

If you are fan of Final Fantasy saga keep in mind one thing, this game have more of Final Fantasy than all of supposed games of the series before this since FFX&XI.\n\n+Graphics\nI'm absolutely delighted with the technical part of this game. I dont understand how all the Final Fantasy's on Steam are so horrible in performance and this one so awesome.\nA lot of graphic options, full customizable UI, support for multiple screens... Very nice job from Square Enix, It's very rare on pc.\n+Combat & Boss battles\nAt first time maybe the combat looks slow, easy and very simple but you are not going to feel the true difficulty of this game until you face a Primal in Hard Mode. Get your butt ready for die a lot and more if you do it with random people.\nThe battles with the main bosses are super epic, the music it's just wonderful and completely immerses you in the game. I can still hear my screams of the first time I killed Titan in Hard Mode after weeks of tries.\n+Classes\nThe possibility of have all the classes of the game in the same character is just awesome. I cant imagine playing other mmo with a lot of characters for different classes. I am too lazy just thinking about it...\nThe DPS classes are a little bit broken in difficulty and how much dps can do compared to others. This is the only "bad" thing I can say about them.\n+Story\nLike I said this game have more of "Final Fantasy" than some of previous games of the franchise. The lore is very cool and the main history really grabs you into the game. The way they linked the history before A Realm Reborn and the actual history is wondeful.\n+High End Content\nIf you like the pve and the raids you are going to enjoy so much this game. The entire high end content is oriented to this. The difficulty of the bosses at this point is very hard and if is not enough you have a "insane" mode for them and that is almost impossible.\n+Dubbing\nYou can choose the Japanese voices. YES! (。⌒∇⌒)。\n\n\n-Cinematics\nA lot of cinematics dont have sound so it's just text and click, click. Except the bosses intros, unfortunately all of them are boring.\n-Map\nI didn't played the 1.0 version of the game but I know how the map was and it can be resumed in "corridors everywhere". Now is a lot of better but even with that "remake" of the map it's still too small for a MMORPG. It's not a constant map and it's divided in zones with loading screens between them. This is very common in a lot of mmo's lately and it's a shame.\n-PVP\nIf you are looking for a MMORPG with good pvp and funny this is NOT YOUR GAME. This game is completly oriented to pve and the pvp it's just for get some cool armor skins.\n-Brayflox Longstop (Hard)\nI hate you Brayflox, I HATE YOU.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BakaOsaka/recommended/39210/","BakaOsaka","Osaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BakaOsaka/","622 products in account","Final Fantasy XIV is in a tight spot. Following the poorly-received Final Fantasy XIII and carrying on the legacy of Final Fantasy XI, it has a lot to live up to.\n\nAnd originally, it failed to live up to this. With 1.0, it had a lot of major issues including XP caps, lack of group activities and general bad design. This was a major problem that could've caused the death of the game.\n\nHowever, Square Enix did something different. Instead of following the generic "Make it Free-to-play" model, they set out on rebuilding the game. Almost completely scrapping the original game and rebuilding it from the ground up, they made a game that can serve as the true XIV that people wanted. This is A Realm Reborn.\n\nFollowing the failure of 1.0 and the implementation of ARR, Square Enix decided to keep the universe of 1.0 semi-canon, with ARR following on. Set 5 years after 1.0, there was a catastrophe that served to bridge the gap between the 1.0 world and the ARR world. With many features such as landmass, NPCs and areas staying almost identical to that in 1.0, the whole storyline is completely a new, almost sequel to XIV, with gameplay vastly improved and expanded to meet those of other modern MMOs.\n\nThe storyline, although generic, does follow the Final Fantasy formula of an evil Empire ruling over the world with an evil agenda, and you and your companions have to fight against them. With this, it is almost a retelling of Final Fantasy VI, with many story elements shared across the two universes, and this is strengthened in the expanded storyline with locations and characters having similar names.\n\nThe characters within the game are all pretty unique, although it does have it's own versions of "Biggs", "Wedge" and Cid". Each character in the world feels fleshed out, with most having their own questlines and stories separate from the main storyline. This serves to flesh out the universe and make you feel like you're in an actual world rather than a half-baked MMO.\n\nAlthough the storyline is a major aspect of the game, it does serve mainly to unlock additional content, although this is in no way a bad thing. The storyline quests give a good step on leveling up your first character, guiding you through the leveling process whilst not serving to hand-hold the player. Although it is easy to gain levels through quests, it would not be easy for a character to max out by simply completing quests.\n\nInstead, the game has a number of different ways to level up, mostly these are through group events.\n\nFirstly, one of the most commonly encountered events are FATEs. There can essentially appear anywhere in the field, outside of towns and other sanctuaries. FATEs have a simple objective, often something such as "Kill all of x enemy", "Kill x boss" or "Collect all of x". Usually they involve beating on enemies until the quota is met, which is pretty satisfying. These give the player additional XP and Gil. Mostly these FATEs are level-limited, so many higher-level players would not be inclined to do older FATEs or do them if they are max level, however this has been changed through late-game content that requires players to return to areas and perform in FATEs, meaning that they are available for everyone and serves to keep old content fresh.\n\nSecondly, are Leves. Similar to FATEs but for single player, you are assigned them in each town by a special NPC with a unique tasks such as "Kill x and collect their item" or "Plant an item at x". These are pretty fun to pass the time and have a number of benefits, similar to FATEs.\n\nFinally, the most common way of leveling up is through Duty Roulettes. Once a day, the player is given a boosted XP and Gil bonus by performing in the Duty Roulette. By choosing to do this, you are randomly assigned a party for a Duty, which can consist of a dungeon, a Trial (Boss fight) or Guildhest (Similar to FATE and Leves). These are unlocked as you progress through the story, and as it is random you can get assigned to any duty that you have previously unlocked. This means that a maxed player can get assigned to a level 20 dungeon. This ensures that the game is kept fresh and that new players can progress through lower level dungeons without the risk of there being no available players, which is also reinforced as an XP bonus is rewarded for all party members who participate with members who are new to that duty. As you progress, more and more duties are unlocked including high and extreme level, with their own rewards. In addition, once the player hits level 50, an additional reward becomes available as a substitute to the XP.\n\nI currently have 150 hours registered to Steam for this game, and have just completed the main storyline. There are countless other things that I must complete, as well as the content unlocked in the latest update coming soon. This will add large amounts content which serves to increase the playability for both high and low level players.\n\nSquare Enix are very good at announcing and presenting new content to the games, with regular livestreams showing off new content to keep up the hype. This builds good relations between both the players and the company. In addition, the moderation team of the game (GMs) I have heard are very helpful, and can resolve most issues. In addition, in the two times I have contacted Square Enix support I have received an adequate response within a few hours.\n\n\nIn all honesty, the game is great. Although it is different from other MMOs I have played, it does have a great playerbase who will help newcomers with any issues. I fully recommend this, even if it's only for the 30 day trial.","July 6, 2014","true","689.1"," 107 of 121 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","107","121","0","3"

This already starts with the story which is very long in my opinion. The atmosphere and the music are wonderful. Every detail in the game is lovely designed. There are so many possibilities in the game to kill time. For example, there are FATEs which are events where you must fight in groups against world bosses and other opponents. Even if you've reached max level, you can still enter old dungeons because your level gets capped and you can enjoy them with newer players. If you're bored with your current class, then you don't have to create a new character. Just change your weapon, and you can play as another class. I really like that idea since I don't like to have multiple characters.\n\nIf you're a Final Fantasy or MMORPG fan, then you should definitely give this title a try. It's one of the greatest MMORPG's in recent years.

If I try one, it usually captures my attention for a solid week, then I lose interest, uninstall it, and never play it again.\n\nThis game? Oh man oh man. This game is great. I've only ever played free MMO trash around the web, but this one is by far THE BEST MMO I have ever played.\n\nThe combat is like you should expect; if you've played any other MMO, it plays similarly to what you would expect out of an MMO. There are a variety of classes that you can choose from as your battlecraft classes and, the best part, you can have every class on one character. This is especially helpful when you're doing end-game raid stuffs. Form one team, and depending on what your team has leveled, you can form different groups with the same team.\n\nWhen I first started playing this game, as a low level I thought the gameplay was spectacular. Everything felt so fresh, and I felt like there was a bunch of things about the game I had yet to discover. Boy, was I right. Once I hit 50 (the max level for every class BEFORE Heavensward, which will increase that cap to 60), I felt like the game suddenly opened up to me. To this day, I still find that I have a LOT to do.\n\nIf you're looking for a great MMO to play and don't mind a monthly fee, look no further.

Classes are given very large kits and balance spamable abilites with complex rotations and cooldowns. Things are smiple enough to let casual players compete most content but exceptional players exceed and tackle the highest level raiding conent when it's released.\n-Large amounts of midcore content while still providing hardcore and casual content.\n-The learning curve while long is actually fairly short compared to most mainstream MMO I've played, and you are able to gain an understanding of things faster due to the ability to level/hotswap out different classes as you please.\n-Reasonbly diverse class list genrally offers a lot of different and unique playstyles.\n-The dev team is small, but very dedicated and seem to listen to fan feedback reasonably well and puts out major content updates every few months with smaller minor patches to hold everybody over.\n-A lot of stuff to do, and plenty of replayability.\n-Final Fantasy tier sound track is naturally beautiful.\n-You can have all classes on one character. Hotswapable, including crafting and gathering classes.\n-Fishing\n-Catgirls\n-The game is absolutely full of references to different things and amusing humor. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not. Either way they know what they are doing tears at your soul and they aren't sorry. I like to think of the Square Enix FFXIV dev team as Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies.\n-It comes with an actually good story, this is extremely rare these days in MMOs but it will destroy your heart.\n-Full cutscene/story replay feature for all those people who skip everything and want to figure out the story later.\n-It also comes with absurd amounts of side content that only exist to amuse you.\n-Everything is put together so nicely. One of it's best features overall is that it doesn't do anything badly.\n-Catgirls\n-Lots of in game events, probably about once a month or so there is some kind of seasonal event. During some seasonal events including Halloween, Christmas, Easter, Valentines Day, and many more they actually update massive portions of the game thematically. These may also give everything for aestetic gear to mounts.\n-Magnificently done atmosphere and fight design.\n-Lots of unique content in terms of fight/boss design. Some fights may have overlapping mechanics that were used in other fights but nearly all of the content feels completely different.\n-It is still very early in the game's life cycle. If it's anything like it's mother MMO, Final Fantasy XI, then we are close to a quarter done with thousands of hours of content already in the game.\n-Y'shtola\n\n\n\nCons:\n-The game is an MMO and can be grind heavy.\n-Some gear is gated behind time gates (ie only a few pieces of gear a week) and while this cap always gets removed after a while, it adds an unneeded wait for gear.\n-The difficulty spike can get a bit high at times when you are new to the game and running content for the first time without watching a proper guide.\n-Old content is reused a lot and that's ok to many because much of it is heavily replayable, but the way gear syncing (Limiting stats on gear that has outpaced older content) is done makes some old content far too easy due to stats not being synced low enough and making non-current content faceroll easy.\n-While the devs are actively trying to fix things, sometimes the ends don't justify the means with gear. The best example of this would be the relic weapon questline where you grind for gear comparable or better to the best raiding gear at the time, but the steps are meant to be a masochistic grind so it kinda fills it's own purpose.\n-On the North American servers excluding Gilgamesh and Balmung (Which are both often locked from character creation due to high population) have rampant amounts of RMT offers sent through private chat and not enough is done to combat it.\n-Crafting can often feel trivial in terms of actual combat gear, but as of 3.2, this issue seems to have been eliminated for the most part.\n-Much of the seasonal event gear is free if you attended the event, but is put in the cash shop after a long period of time downing the exclusivity of having experienced the event. This is more of a personal gripe.\n-There is a cash shop purely for visual items (Almost only special sets that were free at one time and a few other special items)\n-Dps que can occationally become unreasonable\n-The selling system/overflow storage system works off retainers, basically servants that you can customize. You are given two by default which is enough for many players, but they offer more (Up to six) for a small monthly fee. Very upsetting considering the game is purchased plus pay to play although extra retainers aren't that neccessary for most.\n-You will re-run old content a lot. While this keeps que times shorter for people trying to level alternate classes, it can be old after a while, but you are given many options for how you level.\n-Still no dedicated damage parsing feature implemented by the devs, but many parsing utilites do exist (Banned but ok normally as long as you don't talk about them in big public chats). This is only essential for end game raiding for the most part.\n-The game is still young (First expansion was less than a year ago) and the devs are still working on their proper flow, so occationally they will do some experimenting and ♥♥♥♥ stuff up, although they do normally fix things.\n\nA bit of a summary: This game really is great. Overall, having played many other MMOs, I think I've never found another that put everything you could want in a fantasy MMO together so fluidly. It's not that it's unique. If you are looking for some super never before seen gameplay then go be a loli with a giant axe in Tera or go warp into a gatecamp in Eve Online. This game's actual "Uniqueness" literally comes from how well everything is put together, not because it tried to change the key formula. Visually it is stunning. The music goes above and beyond what anybody could ever expect of an MMO and keeps on going. The atmosphere in fights is absolute insanity. I still get shivers when I think about how amazing some of the 8 man raids were. While some of the older content had been defamed due to the added "Unsynced" feature and the lack of proper gear syncing, much of it is extremely enjoyable to go back and play due to the nature of the game. Do not go into this game thinking you are going to be amazing fast. The lack of proper level syncing makes some of the early content too easy and it's unfortunate when new players get haymakered in the jaw because they weren't sufficiently prepared. This is being addressed by the dev team slowly, but it is still a problem that exists. If you can afford the monthly bill and want to ruin your life, then this game is absolutely worth getting.\n\nOverall rating: 11/10 I have a catgirl fetish now","February 24","true","284.7"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","95","56","59","14","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mountainsage/recommended/39210/","mountainsage","Punished Sage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mountainsage/","685 products in account","A breath of fresh air in the MMO scene, or rather, a reminder of what it was that made MMOs popular in the first place.\nWhat makes FFXIV:ARR so good, is not what it does have, but rather what it doesn't.\n\nGimmicks.\n\nEver since World of Warcraft became such a large player in the MMORPG scene, competitors have risen which attempt to dethrone it with new and "exciting" mechanics, but in doing so forget what an MMO even is.\n\nFFXIV:ARR learns from the mistakes of others and sticks to the known strengths of the genre. The holy trinity of Tank/DPS/Healer, Strong and challenging end-game content, deep storyline and world lore, an abundance of content to sink your time into along with major content patches every 2 and a half months.\nIt should be noted, that major content patches in FFXIV:ARR usually contain the same amount of content an expansion for WoW would contain at launch.\n\nYes, the game has a subscription model, but given the spetacular failures of numerous F2P and Cash Shop MMOs that have popped up over the years, combined with how this money is funneled into frequent and high quality updates to the game, is this really a bad thing? Honestly, it's well worth the money.\n\nHowever FFXIV:ARR doesn't just stick to old core values, it does so while breating new life into them that don't undermine their integrity. The holy trinity of MMOs is refered to as holy for a reason, to mess with it is to dance with certain doom. FFXIV:ARR conquers this perplexing problem regarding the need for re-interpretation without becoming gimmicky by altering the way experience works in the game.\nIn traditional MMOs, you make a character, you select your class and you start getting experience points. As you gain experience, your character levels up thus expanding your capabilities with your selected class, until you hit max level then you move to end-game content.\nXIV:ARR does away with character experience, instead replacing it with class experience. You have an active class, determined by the weapon you are wielding and any experience gained will go into the experience pool for your active class. You don't level your charcter, you level your class. For example, I'm currently a level 50 conjurer, specialising in the advanced healing class "White Mage" and I am also at the same time a level 18 Thauterage, the predecessor to the DPS class "Black Mage".\nThis doesn't make me some weird DPS/Healer hybrid, I can only be one at any one time. If I have a WHM weapon equipped, I'm a WHM and I have access to all the abilities of a WHM of my level and can equip gear for my class. I do not however have access to abilities for classes I have also leveled (except certain cross-class abilities which are sort of how this game does talents) nor can I equip gear meant for a Black mage while I have my white mage active. At the same time, when I switch to my black mage, it is as if I am a fresh character still leveling and only at level 18, the fact I have a class at max level does not affect my game play at all.\n\nThis is great since it allows for alts without having to give up your character, your identity, your friends, your guild etc, you have it all in one place, without ever undermining the holy trinity.\n\nFFXIV:ARR shows that it's possible to approach MMORPGs with a "Don't fix what isn't broken" philosophy without simply remaking yet another WoW.\n\nOn a final note? I pre-ordered the imperial edition for The Elder Scrolls Online, that set me back $75 USD, I did that before I started playing this and you know what? I've decided to just swallow that purchase and play this instead.\nIt's THAT good.\n\nSaying all that however, the game is certainly not without it's faults.\nFFXIV:ARR is a remake of the 2010 game FFXIV, which frankly? Was absolutely terrible.\nThe original game suffered from poor UI, poor world design, a dull and slow (Even by MMO standards) storyline and terrible optimisation leading to significant technical issues.\nThere is only so much you can do with this and this shows when we look at the current game world.\nThe current world is made up mainly of what was the original open game world which has had the massive bloat cut from it, the areas worth keeping turned into zones which are seperated by zone transitions.\nThese aren't instanced, which is good, but still it does break immersion a bit.\nThankfully, this isn't likely to be an endearing issue as developers have acknowledged the size of the world which though acceptable, could use a bit more to it and have said that we will be seeing significant increases to the world's size in major expansions (the first of which is expected in the second or third quarter of 2014).\n\nThere are also some key class types which are noticably absent from the game, for example the stealthy ambusher, (thief, rogue, ninja etc), however once again the developers have acknowledged this issue and said plans are in place to bring in new classes in future patches and expansions.\n\nTypically, I would count this as a major negative when forming my opinion on a game but I have been very impressed with how reliable Square-Enix are for following through on promises and fixing or introducing things where needed.\nSo I'm willing to take their "We are aware of this and we have plans in motion to meet these requests" in good faith, something I am VERY hesitant to extend to many if not most game developers these days.\n\nOverall?\nFFXIV:ARR is the equivilent of a miracle in gaming. Not only rescuing a title otherwise doomed to ridicule, but improving it to such an extent that it deserves a place in the genre's historybooks on account of it's merits.\nIt has it's issues sure, but nothing that comes close to being considered a major con against it's abundance of pros.\n\nI highly recommend buying this game, or at the very least, putting it onto a watch list and keeping a very close eye on it over the next few months to see just how well it is cared for for yourself.\n\nI'll give this an 8/10 :V\n\nTL;DR - This be some seriously good ♥♥♥♥, but it has some things that need attention. Buy it or keep an eye on it!","March 20, 2014","true","236.7"," 72 of 91 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","72","91","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tetolyz/recommended/39210/","Tetolyz","Tetolyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tetolyz/","48 products in account","I will recommend this game to anyone. My hours are increasing by the days that I play.\nThis game will steal your life and never make you want to go outside. Lol. Just kidding.\n\nPros:\n\nNO GENDERBIND. I love this, I can be all the classes without having to make a new character, I don't have to be a certain race to play all the classes. I do everything on one character and it's amazing like that.\n\nCrafting is awesome, Most crafting mmos are pretty straight foward. You get the materials, Boom done. That's not it works in FFXIV, In this game, You use your skills, get the materials and use your skills to make the material you're going for. It's like a little mini game to keep you interested. It's a very fun thing to do in game.\n\nCommunity: Omg, where do I start? All the mmos I have played. I immediately go solo, and do everything on my own unless I'm forced to party. This community is WONDERFUL. They're nice, and not rude at all. I've only experienced one rude person in my hours. The guilds are wonderful and want to help new players level up. I was afraid to join a guild but when I did. It was lovely. I was welcomed and offered help when I got stuck. Dungeons, you can't do them alone so having an amazing community is a good thing.\n\nStory: The story is literally the only reason why I got this game in the first place, but knowing what I know now. It's a great game all together. The story is engaging, interesting and definately is worth the sub. and with Heavensward. There's even more story now. So it's really worth it to enage fully in the story.\n\nEnd game: Past level 50, or past level 60. This is where this game jumps to the top of my list as Best MMos.\nSimply because. There's simply NEVER nothing to do. There's so many things to do, to keep you busy. Right when you hit 50. The game opens up even more, You can travel to new places. Fight harder dungeons and earn tombstones for amazing glamours.\n\n\nMusic/Scenery The soundtrack is amazing. I find myself listening to it most days when I'm on and taking in the beautiful graphics. When it rains. You can see your avatar wet, when it's windy. Your hair blows. It's very cool to me at least.\n\nRaces: Also, The races are awesome. You pick one race, then there's two more. Like Miqote. You can be a seeker or the sun or a keeper of the moon. Lots of things to pick from in characther creation. Amazing selections. Lots of hairstyles. Wide Variety of eyes, highlights for hairs and voices etc. It's very nice to have so much selection. ^_^\n\nCons: I only have a one con.\n\nGrinding can get repeative, you will have to multiple dungeons, and fight along the same monsters etc etc. That can get boring. But some dungeons are tricky so it's better if you know what you're doing.\n\n\nThis game is great. It's worth the sub and worth the extra money to get heavensward. I will continue to play it and tell people to jump into the wonderful world of Eorzea. :D","September 17, 2015","true","214.9"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","47","52","3","0"

Game play is smooth and although taking alittle time to really feel it gets started is enjoyable and encompasses ideas from many different MMO's.\n\nIn short if you have enjoyed any of the more polished subscription based MMO's of the past 10 years, e.g. WoW, Rift, DAoC then you will probably find this is well worth a look.","March 5, 2014","true","50.1"," 120 of 173 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","120","173","0","6"

All I do is READ them, but this game really caught my eye and I truly believe it deserves one.\nFinal Fantasy XIV has to be one of the most fun MMORPG's on the market to date. You jump right into the story and feel like you're listening to someone read a really well written book. It draws you in and makes you want to hear more and more with every passing hour.\nFirst off I would like to point out that Final Fantasy XIV has one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard in my entire gaming life. It fits really well with every location you reach, and the battle music is one that will bring back memories for all the Final Fantasy Vets who play .\nSecond, I would like to say that the graphics quality is out of this would for any MMO to date that I know of. it may only be DX9 but they gave thee game a full graphics overhaul. Playing on the lowest settings gives you STANDARD DEF CONSOLE graphics, but when you crank up the settings, BAM! you look close and every bit of clothing has texture, every shadow is perfectly cast, and the over all exicution is remarkable.\nFinally I would like to say that after over 200 hours of in game time, I have made many friends. The community is wonderful. I remember when I was about a level 14 White Mage, I was taking on a level 17 monster and I was low on health. Another Healer out of the blue healed me and a Black Mage helped me defete the enemy and gave me about 5000gil to buy better gear. Everyone playing this game seems to help one another as best they can whenever needed and that is probably the best part of it all.\n\nPersonal Rating for this game would be a 9/10 just because sometimes when you stop playing for about a week or two and come back to it, you may get confused on where to go and it leaves you to figure it all out. but other than that little disadvantage, I have to say that this is an all around perfect game. And the edition of multi class gaming on one character makes it stand out from all MMOS I have played.","October 13, 2014","true","450.1"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","47","56","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oowah/recommended/39210/","oowah","Ibuki Mioda ✎✐✎✐✎✐","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oowah/","338 products in account","Ibuki will start by saying she has been playing this gem since closed beta phase 2. Actual hours are close to 3,000 in game.\n\nIf you are new to this please disregard Balmung unless you want to be hit on by big black Rogs 24/7 while waiting for a queue to pop. Also Gilgamesh is for the elitists so Ibuki advises against this as well as it creates a bad experience for new players to get told how ♥♥♥♥ they are 24/7.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, enjoy your opening scene filled with you stuck in the back of a cart/ship on your way to one of Eorzea's city states, which you pick based on your starting class. Along the way, you are introduced to a bunch of nobodies who become sombodies and then nobodies again when all is said and done. If you feel attached to a particular character, get ready to hate them as soon as the voice acting starts (even japanese dub is bad). Luckily this was rectified somewhat in the HW expansion as beginning with the first quest all NPCs save for a few have new VAs' that are actually british instead of the Sam Riegel and Liam O Brian being hammered into your ear for 3/4ths of the story.\n\nWhen starting out at lvl 1 you will only have 1 skill to use in combat, as you level you'll get more and more skills and eventually your class will become very complex to manage, such as the case of Lancer to Dragoons. Once you get a feel for your class (around ilvl 200) and you've wiped to titans landslides or other easily avoidable AOEs and shouted "Lag" in the party chat at least 15 times, you will start to get the hang of prioritizing mechanics over moves. Being able to simultaneously DPS/Heal while a guy shouts THE EDGE IS CALLING TONIGHT and you're getting punched off the edge is truly an experience to behold.\n\nIf you are less combat focused and just want to fiddle the market with outdated gear so people have an excuse to use gil on something, then look no further then crafting. But unfortunately if you want to make any money off crafting you have to become an Omnicrafter which means getting every crafting class to 50 or 60 (if you like putting razer blades to your neck). The true end game for a crafter is crafting the newest glamour gear and selling them for millions of gil only to realize you have nothing worthwhile to buy and you go back to selling and making more of these things until a new patch comes out that does the same thing. With HW being an Omnicrafter is no longer necessary for the lvl 60 renditions however the new skills that were added in HW for crafters are just dumbed down versions of the other skills, which is bad. Gathering is also another avenue but theres no point in telling you about sitting for 2 hours trying to catch a fish with a green color instead of none.\n\nIbuki recommends this for the constant stream of content and the communication between the devs and the players despite being in different continents across the globe. This has problems atm but at least its not sitting there for almost 2 years with no new content added until the next expansion. As time has shown anything can be fixed in this game as long as Yoshi dedicates development towards it, which he is. My only complaints from 1.0 to ARR are the belts getting removed from the visual model of the character, Mi'qote asses being flattened out and lightning tiered for the sake of development costs, and the fact that when you turn around you instantly snap to ot the animation whereas 1.0 you actually turned around and moved realistically, also the cutscenes were far superior in 1.0.  However everything else was Brendan Fraisered.\n\nOink!\n\n\n","April 27","true","836.7"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","80","37","46","16","3"

Mostly consisting of the trap that ensnares a majority of the people in this game: jumping around your FC house aimlessly until something happens. (Oh wait, there's a revival in old content from 3.0 and before! Give me your poetics bonus, lets go clear Alexander Normal, I need to get my relic. Better get on the train while it lasts! Need a Coil carry/clear, hit up that party finder and tell em bout your bonus!)\n\nIt plays too safe, too limited and too strict, reducing player agency and planning to "Look up a guide and do it like that". It's not the thinking man's MMO, it's not the even the non-thinking man's MMO, it's the painfully generic experience with no risk/reward scenarios that retirees from World of Warcraft and the people that are new to an MMO love.\n\nPlayer interaction is at best non-existent to barely there, and this is including FC chat and any linkshells you might be in at the time. There's no reward for helping people, no sense of gratification, it's a nameless charity "spin the wheel" of dead content you don't want to do, but you do it for the tomes.\n\n(Less so the tomes now, with the new relic. It's spamming A1-4N runs like a hamster in a wheel to get a 10 item level increase for people who don't raid. Maybe i210 will encourage people to raid, or maybe it'll encourage them to reflect upon their misdeeds and hours of grinding. Thank you SE.)\n\nYou'd think, oh 1300 hours is a long time, you must've gotten your money's worth at this point, right?\n\nThe answer: No.\n\nPvP queues (which I signed up for to cap my weekly tomes than rather deal with the brain dead community post-launch) can take upwards of an hour, and games can last an hour as well. Chalk up 100 matches or so and a big chunk of my time was just waiting. Waiting is something you do in this game, quite frequently. Queues in general, if you were late to the party can be a rather thrilling alt-tab experience, in which you can enjoy the lovely scenery and music alongside shout chats filled with "INV PLS" or "check the party finder" (When hunts were semi-relevant again in 3.0 release, but now that's just dead. It's either memes or B rank daily hunt call outs, pick your poison.)\n\nSo I took up mining, and botany, and fishing. Crafting, leveling an alt class, and so on and so on, till I was sick of both that and the waiting I did between.\n\nMost of the time you play because of an obligation, whatever it maybe, and always hovers very close to peer pressure and addiction at times. Would I recommend this to people who never played an MMO in their life? Yes.\n\nIs it an MMO for those that loved XI or really any kind of MMO with social aspects to it's community? No. (Or want satisfying midcore content)\n\nDon't play this game with friends unless you don't want to be their friend for very much longer. (Or want to progression raid)\n\nEDIT: Look it's patch 3.1 soon to be 3.2. I was never much a fan of new content being trickled out at ridiculously slow pace. Truly this new raid tier will save XIV! Time will only tell if 4.0 will actually be good.","August 20, 2015","false","605.1"," 84 of 141 people (60%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","60","84","141","12","24"

FFXIV: ARR combines elements from RIFT, WoW, Guild Wars 2, and a whole host of MMOs to create a fabulous gestalt of MMO mechanics, one that offers more and more the further you go. While TOR is still my favorite MMO due to it's excellent storytelling, FFXIV is definitely my favorite MMO in terms of it's mechanics, though the story here is pretty good too. Set a few years after a fiery apocalypse destroyed the land of Eorzea, the world is just about getting back up on it's feet after the cataclysm. However, the warlike and expansive Garlean Empire has other plans, seeking to subdue the violent and destructive Primals that make their home in Eorzea: by any means necessary. While suffering from a lack of voice acting and an exceptionally slow start, the mysteries and questions of the FFXIV story are compelling enough that you want to see how it all turns out. Overall, while it doesn't have too many ideas of it's own, FFXIV's polish and quality are more than enough to compensate. Looking for the pinnacle of the hotkey based MMO?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/recommended/39210/","gamerlen","GamerLEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/","325 products in account","So, I've been around the MMO block more than a few times. World of Warcraft, Star Wars The Old Republic, The Secret World, Age of Conan, both D&D online games, Champions Online, D.C. Universe Online, Rift, and so on... but this one is definitely one of the better ones I've played.\n\nLemme put it this way. I've been a WoW player for the better part of eight years now. I recently picked up this game about midway through the WoW 6.1 content and started playing it right before Heavensward came out, then kept on going with my Miqo'te.\n\nSo how much have I gotten into this game this time around? When WoW came out with 6.2 -I didn't care-. New raid, new zone, new loot, new mounts, etc. I don't give a crap, I'm too busy going through Dravinia.\n\nPros:\n- A very strong and engaging story with good characters.\n- The ability to make one character, but swap between character classes post-creation. This is also used to get the upgraded versions of classes (i.e. Lv30 Thaumaturge + Lv15 Archer = Black Mage).\n- An in depth crafting system that is very addictive to work with.\n- The ability to have a chocobo partner who acts as both mount and fighting companion.\n- 22 Individual character classes/jobs based on the classic Final Fantasy job system.\n- 11 crafting and gathering classes for making equipment, potions, etc.\n- Five unique playable races with highly customizeable appearances and two main variants for each race. Six if you get the Heavensward expansion.\n\nCons:\n- Game will require you to grind via dungeons/levequests around the 40-50 stretch to continue the story (you will constantly run into the 'your level is not high enough to continue' issue).\n- You can't sell things in the Market/Auction House until around level 20, so making money early on is difficult.\n- You can only send mail to people on your friend's list, so you can't send mail between alts.\n","July 5, 2015","true","498.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

The whole game has a clear, crisp gameplay, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the game a big boost. It's been compared to Guild Wars 2, but I think FF14 has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.\nIn 2015, SquareEnix released this, Heavensward, their most recent expansion. I think their undisputed masterpiece is the fight against Ultima Weapon, a boss fight so enjoyable, most people probably don't dodge all of his abilities. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the developers themself.\nHey Paul!","February 10","true","254.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","100","9","9","10","1"

Combat is sharp, fluid, and the combos work well; especially when you're decently leveled and don't have peasant abilities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Axiluvia/recommended/39210/","Axiluvia","Axiluvia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Axiluvia/","95 products in account","I liked FF14: ARR up until the expansion.\n\nI've played a lot of MMOS (I think at least 30 now) and there are certain things I look for, and really enjoy an MMO having. It doesn't have to, but it gets a big plus in my book if it does. One having interesting and complicated enough mechanics that when you actually finish a boss for the first time, or a dungeon run, it feels like an achievement; that you had to work for it, but it was worth it. The second is having the ability to have different playstyles; the ability to tune your characters closer to how you want to play. The third is an engaging, interesting, and above all USEFUL crafting system.\n\nFF14 had 2 of the three; there's no skill trees at all, and not really any way to modify your gear; there's BiS and that's about it. You can do vanity gear over it though, so at least you can look different then every other player the same level as you. Still, the mechanics were awesome, I loved the music and a lot of the themes of the dungeon, and actually LOOKED FORWARD to gathering and crafting, because people LIKED getting HQ gear and useful items later.\n\nThe world was engaging to look around. The story was... well... decent for an FF game (I don't care for FF games in general myself, I played this because I liked it as an MMO). There was always plenty to do, plenty to collect, plenty to save for, etc.\n\nThat changed with the expansion. First off, the new maps are a horrid PAIN to get around. They made them HUGE with the intent that "It'll look cool when you fly around" and obviously did not give a damn about people who had to hoof it, trying to unlock flying.\n\nOh yeah, you have to hit random nodes and do random quests on the map (including main quest and side quest stuff) to be able to fly. PER NEW MAP. So by the time you unlock flying, you're probably going to be done with wanting to be ON the map.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty much mostly just ripped from other previous dungeons. One of the first new ones, Sohm Al, we recognized very easily as a 'weenie T6'. And to me, the music was just really boring...\n\nAs for the crafting part...\n\nApparently Yoshi P (one of the main developers, if not THE main one) has basically stated he hates the fact that crafters figured out how to make things better then dungeon drops. Oh, sorry that the ENTIRE WEEK one might put into making the HQ accesory and the MILLIONS of gil that you might dump into boosting it up to make it SLIGHTLY better bothers you SO MUCH that you basically made ALL crafting completely worthless.\n\nOkay, there's pretty much three reasons to craft in games: To make items a cheaper way then just buying them, to make items you actually want to use, and to make unique items you can't get anywhere else.\n\nSince quests just THROW high quality gear at players now, and there's NO POSSIBLE way to get the same TIER as dungeon drops, the only item adventurers would really use is food, and there's not really a market for seliing (level 55 gil for 500 gil on the marketboard!). And the only 'unique' items that are remotely worth making are vanity gear, housing items, and stuff for your mounts. Which makes the HUNDREDS of hours both in gathering and crafting completely not worth it, since almost all the housing items aren't that expensive.\n\nThere's a lot of other things to mention, but basically I felt they ruined the two main reasons I was playing this in the first place. They MIGHT fix it, but I've already been soured on the idea.","September 10, 2015","false","692.9"," 69 of 124 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","69","124","9","3"

For the rest of the week you can do the outdated primals, the Casual Tower raids, craft or the most popular non raiding activity, Erotic Role Playing. The armour is very varying, there's lots of fan service, and it's one of the best Final Fantasy games to come out in some time. You'll probably have fun with it leveling and gearing up at first, but after a while everything is the same and you don't get to do fun stuff as much as you probably would like to. After you gear everything up and realize you have no content to do with those alternate classes, you'll realize it's silly gearing anything outside of DOA primals or outdated farmable coil turns that everyone already got their loot from 4 months ago.

Modern MMOs seem to have devolved into a quick single player race to maximum level where there is no incentive to even read a quest log, before jumping onto the gear grinding treadmill and ultimately running out of things to do shortly afterwards.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn has finally changed that, this is the first MMO I have played in recent years which has an interesting, well written story line and actually forces you to complete multi player content in order to progress from time to time.  The crafting system in this game is also incredibly well thought out and rewarding, it is not simply a case of gathering a few materials and pressing a button instead you have to think carefully about strategies to craft each item.  The other thing that also grabbed me about this game was just how beautiful the world is, from the scenery to the chaaracters the game looks stunning and the soundtrack is also top notch.\n\nThe game isn't without its faults, one of the main issues at low level is the combat system has a very long GCD and until your character gets some extra skills which are off the GCD this can make combat seem very slow at first.  I think the developers should have introduced a few more 'off GCD' skills earler in the levelling process for some of the classes as this was my main gripe at low level.  That said it doesn't take too long before things start to improve and later on in the game once you have all your skills you can often find yourself wishing the GCD was a bit longer!\n\nOne last point worth mentioning is that the community seems to be great, obviously I can't generalise for everyone playing the game but I have found most people are very friendly and helpful.  This goes as much for people outside of your Free Company (guild) as those in it.  I have bumped into more random strangers who have offered to lend a helping hand and explain things in this game than any other I can remember.\n\nTo sum it up this is a great game that you can really immerse yourself in.  It has plenty of depth and everthing before maximum level seems tangible and enjoyable rather than something to grind through.  This means you can enjoy the journey rather than worrying about the destination.","November 12, 2015","true","472.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You never run out of stuff to do and there are countless ways to level up your classes and jobs, the very best part of the game to me is the story, the main story quests aren't filled with fetch this and slay this filler ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the story itself is genuinely interesting. Each and every dungeon has it's own mechanics which are both fun and mostly easy to get the hang of and the combat itself requires quite a bit of strategy especially in team-based instances. The one real "problem" I had with this game is starting out, trying to learn everything while taking your first steps into the massive world handed out to you can be really intimidating but learning the basics and getting a hold of what you're doing is well worth the hassle.\n\nThis may not be the most well-written review ever made, but hopefully some people give this game a chance!","February 9","true","279.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Theres a lot to offer for everyone.\nPros:\n---Beautiful design for all of the zones, cities, and dungeons.\n---Awesome sound track I actually enjoy hearing each unique dungeon theme (most of wow was played sound off)\n---Balanced (for the most part) PVP. This game did what WoW should have done since vanilla. Theres a separate level up     system for pvp that gives you specific skills used solely for that mode. It fixes the whole PVE vs PVP balance conundrum most MMOs face\n---THE FEAST: This is probably what saved it for me long term. Just release this past week was The Feast which is a competitive PVP mode with rankings. Matches here gave me more of a thrill here than playing in the 2.4k arena bracket in WoW\n---The ability to play whatever class you want on a single character. This function also allows you to bring in skills from other classes to further customize your playstyle\n---High quality and difficult end game content (unlike WoW, which has people farming the content within a week of release)\n---Great community\n\nCons:\n---People love the story but for me.... meh a lot of it was blah blah chosen one and tons of pointless fetch quests (like really homie i just saved the kingdom now i have to fetch water for 3 privates?)\n---UPDATED: PVP was originally dead however theres been a resurgence with a competetive pvp arena mode added with seasons (as said above).\n---Lack of Battleground diversity (However this is slowly and allegedly being addressed by producers)\n---This game forces you to choke down 15-20 hours worth of dead level 50 content in order to even unlock the expansion pack\n","March 13","true","028.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

IMO it's worth it\n\nThe only other MMO I've played seriously was GW2 and with over a thousand hours in that game, I had to let it go. I couldn't find the energy to play anymore and so I went looking for another MMO. I had played a little of FFXIV right before the expac released but the daunting task of completing the story drove me back to GW2. Once again got sick of GW2 and resubbed to FFXIV. I've sunk so much time in this game, this past week alone, that I don't know why I dropped the game a year ago.\n\nThe story is good and lvling is fast if you follow the story missions and do the fates in between. Lvling the other classes after the first is super easy because you get extra exp because of your higher lvl class. The dungeons are fun and engaging. The comunity so far, has been nice for helping me through some of the rougher content. All in all I think it's worth your time to check out\n","May 6","true","231.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Like, I thought this was worse than Dead Island skeptic.\n\nSquare-Enix's track record has been far from amazing in terms of Final Fantasy titles as of late. Final Fantasy XIII almost cemented my lack of trust in them, and watching the disaster that was XIV 1.0, I just stopped keeping track altogether. They'd lost their magic much harder than I could imagine.\n\nThis game is lucky I knew someone else who was into A Realm Reborn. At first, I had to laugh at the fact he was still paying for a lousy, broken, boring MMO, but then I started watching. I hadn't realised XIV had ended it's world and restarted again, and I was confused when I found the game to be a lot more interesting than I remember. It shut me the hell up.\n\nI decided to dive into this head first, give it a shot, see if it would be something I could get into. After all, I knew people playing it already, it would be a party based activity, something I haven't done in a while.\nBut as you can tell by the amount of hours currently sunk into it, I didn't really need to know anyone prior.\n\nThis game sunk it's teeth in. Hard.\n\nI'm not someone that comes from a massive MMO background. The last one I had played and gotten into was almost 10 years ago. It would be difficult to know if I could recommend this game over other MMOs, or even other games. Although you would probably do this anyway, I recommend looking at gameplay footage and deciding for yourself. I can personally say I've had more fun with this than I was expecting, and keep coming back.\n\nCommunity is pretty good (on Cerberus anyway, and from what I've found from watching other players). Yes, there are a few bad eggs, but considering the MMO and other online games I've come from, this isn't a problem. Every community will have the ragequitters, the griefers and the thieves, but they are so scarce. PvP is probably the main place you'll find these people, if at all.\n\nThere are a handful of nitpicks, most of them are rather minor, such as the voice acting at points sucking the emotion out of a moment, usually in a single word (this seems to be a SE staple(seriously stop hiring the worst actors to play big roles)) and the HUD does not scale with windowed mode, so it's very easy, if you're running a smaller window, for your screen to get cramped with icons, even if you do shrink them down. But they are nitpicks, nothing that stops the game for me at all.\n\nAll I can say is, there is a large chunk of time that I have sunk into it and I do not regret it*.\n\n*okay I regret it a little. I could've been saving the world or learning to speedrun a game or something else with the time I've spent on this.","September 10, 2014","true","330.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Callback/recommended/39210/","Callback","Callback","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Callback/","364 products in account","Tried this game at a friend's behest.  First impressions were nice.  The game is true to its Final Fantasy heritage, and provides the atmosphere you would expect from any FF title.  Graphics were great by MMO standards, but not really up to what you would expect from a current single player Square Enix game.  It sets up a nice story, tho the cutscenes all use in-game models and feel poorly acted/animated.  Overall the mood the game creates is a good one, and one I would enjoy playing in.\n\nThat is, if the gameplay itself were at all enjoyable.\n\nAs soon as I got into the combat, I immediately groaned.  It's WoW.  The game sticks to the most basic overdone combat system possible.  Target a thing.  Press your skill keys in rotation to damage it.  It starts autoattacking you.  You take damage from that.  You step outside the AoE markers to avoid taking any extra.  Eventually, one of you dies.  Repeat ad infinitum.  Dungeons follow the same formula too.  Tank soaks aggro because autoattacks are unavoidable, healer mitigates that incoming damage, everyone else kills the stuff that's focusing the tank.  Pull a wave, do that.  Pull another, do that.  Reach the boss, do that with a few extra distractions you need to run and deal with in between hitting it.\n\nI wanted to love this game, but sticking in the most samey, widely cloned MMO combat system just leaves it lumped right in the same group as 90% of other MMOs out there.  Why?  They're capable of being innovative.  They could have just as easily made it into a XII-style open-world exploration into menu-based RPG encounters smooth transition, with options to allow nearby players to join in on the players' side and assist.  They could have done a lot of things.  They did not.  Instead, they stuck to the most basic formula possible.\n\nOh, and keep in mind it IS subscription based, tho they DO offer a discount if you limit yourself to 1 character (and since you can freely change between all the classes I see no reason for needing alts).\n\n\nSo my final score:\n\nAtmosphere: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 7/10\n\nGameplay: WoW/10\n\nSubstitute in your own number for that based on how much you personally enjoy WoW-style combat.  For me it's a 1/10 on that, and since combat makes up a majority of the gameplay, whether hunting for levels, killing for quests, running a dungeon or raid, if you can't love the combat you can't love the game. I would maybe return to this for the sake of just hanging out with my friends if it were free to play, but I refuse to spend another penny on a game that cannot keep me entertained during the majority of its gameplay.\n\nIf you enjoy WoW and all of its clones, I do highly recommend this game to you.  If you're like me and are bored to tears of the same system being duplicated over and over for over a decade, stay away.","June 25, 2014","false","468.7"," 248 of 471 people (53%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","53","248","471","10","35"

I did not find it too uncomfortable when I do my raids and trials, so I would say that system is actually not that bad.\nThe choice on different jobs on one single character is really good system. I've been so tired to lvl again and do the main story again and again to get a new job. Although the lvling for jobs after the first job is really painful, I prefer that than watch the same story again and again.\nThe gathering and crafting for me, is the best design in this game. I am not a hardcore player, so when I feel tired on doing my raids, I usually just go fishing or something else. It left the choice for player not only to fight, but somehow live in this game world. Furthermore, the Gold Saucer is also another way to take a rest. I think ff14 really provide player anothe world to live in, not only a tons of boss to kill.\nI do not pvp a lot, and I never liked pvp before, so I cannot tell anything about the pvp system.\nAt last, my grading for this game is 95/100, I hope you would give this game a try after read my review. :)","February 8, 2015","true","694.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"

I run a i7 4790K and a GTX 970 with 16gb Ram. Not only can I run this game in 1080p maxed out at 60fps, I can also stream it with those same settings at a 3.5 bitrate, and my computer doesn't cripple in performance.\n\nIt has quite a variety. Final Fantasy XIV boasts multiple classes you can pick from. A wide diversity, that is simplified for dungeon play into 3 categories: Healer, DPS, and Tank. Players will be required to form parties with the minimal 1x Healer, 2x DPS, and 1x Tank. You can't just run in a dungeon and expect to solo the entire thing, you need your party members.\n\nThe only downside to this game is, you need friends. So you better know people who are already in the game to join, or go alone and make friends on your own. If you don't have anyone to play with, I can't really justify the monthly subscription fee of $13~15.\n\nMe?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pizzawarden/recommended/39210/","pizzawarden","Ultimatum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pizzawarden/","5 products in account","CuteFish Review: Longish review, pro/con list, closing thoughts. Just skip ahead if you don't like reading! :3\n\nFFXIV: A Realm Reborn is a game that aimed to polish and refine the 'WoW-era' MMO instead of hamfisting in a slightly different spin of the genre. A story based leveling system (at first) that leads into a content rich MMO that has appeal to, quite literraly, any form of player who likes the genre. Very challenging group-based endgame PvE, good PvP, and an abundance of 'things to do' that makes for a very gratifying time sink.\n\nAesthetically, the game has a clean look similar to the other current-gen Final Fantasy games. It runs rather well on my machine and pretty decently on lower end machines, but it's definitely an art style that loses quite a lot of its charm when you start setting graphical settings to 'low'.\n\nThe combat system is the standard tab-targetting most of us are likely accustumed to but actually at a slower pace. The game has a 2.5 second global cooldown between abilities. Early on, this feels incredibly slow (because it is) but later on it feels much more meticulous since each ability use is quite a time commitment. I feel much more weight to use the 'right' ability than any other MMO I've ever played, and a big part of using the 'right' ability lies in understanding the fight. This makes the game far less 'go through your rotation based' and just thought-provoking enough to make you forget you're even waiting 2.5 seconds between spells and it's wonderful.\n\nThe game has a unique system in which 100% of the content the game contains can be completed on one single character. Every class, job, craft, quest, etc can be completed on one character to the point where there is genuinelly no practical reason to ever make a second. This makes for a unique attachment to that one special character who will likely be with you from beginning to end. All classes (including crafts) can be changed at a whim (outside of dungeons and PvP) by simply changing your weapon. You're given a bonus 25 slots per gear slot to hold every single piece and an easy 'gear set' system to quickly swap between entire sets of gear for your variety of classes.\n\nFFXIV has a pretty decent story with likeable characters and hit-or-miss voice acting. The only major complaint is how you're supposed to be the 'hero of light'... along with all the other thousands of players on your server. Even looking past that, it delivers a classical Final Fantasy adventure that hits all the right notes possible in the MMO setting.\n\nLeveling is rather easy and straightforward; but at the same time allows for an impressive amount of freedom in how you want to go about it at all. Your first class/job will primarily follow the main story line supplemented by FATEs (randomly spawned group content in the world) and dungeon queues to level at a solid pace. The pacing was excellent and was a rather mild curve in the time between levels as you progress. Part of what makes leveling great is that after progressing a little bit into the game you gain access to 'Duty Roulette', which allows you to queue for a random dungeon and upon completetion, receive a tremendous surge in xp on top of the already solid dungeon xp. This allows people on time restraints to level at a very reasonable pace as all you really need is about 35 minutes. After having one max level class, all future classes gain +100% xp to almos everything, partly because they dont get the main story and partly to speed you along.\n\nThis is an MMO with a definite PvE focus, as the dungeons are execellently crafted progression of difficulty from the start to the end. A complaint does lie in the first set of dungeons aquired very early on as they were very devoid of mechanics and give a bad impression of future content. Lategame PvE offers a multitude of challenge tiers to accomadate what you as a player are looking to do. Duty Finder raids, unlike other MMO counterparts, don't offer an easy mode, and its nice to see the game respect the playerbase by demanding a minimum skill requirement to start getting your hands on decent gear pieces.\n\nA special mention should go out to this games crafting system. While earlier I mentioned this game has a strong sense of polish to the genre, this area was given a revamp compared to virtually every other MMO with a focus of creating depth, choices, strategy, and a purpose. The crafts are actually classes with their own gear avaiable to them to boast the crafting potentional. Every craft class has their unique spells used during the hard-to-describe act of actually crafting, which plays almost like a classical turn based game balancing many factors such as the progress towards actually finishing the item vs the actual quality of it, among other factors. Craft classes also have certain abilities that benefit other crafts, encouraging you to do them all even if you only really want to use one. Honestly if you've ever wanted to go hard on some crafts, this is DEFINITELY the game to do it.\n\nOn a final note, this game has the best soundtrack and the most cinematic, epic bosses in any MMO I've played. I genuinelly don't want to really spoil any of by showing you, but it's pretty freaking great.\n\nPros\n+ Single-character system builds strong bond with your player character.\n+ Content that will appeal to any audience that already likes the MMO genre, and many newcomers (are there still any?)\n+ Combat that requires some actual mental usage regarding what abilities you're using.\n+ Best MMO on a console (but you're reading this on steam...)\n+ Great story that blends into the game almost seamlessely.\n+ Heavily teamwork-based group PvE content.\n+ The content updates are HUGE. The latest one (3.2) required a hefty time investment just to read through all the patch notes.\n+ Heavy timesink game based around progressing the overall state of your character rather than locking you behind time/grindgates. Always something to do~\n+ Most fun I've had crafting in an MMO to date.\n+ Amazing soundtrack that makes bosses feel larger than life. Many bosses have multiple songs, with one even having 5 whole songs. FIVE SONGS!\n+ System in place to help new players learn the game, from decent tutorials to a whole network of matching new players with highly experienced ones for guidance.\n+ Amazing community from my personal experience.\n\nCons\n- There's a large divide between emptier and fuller servers. Definitely do your research before commiting to a server.\n- Early game dungeons are pretty awful.\n- Endgame gear/stat choices for each job is very linear. This is lessened since you can play all 13 classes on 1 character.\n- The gathering classes are really runescape-y in their grind... but I mean theres not much you can do with collecting rocks.\n- Some of the voice acting in English sucks. Some of it is pretty great. But mostly mediocre.\n- When you reach level 50 theres a 100 quest slog to get through before you can start the Heavensward (50->60 content.) It's pretty rough, not gonna lie. At least you only have to do it on one character!\n\nClosing thoughts: This game is epitome of taking the fundamentals of a game type and making them perfect. If you're feeling a little burned out by games like WoW or any of its plentiful clones, it may be time to give FFXIV a whirl. If you're just looking for a really comfy game to play and always have stuff to do when you log on, this game is great for that. If you want that classic hardcore PvE content found in the earlier days of WoW, this game delivers on that front too!\n\nOverall rating: 9/10","February 26","true","730.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

This game is about grinding, those of you who have played FF X should know the pain of grinding. But in FF14, grinding is much better than before, because of all the things you can do. Look, FF14 is so diverse that I've met all kinds of people. A normal MMORPG divides into PvE or PvP group, yet, in FF14, there are way more groups than you thought. One of my friends only level crafting and has little levels when it comes to combat classes. One of my friend only focus on PvP in wolf den, and doesnt care much about raiding because it's really hard to find a good pug if you are not in a major free company that focus on pushing through turns and dungeons. Overall, this game wins at diversity. The things you can do in this game is just unlimited, but be aware my friend, once you introduce FF14 into your life.

Though it is a subscription based game, as of this review, it has surpassed many Free-to-Play MMORPGs out in the sea of games already with a blend of certain ingredients.\n\nStarting off by making your character, you have multiple choices of races you can become. From a regular human, a midget, cat people, elves and even huge peoples. There are many options to personalize your character if you choose to do so, such as eyes(heterochromia), tattoos, and even hair highlights(which was a first to me), You might be wondering if this is when you choose your class now, and you're right. To my amazement, your one character can master ALL the classes within the game. All you need to do is simply reach a certian level and you can accept to join all the class guilds. After that all you do is switch weapons and become that class.(Amazing right?) After you perfect your character, you are immediately thrown into the beautiful world we know as Eorzea.\n\nPutting the amazing transition SE has went with the end of FFXI to FFXIV aside, the story of your character begins in a slow pace. Most people will be put off by this slow beginning, but the story does start to get interesting to the point you want to learn more about it. Anymore information and it might end up in spoilers, so you decide whether to pay attention to the story or blitz through quests exclusively for experience towards your character.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to mention is about the dungeon system. You have finders which will automatically find you dungeons/parties, this can be a good or bad thing. So far from my experience, the community is nice to new players and will help you out and then we have some that are not so......nice. Either way, you can decide to use this or play with your friends within a party up to 8 people. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock more harder and interesting dungeons in which your team of friends can have fun  participating in. You might be wondering if there is anything rewarding from doing these. Besides receiving entertainment, drops such as weapons or armor might be a eye candy for your character. Another big thing would be the music. The music in this game is superb.\n\nTL:DR - Buy or at least try the game(free trial is up to 2 weeks). You will most likely enjoy the game and music and join the community, if not....at least you tried it....","December 3, 2014","true","563.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Which doesn't seem like a lot but the way I play games (play for a few hours, stop, play, stop) it's a lot of time to dedicate to one game.\nI haven't played an FF game I enjoyed since X. That is, until XIV came out. I've played a lot of MMOs including WoW and none of them held my interest for long. In FFXIV there are a lot of things to do and the community is the most enjoyable one I've encountered.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy the most is that you don't have to stick to one class. On my  main I started off as a Lancer and instead of remaking and loosing all that time you can simply go pick up a new class (which gets upgraded to a job once you complete the level 30 quest). If you get sick of your character appearance you can use a potion that you get as part of the vetran rewards to change everything about them (or you can buy one). If you're just sick of their hair/makeup changing that is as simple as coughing up 2k gil for a makeover. (which is nothing at all later on, especially if you craft)\nSpeaking of crafting, that's a feature that held my interst for hours. It's rewarding, although often expensive. In addition to making weapons/armor/clothing for your character you can also make furniture if you have a house, which you can buy personally or by joining a guild called a Free Company that has one. The only gripe I have is super long DPS queue times but that's less the games fault so much as the fact that I play DPS mainly.\n\nIt will trash your life and suck up your time. 10/10.","September 26, 2014","true","266.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I quit playing it for good about half a year before Pandaria's release. Since then, I drifted from MMO to MMO, never finding one that really captivated me... until I decided to give the rerelease of FFXIV a spin (after absolutely hating the 1.x version of it): FFXIV A Realm Reborn. And oh boy, it is a huge improvement over FF14 1.0 and an absolute delight to play, even for someone with zero Final Fantasy experience like me. After roughly 1300 (3200 at time of me editing this review) hours of gametime since the rerelease, I can honestly say that this game is absolutely amazing and well worth the money!\n\nEdit: Roughly 2000 hours after initially writing this review, I can still say I am completely in love with this game. An absolute must buy! If you're not convinced, there's a trial you can find of FFXIV here on Steam which gives you a little taste of how the game is... sadly enough, it gives you a taste of the early game. The weakest part of FFXIV. The endgame is where it shines, but you'll have to put in more time for that! Again, I can't recommend this game enough!\n\nEdit: Another edit, it's now been over 4000 hours and the first expansion (Heavensward) has released, and it is a great addition to an already great game. I really can not urge you enough to at least give the trial a go -despite low level being the weakest part of the game, as I mentioned in my previous edit-.\n\n-Ciaran Dango & Sena Tempus, Moogle","June 26, 2014","true","831.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

Final Fantasy is not so much a videogame as a feel of a videogame, a specific set of familiarities and tones that amass into a notion of strange particularity. It’s hard to separate the act of playing Final Fantasy from our perception of what a game like Final Fantasy is: its look, its feel, the sound of a familiar melody at the title screen that tells you yes, this is Final Fantasy, and everything is going to be okay. Final Fantasy is not a game, but a smell, a memory, a compulsion.\n\nI have been playing Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn a lot, to my own surprise. This new rendition of a previous disaster which I have not personally experienced is seamlessly, indulgently playable. It is a game of unrelenting maximalism— every single Final Fantasy mainstay is hurled at you indiscriminately with reckless abandon— while at the same time being totally relaxing. It’s like plummeting into the ocean only to realize that it is the exact same temperature as your body. Unlike something like Call of Duty, which is equally big and playable but requires muscles tensed and brain on edge, FF14 washes over you in a warm crystalline blue glow of fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nI played FF14 while catching up with a friend on Skype. I planned a ♥♥♥♥ing camping trip while playing it. Final Fantasy just occurs, if you let it. Do you know what else does this?

I made many friends, but was kicked because of the dumbest reason, I was then invited to their Main FC. I made new friends, I still talked to old friends. Eventually my little group of friends were all kicked out because we insisted one of our friends were kicked for a stupid reason, but I was kicked for apparnetly complaining about it even though I wasn't complaining about that incident I was complaining about the day I had. They didn't have the nerve to kick me while I was online, but they did so directly after I left. My little group of friends split up to many different FCs within Zalera. We talked within our linkshell. Eventually, half of us decided to make an FC. I founded the FC and gave leadership to the voted leader, but I wasn't even given the slightest amount of Powers. I didn't complain, even though a friends who barely did anything for the FC got more power than I had. Months later, we were starting to tear each other apart and I got a little mad about the lack of power even though I created the FC. We all tore apart and I left for months. I finally buy it on the PC, and play it a little bit just for the hell of it. I re-join that old FC, seeing that the abusive officers were gone and all in a different FC. The Leader was the only one who recognized me, and the only one I recognized. My entire group of friends had either switched Servers, changed their name, quit the game, or still play at times, and the last is held at a minimum.

This game is amazing for many more reasons than I am allowed to type down in this review. So instead, let me just give you my top 5 reasons as to why I think this game is amazing.\n\n5. fluint animation and amazing graphics\n\nMost mmos put all there money into gameplay and story writing. Not that theres anything wrong with that, but this leads to lack of visual presentation. Take wow for example. How long has it been out? Longer than most mmos. Has it updated its visual quality since its release? No. It looks the same as its always been. Now take a look at ff14. What do you see? 60fps gold encrusted in gorgeous platinum grade textures. And the best part is square knew they didn't have to try. ff11's looks are on par with wow. So why did they try? Because they care.\n\n4. no limits on how many classes you can have\n\nIn the beginning, you choose your one main class. However, when you complete the level 15 quest from your guild, you are free to take on as many other guilds as you like. There is no need to make a second character unless you REALY want to. Square did this because they knew that it would have been tedious to have many characters under one profile due to class limitations. With just one character, you can suit the needs of all roles. Wether it be tank, healer, or damage dealer.\n\n3. NON-elitest community\n\nHow many times have you been kicked from a raid in wow because you had the "wrong" armor on, or you put your attribute points in the "wrong" spot. True there is an optimal way to play ff14, as there always is with video games, but if you dont have a perfectly specced, perfectly outfitted, GOD among charcters... nobody cares. You can shove all of your black mage attribute points into strength, you can equip robes and a wooden sword as a gladiator, you can ignore your skill hotbar as a monk... and nobody cares. No matter your level, attributes, euipment, and mmo skills in general, you will never be dismissed from a game provided that you are respectful and you at least try to do your job. ff14 has the best community of all mmos ive ever seen.\n\n2. amount of dlc\n\nJust about every mmo gets there largest sum of profit from dlc. The temptation of new classes, races, side quests, main quests, and the increase of your max level is hard to ignore. Now, how much dlc does ff14 have? Take a guess. On second thought don't. I know you would have guessed wrong anyway. The amount of dlc for ff14, as of now, is... 1. That's it. Just heavensward. Other than that, the base game has everything else. Now don't take it the wrong way. this game has plenty of content. In fact, almost all races, classes, side quests, and main quests are added in the main game via PATCHES. I mean, what other mmo does that? Just giving you free stuff because you own the base game? can't think of any? Me neither. It's pretty clear that square cares more about the communitie's satisfaction than their profits in the making. thanks square.\n\n1. are you ready fo this... IT'S CROSS-CONSOLE!\n\nYup. You heard me. The pc and ps4 ports of ff14 share the same servers. Servers that are filled with over 5 MILLION happy customers accross the world, and accross different platforms, The ps3 verson of the game is a minor exception, considering that heavensward almost broke the system because it was not built for such content. so its obvious why ps3 needs its own exclusive serverse. But other than that, YAY FOR CROSS-CONSOLE!\n\nff14 is by far the best mmo I have ever played. Even without the 1 dlc that is out right now, you can still enjoy this game for hundreds upon hundreds of hours without getting bored. Infact, you can almost be certain that square will patch in new content to keep you playing.\n\nAll in all, i recomend this for those who like rpgs, mmos, final fantasy, and any other square related rpgs.\n\nNow if you excuse me, i'm going to ride my black and green chocobo into the sunset. along side my titan-egi, of course.","January 17","true","347.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Short summary opinion is at the end for those that want to skip reading a longer opinion.\n\nThe quests in this game are much more diverse than in many other ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes. They range from investigation style quests, to NPC interaction quests, to your cookie cutter fetch and kill quests and more. Some require you to run dungeons and other require you to take part in mini raid style battles on the world map (you dont need a party to participate in these).\n\nIt needs to be understood that this game is extremely heavy on storyline content to the point that some may feel like they are reading an interactive book rather than playing an MMO. This means quite a bit of single player questing and even single player instanced battles as part of many questlines. For some this may be a source of irritation but for people that are familiar with the Final Fantasy brand, this is an amazing chance to become engrossed in the realm of Eorzea.\n\nIf you are planning on playing this MMORPG just to skip every dialogue and run to every quest mark, you will probably start feeling either annoyed or confused at what is going on with the quests and frustration may result from that. This is because the main story quests play a large part in character progression in terms of unlocking areas but they are also very detail oriented in terms of conveying a personal story to the player rather than simply grinding out exp to level up.\n\nThe storylines, both main and side, reflect some of the best writing to come out of a Final Fantasy game in a very long time and you can very easily forget you are even playing an MMO at times.\n\nThere is a rather large drawback however, depending on your point of view...  This game demands that it's players EARN practically everything.\nYou are NOT given a mount for free when you hit a certain level, you have to meet certain conditions to earn the right to ride a mount or stick with cheap taxi mounts until you do.\nYou are NOT given access to your full ability tree as you level up and instead must take part in quests / storyline unique to your class in order to earn additional abilities and even a job class unique to your base class.\nYou are NOT given access to dungeons in the game until you either follow the main story quests to the point they are unlocked for story reasons or until you find the side quests that unlock them for story reasons.\n\nThe list goes on but you probably get the idea... things in this game are earned through hardwork, not through mindless grinding or by getting carried on the coattails of a high level friend that can just shower nice items on you (but that second one would still probably help alot if you are that lucky).\n\nThe game is great, The story is amazing (both powerfully dramatic and enjoyable comical at times) and the gameplay mechanics are enough to challenge even seasoned MMO vets in the level 50+ dungeons and trial fights.\n","January 15","true","169.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I think it's one of the best video games I've ever played.  It's weird, though, because it's not a game that comes without a load of the problems typical of MMOs.  (This is totally my opinion here, so if you're a reader who loves everything about MMORPGs and you disagree, that's totally fine.)  For long stretches of the leveling game, combat can be extremely dull depending on a variety of things: what job you've chosen, whether or not you have any companions (e.g. solo questing as a gladiator/paladin is going to be feel pretty slow when it takes you a moment or two to kill anything), and you're going to be sitting in queue after queue waiting for your turn in the dungeons.  Combat for some jobs is not very interesting until you're level 50 or 60 and you have access to dungeons and raids that will test your skills (often with boss mechanics that seem weird or even overwhelming at first, but are satisfying to pull off as a group overcoming a unique challenge), and that's an investment I'd want anyone to be aware of when getting into something like this.  You'll spend a lot of time pressing a few keys in sequence while you whittle down the HP of this or that monster.\n\nThankfully, most of the queues are pretty short and there are tools for getting people together for something even if the Duty Finder isn't pulling together a party for you.  And there's plenty to do while you wait: keep on questing, do some gathering or crafting, play Triple Triad.  Very importantly, for me, it's a world that feels good to hang out in.  The first and larger paragraph up there probably seems overly negative for a game I'd recommend to others, but here's so much that I enjoy about Final Fantasy present here — my bard's equipment is glamoured to look like early FF character designs by Yoshitaka Amano, and there's tons of armor (and other designs) in the game that support this style and atmosphere.  It is a legit as heck hangout/comfy game.  The challenging (hardcore raiding) stuff is there if you want it.\n\nJust some thoughts here; not really a full review or an attempt to convince anyone to play.  It's my jam, tho.  I may come and go, and frankly I'm extremely relieved that it's a game I only want to play for a few months at a time between extended breaks, but when I'm into it... well, I'm pretty into it.","March 7","true","511.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/recommended/39210/","funkyfinzy","FunkyFinzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/","186 products in account","Realm Reborn is a sequel to the previously released Final Fantasy XIV, which wasn’t received very well, and this is even conveniently explained in the game’s plot: there’s an apocalypse which ravages the whole realm and begins a new era. Personally I hadn’t played the previous game but this sequel is said to offer significant improvements over the original across the board, it's essentially an entirely redesigned game of its own.\n\nThe plot is fairly generic save the world kind of stuff: you are an adventurer brought into one of the game’s three big city-states with a special ability to attune to crystals which hold some great ability to hold off evil. You perform tasks for the city-states and eventually rise to become an envoy between them and even serve them. Similar to single-player games, the main plot and many of the other quests are filled with cutscenes, and in the main story’s case, the significant ones are also voiced. It’s all easy to follow and they’ve tried to put a bit of story into everything, for instance all of the game’s class guilds have a storyline of their own that advances as you gain levels and do guild quests.\n\nHowever this kind of plot is well suited for MMO and something as complex as Final Fantasy XIII’s super messy plot obviously wouldn’t work here. Rising in guild ranks and joining armies feels like an accomplishment, and you get treated to far more heroic stuff like taking on massive primals (think summons from previous Final Fantasy titles) rather fast. The game overall plays much like a singleplayer game story wise: the story is focused on your personal character and many plot advancing quests have certain “duty” sections that can only be completed with your own character, such as taking on a boss battle. This can be reversed too in some cases: some boss battles and dungeons instead put you in a party with others. Most of the game can be soloed if you want, but the option to do stuff in a party is totally there too, you’ll only ever be separated for brief periods at a time.\n\nThis focus on your own character is what sets the game apart from other MMOs in my opinion and makes the game more interesting. The cutscenes are also no worse quality than in singleplayer FF titles and the game’s graphics and particularly animation are fantastic. All characters are lively animated and seeing your character pull off all kinds of stuff like stupid faces in cutscenes is really fun and involving. The game is also really well optimized, running on a large variety of systems and even having its own preset settings for laptops for instance that take your specs into account. The user interface in the game is really good too, super easy to use and slick looking, I was never at a loss to find something.\n\nGameplay is similar to other MMO titles and the difficulty level is really good across the board, you will be challenged at every level and you can always find more dangerous or easier opponents and quests. As a nice twist your character can be literally any class in the game – you can use and level any one class at a time, provided you have joined their guild, and certain class abilities can also be used by other classes. For instance, Gladiators that have leveled Conjurer can cast Cure, which they normally wouldn’t have access to, so cross-classing a bit is encouraged and even required to get Jobs (specialized mid/late-game classes) later on. To swap a class you just swap to a different gear preset, which you can create lists of. At the most basic level you just need to change a weapon to switch to another class.\n\nThe game is easy to get into as well, there’s a 15 day free trial that offers leveling of a single character up to level 20, but you can cross-class him/her as much as you like, and it’s definitely enough to get a good look at the game. The free trial is best played with a friend that already owns the game though, because you cannot set up your own parties in it, but other subscribed players can invite you to theirs. Marketplace and trading functions are limited but otherwise there’s no significant restrictions. The game is available as a digital download on the website and on Steam, as well as on PS3 and PS4 on the consoles, the multiplayer is cross-platform, and new buyers of the game automatically get 30 free game days. Steam users will also be happy to know that the monthly subscription can be paid with just Steam wallet money, assuming you also bought the game from Steam.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's great. Don't compare it to Square Enix's other new FF games. It's a traditional ♥♥♥♥♥♥me with Final Fantasy flavor and one well designed one at that. I enjoy it tons more than the recent main series FF games. And I wrote this review originally for something else in mind, if you're wondering why it's so long and detailed. :P Give it a chance, it deserves more PC Steam players. And, it has a ton of content in a large world. I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what it has to offer so far at the moment of writing.","December 2, 2014","true","837.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I quit that to play Star Wars Galaxies, and boy, was THAT a game!\n\nSo now that we have the fact that I'm a SWG Vet, and no MMO has ever really caught my attention, or hooked me in, that should tell you how good this game is.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Fellow SWG Vet's, this is NOTHING like Galaxies! Except the MMO part. And the fact that you can be any class, whenever you want! Twelve combat classes, that merge into twelve more advanced classes, that you can blend and mix skills to have cross-class abilities, and then you can switch between them on the FLY!. Oh, and the crafting? Eight crafting classes, and three gathering classes! Crafting is very much like Galaxies. Scan for, or buy, mats. Find the best quality mats, and craft the best quality gear!\n\nThere are dungeons, raids, and an amazing storyline that one would expect from a Final Fantasy game. The characters are very well developed, voice acted, and diverse. Everything falls into place.\n\nBefore you purchase the game, and as with any other MMO: Do your research! Read up on th game, read reviews (like mine!), find out if there are free trials and friend codes. If you want a friend code, just send me a message, I'll be more than happy to show you around the vast world of Eorzea. It;s a beautiful one","June 25, 2015","true","407.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I started my experience back in the middle of 2015 and since then enjoyed, almost every step (aside Titan EX). FFXIV caters to the needs of many kinds of players those that heed the call of combat and those that want to craft and relax online. It has open ends on all parts of the scale making sure you have lots to do, without being pressured to do it.\n\nThe key points for this game include:\nPlaying everysingle class on one character, allows for diversity at times when you need it without taking away your efforts.\nGreat socialisiation, it targets well how people can interract with each other online as their substitute self-\nAmazing customisation, by god is the customisation good, go a head make your character, you will never find someone that looks like you.\nIntricate story, though it has had a tendancy to get a little dry at time the primary campaign which takes you through the levels is incredibly enjoyable and the story itself is well written and crafted, though watch yourself if you really hate politics.\nThe combat and leveling,.. the key point of most MMOs, FFXIV has it set to a T. Everything is balanced and created so 'Jobs' can fit in with one another. I my played Archer until I could reach the Bard Job. This primarily made me the support DPS in all dungeons. Whilst each healer and each tank has their own specific uses which each and every ability cater to. This isn't really something I can explain with words so I suggest looking up a few YouTube videos on the classes and Jobs.\nLastly the dungeons or Duties as they are called. The main focus of this game as a whole is to prep yourself for Duties which are dungeon crawls, boss battle trials and Raids. All are extremely fun and hold the entirity of the main game within them outside of the storyline. Each dungeon is unique with bosses and units your team have to take down co-operatively, Trials toss you up against one of the big guys which have diverse fighting mechanics you need to learn and master as a team to take down and Raids, well, we all know what raids are...\n\nMy final scores for FFXIV are as follows\nScore  Visuals and landscaping  8.5/10  Soundtrack  9/10  Gameplay  9/10  Controls  9.5/10  Dialogue, quests and story  7.5/10  Social aspects and self customisation  10/10  OVERALL  9/10","February 13","true","369.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Problems from glitches, bad economies between the players and NPCs and being flat-out unfinished.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (or version 2.0 onwards) fixes so many of the problems and the game itself has good controls, an easy-to-use interface and HUD and beautiful sceneries and locations (with areas like Coerthas having been altered altogether from the original version). Each class has their own advantages and disadvantages and unique abilities that they learn upon levelling up or completing class-exclusive quests. Upon learning an ability that belongs to a specfic class, for example, Raging Strikes from the Archer, it can be used by other classes providing they're within level range to use it.\n\nThe game offers many quests and dungeons as the story progresses, with new dungeons and harder variants of the bosses unlockable post-story (as of ver. 2.1 onwards). If you're a completionist-type of player, you will have plenty of things to collect and complete throughout the game.\n\nYou will have to pay a subscription fee for this game, but for each period of subscription, you will be rewarded exclusive items, better known as Veteran Rewards. If you have a friend who wants to give the game a go, but doesn't want to spend anything yet, the Recruit-a-friend campaign allows them a 14-day free trial to see if it suits their fancy, furthermore, if your friend subscribes, you and your friend will get rewards only obtainable through this campaign.\n\nOld and new players will find plenty to do in this game, and if you're looking for a good time in an MMO I would definitely recommend Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.","September 7, 2014","true","135.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadesman/recommended/39210/","shadesman","robot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadesman/","243 products in account","Strikes a very satisfying balance between RPG and action game. Classes and skills themselves are very simple, much moreso than ones you'd often find in other MMOs. The simplicity allows for the player to focus harder on individual fights rather on stats and builds. This means that, assuming you're properly geared, you have only yourself to blame for death or messing up. You didn't put an extra point in a bad stat, you didn't level a bad skill, you just messed up, and the next step is learning how not to do the same thing again. Or you lagged. Titan HM/EX, every time.\nMechanic memorization may not be everyone's cup of tea, but in my opinion it is much better and more satisfying to clear a boss or a raid because you knew what to do, when and how, rather than because you're a big bad min/max'd dude with perfect stats and a perfect skill build. You get to where you are through practice, through learning, through experiencing. You can't just invest a bunch of time/gil into BiS gear and expect to do good at everything if you haven't tried it yet, and that's why I really love this game.","September 10, 2014","true","263.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","1"

Please note these are my own personal opinions on the game, and I still have a large majority of the game to uncover.\n\nPros\n-Breathtaking graphics.\n-Skill animations.\n-Roleplaying.\n-Replayability.\n-Story.\n-Inventory\n-Sountrack\n-Armor/Mounts\n\nGraphics - Absolutely wonderful, especially for what is coming up to be a 5 year old game.\nSkill animations - Nice, fluid, look awesome; very eye appealing.\nRoleplaying - A large of roleplaying can be had in this game, especially with the requirement of a Forename and a Surname.\nReplayability - Literally 20+ classes you can all level up on one character and switch between, really awesome idea that works amazingly.\nStory - Super in-depth, and really worth-while taking your time on your first playthrough to explore the world.\nInventory - Literally THE best inventory system I've ever seen in any game. Seperate inventories (literally 20+ slots) for every armor piece, then another 100 for junk/misc, and ANOTHER for quest items.\nSoundtrack - Beautiful sountrack from Square Enix, as is to be expected.\nArmor/Mounts - THE best plate armor I've ever seen, weapon designs make sense, along with some armor. Mounts look cool as ♥♥♥♥ as well. Great amount of custimization.\n\nCons\n-Global Skillcooldown\n-Confusing at first\n-Map system\n-Teleportation is a bit odd\n-Learning curve\n-Voiceovers\n-Tab targeting\n\nSkillcooldowns - After every cast, whether instant or a 2-3 sec. cast time, you have a set amount of time before you are able to do another action. Feels a bit awkward at first, and still does right now, but something I disliked.\nConfusion - Game throws you in, no ♥♥♥♥s given, and it can be a bit overwhelming, take things one at a time and it'll get good.\nMap system - Feels clunky to use, hard to tell where some locations (i.e. exits, towns, quests) are.\nTeleportation - Teleporting feels like it should be done at "Aetheryte Crystals" allowing you to go anywhere, but they limit you to zones. Teleportation is done as a skill and costs money, just feels weird and unexplainable.\nLearning Curve - Big learning curve, but once you get over it, it's very rewarding.\nVoiceovers - Some of the most random cutscenes have voice overs, and ones that feel detrimental to the storyline have none. Just feels weird at times; inconsistent.\nTab targeting - Tab targeting SHOULD (in my opinion) be the closest monster towards you, and it isn't. I don't understand the mechanics and it can cause unnecessary aggro on monsters due to misclicks.\n\nTL;DR - Great game with a bit of a hard learning curve. Worthwhile in the end.\nFat Chocobo/10","July 26, 2015","true","183.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Like many of you, I thought FF online will always suck because 11 and fourteen 1.0.\n\nThis one? You miss out something valuable as a gamer if you skip this game.\n\nI BEG OF YOU AS A FELLOW GAMER, THIS GAME DESERVES RECOGNITION.\nI came too damn late because I thought GW2 is gonna be great (heart of thorn is terrible especially with the story, so I quit).\n\nI've been a gamer since 1995 (5 years old) playing red alert, tiberium, starcraft and diablo so on. I play good games only!\nThe first MMO I played was Rangarok, it was a frigging cocain at that time.

If you don't pay, you just can't play. They don't delete your account btw...unlikes *cough cough* ESO.\n- Grindfest starting at lvl40+...I just want to go through stories QQ.\n- The que time in early lvl quests (aka dungeons) usually take forever. Too many people got sucked into end game content.\n- This is not the actual world we live in.\n\n*EDIT1*\n\nCON\n\n- Just finish realm reborn final mission. HUGE MISTAKE: Too many people required and reward elite players to come back and play with you. Meaning they will force you to skip either all the cutscenes or all the fight. They even have an audacity to tell you to go watch cutscenes in the inn as if they ever do that first time in the dungeon. Few would even try to kick you out.\n\nI heard they fix for story content after this, but we'll see what I find out.\n\nMajor dissapointing ending mission. Great ending content, ♥♥♥♥ system..... What's with these games these days that ♥♥♥♥ing up ending one way or the other?\n\n\n\n\n*Side note*\nJust put down your stupid Destiny, ESO or whatever lame game that got hyped out into the outer space and play this damn good game already.\n\n\n*Edit after Heavensward*\n\n- So they actually fix the ending missions issues where elites force you to skip all battles or all cutscenes.\n\n1) They reduce the players required to normal of 4 players.\n\n2) the cutscenes are off higher quality, more efficient and less time consuming. All the more intense cutscenes are put in your private main quest while.\n\n3) Dungeon quest cutscenes are not only shorten, but elites that come for delicious delicious tomestone will have to wait for you otherwise, they will have to fight the boss with less people (which is impossible).\n\nI haven't done raid yet...♥♥♥♥, 261hrs and I've only done all main quests up to date.....OH patch 3,2 is coming.

With MMOs being largely community driven, the fact that the Final Fantasy XIV team is willing to share as much and as often as they do (going so far as to describe the problems they had in the original launch of the game and how they worked on them) is a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe failure of Final Fantasy XIV Online was something of a reality check and with the two years spent redeveloping the game we now have a well written story surrounded with an excellent series of challenges to keep people busy with. The game is visually impressive and runs many times better than it's failed predecessor. Combat is at a fair pace with a number of different classes that you can change to on the fly just by changing your primary weapon.\n\nWhile Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is primarily a PvE game, the development team has done an excellent job at bringing in content in a timely manner, providing for quality-of-life adjustments, and has been extremely effective in documenting and implementing a lot of the playerbase's wishes.\n\nIf you're looking for an MMO, Final Fantasy XIV isn't a bad one to look at. With it's entry price being half that of other new MMOs, and the subscription offerings being more flexible than others, the game is not only well cared for, but hard to beat for it's price of entry.","March 22, 2014","true","458.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

At some point you'll develop stockholm syndrome and think you're actually having fun, but once that wears off, you realize that the game is a repetitive weekly grindfest with the same copy/paste dungeons but with a new coat of paint. The character animations are absolutely abhorrent and the quests outside dungeons are likewise terrible. Most quests consist of killing or collecting 3 things of something and bringing it back to the quest giver. This quickly becomes monotonous but unfortunately you'll have to do this a couple thousand times in different variations. The story was written by 5 year olds (japanese people) and is so bad it's considered tounge in cheek by most (not braindead) people, and the only people defending the story or the writing in this game are people that complain when you say "animes" or think katanas are the best swords ever (not true, by the way.) If you're still considering getting this game even after reading this diatribe, I highly recommend you STAY AWAY from the community at all costs.

It was with great sorrow that I realized that the higher tiers of crafting had some bizarre, invisible-except-for-certain-times-of-day mechanic putting my happy gathering spree to an immediate, screeching halt.  I understand the need to make things rare in order to maintain the economy, but seriously?  Faced with the choice of standing, waiting for hours for a single node to spawn or buying it from the market, buying it from the market seems a much better choice, at least, until you see the prices, and realise that it would take you just as many hours of harvesting regular things to sell to afford one.  I suppose this is 'balance' but it certainly wasn't fun, and crushed my hopes as a crafter.\n\nThe game will also 'force' you to participate in queue-for-group dungeon content to advance your main story quest, and I found unless you queued as tank or healer, you'd be waiting sometimes hours for a group (which may or may not even stay together to finish the dungeon!) just to advance your main, storyline quest.  I eventually made it to the end, but after that I was left with just a sense of overall disillusionment.  Add that to the pointlessness of the crafting at higher tiers, and well...\n\nAs I said, it is one of the better MMOs out there, but I don't feel it has anything for the 'long haul' - unless you fancy queueing for groups and sitting afk at node spawn points for months on end, which ultimately killed it for me.  Perhaps if you have unlimited playtime to do the time-sink routine it'd be worth a play.","December 6, 2014","false","223.5"," 55 of 105 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","55","105","4","0"

Easy to get into multiplayer content, incentives for veterans to help rookies out, storyline quests progress your levels quite efficiently.  Interesting crafting mechanic, no-fuss travel, lush scenery and classic Final Fantasy aesthetics.  Loads of punny quest titles and memes hidden throughout.  A marriage mechanic that does not restrict (or even ask questions about) gender combinations.  Multi-rider mounts so you can haul your friends around.  Tons of quests and collections, a completionist's dream.\n\nCons: Extremely technical, precise, minmax-y and a lot of poor communication, both between the game and the player and between player and player.  Terribad voice acting, overly flowery and verbose script, a plot that is hamfistedly dramatic and full of predictable and frustrating tropes, ugly "basic" gear practically until max level with few to no alternate options.  Gear-gated content and rng-based gear acquisition (this is a con, to me, take that as you will.).  Story quests force you to solo content, even in a game where no class is built to safely run solo.  Passive-aggressive elitism in the community.\n\nI ran out of game time, and I won't be renewing it.  This game is not for gamers who play games to have fun.   This is an MMORPG that is designed for people who feel good about themselves by getting very good at, or completing, extremely difficult or complicated content.   I'm not what one calls a "hardcore gamer" and thus the restrictive, overly specific Holy Trinity of RPGs gameplay left me feeling drained more than refreshed.  After failing a solo story quest duty five times in a row, and finding that I was doing everything right, I just simply should've gotten hit less, I decided I wasn't the kind of player Square-Enix had in mind when developing this game.\n\nI'm told Heavensward is much better story and much nicer mechanics, but if you can't even make it to the Heavensward  expansion's content, which begins only after you've completed your entire A Realm Reborn story quest, it's not worth even the cost of the base game.  I'm not going to muddle through a difficult, unsatisfying and frustrating game just in the hopes that I can pay more money to see if the expansion is more to my liking.\n\nI game to have fun, not to hate myself.","May 3","false","71.4"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","2"

Sure, it's pretty fun for a while, but it gets too demanding and monotonous to enjoy playing in the long run, unless that's what you're into. Heavensward, the $40 expansion, is a well played joke. Multiplying the exp requirement for leveling and making you hike across massive maps* makes up more of this expansion's playtime than actual content. Significant updates are few and far between.\n\n*Flying isn't unlocked for the area until you've activated every Aether Current across the map and awarded via quests, and by that time you're moving on to the next area anyway, where the process repeats.\n\nTL;DR : A fantastic aesthetic, amazing soundtrack, accessible combat system and engaging story masks a life draining waiting simulator plagued with bad dev choices and Chinese RMT bots.\n\nI'd like to hear from those who still stand by this game, as I can't fathom why.","December 2, 2015","false","010.2"," 107 of 207 people (52%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","52","107","207","13","31"

This game is that good. Yet another patch (2.5) has brought more story quests, another primal and tons of new content on the way. Check out this video preview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj3hGDaDZqI\n\n\n*Original review after 460+ hours / 1 character restoration and resubription*\n\nAfter 250 hours I deleted my character in an attempt to stop playing. Then a couple months later I heard rumours of character restorations. $14.99 and a month later I was 450 hours in. I didnt re-subscribe again after that month, but I think about it regularily. I also didnt delete my character this time.\n\nI bought the game on sale and it came with a free month. So $45.00 total got me 3 months / 450 hours of some of the most enjoyable gaming I have ever done (loooooooong time gamer here). As someone who started with FF1 on NES I can honestly say that this is my favorite FF game of all time (I've only played 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14). It is the most complete, the most challenging, the most satisfying FF game I`ve ever played. And the best part is it never stops growing. Since I left they have added 2 new classes and a new Primal to fight.\n\nNot every element of this game is exciting. Some of it is straight up boring, and some of it will have you screaming with excitment / raging and throwing your controller. But the fact is you get to choose what you go on and do every day. Its up to you. The lack of voice overs is a little underwhelming, but at the same time its how most FF games I`ve played have been.\n\n10/10 Would delete and restore character again.","January 19, 2015","true","366.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cobaltblue/recommended/39210/","Cobaltblue","Cobaltblue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cobaltblue/","303 products in account","Hello everyone!\n\nSo after about 150 hours in the game I decided to write my very first Steam review. I want to mention that I have not yet experienced the "engame" of the game. I've been leveling a few classes (as in every MMO i try out lots of different classes before actually leveling one to max-level.  If you are looking for a review of the endgame, this is not it.\n\nSo far I played White Mage, Paladin and Ninja.\n\nWhat I like about the game\nClasses\nNice classes with interesting combos/mechanics.\nAll classes playable by the same character (you can switch to the different classes without creating a new character). Style\nBeautiful spell effects.\nNice monster, weapon and armor design. Mechanics\nVery good transportation ingame. Once you have visited the different zones and activated the crystal there you can teleport to that crystal for a small fee.\nChocobo mounts! These can actually be leveled and fight alongside you, tank for you and can even heal you!\nCustomizable interface. You can move around anything you see and decide how big or small you want it to be. Community\nVery friendly community. I know that this is not necessarily because of the game but I feel it should be mentioned. I played a number of MMOs before but this has to be by far the nicest community I've seen in an MMO. What I think could be improved\nMap\nThe map takes a bit getting used to. Sometimes it is hard to see where you have to go for a quest that spans across different zones. Abilities\nDepending on the class there is a bit of button bloat. Some classes get very niche spells that rarely get used. Leveling\nOnce you leveled up a few classes you might start to run out of quests. This is because you still have to level the other classes up but can only complete each quest once. So if you did them all while leveling your first few classes you might end up having no quests later on. Luckily you can do FATEs (similar to the events in Guild Wars 2 for example) and repeatable Levequests to level up. Level Sync\nThe game has a level sync system that lets you do lower level content and still earn experience. This is a nice feature, but I still put it here as I think it could be improved. Let's take my Ninja for example: You get a very nice mechanic at level 30 that lets you combine different hand signs to cast a Ninjutsu. This is when the class starts to get really interesting because different combinations will let you cast very different spells. Now if you would enter a Dungeon that is for level 20 characters the game will de-level you to that level. This means that you will not have access to spells over level 20. In the case of the Ninja this will lead to very boring gameplay. Conclusion\nSo far the game really impressed me. I played a few MMOs before but the style and gameplay of Final Fantasy XIV really drew me in. I recommend you at the very least try out the free trial.","September 7, 2015","true","246.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its build upon the foundation that WoW set years ago and keeps become one of the best RPG experiences you'll have in a MMO setting. There is so much content that at times it will seem overwhelming. There is content for all types of players, from PvP, gathering and crafting, end game raiding and many more. I can go on and on but the fact is that if you are searching for an MMO to really get into. Final Fantasy 14 is the way to go.\n\nOn a side note, you are never too late to start. Square has made an excelent job for new players to catch up and jump into the most relevant content.","March 10","true","084.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The subscription fee you pay for this game is well worth it considering how much content this game has to offer.\n\nFFXIV doesn't try to do anything gimmicky or "unique". It tends to follow stereotypical MMORPG tropes but it does it extraordinarily well. The game is slow at first, and won't really begin to ramp up in difficulty/pick up story-wise until you're around level 30. The game allows you to play all battle, crafting, and gathering classes on one character (simply swap to the weapon of the class you want to use granted you've unlocked it at the respective guild), however if you're an altaholic you may dislike this as character progression is separate. The game uses a holy trinity system, and all of the battle classes are fun to play and unique in their own ways. Most of this game is story-based, so you'll have to do the story if you want to get into anything in this game.\n\nThe storyline is for the most part very well-written, this game has deep lore and is full of references to other Final Fantasy games if you're a veteran of the franchise. The game also requires you to finish the core-game story in order to access Heavensward content. It is not worth buying Heavensward immediately as you cannot benefit from it until you are level 50 (unless you really want to play as an Au Ra; you cannot play the jobs that come with the expansion until you can enter the expansion zones). You can spend hundreds-thousands of hours in this game without even touching expansion content, and Heavensward is well worth purchasing once you hit level 50.\n\nThis game is heavy in PvE, featuring dozens of dungeons, raids, and primal fights (basically boss battles). The game has plenty of quests for you to undertake, overwhelmingly so in fact. I have ~700-800 hours in this game total as of this review, I played the trial on PC and then picked up the full game on PS4, eventually upgrading to PC because the keyboard/mouse support wasn't up to par and I wanted better framerates.\n\nI could go on about this game for hours, so in the end I encourage you to try the game yourself. You can play as a trial member for 14 days (most core classes up to level 20), and if you decide to purchase the game you'll get a month free of game time.","March 12","true","469.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (From here on out called FF14 Online) is an MMORPG Fantasy game set with the Final Fantasy Universe.\n\nWhat is it NOT? FF14 Online is not your typical Final Fantasy Game. Its an Online MMO, which means you MUST have an internet connection to play. There is also a monthly fee ($14.99USD) to play, so please consider this before diving into this game, as it could become very expensive and a waste of money for those of you that do not play at least once a day.\n\nGraphics:  FF14 Online has some of the best graphics for an MMO I have seen in a long time. Everything is crisp, framerates are smooth, and the cutscenes are not like previous entries (Extremely higher detailed than in-game. Yeah, Im looking at you, Final Fantasy 12!) There are multiple options in system settings you can mess with to achieve the highest Framrate you can. Even lower end systems can play this fairly well without too much of a hit to visual quality.\n\nGameplay:  The game plays as you would expect any major MMO to: You begin by creating your character. Changing their appearence, race, class/job, etc. Do not fret too much about picking a starter class. Unlike most ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes, FF14 Online allows you to eventually learn any and all classes/jobs. Most of which have crossover abilities! (A Gladiator using curative spells? An Archer with black magic? Yes! You CAN do it!)\n\nDoes it have Single-Player Mode? FF14, as stated before, is an MMORPG, meaning there is no true single-player mode available. While this is a fact, most of the main storyline can be completed solo, with the exception of certain dungeons. There is also a lot of solo content for you to play, if that is your thing. But you get the true enjoyment out of this game with the group system, Free Companies, and many other vsrious social forms.\n\nDo I recommend this game? I give this game a definite "Yes"! If you are into games that give you the most bang for your buck, give it a try. You can play a 14 day trial of the game if you go through the official website http://www.finalfantasyxiv.com\nIt is a game worth giving a try!

The trend is cater to the extreme casuals -"nothing can be hard or we complain"- so the game gets dumbed down. Then there's the more rare, but present, companies who refuse to listen to players and totally hose the game. Like Archeage in how Trion ruined what would have otherwise been a fantastic game. Or Eve online, which hemorrhages players left and right nearly every year after updates that break the game- except with Eve, the hardcore fanbase will always play or come back eventually, maybe not all but enough to keep it from going F2P - despite the company CCP continually screwing over the playerbase. It's a sandbox with nails, folks there are generally used to getting tetanus so the company being ♥♥♥♥♥ is like w/e.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV MMO on the other hand, had a bad start yes, but the company did something very very rare; they listened AND fixed the game to the point where folks now are saying its the next MMO worth spending a monthly fee to play. No its not the 'game to replace the original WoW' (not the shell of its former self that it is now) that will cure all things, but it is a damn good game.\n\nHave to hand it to the company for bringing this MMO back from the brink of its bad release. With how many MMO's come out (SWOTR, TERA, Wildstar, Archeage.. to name a few), promise the world, fail, then go F2P, it's really saying something these days that a company can listen to feedback, take it in, and fix the game to make it a success.\n\nThis review sums it up pretty well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrGehGbMCs\n\n\nLast I heard there were 4 million players registered- could be different now, but the reboot/fix what-have-you, has done it and this game is fantastic!\n\nCan look this up online as well, but here is a link from Reddit on the current numbers: https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/33cc1k/latest_lodestone_population_survey_730k_active/)\n\nIT MATTERS HOW a company handles a game, its community, and all aspects which you as a player interact with it. Why? Simply because this in large part is whether a game will work out in the long run. Take Archeage for example, epic game, epic concept, did really well in Korea, completely failed in the US - why? Primarily -likely solely- due to the company's complete and total mismanagement of the game and horrendous inability to address issues fairly within the community. Also if you polarize your community or make actual 'toxicity' where the players are just terrible to play or interact with.\n\nWhen people say to other reviews that those "aren't" a review because they only list gripes about the company (in FFXIV's case, the demo reviews about account creation info for Steam / non-Steam purchase, not being there), too bad. That info actually matters and thankfully in this case, Steam HAS been updated the demo info about account creation.","October 17, 2015","true","41.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are beautiful, the character creation is very in-depth, and it actually feels like you're involved in the combat instead of just sitting there tapping buttons until you fall asleep. The crafting system is unique and fun (albeit frustrating sometimes), too. If you get bored of questing, dungeoning, and crafting, you can go play games and race chocobos at the Golden Saucer, if you're so inclined. You'll never run out of things to do in this game.\n\nAnd if you're a roleplayer like me, Balmung has a huge and varied roleplay community--you're more than likely to find what you're looking for, no matter what your RP style is.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the game is the character creation restrictions. If a server is overpopulated, you can't make a new character on it, and have to wait until the populated is a bit lower, which is usually really early in the morning (if you're in America). This is a huge problem on Balmumg, which really stinks if you're looking for an RP server. Other than that, though, this game is great and totally worth the $15 a month.","September 24, 2015","true","422.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When enemies cast skills, you can quickly run out of the skill range to avoid taking a mass amount of damage. Of course, this gets a lot harder at later levels because the skill radius is either larger or the cast time is quicker. Or maybe you have about 6 of the same monsters chasing after you at once.\n\nThe game keeps things fresh and exciting with a combo system. For instance, with my class I cast a skill and then have access to other skills which will perform a bonus effect when casted and then can be chained on along with another skill to deliver a massive burst of damage. The combo system varies with other classes, like Pugilist, a DPS class which requires you to change into different forms to combo.\n\nIn no way will this game make you feel like you have to constantly grind for XP as there are plenty of quests around for you to take. There are also special events known as FATE Events that occur and grant a large amount of XP upon completion. Of course, there are also dungeon raids which require a great deal of teamwork.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention you're not locked to one class. If you want to get another class, talk to a guild leader.\n\nSTORY: 9/10\nIts a Final Fantasy game and still remains a Final Fantasy game, although in an MMO form. Do I need to say more?\n(Unless you've never played a Final Fantasy game before... I don't really want to spoil anything but I can guarantee that the main quests are definately enjoyable.)\n\nCOMMUNITY: 8.5/10\nEveryone I have encountered has been willing to help out if you're in need but like every MMO, there are your typical jerks. Two examples that I have encountered I can give are the party member who claims to be the "Raid Leader" and the one guy who rushes in and trys to Leeroy Jenkins the dungeon boss.\n\nSOUNDTRACK: 10/10\nITS A FINAL FANTASY GAME......\nIf that really isn't enough here is one of my favourite songs from the  Soundtrack.\n\nAlthough this is more of a first impression than anything and ratings may vary the more I play the game, I would give this game currently a 9/10. It's not perfect (although almost close to it imo) but It's currently the best MMO out there.","June 28, 2015","true","655.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When enemies cast skills, you can quickly run out of the skill range to avoid taking a mass amount of damage. Of course, this gets a lot harder at later levels because the skill radius is either larger or the cast time is quicker. Or maybe you have about 6 of the same monsters chasing after you at once.\n\nThe game keeps things fresh and exciting with a combo system. For instance, with my class I cast a skill and then have access to other skills which will perform a bonus effect when casted and then can be chained on along with another skill to deliver a massive burst of damage. The combo system varies with other classes, like Pugilist, a DPS class which requires you to change into different forms to combo.\n\nIn no way will this game make you feel like you have to constantly grind for XP as there are plenty of quests around for you to take.

My only previous effort was getting a quarter of the way through the original Guild Wars and promptly stopping. I got FFXIV original, and like the vast majority of its userbase, despised it for its lack of effort and genral uncompleted state. I also am a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series, however since XII had been steadily declining in praise for the series and how Square directed it. All these things meant that, while buying ARR on sale to give it one last chance, I was filled with a kind of half-dread.\n\nImagine my surprise, then, when FFXIV single-handedly made me a proponent of MMOs, made me forgive the $70 I wasted on vanilla XIV, and restored my love in Final Fantasy and all that that means. A Realm Reborn has so much flavour, flair, and engaging gamplay that it's kept me obsessed for, frankly, far longer than any one game should. Its beautiful, lived-in world, mismash of Final Fantasy's most memorable concepts and motiffs, and liquid-slick skills-based gameplay has changed my thinking in regards to an entire genre! I can't recommend XIV: ARR enough. It's beautifully constructed and lovingly maintained, and despite its dark history, shines through to form an exemplary entry in a once-again exemplary series.","September 14, 2014","true","202.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It was awful.  People noticed, first, then Square Enix noticed.  After a bunch of changes to everything we got a brand new game: FFXIV:ARR.\n\nARR is, first, a complete game.  There's content everywhere, the combat feels great, the soundtrack is awesome.  The crafting system is unusual in the best possible way - it's instanced to your character, so no more resource-stealing!\n\nThe downside is, it's a very, very immature MMORPG.  While the raids and dungeons are well thought-out, other fights are less so.  The storyline group boss fights against the Espers give no loot.  What's worse, the game really doesn't 'start' until you reach very high levels, so enjoy questing and grinding...which take a long time, and aren't well-paced at all, for a game that truly 'begins' at the endgame.\n\nPROS:\nA FF MMO that actually feels like a core Final Fantasy game!\nBeautiful music - particularly the 'Wild West' Chocobo theme!\nInteresting game mechanics\nGood quest writing, good translation.\nInstanced resource collection (tradeskills)\nYou only need one character - anyone can be everything!\nExcellent endgame PvE experience.\nFrequent updates with new endgame content\nCONS:\nThe game doesn't truly start until the level cap; most of the game is a glorified single-player mode.\nHuge amounts of RNG involved in the crafting system.\nNearly no PvP to speak of.  If you hate PvP, this is a PRO, but I love PvP.\nMain storyline boss fights don't give loot (!!!???)\nRuns very poorly on older hardware - if you have an older system, upgrade before buying this game.\nFinal Verdict: Make sure your system can handle this game before you buy it, but do, it is worth your money...if you don't care about PvP.  If you're a PvP gamer, there's other games, but this game will hold you for a month easily.","October 25, 2014","true","487.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(Doing the main quest alone, with some side quest and you can reach the Level limit no problem) (Leveling up other classes though takes time)\n- I'm enjoying the story, as do many others, though if you don't want to, it is all skippable.\n- You only need to make one character because that one character can be any-class as you can switch on the fly. First you must get to level 15 to one of the classes then you can switch to whatever else you want if you don't feel like it suits your role you want to be. Or you can be like me and level up all the classes. (I main Monk)\n- Want to just be a crafter? There is that too and they make money (gil persay) if you join a good FC willing to support the mats (materials you need).\n- End-game content is very captivating if you want to raid. There are many raid groups always looking to fill spots if that is what you seek. It is enjoyable and worthwhile. Trust me, it takes a lot of wipes (sometimes one or if your raid team is excellent, only one try), but its feel good.\n- Great community\n- Square Enix will not disappoint. They always have something awesome planned for this.\n- Heavensward Expansion!\n\nWould highly recommend trying it out first. It might not be for everyone, but if you like Final Fantasy (and this game as soo many tibbits to its other titles, ex. Void Ark (FF5) , Crystal Tower (FF3), Gilgamesh, and others), you will enjoy this MMO.","November 30, 2015","true","980.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After all my expierenes with MMOs, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is my favorite, and it's the game that made me stop playing WoW.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice when you launch the game is just how gorgeous the world of Eorzea is. Gameplay wise, the combat is interactive enough; it may not be as involved as a game like WildStar, but you're constantly using skills and dodging attacks which makes it very entertaining. The main story is interesting, and is full of likeable characters. The voice acting is pretty good for the most part, I haven't encountered anything that really stood out as bad like a Jill sandwhich.\n\nAs much as I do love this game, I still have some criticism (since after all, nothing is perfect). The most glaring issue is the slow pacing players will encounter at the start. It can easily turn new players off of the game as they will be bombarded with meaningless "go there, talk to person X, go back to quest giver, get reward" type quests, and getting those out of the way before you get to the combat is pretty boring (though you do have the option to skip those and go straight to the combat quests right away).\n\nThe ability to have access to every class in the game on a single character removes the need for alts, and is neccessary for the job system within the game. Jobs are essentially advancements of a class, and require class A (the class that is being advanced) to be level 30, while having a specific class, class B, be at level 15. This allows you to have new abilities, and access to job specific quests form levels 30-50 (60 with the Heavensward expansion), each with their own story, much like the class quests that you'd encounter from levels 1-30. The only gripe I have with the ability to change classes on your character, is the lack of quests in the game. Since you'll eventually run out of quests to do to get XP, you'll end up doing the same dungeons, FATEs, and levequests repeatedly, which can get dull.\n\nOverall this is a great game, and well worth the subscription price in my opinion (there are two subscription models available: Standard $15 a month with no restrictions, and the Entry level for $13 a month which limits you to one character per world). It's a good game for Final Fantasy fans and non fans alike, though fans of the series will probably get a bit more enjoyment out of it due to the bits of (non-intrusive) fanservice sprinkled in.","January 10","true","497.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrNeedlemouse/recommended/39210/","MrNeedlemouse","Mr.Needlemouse™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrNeedlemouse/","510 products in account","(This review is being written from the POV of a level 34 tank class. Please do not judge the game's DPS or healing classes by this review. I have not accessed the expansion Heavensward yet, so i cannot speak for it's content)\n\nFinal Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn is the 14th installment in the long running Final Fantasy series (No ♥♥♥♥). However, this is not your usual FF game. This is a paid subscription based MMO, similar to World of Warcraft, Black Desert Online, etc. The game version currently available is 3.1, with patch 3.2 coming soon.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nFF14 is very different from your usual MMO, because of the way it handle's it's class setup. When you begin the game and create your character, you decide on what your starting class will be. This affects your starting location, and sets the main game into motion. However, once you complete the "tutorial" quests you can essentially live your life how you want to. The game doesnt force you to continue the main quest at any point, however if you wish to unlock more locations and reach the end game, the main quests are required.\n\nNow, as i said, the class setup is very unique. In the world of FF14, your character can class change into all available classes, as long as you have the required unlocks and levels. This means your character can become whoever you want them to be, there is no barrier blocking classes out of your reach. The game really flourishes from this, because this gives you the freedom to essentially never run out of content. Reach the max level with one class? find another you want  to play as and start working towards your new goal.\n\nHowever, of course no game is perfect, and this one has it's fair share of issues present. End game is currently very lackluster in content (according to other playes, as i stated i have not reached end game status) and there is not really much to do once you max out the classes you want to use. Dungeons are fun, but require alot of teamwork so unless you have a good group of friends to go with, you might get screwed over. Not only is it hard to reach max level, but it feels like at times the game is punishing you for not grinding for hours on end. I realize this is a time-sinking game, but when the main story only gives you 5 quests before raising the quest level requirement, It becomes extremely difficult to gain levels later on.\n\nCOMBAT\nThe combat is fun. It revolves around global-cooldown based skills you unlock as your class gains levels. Some skills are not tied to the main cooldown group however, so this opens up very cool combos you can pull off later on in the game.\n\nAs you unlock other classes, depending on the skills those classes contain, you can equip other class skills to your main class. This brings the combo potential even further, and really makes it that much more worth it to grind those classes out. My only complaint with the cooldown system is during dungeons some people tend to forget that theres a cooldown for everyone, and they get upset and angry because "how dare the tank lose hate on an enemy". Don't listen to the toxic people, practice enough and you'll be fine.\n\nOVERALL\nThe game is alot of fun, with friends or a free company (guild) to help you along the way. Make friends with as many people as you can, you'd be surprised at the amount of very friendly, happy to help people just roaming around looking for friends. As soon as you can, join a free company (or make your own) and start building your community of friends up.\nThe game is a time sink, no one can deny that. But, the atmosphere, music, and beautiful locations make everything worth it.\n\nBuy the game already, it's gaining alot of new people so now is the chance to join us in this adventure.\nSee you in Eorzea!\n\n\nP.S ♥♥♥♥ lalafells","February 14","true","747.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I came from TERA, i promised myself i'd never play a game with tab-target again.  But here I am, 150+ hours,\n\nWhile questing you'll spend a lot of time blazing through quests, and for the most part, I didn't feel bored by the story, the combat was engaging, and he quest themselves were decently written and weren't tedious to manage or complete; my only complaint is one must resort to FATES once they hit hit that point of "GOTTA GET TO 50 ASAP"\n\nLuckily endgame content in FF14 makes you work for your gear, but makes it easy to accomplish and is not a time sink (for the most part)\nOne can attempt to hunt monsters with a full 8-man raid, along with many other raids to get specific currency to obtain that gear, and it takes a good 5 hours to get all that currency for decent gear to PREPARE for endgame content.  Once you're properly equipped you start facing many challenges that do take skill in your class, and communication with your party to accomplish, such as Hard Mode versions of boss fights in the story mode whilst you were leveling.  The main thing to note about this game is that it is very hard to NOT suck at your class, every class is incredibly unique, espcially when one is allowed to get a job (Specializing in that class role) but the game makes it very easy and simple to do a specific role without much screw ups, levels 1-49 preapre you with very brief 30-40 minute dungeons that give you a proper conditioning to be a healer, tank or get a sense of your DPS rotation, so you won't get your ♥♥♥ handed to you when you first start out.\n\nFree Company's are FF14RR's guild system, and it not only serves as your help hotline, it serves as your home as well... literally, FC's are allowed to acquire houses for all their members for a small payment of... 2 million gil.... >.>  and 10mil if you want a swag pad, FC's in turn give you plenty of leveling bonuses for new players, and the more new players do FATE's, the FC in-turn ranks up in their residing Grand Company of 3 Grand Companies.\n\nGet this game, it's a full package, engaging story, plenty of customization (More hairstyles when you're lvl 20 C:), and traditional but SOLID gameplay.\nYou won't be dissapointed if you love MMO's.\n","July 29, 2014","true","645.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Well SquareEnix listened to the fans and brought in some familiar faces to help make this new Realm.\n\nSo you create your character, the game has subscription, but it's definitely gorgeous and fun to play. The readded the summoner class which was my absolute favorite in Final Fantasy 11. You have a vast world to explore, to adventure in and the game is more suited for solo play along with parties. You can go do instances together, have a blast playing with friends or just even hanging around and chatting. Now there is some cons with this game.\n\nI don't like the instances as much in this game as i did in Final Fantasy 11. I also liked the auction house more in 11. I noticed there isn't any dlc for this game or if there is i didn't come across any. So im wondering if they are just updating the game like GuildWars2.\n\nSo i will probably update this game more, but one of the biggest things i must mention is take advantage of the events they have. You get cool items and it's a very memorable experience.","October 3, 2014","true","26.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

My alias is Mog and I typically go by Moogle Assasin7. That being said, this is my SECOND favorite FF title to date. Don't get me wrong though, I do have some gripes about this game which is why it's only my second fav.\n\nWhat you need to know about this game is that you have to buy it and it has a subscription (BOTH are required to play). I didn't realize this until my free trial ran out. Very dissapointed that they left that tidbit out of the discription. However, I still play because its awesome.\n\nNext is the game itself. Very repetitive... you tend to do a lot of the same stuff over and over. The trick is to mix up your game play and switch up your focus. There is a massive amount of story and there is always something to do. Voice acting is great. Plus the devs are constantly adding new content, which helps keep you engaged. Community is great, I have yet to have a problem with a single person. It's easy to drop in and out. This is nothing like FFXI, you CAN actually progress through the story line and you'll do it almost completely solo.\n\nI use a midgrade laptop that runs on windows 8.1 and it handles fine. (usually around 11fps) I know that isn't alot but this game doesn't require much. Biggest drain on fps is the hunts.\n\nBottom line 9/10 for massive amout of content, easy to learn, hard to master, great story but repetitive. Totally worth the 15 bucks a month.

Yet. The world is still lacking in scope, the endgame needs more variation, and lots of features like player housing hasn't been implemented yet.\n\nBut I still give it my wholehearted recommendation. The graphics are great, the content that IS there is really fun, the production values are as good as any MMORPG I've ever played, and I can't stop playing it. If you're the type of player who rushes through content, you may find yourself hitting a wall at some point, but if you dial it back to somewhere between "hardcore" and "casual", this game is a true gem. Heck, even if you DO breeze through it all, it is a game that grows with every patch, every content update, and every (eventual) expansion pack.\n\nThe monthly fee might seem discouraging, but not since Final Fantasy XI (also an MMORPG) have I ever got so much playtime and content for my money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskien/recommended/39210/","Duskien","Duskien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskien/","283 products in account","Decided to update my review, just because I love this game so much + my last one didn't do it justice. Going to break the main points down, so it's easier to read.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nLike most MMOs, you have the holy trinity of dps, healer and tanks. In this game they are divided into classes, which can further specialise into jobs. Cross class skills are used, so lets say I'm a White Mage at level 60, I can use cross class to access some skills from other classes/jobs I've leveled. Classes/Jobs are also handled differently. Your character can switch between any of the classes/jobs as they get unlocked, allowing you to completely change your playstyle should you choose to in the future. There's even classes like Fishing, Blacksmithing or Alchemist if you want to work the markets, or help your Free Company build an airship! Gameplay is like most MMOS, except it can get quite challenging as you get to a higher level. IMO this game has some of the hardest content from any MMO out there. There's the typical "Run around and quest" style gameplay, you can do a main story, there's lots of little "sub stories", trials, dungeons, fates in which many people randomly team up to complete a mini objective etc. Gameplay wise the game definately isn't lacking. The actual combat is quite good, players aren't just taught to stand still and smash buttons. There's lots of movement during fights, as you move away from aoes, deal with specific mechanics to handle bosses and move to specific locations to help team memebers. Apart from the obvious leveling gameplay, there's a lot of other things to go and enjoy. There's sightseeing logs, hunting logs, Gold Saucer events + a lot more.\n\nSTORY:\nWhat surprised me the most about this game is just how good the story is. Not just from an MMO perspective, but from a Final Fanasy one. Generally, it's put together really well. Ofcourse there are a few tedious bits, but for the most part it's extremely enjoyable. The story helps guide you to places you should level, introduces you to more of the world and characters in it. Another thing to note is how well some of the characters are built up throughout the story, you really get to know + like them. Again, content wise you're definately not short, especially with Heavensward just released. There's easily more than 50 hours of story content available at the moment, and the best thing is that it's constantly being added to through content updates. The story is split into mini chapter type things, some with overlaping issues, so certain issues don't overstay their welcome and it doesn't get stale.\n\nVISUALS + OST:\nThis is a Final Fantasy game. Even people that haven't played Final Fantasy know that a lot of effort is usually put into these 2 areas, and it applies here. Visually, the game is extremely impressive, especially now with DX11 support. The zones and enemies are extremely diverse, filled with a true sense of imagination and thought put into them. The music complements each area well, with a great range of types used. Lots of different types of musical styles are used for certain situations, from J-POP, smooth jazz and heavy metal. Even if some music tracks don't fit your fancy, theres bound to be plenty more that will.\n\nENDGAME:\nDecided to give this it's own section aswell, as most people are interested in this. There's a ton todo at end game. There's tons of dungeons, raids and extreme primal encounters you can fight for gear, mounts or glory. Some of these get extremely challenging, to the point that you'd need to form training parties to help train yourself + your team to beat an encounter. There's also a pvp arena, which I confess I haven't used, dailies through beat tribe quests or doing any of the logs I've mentioned above.\n\nOVERALL QUALITY:\nIMO The overall quality is just great. There's so much todo content wise, it's just unreal. With so many possible playstyles and things todo it's hard to not reccomened this to any MMO or Final Fantasy fan. I'd honestly reccommend it just for the story alone. This review really doesn't do it justice, so if you've read this and it's interested you I'd really reccomend watching some videos of it on youtube(Just don't spoil the story for yourself!) and checking out the free trial.

The combat is smooth but it is a traditional MMO combat which is fine. The story is easy to follow and the side quests are decently entertaining. The skill system is epic and kind of remeinds me of runescape, you have your combat skills which you can level each of them up, you also have fishing, cooking, mining, smith and ect, that each have there own guild and you can practice any of them. So your aren't stuck with one class or job you can do what every you want.\n\nWhen you level up you just attain the skills no need to go buy them, there are some skills that requires a quest to use but I like this a lot better then some other MMO where you level up and then have to go buy the skill which was very annoying and usually just a waste of money.\n\nSo all in all its a pretty basic MMO but I love it.","March 5, 2014","true","441.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It also scales well across old and new technology.\n\nI am a die-hard WoW fan, and will probably always play it on-and-off until it ends, but this game might be the first major MMO to catch my attention. It all just works. The first few levels are a bit disorientating, but after level 5 it starts to make sense. The community is also young (as the game is new) but very polite and helpful.\n\nThere's a decent variety of classes to start off with, and those who hate alts will love that they can switch classes just by changing weapons after a certain point in the game. (Level 15?) WIth some hybrid classes only being available after you level two individual classes to 30/15 respectively. There's almost a guarentee of many many more classes coming over from the previous FFXI title. Ideally it would flesh out every primary class with two specialization choices-- like how Arcanist must choose between Summoner or Scholar. Classes famous from XI include: Samurai, Black Knight, Corsair, Theif, Red Mage, and Blue Mage.\n\nSo far quests are varied and interesting, the enviroments are vibrant, and the world feels alive. I have not experienced any lag client or server side.\n\nIf you like classic Final Fantasy, you'll love this game. It's a very solid title and worth a shot.","March 22, 2014","true","61.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The game is gorgeous, entertaining, and does a fantastic job of pulling you into the narrative, and making you care about the npc characters. The ability to level all the classes on one character is a blessing and a curse, but overall I like the way it feels.\n\nBiggest downsides for me are the lack of chat bubbles, and the need to grind xp to finish the main story/cap your character once you surpass level 35. There's also a fair bit of gold spamming, and having to type out a ticket to report it every time is very tedious, especially compared to WoW's one button report spam feature.\n\nOverall, very happy with my purchase, and the ability to pay for subscription via the steam wallet.

It is finally here. Final Fantasy 14, the next part in the ever-so-popular series isfinally out for the gamers of the world to enjoy. As for me, i was a bit sceptical about it at first, as i don't really like MMO's. But as a huge fan of FF games, decided to give it a shot. And believe me, i was not wrong. I was hooked right at the moment i entered the main menu: The guys from Square Enix managed to make even the menu look beautiful and soothing, accompanied with all-too-known musical theme. The graphics are amazing, even on the lower settings, and the landscapes are gorgeous and well-planned. The game itself has many clever designs, such as different view on crafting, dynamic battles, party and dungeon finders, daily quests, the all-new multi-class system.... Etc. Etc. And the game always manages to give you something new, more different things to keep you from getting bored.\nIf you still have your doubts about giving your money monthly to play the game, then i will say you that: If you want a solid MMO experience with plenty of traditional FF goodness and recognisible characters - then think no further, just go and pay for it.

We shared stories, got to know each other a little bit, and some of the max level players came out to help me quest for fun (they even gave me a free pet).

IMO, this game isn't afraid to be cute and light, and neither is it afraid to be dark. This is reflective of the writing and plot, to the characters you meet and enemies you fight. Unlike most single player RPGs that become far too cute, or completely dark with no hope for salvation, or "try to hard comedic" with jokes that bash you're head in, this game is a combination of every world, and in nice moderation. I felt after my time spent in the game, I got to see its dark aspects, but never forgot how cute it was. Especially with the immense varying between areas. I adored how one city made me feel fresh and relaxed, while others made me feel rigid and attentive. The same goes for the characters you meet along the way. Even the monsters have great diversity.

There was nothing wrong with the gameplay.

What I felt was this game was very REACTIVE as opposed to PROACTIVE. I was constantly waiting to react during fights, either waiting for my cast bar to finish and react with another skill, or reacting to a boss attack field by moving out of the way. Many MMOs have you proactively moving to avoid damage rather than reacting to a boss attack field. And those same MMOs don’t have a cast time for every single skill, thus creating a rhythmic flow to attack skill rotation (PROACTIVE) rather than waiting on dreary cast bars (REACTIVE). In general this made my gameplay feel lackluster at times. But this never detracted from overall gameplay. Mind you, mastering cast bar skill rotation (and skill rotation in general) is an art form all its own.\n\nCONCLUSION:I would highly recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRainOnAGrave/recommended/39210/","TheRainOnAGrave","Monday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRainOnAGrave/","26 products in account","Sorry for this long review, if you dont wont to read, then all the other ine sentence reviews should convince you to get this game. this is pretty much just details on the game itself and my thoughts on them. i dont think i get really specific so if you wanna know more just go to the wiki or the play guide http://store.steampowered.com\n\nPros (in my opinion, obviously)\nMost Classic RPG experiance in an MMO that ive had in a while. its its pretty rare these days where you start off as an actual  normal adventurer and get quests from an adventurers guild. these days most mmos are just replica of "you are a chosen one! now go fight evil" sorta thing.\n\nThe combat system is about the same as the standard good old formula, has som pretty animations for combat as well. The Gear and weapons have a nice aesthetic feeling to them and they get the look of the gear right as well, going from begginners gear to higher level gear, it actually matches what it looks like in comparison to the level. no flashy beginners gear. to bad that there is no costume slots so you can use the image of old gear, but most of them look great to begin with.\n\nA great part of the class mechanics is that once you reach lvl15 on your first class, you can choose to pick up any other class and conintue with that, of course starting from level one again. but if you dont want to do this you can always start a new character, since they give a generous amount of character slots per world (at least after the ifrst month of paid sub).\n\nThe Story is quite typical of a final fantasy game, chocka block full of characters and plot. since i play most games while listening to something,  i usually dont pay much attention to what the npc's say and just follow quest obj, but this has probably been one of only 10 or so games that i dont do that.\n\nAnimations, Graphics and Design of Final Fantasy 14 are quite good, if you look around you realise that every npc, wheteher they be friend or enemy, has a ton of idle animations and animations while being interacted with. for me who uses a pretty low end pc (basically what the minimum it states, maybe a bit lower) its still looks quite beautiful.\n\nThe Environment and world itself is quite expansive,though it is section off into different regions. For example Thanalan (name of whole region) -> split into North, South East, e.t.c\n\nThere is thankfully no game breaking pay to win gear. though there is gear that you can by with real money, its aesthetic stuff like mounts and costumes. basically all you can by with real money is -> The game itself + paid DLC ( which so far is only heavensward), the sub needed to play and aesthetic stuff like premium dyes, mounts, nostalgic costumes and little pets that will follow you around.\n\nAlso if you happen to be a japanophile like me you can hav Jap audio with english sub. just saying, but theres nothing wrong with the english voice actors, they're acutally pretty good.\n\nCons\ni wished that they would add more voices to the cutscenes and general talking to npcs, because so far only important mission cutscenes have voice.\n\nmaybe no sub fee or a lower one, its pretty heavy on my wallet since i play alot. hahaha\n\nsometimes around really big updates the launcher freaks out and does a bunch of erros and you'll end up redownloading it or searching the internet for an answer.\n\n","March 7","true","168.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Threeinone/recommended/39210/","Threeinone","Threeinone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Threeinone/","180 products in account","Honestly my favorite modern MMO. I've put countless hours into it and still find it endlessly enjoyable. The classes are all fun and unique, the crafting is active and interesting, and thanks to the job system you can experience everything the game has to offer with a single character.\n\nI took a break after finishing end game and getting all best in slot gear for my main class, but when I came back I found out that there was almost double the endgame content as when I left. This game is ever changing and ever expanding, new content is being added quite regularly, and it's not just new raids or dungeons. Whole new story quests, expanding on the lore, are added extremely often.\n\nI'm going to sum up my feelings in a list of good and bad from my perspective,\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nWhat's the good:\n\nThe combat: It's slower then most other MMOs but that is a benefit, giving you more time to make a choice on what to do next and how it will be effective. It flows naturally and feels satisfying with just the right amount of power. Later in the game a boss fight stops being just a harder monster you need to work through, but instead becomes a kind of dance, each member of your party having their own role on the stage.\n\nThe Quests: Yes, they are a lot of fetch quests and breadcrumbs, it's nothing special in the MMO world... But it somehow is. With all the dialog, lore, and the streamlined loot system, the quests in this game somehow transcend the "Go here and do this" standard. The first major thing you might notice? The quest givers know damned well what you're there for, the world has a long history of adventurers and questors, everyone knows you're there to help them with anything and damned if they are not going to take advantage of it. This makes for quite a fun experience as you do the most basic tasks for someone too lazy to pick up vegetables that are literally 5 feet away, and they acknowledge it. If you play and get to level 50, I HIGHLY recommend the "Hildibrand" Quest series started in Ul'dah, it will have you laughing till the end.\n\nThe Dungeons: The dungeons in this game are basic, but awesome. Each able to be run in about 20-30 minutes and comprising of 3-4 bosses and trash. But they have a ton of atmosphere and charm, each one clearly was carefully crafted to be both visually appealing and challenging. And don't be fooled when you see the labels of "Hard mode" when you get to end game, Hard mode dungeons are not in fact just more difficult versions like in other MMOs, the game designers in fact go back and remake a dungeon from scratch, using the same location but a different path, with different trash and different bosses. Every Hard Mode is a whole new dungeon with a whole new story to it, causally taking place after the events you caused in the normal mode.\n\nCommunity: Other then a few bad eggs and elitists the community is extremely helpful and kind, you should never lack any help if you need it just by asking around. The game actually incentivizes high levels to help low levels with the Syncing system where a high level in specific situations can scale his/her level down to match a dungeon/quest/fate.\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nWhat is Bad:\n\nGlobal Clock: All actions by players and mobs are on a global clock. This gives the game a somewhat turn based feel to it where everything is in time and synced together. Why is this bad? Because for more then a few classes in order to get the most out of your abilities you need to time them PERFECTLY based on this clock, and the fact that you can't see or interact with it means that you'll be guessing based on the countdown on your abilities. Best example of this being a problem is on the summoner Job, where timing your dots right makes the difference of 100% of your damage or 80% of your damage if you get it wrong.\n\nInsanely difficult dice roll quests: At end game, there is a series of quests to get your "best" weapon. This is... the most bull ♥♥♥♥ you will ever have to face in a game. You have to win 12 random dice rolls, and failing one means having to try again... Did I mention that each dice roll happens AFTER you finish one of the many random events around the world? That you have to wait up to 15 minutes for? Even with higher drop chance it is still Bull. (My best time for completing this quest.. 6 days, friend took more then 2 weeks) Lucky that this is optional.\n\nCharacter creation limitations: What's that? Wanna play with a friend who already plays the game? What's that? They are on the Levi Server? Well FK YOU! Servers every now and then (some more then others, to the point of being closed more often then open) will close their gate to new players, this is done to keep the servers from being over loaded, but this has the nasty side effect of keeping players from playing together on the servers they want, specially the more populated ones where you have more people to interact with and more options for guilds/fcs. Why is this done? Well that brings me to my last problem.\n\nGold Spammers: Yup, the ever present MMO issue is here but 1000x worse. These pesky parasites will spam all chats, all areas, all the time. They even personally PM you with their virus ridden web links, promising massive amounts of gil for your hard earned money. This is done through the in game player search, where they just have to go alphabetically to find every single one of us and spam us one at a time. Of course they get banned, only to instantly make a new random name account and get right back into the game. they come in the thousands and they want all of your money, and in my opinion is the sole reason that servers are rotated the way they are. It's annoying, it's frustrating, and no mater how many of them you block there are always 5 more to take their place. Every now and then Square does a mass Hardware ban and that quiets them for a week or so wile they buy new computers/servers but it's only a temporary fix to a permanent problem.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nAll in all, in my opinion, the good outweighs the bad. This game is an experience, an amazing experience. I've never had more fun with an MMO in my life and I'm not sure I ever will. No one would have thought that after the disaster that was the original FFXIV that this would be what comes out of it. I ask any of you reading, at LEAST give the 2 week free trial a chance.\n\nYou have nothing to loose but a whole world to gain.","April 12, 2015","true","631.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has such amazing visuals, at least for an MMO of this style, the story is well written, dungeons and partying up is extremely fun, and the fact that you do not have to make a million characters to play all the different classes, you can just make one character and master all the classes and jobs with that one character.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/relmdrifter/recommended/39210/","relmdrifter","RelmDrifter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/relmdrifter/","115 products in account","I love this game! All the Final Fantasy characters and monsters! You don't need a new character to play a different class/job! The music is amazing! The story quests are easy to track, and put you at the center as the Hero of Light. Everyone is fighting for the same casue, no good vs bad, so you don't have to worry about being in the wrong place and getting smashed by another player.\n\nThere is pvp arena's for those who like to. Plenty of things to do, like hunts, treasure maps, the Hildibrand story line, Chocobo racing. Speeking of Chocobo's, you get one early on for a mount, and it doubles as a companion to fight with you.\n\nThe Duty finder is helpful to get into instances when your friends or Free Company members are not around. It also looks to other servers to find players, as well as being a cross-platform with the PlayStation version. Thats right, controllers and KB/M playing side by side\n\nYour are rewarded for your total subscription time, no need to pay every month if you don't want to, you still get the rewards when you have meet the amount of days payed (exp. your first 30 days payed earns a reward, you can not play for a year, and when you pay again, you get the 60 days reward. After a few, it starts to take more time between rewards).\n\nFighting in this game requires you to move to not be hit by mobs attacks. Even as a caster, you must pay attention to what is coming your way, and sometimes it is just a matter of knowing where to stand to get spells off before you have to move again.\n\nEverything in this game looks great, the characters and equipment, mobs and bosses, zones and backdrops, and of course, the cutscenes! Oh and the spells and ability!!\n\nThere is even a Limit Break system while in instances. A shared guage that builds up to 3 levels, and the different class groups (exp. casters, healer, tank, dps) have a different limit break. A level 3 healer limit break will raise all dead party members, casters cast meteor. Time it right and save the day!\n\nCrafting, almost forgot crafting! You don't just click a button and wait for a bar to fill. You have skills to use as a crafter. Skill rotation helps determine output quality. Plus quests for your craft, and the gear just for crafting. Some of the crafting gear is also styled around what you are crafting.\n\nGathering jobs are  miner, botanist, and fisher\n\nFree companies have houses that provide a place to grow crops for cooking or feed for your chocobo, training dummys to practice your rotation, and a few vendors for repairing equipment, buying regents, or just selling junk.\n\nAll of these things (and so much more) tie together wonderfully, and give (me at least) a sense of place in the grand scheme of things.\nThis, compared to one other mmo I played a lot of, is a huge difference. I just didn't feel the other game gave me any drive to "do great things" other than to complete a quest, or run a instance for the fun of it. I never felt like I was part of the Big Picture. Kind of hard to put into words, and maybe I just did not play with the "right" players, and I never made it to end game raids.\n\nOver all, FFXIV is Best MMO I have ever played, and still crave to play!\nI Hope you find this review helpful. :)\n\n(If my review has helped you decide, and/or you just like it, maybe you could toss some change to my steam wallet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iagolx/recommended/39210/","iagolx","iagolx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iagolx/","55 products in account","Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn is a new version of the original game, just called Final Fantasy 14 Online, which came to be considered a complete failure. The title, available for PS3 and PC, did not disappoint in his recovery and has met the expectations of fans.\nRealm Reborn is a very appropriate name for the game, as he was redone from scratch and this is already felt in its first minutes. Not just the game system, but also its history, characters and operation. Even those who were at advanced levels in the previous version here returning from scratch, entirely renovated.\n\nAnd so resumes the story of Eorzea, where goes the adventure. Entitled to reset characters and a new mythology, the player gradually gets involved in the action and drama lived by this world. Arriving with his hero in a city, out of nowhere, it needs to give their all to be recognized as someone of value.\n\n\nThe character creation system is well done and complete. Even in the PS3, with commands totally focused on the joystick, it is possible to find and not get lost in the confusing menus. The game does not disappoint in this initial step and is quite complete in everything from races options the initial classes, through appearance setting.\n\nThe introduction also fulfills its role well, with a story narrated in the third person and scenes breathtaking, setting the stage for what the player must face over the next few hours - and they are many. As a true MMORPG, Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn has a lot of content.\n\nAs in any game genre, the evolution of the characters is due to the missions to be accomplished and advanced levels. Here the experience levels are back (remember they are gone in Final Fantasy 13?), Then the progression is natural. At each level, new skills and more news are unlocked, but there are some surprises.\n\nThe first is the possibility of moving level with each class available in the game and others that can be enabled. Unlike other online RPGs, it is not necessary to create several characters to test other classes of heroes. Here you can simply decide that tired of being warrior and changing careers, becoming mage or archer. Of course, this will reset the level that chosen profession, but the former remains.\n\nThis kind of change only adds personality of A Realm Reborn, striving to be a MMORPG different from the others, even though some follow successful trends - such as own missions. Fortunately the class system works very well, recalling the classic Final Fantasy Tactics at times - after all, many professions require various levels in others and so on, just as you learned in PlayStation 1.\n\nIn fact, much in the Realm Reborn seems to have been inspired by previous games in the series. Elements ranging from the class system up to some spells, elements, materials and so on. Overall, the game risks trying to please enough who is long-time fan, although it can be availed by those who favor recently.\n\n\nWe will not lie, the gameplay of Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn fit like a glove to the game. Everything is very well fitted both on the PC, as the PS3. Play on either platform is a rewarding experience, which is even more impressive for console users.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that everything works well in DualShock 3 control, and even the PC version is fully compatible with an Xbox 360 control plugged into the computer. Commands are natural, menus can be easily accessed and attacks are activated easily, quickly and accurately, as a struggle requires.\n\n\nThis type of adaptation is played master of Square Enix, since the game can be availed on both platforms with just one account. Unfortunately you have to buy it twice, once on the PC and one on the PS3, to play with them, but later the first month tuition - $ 15 every 30 days - goes for both platforms simultaneously. A nice plus.\n\nIn addition, all the characters, friends list and historical are saved in both the PC and the PS3, the online server of the producer. This happens because the game is exclusively online, of course, but there is an advantage in this.\n\nA Realm Reborn has decent graphics to be called a legitimate representative of the Final Fantasy saga. With the right effects jaw-dropping, neat monsters and spells with many special elements, the game does not make ugly, despite the PS3 version lose a little - just a little - the title on the PC.\n\nAnother point that stands out are the very cities. Some, at first, are very small, but then it changes exponentially. The player soon stumbles upon megacities, stuffed characters, either other players or the computer, but what matters here is the visual. A quick Internet search reveals, for those who do not have the game, as he is really beautiful in their environment, something that is difficult in a MMO, in many cases.","July 21, 2015","true","264.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought the pacing and grinding was awful, i could never get past lvl 30 because by then I was too bored. This game however is something else. I'm a lvl 54 paladin by now. Here's why: there's a very captivating storyline, the gameplay mechanics are awesome (although the global cooldown might be a bit slow for some), the pacing is brilliant; you level quickly due to the main scenario quests and a thing called dungeon roulette (the game throws you in a random dungeon for an exp reward).\nPerhaps the most important thing (for me at least) since I never got to the endgame of an MMO before: the community is extremely helpful for new players, be it the guild you're in or the randomly selected partymembers with which you have to clear a dungeon. People were always ready to help out.\nThere's also a lot of nostalgia-bombing for fans of Final Fantasy, but you absolutely don't have to have played the games beforehand.\nOverall I recommend this game for newer MMORPG players as well as older players.","February 3","true","399.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Questing is required to unlock features, but they all tie into the primary storyline which makes it all come together as a very well written book with twists.\n\nIf you like a game that is built to actually play and comes with a very good storyline.

While the combat is simplified, it's neither too simple nor too frustrating, and the native controller support is an absolute joy. More depth and complexity can be found in the crafting and gathering systems, although the game is still quite easy to understand.\n\nThe world, while only consisting of a few maps, is gorgeous, memorable, and full of detail, both in characters and environment.\n\nThe music is also fantastic, expressing a broad array of emotions, from the tender to the grand. The boss music as well is varied and intense and uses a variety of styles and instrumentation.\n\nAchievement hunters might find the game a bit of a grind, as some of the achievements are literally just grindwalls, especially the ones relating to the game's minigame hub, but the fact that most game systems have achievements attached to them, and the sheer array of activities that can be done, mean achievement-hunting is fairly involved and interesting from an intellectual point of view.","March 2","true","773.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the combat is simplified, it's neither too simple nor too frustrating, and the native controller support is an absolute joy. More depth and complexity can be found in the crafting and gathering systems, although the game is still quite easy to understand.\n\nThe world, while only consisting of a few maps, is gorgeous, memorable, and full of detail, both in characters and environment.\n\nThe music is also fantastic, expressing a broad array of emotions, from the tender to the grand. The boss music as well is varied and intense and uses a variety of styles and instrumentation.\n\nAchievement hunters might find the game a bit of a grind, as some of the achievements are literally just grindwalls, especially the ones relating to the game's minigame hub, but the fact that most game systems have achievements attached to them, and the sheer array of activities that can be done, mean achievement-hunting is fairly involved and interesting from an intellectual point of view.","March 2","true","773.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a large variation of classes and dungeons to partake in with a vast variety of people to meet in the process. The game is very grind extensive, but it's an mmo so it's expected. End game is where must of the fun is to be had, but it isn't a challenge to reach end game. Overall, Final Fantasy XIV: ARR accomplishes what many mmo(s) already accomplish, but it does so within a realm related to the final fantasy series which makes it succeed more than other games.

Sticks to many of the traditional aspects that made the genre popular while putting its own spin on things, as well as keeping the Final Fantasy vibe alive and well.  Final Fantasy fans who are not very familiar with MMORPGs will find this to be a good entry point into the genre. MMO fans should get enjoyment out of it even if they are not big into the Final Fantasy series, although they may not appreciate it as much as somebody who is very familiar with the Final Fantasy series.  Even if you aren't a fan of playing MMOs, you can still get a good experience just by playing through the main storyline.  Since the first month of game time comes free, that gives you more than enough time to play through the story if that's all you desire to do. It's definitely worth picking up and trying. It's a fun game and my MMO of choice.","June 23, 2015","true","340.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I say that, having played all the popular (and not only) mmorpgs out there.\n\nThe overall design is just FLAWLESS, and for that the game designers have my utmost respect.I don't just mean that about the graphics. The music of the primal encounters, and other major fights are just epic, well made, inspiring pieces.\nThe boss encounters do have very interesting mechanics at time, but - as everything - once you conquer them they turn easier.\n\nThe game offers a LOT to do, and it's fun as long as you interract with others.\nGetting into a good Guild (Free Company) is a great tip for newcommers. Many players are helpful and offer tips, and you can forge relationships which is up to you if they last.\nThe social experience is there, and that's a part of MMOs players neglet a lot as they blindly rush towards endgame.\nI know I did that, and I've got ~450 hours played in about a month that I started this game.\nThat said, this game is addicting, much like any mmorpg you enjoy (won't name other popular ones)- mmorpg players will understand.\n\nThe monthly subscription is not even worth mentioning as everybody who has played mmorpgs before knows there's a vast difference in game quality, support, and other features when a game has subscription. What you pay for, you get.\nShould be mentioned that the game itself is relatively cheap and comes with a 30 days sub-free to try out.\nThere's also a trial version available in which you can play for 2 weeks with max level 20 (and other restrictions).\nI'm quite sure a game for a console costs more(about 3 times as much) and it's a 1 week experience tops.\n\nIn a market where going Free to Play seems like the only option to maintain a game, this game grows.\nCredit for that goes to it's nice comunity, it's regular updates, it's low downtimes, it's nice optical and accoustical experience, and most importantly to the fact that this very game in it's 1.0 version failed horribly, shut down, and was Reborn, as the title suggests, into what is currently one of the greatest of it's kind.\n\nAdditional awesomeness points go to writers/translators or whoever named the Quests and FATEs in the game (FATE = Events that happen randomly in the world) - The naming is just great, at times I found myself just laughing at the screen with the things I was reading.\nThe game is so well written I cannot even begin to explain.\n\nOverall, I feel the game was one of the most worthy purchases I've made in quite a while.","September 12, 2014","true","861.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The world design is wonderful, bringing life to new areas with each update. Dungeons are fun, interesting, and easy to get into. While there is a primary storyline, which you need to follow to unlock different aspects of the game, a lot of the side quest are unique and very filling. When I say filling, I simply mean that there is a lot of "stuff" to do. From slaughtering cacturns, to exploring new areas; each quest comes along with an interesting narrative.\n\nWhen I first started to play, I joined up with two pals from beta. They were significantly higher level than me, but were able to help me by lowering level to match my own. It really made the game more fun, and we got a few good laughs out of the dungeons. They had me join up in their Free Company, and now I've got lots of people to just hang out with and dungeon run with.\n\nSure the cost isn't exactly cheap, but it is easily worth the monthly fee. Besides that, the only real issue is that even on the lowest graphics, it can still slow down a computer to a crawl.","July 17, 2014","true","30.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even on the newer servers!\n\nThey offer a cheaper subscription offer to those that only want 1 character per server, which is GREAT!\n\nThis and WoW are the only MMO's I believe that will continue to thrive with a subscription model.

I had friends who had played before ARR and I had friends who had played after the release.   While one set said the game had been terrible and they were never touching it again, those who played after ARR's release said that the game was well worth the monthly sub.   Deciding to see for myself; I, my significant other, and our friends decided to buy the game and check it out.   It suffices to say, I was not disappointed.\n\nFFXIV: ARR takes points from all current MMO's, polishes them, and then puts them on a pedestal for all their players to view and enjoy.   I've played GW2, WoW, RIFT, Terra, and SW:TOR, but nothing comes close to the pure satisfaction of embracing a truly well made Final Fantasy MMORPG.   FFXIV: ARR has recovered from all of it's mistakes in the past, to bring out a wonderful game that sticks true to it's Final Fantasy roots and will leave you begging for more.\n\nFrom the game soundtrack to the storyline, FFXIV: ARR has shown itself as a competitor to take place among the "legends" of the MMO industry.  The Dungeons are paced wonderfully, and show challenge when you need it, the quests are fulfilling and give you a sense of purpose within the game and objectives like FATE's and Guildhests give players exactly what they need; smooth enjoyable fun.\n\nFrom furthering yourself in crafting items and gear, to fighting monsters and bosses, each task takes an enjoyable amount of time.  Having only put in about 75 hours, I've found myself enthralled by  the depth of each action, and the amount of polish that has gone into the game to make it the work of art that it is now.\n\n+ Great Storyline.\n+ Battle system is enjoyable.\n+ Wonderful music.\n+ Enjoyable community.\n+ Smooth gameplay.\n\n10/10.","April 21, 2014","true","421.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're new to the Final Fantasy world or an old fan boy like myself, you would truly enjoy everything this game has to offer. The only drawback I have with this game is the pvp. It needs fine tuning and the battles are completely unbalanced. You have to go in with a cookie cutter group. Pugs are usually cannon fodder in pvp.\n\nMy favorite aspect of this game is the job system. You have several base classes in which you will later combine to create an advanced class. Some classes can cross abilities. For example: My Black Mage can use some of my Archers abilities or buffs. The cross platform is fantastic as well since I can play with friends who prefer to play on their PS3's.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kicksspecials/recommended/39210/","Kicksspecials","MilesFrozen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kicksspecials/","393 products in account","Final Fantasy XIV: A realm reborn is a really fun MMO. Being a WoW player from late vanilla and jumped to GW2 but got bored from it after a couple of weeks later when it was released and then jumped to Final Fantasy XIV: A realm reborn when it came to steam.I can say that i have more fun playing this MMO then when i playing GW2 and what WoW is becoming today.\n\nTo be honest i never played a Final Fantasy from the main series before but did played some DS spinoff games and came to this game and the main series as a stranger but i always wanted to try out a FF game from the main series. From have completed the main story in this MMo i think i can make a review of this game.\n\nThe first thing you should know is that if you were expecting a different MMO then World of Warcraft you gonna be disapointed but if you liked WoW from what it is you can feel a bit comfort here. You got your Kill X creatures and Collect Y things and also some talk to NPC quests but the game does not take the amount you need kill or collect as crazy as most MMo's. At later levels you mostly need to kill like 6-10 while at early levels not even more then 3. Also this game has just like WoW the Holy trinity (Tank,DPS and Healer) where also you can also play dungeons with people from other servers. But unlike WoW the normal instances are 4 man and the bigger instances 8 man but you also got a 24 man raid.\n\nOne of the key differences from WoW is that you can change to every class in the game on 1 character meaning that you dont have to make alts. I personally like this a lot and you can also be every gathering and crafting class aswell. if you level more classes you can even share some of the skills they have with other classes but not all of them, Kinda replaces the game from having no talent tree or talent skills.\n\nThe game does have a story and you progress through it by completing story quests. The game kinda forces you to follow the story quests because most of the game features are only unlocked by doing these quest making the first levels from 1 - 30 on your first class a long tutorial but after that games opens more up and the game does not really feel that slow. The game does feel a bit slow on every class first levels but as you go on the class becomes a lot more intresting.\n\nThe game also have guilds but here they are called Free Company's in this game but as you go through the story you also need to choose a Nations Grand Company wich you discover more from as you go on with the game.\n\nLastly if you are more of a PVP person you gonna also gonna be a bit disapointed because right now the only PVP is a 4vs4 Arena battle like in WoW and there is no way to duel people in the world and Open pvp is also not in the game.\n\nSo that kinda concludes my review on this game. if i tell about everything then this review goes out of hand. Overall i really like this MMO and wishes it to even improve more in the future. And i cant wait to do all the end game content now that i completed the main story but to be honest the story does go even further after you completed the real main story of the game. If you are unsure if you can run this game you can download a benchmark from the official site of the game where you can also Create a character beforehand so you dont have to that when you buyed the game and the benchmark is free.","April 10, 2014","true","424.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

All gear has a level limit which is determined by the class, but some may also be stricted to specific classes, preventing your level 1 Marauder running around in level 50 Lancer gear, or even the other way around.\n\nI still need to decide if I will be continuing this after my initial subscription expires, but currently it is optimistic :)","July 6, 2014","true","23.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_silver/recommended/39210/","_silver","Silver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_silver/","54 products in account","This is a beautiful, immersive and meticulously detailed game, the amazing gameplay of which will reel in franchise fans and newcomers alike. While Final Fantasy XIV is unlike its single player predecessors, the lore recognizeable by the long time FF fans creates a story with depth and character interactions generally forgotton by MMO creators.\n\nAs such, the attention to detail regarding idiosyncracies of certain characters is conveyed through their speech, and this attention to detail extends to the environment as well. Small things that one would barely notice can be found in the game, such as the pattern of shadow created by light shining through a grate, as well as that shadow adjusting alongside the in game time of day; the stitching on armors and clothing, right down to the shadows created by them on the player; and many more details that add to the game's wonderful environment.\n\nWithin this environment is gameplay that is executed uniquely, and superbly. Skills operate in a style familiar to MMO players, with a relatively short global cooldown, and individual skill cooldowns which vary depending on the strength and usefulness of the skill. Combat utilizes a TP, similar to a stamina system, while magic utilizes the classic MP. Some magic skills of which rely on a casting time, which occurs at the same time as the global cooldown, making casting fluent yet balanced. Skills can be clicked, hotkeyed, setup through user macros, and so forth. The combat truly appeals to every style of play, as well as every player through its broad range of classic Final Fantasy jobs that players can quest as.\n\nThe questing is reminiscent of other MMOs, and yet the game approaches these concepts in ways that makes them less of a grind than they could be. Rather than the traditional, "Kill 50 of this monster," or ,"Gather 30 of this material," the quests bring these numbers down to 5s and 3s, which allows the player to take the time to actually understand WHY they are doing what they are doing.\n\nFurthermore, many players will actually be ABLE to do what they want to be doing, for the game has been optimized wonderfully. Areas are divided by loading zones, but the transition between these is so fluent and quick that it took me this long to even remember they were there. With easy to use presets such as "High end PC" or "Low end laptop," adjusting settings is user friendly. If you would like to adjust things yourself, there is of course an option for custom settings.\n\nYet what truly sold me on the game, what I believe to be the greatest of its qualities, is the job change system. Many MMOs have you make one character, choose one class or destiny for them, and that's that. You're either forced to pay for some sort of reset, make a new character, completely start over or combinations of the above. NOT in Final Fantasy XIV. By simply equipping a new weapon, your stats, gear, abilities, everything switches to the role that weapon relates to, and you can head back to lower level areas to train yourself anew. This is done WITHOUT losing any of your previous progress. In fact certain jobs can use abilities learned from other classes, and often need to in order to reach their full potential. The best part is that no mistakes can be made with this system. There is no "woops, you didn't train your warrior class so your strength is too low," there is some minor ability point allocation, but this is done easily and can easily be reversed. A single character can serve you for every adventure, and as such, the character creation allows you to bring that perfect character to life.\n\nOne truly could spend a few hours just in the character creator, detailing everything from the muscularity of your character, to their eye color, to the color of the tips of their hair vs the rest of their hair, etcetera, etcetera. There are four basic races each with two deviations in appeance to begin with, and the next perk that comes along is that you don't have to worry about "which race has the best looking armor." Armor is purely based on class, scales based on size, and doesn't vary from race to race, only between genders. There exists a range of emotions to emulate via these characters in game, if roleplay at all interests you, and the community has considerably less..."game challenged" players than other MMOs.\n\nWorth every cent of the subscription fee, Final Fantasy XIV is a game whose developers LISTEN to their community (see the 2.1 Patch) and who truly care about their game. The friendly community, and the freedom and beauty offered by the environment will leave you wondering why you didn't play this game all along.","June 26, 2015","true","302.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

And swapping classes is easy, just swap weapons, and start again at level 1.\n\nAs with all MMOs, even from the first I ever played, Martial Heros Online, came out in 198x, running the old ACSII coding and closed their doors cause they didn't want to upgrade the engine. The tank obsorbs damage whom I heal, and the dpsers attack to take it down faster. Final Fantasy XIV fallows the same line of thought. Who ever heard of the cleric tanking while the warrior healed anyway?\n\nUnlike all other MMOs, at least there is no limit as to what race/class combo you can use. The graphics are high end, to the point that you can even hear the leather creeking with every step you take. The landscape is beautiful, and the story lines can be quite emotional if you pay attention to them. In order to rank high on my scale with story lines, they need just one thing, voice overs for the story tellers to reach the level of immersion as they have in StarWars Online and Skyrim.\n\nThere is housing already imbedded in the game, i have much more to do and accomplish before I can check out those homes, they have free companies, same thing as guilds, and guild housing that can be quite elaborate.\n\nMain draw back I can see, is that they use terms from the 1400s, rather than modern day, and that can get somewhat confusing for the new player who wishes to be a conjurer, back in the 1400s, the healers were indeed called conjurers, as they conjured magicks to heal with. So a conjurer in game, will never be able to conjure a familliar, or demonic entity to fight at their side in the same sence of modern terminalogy would have you disern the class name for.\n\nBy the way, I am Fairen Sila on the Marboro Server, already with a guild full of helpful crafting members. Feel free to join us in game if you are so inclined. once in game hit the chat box "/t mini me" and ask her for an invite, and tell her you read Farien's review.","September 20, 2014","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Do not confuse this game with the atrocity that was XIV 1.0. Square Enix literally dropped a Bahamut meteor on that game to crash the servers and reimagine it as the beautiful experience it is today. Graphics are top-notch, at least if you have a decent enough rig to play it on high quality. The community overall is incredible, though your experience will vary by server, play times, and free company allegiance (FFXIV's version of guilds). Inter-played cooperation is mandatory for endgame content, and the game sets you up very nicely to learn your chosen role well by level 50. And then if you decide you don't like that role... all you have to do is switch weapons to a different class and try again.\n\nHallelujah, no more multiple characters to play multiple classes; I'm looking at you, WoW. Final Fantasy's job system makes it totally feasible to level every class to cap without having to jam up a server with 10 different characters, and you might be surprised by the number of people that do exactly that. Even the crafting system is much more interactive than others I've tried, and it's the crafters and gatherers that drive the game's economy. The sense of community is all-inclusive with plenty of experienced players willing to lend a hand to upstarts, though of course don't expect everyone to be this way. Like any game, this one has its elitists but the funny part is that some of those still haven't beaten the last raid.\n\nThe best pieces of advice I can give you are these:\n\n1) If you buy the game, give it until around level 30 to start getting truly fun. That's where you unlock your job (as opposed to your class), earning you extra abilities, and it's where the dungeons start to get really fun.\n2) Once you hit level 50, there is a HUGE learning curve jump when you get to extreme mode primals and the Coils of Bahamut. That's not to say these things are impassable, but you will have to buckle down and learn the mechanics rather than expecting a clear on your first try.\n3) If you get lost, use the /sh shout function in chat. Talk to someone! I can almost guarantee there will be someone around to lend a helping hand.\n4) Listen when people give you advice. 90% of the time, they say it because they want to help improve their server's experience, not because they think you're a n00b that sux.\n5) If you're new to the game and chose the Brynhildr server, hit up Taliel Sicilian. ;)","January 1, 2015","true","790.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game creates a wonderful atmosphere with it's visually stunning graphic style and quality. It also features one of the hardest sets of raid content I have ever experienced. The game has a large variety of raids and dungeons at varying difficulties that allow for both casual and hard core raiders to enjoy themselves. The easier raids are just slightly more mechanically driven than WoW's Raid Finder while the highest tier of raids take more skill than almost any MMO I have played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritofbillymays/recommended/39210/","spiritofbillymays","Berninator | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritofbillymays/","251 products in account","I played WoW for 6ish years on and off, and when I was gifted a subscription by my sister, who gave high praise of it, I I thought it couldn't play that differently. WoW set a very rigid image of how an MMO was set up to milk time whenever possible from the user to give the illusion of accomplishment. However, I began to notice very quickly that where WoW wasted your time, FFXIV ditched those gameplay mechanics and replaced it with something more sensable.\n\nFirst, I'll give you a brief look at classes, money, and travel. Travel first because its simple. Remember all those long flight times, and even with flying mounts it didn't compensate for having to traverse the continuous, no-loading-screen continents. In FFXIV you teleport to the zone and that's it, no fuss, maybe a little walking if your destination is in the back of zone.\n\nThis ties directly into money, so that's next. In FFXIV quests actually give you some substantial amounts of money for getting everything you need from gear to materials for professions. However, repair costs ramp rather quickly, as do teleportation expenses, so part of managing your character becomes maintaining enough income to sustain everything you need. Daily quests and dungeon queues are actually important if you don't maintain any crafting/gathering skills, unlike WoW where they're a chore simply to improve a reputation with a side faction.\n\nClasses are completely different as well. Unlike WoW where you get locked into focusing on a class unless you want to start up a whole new character, and restricted to 2 professions, FFXIV puts no barriers in your way. One character can level to 50 on every tank, dps, healer, crafting and gathering profession, and there are economic and gameplay insentives for expanding your knowledge of the game with this. Every class/profession has 2-3 cross-class skills that can enchance the abilities of another, not just combat but also in professions. The more professions you level, the easier it becomes to be independant of their version of the Auction House, as well as make boatloads of money.\n\nLast, I guess I can put some facts down about differences in guilds and endgame. In WoW, you had to find a dedicated guild and organize parties yourself to complete 10 or 25 raids, which essentially the home to all the best-in-slot gear. They eventually added in a token system where hard 5 mans and the 10 mans would grant accumulative currency for buying equivalent or near-BiS items. However, you'd find yourself tediously working through a raid clear all week, and very rarely a boss would drop something useful to you (and you actually win the roll), making it akin to the lottery everytime you actually got something you needed.\n\nIn FFXIV, they bipassed this by making the token gear the BiS in most or all cases. If your gear dropped in 4man dungeons you were always the only class that would be able to need on it, and even in the 8 or 24mans there would rarely be another class-mate (HEH).  Also, there's nothing particularly unique a dps brings to the table than another, same with tanks and healers. Some do things better than others, but the developers saw class balance as an important thing to accomplish, UNLIKE WOW. Holy ♥♥♥♥, just remembering how useless they would make certain classes from patch to patch is infuriating as I'm writing this. That doesn't happen in FFXIV, in fact, you can randomly queue for the endgame raids everyday, multiple times a day if you want. Farming those tokens is easy, and queues are generally short. The only weekly restriction is on the current endgame dungeon's loot, which is 1 drop a week.\n\nTL;DR: FFXIV doesn't waste your time, and seems more interested in enjoyable gameplay than epenis upgrades to flaunt over your fellow players that are more busy IRL.\n","February 14, 2015","true","278.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0NickM0/recommended/39210/","0NickM0","FuzzyB00T","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0NickM0/","275 products in account","If you need a game to spend an (awful) lot of time on, then look no further. Final Fantasy XIV: A realm Reborn is all that you will need, especially with the huge amount of quests and side quests that the game currently has to offer.\n\nLike any MMORPG, FFXIV ARR has different classes, that all work differently. Tanks being the Warrior (Maurauder) and Paladin (Gladiator), the healers being Scholar (Arcanist) and White mage (Conjurer), and finally, the DPS being Dragoon (Lancer), Summoner (Arcanist), Black Mage (Conjurer), Monk (Pugilist), ninja (Rogue) and Bard (Archer). Each class has plenty of abilities to explore, and all play differently, so there's definitely a lot of content there.\n\nThat being said, I don't think all classes are equally fun to play. Dragoons and Warriors aren't the funnest to play, but the fun classes definitely make up for that. My personal reccomendations would be:\nTank: Paladin\nHealer: White Mage & Scholar\nDPS: Monk, Black Mage, Summoner\n\nClasses themselves are a lot of fun to explore, especially because the way the game handles classchanges: just simply change weapon, and your character becomes that class. No need for additional characters, or a lot of abra cadabra to change around a class, but very straight forward and easy. Even a casual outfit is possible, for in your "spare time", and hiding your weapons / headpieces on these is done with the single click of a button.\n\nBesides combat classes, the game also offers multiple jobs to do, which you can also access with the same system. It's possible to craft your own weapons and armor with the different classes the game has to offer, or make extra Gil (= in game currency) with gatherers or with the same professions. Although not all of them are equally fun, there's plenty of fun to be had here as well. The only classes i don't really recommend here, except maybe for the gil, are miner, fisher and cook. Sadly, cooking seems a bit pointless in the game from as far as i've found out, except for slight XP boosts, or some additional effects.\n\nThe classes are easy to understand and straight forward. If you level one class far enough, you even get the possibilty to use certain abilities of one class on another, in a nice cross class system. Say for example you have a level 50 warrior, and want to use tank abilities that your level 18 gladiator has. It would be possible to have a couple of these abilities on your high leveled warrior, for more tanking badassery.\n\nThat's enough ♥♥♥♥ about the classes, now onto the juicy quests and most important of all, the badass l00t! :D\n\n♥♥♥♥'s good. Go get it.\n\nBut in all seriousness, although there are a lot of "Go fetch", "travel 'round the world for me" and "go feed dem soldiers, guardian of light" missions, which unfortunately are boring and a lot of running around, the GOOD missions definitely make up for this. You can go into dungeons, trials (read bosses), guildhests (read tutorials) can farm F.A.T.E's (read events) and leves (read ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of xp for 'allowances'). Most of them definitely help level up your character, but when you reach max level, only trials, dungeons and raids would be in your interest, along with marks. These give you the epic l00t you were looking for :3\n\nYou don't have to l00t the defeated enemies, but drops will automatically be added to your inventory.\n\nIf you didn't feel like reading it all, there's also a TL,DR version:\n\nTLDR:\n\n♥♥♥♥'s good. Classes be fun. L00T epic. Go buy it.","February 3, 2015","true","452.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_silver/recommended/39210/","_silver","Silver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_silver/","54 products in account","This is a beautiful, immersive and meticulously detailed game, the amazing gameplay of which will reel in franchise fans and newcomers alike. While Final Fantasy XIV is unlike its single player predecessors, the lore recognizeable by the long time FF fans creates a story with depth and character interactions generally forgotton by MMO creators.\n\nAs such, the attention to detail regarding idiosyncracies of certain characters is conveyed through their speech, and this attention to detail extends to the environment as well. Small things that one would barely notice can be found in the game, such as the pattern of shadow created by light shining through a grate, as well as that shadow adjusting alongside the in game time of day; the stitching on armors and clothing, right down to the shadows created by them on the player; and many more details that add to the game's wonderful environment.\n\nWithin this environment is gameplay that is executed uniquely, and superbly. Skills operate in a style familiar to MMO players, with a relatively short global cooldown, and individual skill cooldowns which vary depending on the strength and usefulness of the skill. Combat utilizes a TP, similar to a stamina system, while magic utilizes the classic MP. Some magic skills of which rely on a casting time, which occurs at the same time as the global cooldown, making casting fluent yet balanced. Skills can be clicked, hotkeyed, setup through user macros, and so forth. The combat truly appeals to every style of play, as well as every player through its broad range of classic Final Fantasy jobs that players can quest as.\n\nThe questing is reminiscent of other MMOs, and yet the game approaches these concepts in ways that makes them less of a grind than they could be. Rather than the traditional, "Kill 50 of this monster," or ,"Gather 30 of this material," the quests bring these numbers down to 5s and 3s, which allows the player to take the time to actually understand WHY they are doing what they are doing.\n\nFurthermore, many players will actually be ABLE to do what they want to be doing, for the game has been optimized wonderfully. Areas are divided by loading zones, but the transition between these is so fluent and quick that it took me this long to even remember they were there. With easy to use presets such as "High end PC" or "Low end laptop," adjusting settings is user friendly. If you would like to adjust things yourself, there is of course an option for custom settings.\n\nYet what truly sold me on the game, what I believe to be the greatest of its qualities, is the job change system. Many MMOs have you make one character, choose one class or destiny for them, and that's that. You're either forced to pay for some sort of reset, make a new character, completely start over or combinations of the above. NOT in Final Fantasy XIV. By simply equipping a new weapon, your stats, gear, abilities, everything switches to the role that weapon relates to, and you can head back to lower level areas to train yourself anew. This is done WITHOUT losing any of your previous progress. In fact certain jobs can use abilities learned from other classes, and often need to in order to reach their full potential. The best part is that no mistakes can be made with this system. There is no "woops, you didn't train your warrior class so your strength is too low," there is some minor ability point allocation, but this is done easily and can easily be reversed. A single character can serve you for every adventure, and as such, the character creation allows you to bring that perfect character to life.\n\nOne truly could spend a few hours just in the character creator, detailing everything from the muscularity of your character, to their eye color, to the color of the tips of their hair vs the rest of their hair, etcetera, etcetera. There are four basic races each with two deviations in appeance to begin with, and the next perk that comes along is that you don't have to worry about "which race has the best looking armor." Armor is purely based on class, scales based on size, and doesn't vary from race to race, only between genders. There exists a range of emotions to emulate via these characters in game, if roleplay at all interests you, and the community has considerably less..."game challenged" players than other MMOs.\n\nWorth every cent of the subscription fee, Final Fantasy XIV is a game whose developers LISTEN to their community (see the 2.1 Patch) and who truly care about their game. The friendly community, and the freedom and beauty offered by the environment will leave you wondering why you didn't play this game all along.","June 26, 2015","true","302.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a awesome fantasy combining both Eastern and Western styles of MMO and it flows nicely. The combat is very flashy and despite being havily based on PVE, the PVP isn't the worst I've seen. End game content is challenging and extremely rewarding for when you complete a hard raid like Final COil of Bahamut or Alexander Savage.

And that's what drew me to play this game after hearing that the story and music were the best in the FF series in a decade. Having beaten the story up to the end of Heavensward, I can confirm that is true. Although the gameplay is classic MMO, the atmosphere, music and story all bring back memories of the Final Fantasy series.\n\nThe story will have multiple twists and turns and will keep you wanting to know what happens next. The Heavensward expansion is especially good with this imo. To note though, because it is an MMO, there ARE portions of the main story questline that are filled with filler quests and fetch quests. They definitely felt dull, and feel like Square just put them in to increase the amount of "content" in the main story when they didn't need to. Again, the Heavensward expansion did not have that. The main culprit is the post-ARR, patch 2.1-2.4 content.\n\nThe game has some of best FF music in awhile, enough to make me seriously want the soundtrack. There are a lot of memorable area/city music and battle/boss themes. The world and areas are another strength. There are many varied locations in the world, and some beautiful scenes. The lore is extensive, and I can't wait till they open up even more of the world. There is so much left unexplored in the world and story (that will most likely be explored in future content).\n\nIn terms of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me, there isn't too much innovation, but FFXIV:ARR executes everything really well and hence its status as the foremost MMO rival to WoW.","July 26, 2015","true","722.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Do not confuse this game with the atrocity that was XIV 1.0. Square Enix literally dropped a Bahamut meteor on that game to crash the servers and reimagine it as the beautiful experience it is today. Graphics are top-notch, at least if you have a decent enough rig to play it on high quality. The community overall is incredible, though your experience will vary by server, play times, and free company allegiance (FFXIV's version of guilds). Inter-played cooperation is mandatory for endgame content, and the game sets you up very nicely to learn your chosen role well by level 50. And then if you decide you don't like that role... all you have to do is switch weapons to a different class and try again.\n\nHallelujah, no more multiple characters to play multiple classes; I'm looking at you, WoW. Final Fantasy's job system makes it totally feasible to level every class to cap without having to jam up a server with 10 different characters, and you might be surprised by the number of people that do exactly that. Even the crafting system is much more interactive than others I've tried, and it's the crafters and gatherers that drive the game's economy. The sense of community is all-inclusive with plenty of experienced players willing to lend a hand to upstarts, though of course don't expect everyone to be this way. Like any game, this one has its elitists but the funny part is that some of those still haven't beaten the last raid.\n\nThe best pieces of advice I can give you are these:\n\n1) If you buy the game, give it until around level 30 to start getting truly fun. That's where you unlock your job (as opposed to your class), earning you extra abilities, and it's where the dungeons start to get really fun.\n2) Once you hit level 50, there is a HUGE learning curve jump when you get to extreme mode primals and the Coils of Bahamut. That's not to say these things are impassable, but you will have to buckle down and learn the mechanics rather than expecting a clear on your first try.\n3) If you get lost, use the /sh shout function in chat. Talk to someone! I can almost guarantee there will be someone around to lend a helping hand.\n4) Listen when people give you advice. 90% of the time, they say it because they want to help improve their server's experience, not because they think you're a n00b that sux.\n5) If you're new to the game and chose the Brynhildr server, hit up Taliel Sicilian. ;)","January 1, 2015","true","790.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Once you're settled in, it takes at most 30 seconds to queue into the server on prime time.\n\nI play a tank and I get a lot of love because of that. It appears tanks are extremely rare in this game. I always get the award for playing the most needed class. This is an actual reward in the game.\n\nTUTORIAL\nThe tutorial is huge and extremely good. It's not the type of tutorial that holds your hand, treats you like a baby and gives you little bites. It's a big tutorial that lasts throughout the entire first half of the leveling process. More features of the game open up over time, similar to Guild Wars 2's new player experience but not silly like in GW2.\n\nThere are obvious tutorial instances that teach the basics of the trinity and let you actually train and figure out how the mechanics work before you get thrown into a dungeon.\n\nDUNGEONS + DUNGEON ROULETTE\nThere's lots of them. Main quest dungeons, sidequest dungeons, instances that only have a boss in them, etc.\n\nHow does it prevent dungeons from being empty? The duty roulette system gives you a massive boost in rewards once per day. You don't pick a specific dungeon. The roulette picks it for you, meaning you never know what you'll get. Meanwhile, players who need to do a dungeon for their quests/items/gear will get their parties filled.\n\nI'll compare this with GW2 that has a party finding/LFG tool. In there, you need to actually search for party members, which works ok witht he LFG tool. In Guild Wars 1 there was no such tool and you could end up waiting for hours to get a party.\n\nWAITING FOR PARTY\nAs I said before, the roulette fills up parties for massive rewards. It's not unheard of to get nearly an entire level worth of exp using the daily roulette. But how fast does it fill up? For me, as soon as I click the button to start up the search.\n\nWhy? Because I'm a tank and the guy who dragged me into this game is a healer. We only need to find 2 more DPS guys, of which there are bazillions.\n\nAs a tank, I get friend requests all over. People are overly friendly to me. In chats and forums there is talk of not enough tanks in this game. Since I am one, I don't have a problem. But if you prefer playing DPS, you may end up waiting for a while. I've seen players complain about waiting 30 minutes or more.\n\nCOMBAT\nOkay, I'm not a fan of the combat. All I do is press 2 buttons, maybe 3 and just rotate through them. Dungeons may have a few more rotations. Just fighting in the overworld is pretty lame.\n\nDungeon encounters are quite interesting though. You have the regular trash mobs leading up to the boss. Early bosses are pushovers. They gradually get better\n\nCRAFTING\nThere's a huge expansive crafting system. In fact, the gathering classes and crafting classes are quite fleshed out, similar to the combat classes.\n\nIn the beginning it is the old basic ingredient gathering and putting them together. Later on, you need to start making choices, mixed in with a bit of RNG. Using CP, Crafting Points, which are similar to mana points, you can activate skills that can improve the quality of an item, do nothing for a step (this has a use), make you more focused, etc.\n\nAgain, comparing with GW2... In GW2 you put 2-4 items together and press craft. That's it. Here, you put 2-5 (or 6?) items together, but they can be of different qualities, which affects the outcome. You activate skills which further change the outcome. Crafting one item takes several steps. These are not ingredient steps but "attacks" you do. It's not braindead coma crafting.\n\nUSEFULNESS OF CRAFTING IN EARLY LEVELS\nCrafting is actually useful here, even in early levels. I did outlevel my crafting level. I mean, my main tank character got to level 38 but my blacksmith and armorsmith are still around 10. I didn't even need to craft items for my char to use because I got all ym gear from main-quest quest rewards. But that's just one class. There are many other classes and your character can take them all. You onlyneed one character. To swap jobs you swap out your gearset.\n\nWhen I start building my disciples of magic classes, I'll want to craft a bit for those.\n\nAlso, all the quest rewards are normal quality, which is fine. Crafted can get high quality, which has better stats.\n\nCrafting makes more money than it costs, even at low levels. Some items cost 20gil (gold) in ingredients but sell for 500 or more, especially more if it's High Quality.\n\nHOUSING\nDon't bother. It costs 20 million for a house on my server (the oldest one). 100 hours into the game and I've made 140 000 gil and I'm not even max level yet. I haven't focused on making money but I have been preparing for it. I can make some good coin selling whatever I find but I'm a hoarder and so far my hoarding paid off.\n\n♥♥♥♥ THEY DONT TELL YOU\nThere's this thing called retainers. These are NPCs you hire. They are needed to sell stuff on the market (trading post). They are also your bank/storage. You get 2 for free.\n\nThese retainers can be sent on ventures. That means they will go and gather items for you. Either monster drops, mining, woodcutting or fishing.\n\nYou can sell 20 items(for example 20 stacks of items totalling for example 1500 items, so not individual items.) per retainer.\n\nVentures, unlike what you may read in outdated posts on the internet, are super cheap to buy.\n\nHere's what they don't tell you: You can buy additional retainers, for real money, at about 1-2 bucks per month. This is on top of the subscription fee.\n\nSome don't like that. I don't really care. It may be a reason not to get the game.\n\nIt essentially is monthly microtransactions in a sub game.\n\nSpeaking of microtransactions... there's a lot of cosmetic things that can go up to and over 25 bucks. Like mounts.\n\nI HAVE NOT REACHED ENDGAME YET\nI'll update this if I remember to do so.\n\n----------------------------\nOLD VERSION\n\nFriend told me to get this game. Spent the 10 bucks... Been maybe 7 hours since I installed and am still on char creation screen waiting for the server to open.\n\nThis may be a common issue in this type of MMO, having full servers and then having to wait and refresh and wait for a spot to open up, waiting for hours or days... it still means you're not actually playing...\n\nWhile the server selection screen has nice sparklers and new age music harp music, it's not really all that fun.","April 12","true","622.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Need a break from enemies? There's entire classes devoted to gathering and crafting you can switch to on the fly (one character can have every single class, almost like specs in another game with no respec cost). There's many mini games, even an entire zone dedicated solely to mini games (the Gold Saucer behaves much like the one in FFVII).\n\nGathering professions are considerably more involving than other games; and even fishing's enjoyable (though, a bit limited- take in small doses).\n\nThe game looks and sounds nice, but some of the voice acting is... questionable. Also, there's still a sub fee.\n\nThat said- for a mainstream MMO it's one of the best, and I'm hard pressed to think of one that has the same general appeal for the f2p. Sides, a month of gameplay for an hour's work at minimum wage, or two starbucks coffees, has never seemed unreasonable to me.","January 30","true","58.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ontgiveafuck/","160 products in account","Ohh...\n\nOhhh...\n\nWhere do I begin?..\n\nBeing a fan of the original FFXIV (not for the gameplay, mind; I'm not that dumb), I finally came back home to Eorzea to find out what exactly happened at the end of the storyline of the original game. And I'll admit, it took some doing to get past the trivial "ey ur knew here, lemme give u sum tips b0ss" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that every game passes off as a tutorial, because, ♥♥♥♥ experimentation. Yet, as I managed to toss myself over the hurdle, I noticed something huge. Something that the original XIV lacked.\n\nIt was good.\n\nNo, I'm serious, it's ♥♥♥♥ing good!\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is sapping away at my life, and most other games only hold my attention for maybe 10-20 hours at max. Given that this is an MMO, of course it's going to take a nice chunk of time out of my life, but here's the thing: that $20 price tag comes with a free trial. At any point, I could have said "bump this, I'm going back to <insert game of your choosing here>", but I haven't, even with over 80 hours of gameplay under my belt.\n\nOf course, it runs on a monthly subscription service, so it's only as fun as your wallet will let you run with it, however, for what it's worth, I prefer this model a lot more than any Free-2-Play, Play-2-Win model that any MMO has come out with, rivaling the likes of Warcraft, Guild Wars, etc. You're not going to be able to simply buy that gargantuan sword with your real-life money, you're gonna have to either buy it with in-game money, earn it via quests, or make it your own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed self.\n\nWe can sit here all day and talk about the original and how crap it was (and believe me, it was crap), but trust me when I say that when Square messed up, they knew exactly where they messed up. They took the game down, continued to tweak it, gave us a hell of a send-off (look that stuff up, it's ♥♥♥♥in' hella), and fixed it all.\n\nDoes it reek of MMO-isms? As in, do random people pester you to join their clan?\n\nYeah.\n\nDo people continue to barter even though the shops are literally right there next to them?\n\nOh, hell yeah.\n\nAre there toxic players who will scold you for not healing or tanking the--\n\nThe ♥♥♥♥ kinda question is that? You already know.\n\nPoint is, for all of its flaws, if you're into fantasy JRPGs and MMOs, this one is a must. Highly recommended, though your milage may vary.\n\nAlso, Psy is still an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't trust anyone 3-feet tall and wearing a mask, I always say.\n\n9/10","October 5, 2015","true","159.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I can tell you that this game seems more directed towards its story however. Even with a week of experience of playing this game, a friend of mine and I haven't even went passed lvl 10 on our second try. either because of story delay, or just how slow we are. so it isn't really favoring the "just lvl up and do battlegrounds and raids" but other than that this game kept me really busy. even knowing that i would hit the lvl cap, I would probably make another character.   This is a great opportunity to take a monthly break from WoW and other FTP or PTP ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes.\n\nwhat also got me interested playing this game is the change on its audio, subtitles, ETC. Regarding that it's developed by SE. I really can't stand english voice acting. Upon knowing this as soon I started listening to Japanese voice actors, I felt comfortable playing the game. I don't know about you guys, but After playing a few games that originated in Japan, the difference between voice acting is sychronizing with the mood. That's how I see it. When it comes to english voice acting, I always expect few if not most, messed up on certain occasions, and I'm always afraid it's always on the best parts.\n\nThat's all I can offer on my review on this.

Everything about the game screems to you with a beatiful final fantasy charm. With music and grapichs that sound and look quite stunning, am entertained by running around on a chocobo at times and looking at the scenary that is around me.\n\nThe gameplay is a drastic improvement over the previous game and borrows several mechanins from other mmo's and adds its own new ones, and everyone mash quite good together.\n\nSince this is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me and a final fantasy game, expect grinding near the end, but at least with pretty scenary.\n\nOf course, atm moment of this review i will not recomend the game for those that look to ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes for PvP. They do have a PvP arena, but because of some server lagg it will not be that fun at all. There is also no open world PvP like there is in Star Wars The Old Republic or World of Warcraft.\nThe game in itself consentraits on the PvE content and has given us some really hard dungeons and trials to rage quit over.\n\nAnd if these are the things you are looking for, prepare to be sucked in and suddenly find that its 10 hours later.\n\nEDIT: By patch 2.3 they have added a 24v24v24 pvp battle arena which should be fun enough, but of course even that has its issues.","March 23, 2014","true","416.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I swore I would NEVER pay for a subscription fee.\n\nNow I have paid for one and do not regret it at all.\nThis game is awesome. The amount of stuff you can do in game is impressive as are the graphics and framerate if your PC can handle it.  I have so far played as 2 different classes and to me they feel different. I play them different, which is a good thing.\n\nPeople are generally pretty helpful to noobs and not total d1ckfaces, Although you do get some of those too to be fair.\nThe community seems to be pretty tightly knit and friendly. Within a few minutes on each of 2 servers I have played on, I have been invited to join Free Companys. Or Guilds if you prefer.\n\nThere does seem to be a fairly steep learning curve with menus and such, and the game doesn't really explain them very well if at all. Stick with it, ask questions and experiment and after a while you will get the hang of it.\n\nThe map can be daunting at times. I find I'm getting better at it all of the time, but initially it can really mess you up. Especially when there can be different height levels in some areas such as towns. The map does not shift up or down to accomodate your vantage point.\n\nWhen playing with a party, it seems you will share/split experience. That can be pretty cool.\n\nAudio is good and has some classic FF music, which is nice.\nGraphics are incredibly vibrant and colorful, like you'd expect from a FF game.\n\nCharacter interactions are a little tedious. You read alsmot EVERYTHING. Even most cutscenes are not voiced. Although there are a few.\n\nAccount creation is a  little weird. Especially when you have to use the game client+the website+subscribe and link your account. This could have been a little less confusing.\n\nWhen a friend wants to join you and they just got  the game it is entirely possible that they may not be able to join you. The  world you are on might be full. They can't wait for someone just to logoff. That doesn't seem to work. They have to hope that someone deletes a character at some point I have a lvl 12 character in one world and my friend cannot join me. I had to create a new character on a new world to play with them.\n\nOne last thing: I believe, (and I might be wrong about this), that you get 8 character slots per world. To give you an idea, there are roughly 8 worlds per server area and about 7 server areas. That is pretty impressive.\n\nWould I recommend this game to people? Sure if you are a Final Fantasy fan or an MMO fan.\nNot for everybody...but I'm loving it so far.","September 14, 2014","true","36.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Even on medium settings the game looks great and runs smoothly. The story is actually enthralling and is keeping me interested and I don't find myself speeding through text and skipping cinematics. Atleast, not for the main stories lol. The monsters are really well done and there are a wide variety from cute and cuddly (i.e the Cactus monster thing...) to the scary *** demons.\n\nThe dungeons are fun and it seems that most of them tie in with the main story so you in a sense have to unlock them. Same goes with getting your first chocobo\n\nCons: There are some things that really do bug me in this game which may be just superficial on my part. The first is how the map is. When zoomed out to look at a regional view all you see are name blocks with lines directing which zones are connected. It's not like a google map view that you find in most mmo's. Along with that is trying to find where to go with quests. Some mmos if you have quest lets say 3 zones over, will usually point you to the nearest exit from the current zone into the next. This game doesnt seem to do that. If you have a quest in one zone over, sure it will show you. But if it is 2 zones over then you need to go and track it down.\n\nThe zones themselvs I wish were not instanced. Even parts of the main cities are instanced. I personally like complete open world games. Or at the very least, the main cities should not be broken into instances.\n\nGetting a mount is kind of a pain. You need to progress to roughly lvl 20 before you get the quest to get a mount. Then you need to go farm some tokens in order to get a certificate. That part isnt necessarily hard just annoying. Even if you have the collectors edition and have the two mounts already, you need to get the normal chocobo first before you can use them.\n\nMy biggest gripe however, is the use/lack there of of voice over for the games. Some main story cinematics will have voice overs, some dont. Some times you will have voices then all of a sudden you dont. It's not my sound card, or computer, or whatever, it's the developers that didnt put in voice acting for the whole game. I hope they do add in more sometime down the line.\n\nOverall though this is a very well done game and I am impressed. Even with the nuances I am enjoying the game immensly and definitely recommend playing it even if it's just the trial.","November 30, 2014","true","143.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Have been my entire life, and always will be. It's a tried and true series that I always come back to (whether it's Kingdom Hearts, the OG FF games or new ones) and I gotta say, this one holds up at the top. If you've been missing the high-fantasy style that the series has maybe "lacked" in the past few years, look no further. This is true Final Fantasy spirit.\nTo break it down simply:\n-The combat it tab-target, but just feels so much more exciting. Every hit packs a punch that isn't there with most games except TERA.\n-I don't pay much attention to story in MMO's since 99% of the time it's pointless fetch quest filler with some over-arching theme that really doesn't go anywhere till endgame, so I mean don't expect to be paying $15/month (or whatever I'm paying) for a crazy story.\n-The graphics (which I got on max) are incredible, let alone for an MMO, but it's to be expected for an FF game. The character model detail is amazing and the world looks so clear at all times of day.\n\nHere's where things get realllllllyyyyyyy rough.\nSquare Enix has the worst support/instructions/literally everything that isn't the game itself is the worst I've ever experienced.\nLet me tell you a story.\nI long while ago in a far off land, my brother bought FF14 on PS4 on my PSN account. Simple. Started playing till I kicked him off, so he buys it on my Steam. Simple. Well. No. Not that simple. One day I decided to start playing myself but because the PSN account is now linked to his SE account, I was unable to even change the USERNAME box on the FF14 menu when trying to log in. Okay, so I tried Steam, still, when I enter my details it asks me for a registration key (as if I didn't already own the game?) So we scoured the internet for days, finding literally no information as to how it was possible for me to play. So, being the guy my brother is, he bought it a 2nd time on PS4 (so we could get another key, ya know?) NOPE. $25 down the drain, he doesn't even get a confirmation email, no code, nothing. Nothing at all. So I created a new SE account, then what? It asks me to log in with a "one time password." Okay? So I get the app that gives me a one time password, then what you ask? IT ASKS ME TO PUT IN MY ONE TIME PASSWORD TO GET A ONE TIME PASSWORD. WHAT?????? Meanwhile, my brother finds out the they can apparently unlink your SE account from PSN once, so he asks to get that, and they don't reply back with anything, and nothing has changed. So I created a new EMAIL to create ANOTHER SE account, and I had to purchase the game off of THEIR site, in which they didn't send me anything after paying until I contacted their support telling them I never got my game, in which they didn't even reply. I just simply FINALLY got an email with the code. We now own FIVE copies of this F$0^ing game. Worst time I've ever had trying to just play a game. But man, is it good. Yes. Yes it is.\nI also say this as someone who hates P2P with a burning raging passion so maybe that says something?","December 20, 2014","true","650.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

My life has been taken over.\n\n\nBut in all seriousness, this game is fantastic. I've played a lot of mmo's during my years of computer gaming and I have never once had the real patience to grind through them to reach the end game. This game however has held my attention from start to finish, the cutscenes and dialog are all very well done for the story and this game is just very engaging to me.\n\nClearly since this game is an MMORPG it does take a bit of grinding here and there to get the the end game stuff, but let me tell you once you get to endgame it all starts there. There is so much to do at the end game its rediculous. I still havent gotten anywhere close to finishing it. I've only just scratched the surface of my Relic weapon not to mention only just beating the First Coil of Bahamut....damn T9. And the primal fights are just a fun way to pass time when you feel like making a farm party for them. Tbh just about everything in the endgame is incredibly fun, to me anyway, and will keep you busy for quite a long time. Not too mention this game is very friendly to Casual players as well as Hardcore ones. The combat itself in the game pretty much easy straight through the whole game till the end game. Casual players can find themselves just hanging around talking with people in the community or just maybe running some dungeons for loot or fun, While Hardcore players can find themselves getting engrosed in the endgame constantly trying to get that Primal or Turn clear, as well as farming several endgame raids and bosses all to get that one piece of gear they want.\n\nAdditionally you don't even need to level a combat class specifically. I know quite a few people who were so engrossed in crafting and gathering that they maxed a few of those classes before even hitting level 50 with a combat class.\n\nSpeaking of combat, in this game personally I feel that they did the combat right. Everything feels very easy about the combat and the moves and combos flow together very nicely, it doesnt feel clunky.\n\nThis is all I have to say for now, and I very highly reccommend this game to anyone who loves MMORPG's and is a fan of Final Fantasy.\n\nAlso, F**K you Titan Ex, I have cleared you once and never again shall I attempt your annoyingness.","March 13, 2015","true","601.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

There is a free trial on Steam...just gotta type in "Final Fantasy XIV" and then it'll finally show up as a "Free Demo." Also when looking at reviews to get to know the game, ignore anything under 100 hours. They don't know what they'e talking about.\n\nAs it says for me, I've logged 440 hours at the time of this review (Thats bound to change very soon though). I'm downright addicted to FFXIV. Yes, there are points in which the game is tedious. Yes, there are certain things that make me sigh. And yes, the few cutscenes that are voice acted are terrible as the VA's suck.\n\nFirst things first. Some of the negative reviews says the game is SUPER grind heavy. That's both FALSE and TRUE. It doesn't take long to get a single character class to 50 (Present max level though the DLC/Expansion that comes out this spring will raise it to 60 while adding an entire new area, new dungeons, raids, bosses, and 3 new classes). What takes long is getting your max Item Level Gear which is...130? I'm not too sure on that myself. I haven't hit ilevel100 yet on my main.\n\nMore on the Grinding. You can hit max level in under 2 weeks of moderate gameplay for one of your classes. That's not long compared to some other MMO's. Of course most other MMO's don't allow you to level EVERY CLASS in the game on ONE CHARACTER without the need for alts. What makes the game 'Grind heavy' is the fact that there's 9 Combat Classes and 11 Crafting/Gathering Classes. That's a total of 20 (Well 22 technically but those two share the same exp pool as its base class) different classes to get to level 50. On one character. And yes, there is a benefit from leveling all the classes. You can 'Cross Class' certain skills to other classes. Giving them benefits of different skills.\n\nSome of the early dungeons are pretty boring but they're not really meant to be like really great. They're basically tutorial dungeons. Letting you learn the mechanics that you'll see extremely often in later, harder, and significantly more fun, dungeons (and raids.)\n\nThe crafting/gathering system is a love-hate thing. Though that's true of most every MMO. One of my Free Company minions focused almost exlucsively on the Crafting and Gathering Classes and almost hit 50 on all of them within only a few weeks time. If you're dedicated and manage your exp sources right (Levequests and crafting/gathering level appropriate stuff) your crafting/gatherers will level fairly quickly.\n\nThere's two different subscriptions too. So all those peope ♥♥♥♥♥ing about "Its 15 bucks a month" are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting you. 15 bucks a month is for the premium subscription that simply allows you 8 characters per server for a max of 40 throughout your Data Center. The Base Subscription, which is like...12-13 bucks? Restricts you to 1 character per server and a max of 8 in your data center. I'm not sure on the price as I have the premium subscription myself. The base subscription is cheaper then, say, WoW's subscription. And its worth it since you don't really need Alts. (I just really like the game. >.>)\n\nAs people will say, the game looks very nice. The music is fantastic (But what did you expect? Its a FINAL FANTASY game!). The story is interesting. Gameplay? I like it. It's solid. There's not really much to say about it. It's an MMO...Oh! I saw one negative review talking about monsters "Auto attacks" and there being to avoid getting hit by them unless it uses a move that creates a 'zone' that you want to get out of...that's not true. You can avoid getting hit by a monsters auto attacks if you STAY OUT OF THEIR RANGE. Which is understandably hard for a Melee Class or a Caster Class. But the Archer has no problem literally kiting a monster without ranged attacks around in circles. Ya just gotta becareful not to leash them...as they'll become invincible while they retreat back to their spawn area.\n\nWhat else to say...what else to say...\n\nHm...JUST TRY THE FREE TRIAL! ITS FREE.","February 2, 2015","true","912.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

My friend and I came to the conclusion that in F2P games the most important content and utilities where microtransaction BS! and you just cannot progress.. not to mention the most vile and hatred filled gamers your ever likely to come across.. So we gave this one a bash and in all honesty for what your paying its a bargain ! and no im not a fan boy.. im speaking the truth.... theres no locked content, everything is available as long as your able to progress that far and level up high enough to reach the locations.\n\nThe graphics in this game are indeed Direct X9.0, but not by any means outdated ! i play many new games such as S.O.M / Farcry 4 etc... and this game is just as graphically pleasing if not a little easier on the eye as it all blends and texturises realy well. I run a Nvidia Geforce GT 740 2GB ddr5 card and get 40-50 fps all day long on the highest settings.\n\nThe music is well composed and fits in well with the FF Franchise to those who are familiar, however just sometimes it can grate on you when your not expecting it or suddenly gets louder...\nVoice acting is some what scarce and when is around poorly dubbed but again something anyone familiar with FF will just over look this easily !\n\nAs for content the game is full of it ! Theres never a dull moment, with 18 Classes to not only choose from but swap to at any given moment you can never get bored... ive litterally gone from fighting to keep my A** alive to suddenly sat on a stool fishing for sardines !! all in space of a few seconds. get bored of fishing easy ?? no problem grab a pickaxe and follow me ! we can go smash some crountry side open and mine for ore and composites !! whats that you say ?? cant find your pickaxe ?? not to worry my friend, lets go train to become a carpenter. We'll have you equipped in no time :D and how about after that we head to the Culinary Guild and cook us up a nice dinner of rabbit pie with white pearl chocolates for afterwards.\n\nLike a bit of slash and gash voilence ? become a Gladiator and Tank your way through whiles the Arcanist's and the Thurmatages watch your back with ranged magic and summons ...\n\nAnd of course need not to be mentioned really (ITS AN MMO ITS IN THE DESCRIPTION) you can do this with your friends 95% of the way through... of course i say 95% because during some Guild missions and Campaigns missions im afraid your going to have to go it alone !!! But the people of Eorzea are a nice Folk and are willing to help out anyone who just speaks up !! Help is out there people.. your never alone here :D FF XIV is Cross-Platform compatible with the PC/PS3/PS4 platforms and you play along side them..\n\nBad Points to this game:-\n\nAgain i say "Subscriptions fees" but there not all that bad .. theres no locked content once you've paid and everything is at some point readily available..\n\nFast Travel can cost a fortune so be wary of how you travel !\n\nCan seem Tedious at times, but once you discover everything there is to do youll never fit it all into a day :D\n\n\nOverall i Can definetly recommend this game to anyone looking for an MMORPG but feel there all missing something ??\nWELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FOR FREE HUH ??? pay a little and gain alot more !\n\n9.3/10 theres always room for improvement right ??\n\nCome join us today and find out for yourself just how addictive and fun this game really is ..... because you just cant take someones else word for it :D","January 31, 2015","true","125.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I feel this game is solid enough to be a top contender in the MMO genre and worth the monthly fee it charges. FF14 is an amazing story based MMO that is quite unique in many ways. There is so much to do story wise that all I can say is check it out. If you can get on a full server like Gilgamesh and Cactuar this game is honestly 10/10. There are always people running around and you will never really find yourself alone. There are many jobs/classes to level so your character can quite literally be anything. For me this was a massive selling point as I feel its pretty awesome to be able to play any role I want at any time on just one character.\n\nEDIT:\nWith all that being said I want it to be known I have played many MMOs and rarely do I enjoy any other than WOW. I have played through Wildstar, ESO, GW, GW2 and many others. I usually find myself going back to WOW after a few months of playing a new MMO and reaching end game. I am seriously considering making this my main MMO if PvP gets better.\n\nAll in all I would say get this game no matter what on a sale. It comes with a free month witch is enough time to decide whether or not you would enjoy the game.\n\nLong time FF fans this game is a must for you. It stays true to the roots and has quite alot of nostalgia  if you have played through the Final Fantasy games.","July 5, 2014","true","136.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

On top of that, I've been playing MMOs for so long that I've played a good number of times with subs and non sub games and I sort of got burnt out on subbed games just because none of them seemed to keep my attention long enough to make the payment per month worth it.  In spite of that, FFXIV: ARR is one that I actually returned to even with a sub, because it is well worth the money.\n\nMore specifically, FFXIV is for one, a very beautiful game and although graphics alone cannot make a game great, it is a factor at least for me.  Even if a game has great gameplay without decent graphics I probably won't remain interested.  The opposite is true too but in the case of this game, it has good gameplay mechanics along with absolutely stunning graphics.\n\nThe stories, let's face it, many times a lot of mmo players skip through the dialog and story to get to more quests and level up fast and while I'll admit there is some of that with FFXIV, for the most part, I find myself interested in reading and enjoying the main story more than most other games of the same genre.\n\nAside from those things, the class system, the ability to learn multiple classes and the jobs are detailed and interesting enough to really make it stand out for me.  I love that the crafting isn't a simplifed style where it's just click and create like so many other mmos have done.\n\nThere is far more I can say about this game that I love but you get the gist of things I hope.  If you're an MMO fan, looking to try something new it is absolutely worth your time to at least give it a try.","July 21, 2014","true","646.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I actually like it.. however I live in Japan and all the people I would like to play with are in America, so due to time zones I find little interest in the game.

First of all I am not an MMORPG fan. I Have played 2 before and not for very long. I swore I would NEVER pay for a subscription fee.\n\nNow I have paid for one and do not regret it at all.\nThis game is awesome. The amount of stuff you can do in game is impressive as are the graphics and framerate if your PC can handle it.  I have so far played as 2 different classes and to me they feel different. I play them different, which is a good thing.\n\nPeople are generally pretty helpful to noobs and not total d1ckfaces, Although you do get some of those too to be fair.\nThe community seems to be pretty tightly knit and friendly. Within a few minutes on each of 2 servers I have played on, I have been invited to join Free Companys. Or Guilds if you prefer.\n\nThere does seem to be a fairly steep learning curve with menus and such, and the game doesn't really explain them very well if at all. Stick with it, ask questions and experiment and after a while you will get the hang of it.\n\nThe map can be daunting at times. I find I'm getting better at it all of the time, but initially it can really mess you up. Especially when there can be different height levels in some areas such as towns. The map does not shift up or down to accomodate your vantage point.\n\nWhen playing with a party, it seems you will share/split experience. That can be pretty cool.\n\nAudio is good and has some classic FF music, which is nice.\nGraphics are incredibly vibrant and colorful, like you'd expect from a FF game.\n\nCharacter interactions are a little tedious. You read alsmot EVERYTHING. Even most cutscenes are not voiced. Although there are a few.\n\nAccount creation is a  little weird. Especially when you have to use the game client+the website+subscribe and link your account. This could have been a little less confusing.\n\nWhen a friend wants to join you and they just got  the game it is entirely possible that they may not be able to join you. The  world you are on might be full. They can't wait for someone just to logoff. That doesn't seem to work. They have to hope that someone deletes a character at some point I have a lvl 12 character in one world and my friend cannot join me. I had to create a new character on a new world to play with them.\n\nOne last thing: I believe, (and I might be wrong about this), that you get 8 character slots per world. To give you an idea, there are roughly 8 worlds per server area and about 7 server areas. That is pretty impressive.\n\nWould I recommend this game to people? Sure if you are a Final Fantasy fan or an MMO fan.\nNot for everybody...but I'm loving it so far.","September 14, 2014","true","36.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Even on medium settings the game looks great and runs smoothly. The story is actually enthralling and is keeping me interested and I don't find myself speeding through text and skipping cinematics. Atleast, not for the main stories lol. The monsters are really well done and there are a wide variety from cute and cuddly (i.e the Cactus monster thing...) to the scary *** demons.\n\nThe dungeons are fun and it seems that most of them tie in with the main story so you in a sense have to unlock them. Same goes with getting your first chocobo\n\nCons: There are some things that really do bug me in this game which may be just superficial on my part. The first is how the map is. When zoomed out to look at a regional view all you see are name blocks with lines directing which zones are connected. It's not like a google map view that you find in most mmo's. Along with that is trying to find where to go with quests. Some mmos if you have quest lets say 3 zones over, will usually point you to the nearest exit from the current zone into the next. This game doesnt seem to do that. If you have a quest in one zone over, sure it will show you. But if it is 2 zones over then you need to go and track it down.\n\nThe zones themselvs I wish were not instanced. Even parts of the main cities are instanced. I personally like complete open world games. Or at the very least, the main cities should not be broken into instances.\n\nGetting a mount is kind of a pain. You need to progress to roughly lvl 20 before you get the quest to get a mount. Then you need to go farm some tokens in order to get a certificate. That part isnt necessarily hard just annoying. Even if you have the collectors edition and have the two mounts already, you need to get the normal chocobo first before you can use them.\n\nMy biggest gripe however, is the use/lack there of of voice over for the games. Some main story cinematics will have voice overs, some dont. Some times you will have voices then all of a sudden you dont. It's not my sound card, or computer, or whatever, it's the developers that didnt put in voice acting for the whole game. I hope they do add in more sometime down the line.\n\nOverall though this is a very well done game and I am impressed. Even with the nuances I am enjoying the game immensly and definitely recommend playing it even if it's just the trial.","November 30, 2014","true","143.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Have been my entire life, and always will be. It's a tried and true series that I always come back to (whether it's Kingdom Hearts, the OG FF games or new ones) and I gotta say, this one holds up at the top. If you've been missing the high-fantasy style that the series has maybe "lacked" in the past few years, look no further. This is true Final Fantasy spirit.\nTo break it down simply:\n-The combat it tab-target, but just feels so much more exciting. Every hit packs a punch that isn't there with most games except TERA.\n-I don't pay much attention to story in MMO's since 99% of the time it's pointless fetch quest filler with some over-arching theme that really doesn't go anywhere till endgame, so I mean don't expect to be paying $15/month (or whatever I'm paying) for a crazy story.\n-The graphics (which I got on max) are incredible, let alone for an MMO, but it's to be expected for an FF game. The character model detail is amazing and the world looks so clear at all times of day.\n\nHere's where things get realllllllyyyyyyy rough.\nSquare Enix has the worst support/instructions/literally everything that isn't the game itself is the worst I've ever experienced.\nLet me tell you a story.\nI long while ago in a far off land, my brother bought FF14 on PS4 on my PSN account. Simple. Started playing till I kicked him off, so he buys it on my Steam. Simple. Well. No. Not that simple. One day I decided to start playing myself but because the PSN account is now linked to his SE account, I was unable to even change the USERNAME box on the FF14 menu when trying to log in. Okay, so I tried Steam, still, when I enter my details it asks me for a registration key (as if I didn't already own the game?) So we scoured the internet for days, finding literally no information as to how it was possible for me to play. So, being the guy my brother is, he bought it a 2nd time on PS4 (so we could get another key, ya know?) NOPE. $25 down the drain, he doesn't even get a confirmation email, no code, nothing. Nothing at all. So I created a new SE account, then what? It asks me to log in with a "one time password." Okay? So I get the app that gives me a one time password, then what you ask? IT ASKS ME TO PUT IN MY ONE TIME PASSWORD TO GET A ONE TIME PASSWORD. WHAT?????? Meanwhile, my brother finds out the they can apparently unlink your SE account from PSN once, so he asks to get that, and they don't reply back with anything, and nothing has changed. So I created a new EMAIL to create ANOTHER SE account, and I had to purchase the game off of THEIR site, in which they didn't send me anything after paying until I contacted their support telling them I never got my game, in which they didn't even reply. I just simply FINALLY got an email with the code. We now own FIVE copies of this F$0^ing game. Worst time I've ever had trying to just play a game. But man, is it good. Yes. Yes it is.\nI also say this as someone who hates P2P with a burning raging passion so maybe that says something?","December 20, 2014","true","650.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dekk/recommended/39210/","dekk","Bashie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dekk/","399 products in account","Best P2P MMO I've played in recent years. Been a few months since I have played so this might not be completely accurate. Here are my positives (+) negatives (-) and neutrals (o).\n\n(+) All classes on one character, each levels individually, Mix and match (some) skills from one class to another. For example, if you plan to play a healer, "Swift Cast" from the offensive caster is absolutely required so you can revive people instantly.\n\n(+) This is the ultimate callback game for fans of the more classic Final Fantasy games, though you'll find a little bit from every game here. You probably don't need to be an FF fan to enjoy this, it stands up on its own mechanically. I would basically describe this game as "WoW done better."\n\n(+) Level scaling for Dungeons and FATES (Fates are over-world events that people can take part in as a community.) So no matter what level you are, you and your friends can play together. However, you cannot level scale on the overworld unless you're inside a FATE.\n\n(+) Party Finder. It works wonders, just queue up and do most anything else while you wait for a party to be automatically formed for a dungeon. You can also join overworld parties. Tanks and Healers will be matched quicker because they are not as commonly played, expect to wait if you are a DPS.\n\n(+) Glamour system, make any piece of equipment look like another. You can only unlock the ability to glamour at level 50, but people can do it for you before then. It IS possible to look like a classically colored Black Mage, if you have the currency for it.\n\n(+) Mechanically difficult and exhilarating bosses. Knowing how each dungeon and boss fight works before going in is essential to success. This is a double-edged sword, however, you could be stuck on a difficult fight, wiping multiple times with a pub party that doesn't know what they are doing. Sometimes it can get a bit too stressful, you'll always be on the razor's edge, late game. Different classes and roles are easier or harder to play, I wouldn't recommend rolling a tank for your first class.\n\n(+) Guilds, Guild Houses and Homes. I highly recommend finding a good guild, there are benefits to reap. Decorate your own Guild House, Personal House or Apartment Room inside your Guild House. You could make your own guild, but I recommend joining an existing one that has some legs and good community.\n\n(+) Chocobo Companions. Train a Chocobo to fight alongside you on the overworld, good for soloing. They can be mix-ups of Tank, Healer and DPS. Though the tank isn't all that good, last I heard.\n\n(+) Gold Saucer and Minigames! Gamble, collect cards and play tetra master across the world (love it or hate it), race Chocobos FF7 style, earn currency for rewards.\n\n(+) Retainers, get one of these as soon as you can, you get up to two for free. They act as your bank and you can send them out on missions to get items for you.\n\n(o) Crafting is still kind of a pain like most MMO's, you do not draw from resources directly from your bank like in GW2, so it's an inventory management headache, but there is money to be made and it's far from useless. Each crafting class works mostly the same, but each has some unique skills that can cross-class like combat classes do. Many of which are necessary. It's worth a try.\n\n(o) Arena and Mass-Scale PvP is available, though I can't comment on it since it's not my playstyle. There is no 1v1 duelling.\n\n(-) Ability Icon Clutter, a carry-over from WoW. This can be mitigated with good macro building and UI customization management, though.\n\n(-) Main storyline isn't interesting until around level 50, which is max level before the expansion. Before that, there are some highlights, but it's mostly a slog through lots of political dialogue. Post vanilla is a vast improvement, though. Also, side story arcs are a lot better, for example, each class has its own story arc.\n\n(-) No cross-server play. If you have a max level character on one server, and your friend is on another, one of you will have to make a new character or pay money for a server transfer.","May 14","true","524.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE THE TRUTH\n\nHumans were not ment to play MMORPGs i urge you to give this game a miss and maybe focus on a hobby of yours, try and get creative or spend time with the family, learn a skill.

While some aspects of gameplay are slower than most MMO's I've played, they manage to find a way to fill in the "downtime" as it were. Actually paying attention to the story is rather rewarding. While it does feel like I'm missing some things that may have been covered in FFXI, it doesn't feel like that's hurting the story at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/recommended/39210/","zanriel","Zanriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/","874 products in account","This game has some interesting mechanics that help it stand out. First off, the multiclassing system is pretty neat. At around level 10 your character gains the ability to level up in other classes simply by equipping the weapon associated with that class. All of your stats and gear can also be independently associated with those other classes, which basically means that other than race, gender, or name, you can experience all the content of the game with just one character.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice, although not spectacular. The textures are a bit soft and the game has a fairly stylistic, cartoony feel. However, aesthetically the game is beautiful. There's not a single ugly character to be found anywhere, except perhaps the giant or tiny races, and that just depends on your taste.\n\nCombat doesn't stray far from standard "Diku-MUD" style tab-targeting / hotbar combat like you'd find in almost any other MMO since EQ. They do manage to mix it up a bit, however, with attack chains and synergies, encouraging you to mix up your rotation depending on the situation. Many enemies also telegraph their attacks, which is a trend that is becoming more and more common in the genre.\n\nQuesting is fairly standard, with only a few very special quests featuring cutscenes or voiceovers. Quest objectives usually consist of escorts, defending against waves of enemies, run and fetch, click on various sparkly objectives scattered around, or kill X number of mobs. Again, this is pretty much what you'd expect from almost any MMO.\n\nThere are a few interesting twists on the standard questing model, however. Scattered around the gameworld are various public quests called "Duties" which usually automatically activate once you get in range. Sometimes they're triggered by speaking to an NPC. These work almost exactly like the public quests of Guild Wars 2 or the rifts and invasions in Rifts. Aside from that, each class has a monster journal which tracks various enemy kills. The enemies you need to kill in order to fulfill the various objectives in your journal are marked with a special icon, and when you complete a set, you get a fairly decent amount of XP. This makes it fun to just run around hunting for these mobs and doing the public quests.\n\nSpeaking of mobs, the enemy designs are fantastic. The various types of creatures you're likely to encounter often have surprising and very creative designs. This is fairly typical for Asian MMO's, but fairly rare here in the West. This, combined with the beautiful character designs, is where FFXIV shows its chops by blending Eastern and Western sensibilities to create a compelling overall experience.\n\nThere's also a player housing system, and although I haven't tried them myself, I hear the dungeon encounters are really well done.\n\nAll that said, I find that this game hasn't really managed to get me hooked for some reason. Maybe it's the stale controls and format, which is almost too reminiscent of almost every other mainstream MMO of the past 15 years. Another problem is the quest tracker. While it's pretty good about showing you where quest objectives are on your map, if you have quests located in another zone, it's not always easy to figure out where to go. I also found myself frequently having to do a lot of backtracking. I'd be questing around in a certain zone until I'm too low for the content. Then  I'd have to run all the way back to a central area and then head off in a different direction to find quests I missed which by then would be several levels below me. This might not be as much of an issue if you're not a completionist and you decide to do more leveling with the duty and achievement system, or you've already leveled up a couple times and you're more familiar with where the quest hubs are. I guess I've gotten too spoiled by "breadcrumb" style questing, which was first popularized by WoW.\n\nI decided not to pick up a subscription and continue past the trial. This is a great game, don't get me wrong, but it's just not for me. There are too many great games out there to justify another subscription. I'm already subscribing to 3 or 4 other MMO's that I rarely ever play.  Personally, I think a better model would be for MMO's to let pre-pay, maybe at a rate of 5 or 10 cents per hour for full VIP access. Then you can spend those hours however and whenever you like, without the pressure to keep playing to justify your subscription.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, if you're looking for an MMO with tons of content and features that you can sink hundreds of hours into, absolutely. If you're a "one-game" type of person and you're looking for a great fantasy MMO, you can't go wrong with this one. However, if you have a huge steam library and/or you're already subscribed to one or two other MMO's, this one doesn't really offer anything new and interesting enough to justify another subscription. Even though I'm uninstalling, I'm still going to give this game a thumbs up. Square Enix really did an excellent job and they deserve kudos.","March 17, 2014","true","11.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

XIV is casual and controller friendly, but most importantly to me, it's a Great Final Fantasy game.\n\nThe game does the standard Tank | Healer | DPS trinity and knowing your role is important.  If you Don't Rush through the story to lvl 50, there's enough opportunity to become familiar with your role(s) of choice, and plenty to do after your first 50.\n\nA single character can be (level) every class in the game and is based on (gains experience with) Weapon/Tool in hand.  As you level each class, you gain skills that can be shared in select other classes.  In addition to classes, there are jobs which provide unique skills.  Jobs can be acquired when a Primary class reaches 30 and a secondary class reaches 15.  This is all explained in-game.\n\nIn addition to the fighting classes, there are crafting and gathering classes.

It has an interesting combat system, a cool story, and a lot of content. I played it quite a bit before it popped up on steam... and decided it was so good that I'd pass the hard copy onto my wife while I played the digital. I've always been an FF fan, but I couldn't get into FFXI. FFXIV takes everything great about FFXI and cuts out the junk. Probably my favorite MMO right next to EQ and Guild Wars 2. The only thing that could make this game even better would be if they added achievements to it.

It has things I like from a few different MMOs, but never had in one.  In addition to the standard MMO quests, it has a storyline going through it that you'd expect out of a Final Fantasy game (Mind you, I never played any past X).  You can switch classes (once unlocked) by switching your weapon.  There's a "Duty Finder" which is similar to WoW's LFG/LFR tool, but a single tool for all of the game's group content.  Dyeable armor, and a system similar to WoW's "Transmog" system... Ugh.  I could go on and on about it's features.\n\nThe music is beautiful, and so are the graphics (I have a higher-end PC, though, so results can easily vary).\n\nBottom line: If you like the Final Fantasy franchise, and you like MMOs, you should set your sights on this.","March 26, 2014","true","696.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

(wow I just realised that).\n\nFrom a Final Fantasy Fan perspective: I am a huge Final Fantasy series fan and this does the series justice! I was worried about how it turned out originally before they did the remake, and now that the devs have their heads on straight it is absolutely amazing!\n\nFrom an MMORPG player perspective: One of the many key features I love about this game as an MMORPG in general is; You can have as many classes/jobs and crafts as you want on ONE character!\nThere are so many games out there that just dont adpot this simple yet extremely appealing feature! So many times I have wanted to just be ONE character - build up a story for that ONE character - and not have to make loads of other characters just to experience different classes/jobs and crafts. If you prefer to have different characters for different classes/jobs and crafts then you can still do that! So it really does appeal and accomodate to both sides.\n\nThere are so many amazing features about this game that really makes this MMORPG stand up above the rest but the best way to understand it is to experience it for yourself. Otherwise I would be here typing this post until my fingers bleed.\n\nOne final thing I will say is that if you are a fan of the Final Fantasy series then I would recommend this game 100%! If you have never played any of the Final Fantasy series then I would still recommend this game 100%!\n\nHappy hunting everyone!","August 29, 2014","true","062.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","3"
