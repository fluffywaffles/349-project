In the game you control your greedy gold loving heroes fighting through dungeons, and dying to traps and enemies for a bit of loot. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay/Controls\nThe controls are very simple as you use your mouse to guide you greedy heroes through the dungeon and use the 1, 2, and 3 keys to activate potions to help your heroes out.\n\nThe gameplay is very enjoyable. You start off with a set number of greedy peasants (you will know why I say "greedy" after) and fight through a dungeon to collect loot. In the game you can accept quest with the first one being to steal back a watermelon. The dungeons consist of floors which are anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes long. As you continue to play this game you will unlock more heroes, more potions, and more quests in which you will get your butt kicked a bit. A key thing to note is that the heroes are very, VERY, greedy. More than a couple times a few coins would be lying around, and my heroes would run to the coins getting themselves, and most of my other heroes killed because of their greed. If you go too far away from one hero they will no longer be part of your party and you will need to go back to get them.  In the game there are 7 different types of heroes (including peasants) and 4 different types of potion.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nThe graphics are cartoony and seem a bit paper-like as of now. The area and village are rendered as a more 3D structure. The units are each unique in their design and very enjoyable to play. The music is done amazingly in this game. The music actually reminded me of an old game I used to play. Either way the music is very enjoyable.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Good music\n+ Quick-paced\n+ Simple\n+ Quests are fun\n+ Rewards you as you play and level up\n+ Potions are fairly balanced\n+ 7 different heroes and 4 different potions\n+ Great art style\n\nCons\n\n- Easy to lose a hero\n- Slight grind\n- Death is tasteless (they just flop over no matter what)\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my personal suggestions for the game. My suggestions do not need to be taken seriously as they are my personal opinion for hopefully adding to the game to make it better.\n\n- Controller Support\n- Customization of heroes (different weapons and articles of clothing to choose from)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI have greatly enjoyed my time playing Super Dungeon Run. I have seen what the developer hopes to add and I am looking forward to it (especially funny deaths). The quests are nice and it was fun to play through this game. The only bad things that nudged at me was how easy it was to lose a hero, and how the heroes’ greed got me killed more than a few times. Overall I'm happy to have had the chance to play this early access game.\n\nTL;DR\nSuper Dungeon Runner is fast-paced with floors in a dungeon ranging from 10 seconds to 3 minutes. The controls are simple as you only use your mouse and the 1, 2, and 3 keys. There are quests, potions, and of course your little dungeon running heroes in this game (7 heroes and 4 potions). The heroes are a bit greedy sometimes getting themselves killed for some coins. You fight through dungeon, gain money, get heroes and potions, upgrade said potions with crafting, and upgrade heroes as you level up. Truly fun and quick, Super Dungeon Runner is already a great game. Just in case you can check the features list to see if anything has been added since the time of this review.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 7, 2015","true","7.8"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","77","82","2","7"

Well the peasants in Super Dungeon Run would! SDR is a strange mash up of roguelike, endless runner and RPG. There are quests, upgrades, and plenty of randomly generated death rooms, and of course delicious amounts of treasure! As your peasants run and collect gold you will begin collecting upgrades in the form of potions and costumes. These allow your peasants to become much more extraordinary and wield incredible abilities, such as the Sorceroress or the mighty Knight. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of replay value and depth SDR has for it's adorable simple graphics and gameplay. I wasn't expecting things like crafting, class upgrades and skill trees. Where things need more polish is in the dungeon running itself. Let me be clear, everything works very well while running, you unlock potions, classes and move your poor adventurers about in a hilarious drunken wave. The problem is there is a bit of lack of interaction when the action kicks in. You kinda just sit there and watch what happens. Using a potion occasionally to help your adventurers out of a jam. However, things like class abilities and spells are already planned for final release and will more then likely take care of this aspect. In all Super Dungeon Run for it's price is an absolute steal and highly recommended to those looking for a funny and relaxing roguelike.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/uuA-r8oMOMM\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 23, 2015","true","2.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Altough i think its great it still has some downsides i want to list.\n\n- not enough upgrades (5 upgrades per character)\n- upgrades not visible (would be cool to see some changes to the characters after upgrading)\n- the resource balance is broken (the first 20 lvls you are always hurting for something after that you have tons of that     stuff and cant even spent it)\n- you are somewhat forced to do the same dungeon over and over again because the quest dungeons never change and you dont want to miss out on the extra XP because this will be your limiting factor after lvl 20\n\nEverything else seems fine to me for an Early Access Game. I played it for about 4-5 hours and could finish the Game (all upgrades /lvl 32) in 1 more hour. So you get about 1hr of Gametime per buck which is a realy good deal.

It's rare for roguelikes to feature entire parties these days, and SDR takes that up to eleven by allowing you to gather 20 allies at once (or more if you find and free them) and wander around with your lynch mob to stomp over the opposition. It's a chaotic game, and easy to jump in and start whacking away at things.\n\nSuper Dungeon Run is a realtime isometric dungeon crawler. I'm not exactly sure if the game uses procedural generation. At the very least quest floors are all the same, but I haven't really noticed any other floors repeating. Combat is nice and simple. Merely move your men in the vicinity of an enemy and they will gang up to beat the poor sobs. Two units cannot occupy the same space, so it is recommended to bring some ranged classes along to maximize damage.\n\nThe party structure in the game takes some getting used to. Classes you hire are not automatically a part of your party. To actually make use of classes, you must find them in chests, which upgrades one of your peasants. I like that you can occasionally free a prisoner and add him to your party, which helps offset a bad room that nearly wiped the party.\n\nThe loot system is a bit odd. There's no equipment in chests. Instead you may find potions, crafting materials, class upgrades, or cash. Completing a floor quickly while grabbing all the coins and killing all the enemies will net you better rewards at the end of the floor. The crafting materials are used to upgrade your class equipment, which affects all units of that particular class. The drop rate isn't too bad and doesn't require an excessive amount of grinding.\n\nAt this time the game balance is a bit out of whack. Early on it is difficult as you have a small party with low levels. But a few upgrades turns that all around and makes floors significantly easier. By the end of the game enemies were nothing more than a nuisance. While there's a fair amount of enemy variety, they are all definitely susceptible to simply being mobbed. If there were some enemies immune to ranged or melee, that could help spice things up a bit. Huge bosses with aoe attacks could also be fun. Maybe some enemies who uses status effects such as poison or charm that can only be countered by a cleric would be nice to have around.\n\nTraps are highly lethal in this game. As your party grows in size, it becomes very clumsy as your death blob moves around haphazardly trying to follow your mouse cursor. Otherwise easily avoided traps become meat grinders because your poor men do not know how to move intelligently or one at a time. It's not always easy to spot traps in time either, such as flaming traps firing from a south wall. If there's one class I would like to see in the game it's a rogue to disable traps because boy those traps kill.\n\nThis is the first game I've seen where a mere table can kill you by doing nothing. It manages this by blocking a path, so your troops may end up getting stuck and left behind. I've had a few rooms where I had to walk at snails pace trying to get everyone to avoid walking into a table. I would have liked the ability to change formations, such as single file, because rooms such as these, or traps you must walk around are among the most lethal in the game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good. They are very clear, and show no slowdown, and the animations are fun to look at. For being early access there's a surprising amount of polish here. The music is is also good, though I would have liked a few more songs, as they get repeated often. I haven't noticed any bugs, so good job on that front.\n\nThe game doesn't exactly end as best I can tell. Once you've hit max level and finished the last quest, nothing new opens up. I can't help but want that last bit of closure. Thus I judged the end of the game to be max level and completing all quests, which all in all takes about 5 hours. Even though Super Dungeon Run is still considered in early access, in it's current state it's entirely enjoyable. Even the base price is quite reasonable for what you get. I give Super Dungeon Run a 8/10. It's unfinished, but you can definitely see the potential they've got going.","November 28, 2015","true","5.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The Artwork is cute and fun, and the music adventurous and whimsical.\n\nYou simply click and hold the left mouse button to guide your mob of peasants on their adventures. Note, they really really aren't adventurers. They're peasants, they want to smash things and get loot, but are really really dumb. They'll often run into spikes and other nasty traps because they saw a vase they want to smash or some coins they want to pick up.\n\nAs such they can get all over the place as you increase your party in size. Thankfully you can upgrade them via outfits to transform them into pseudo-adventurers that are better armed than our yellow poncho clothed club swinging ones.\n\nNot only that, but the peasant garb, and unlocked outfits can be upgraded and improved upon.\n\nSo head to your tavern, pick up a quest and click Dungeon to get started. The game is is time trial based, so the quicker you do things and better rewards you get. Although in many cases some quest rewards are so lucrative you really don't need to scrounge around wasting time smashing crates or looking for coins. Just rush through. Now while this does mean you miss out on bonus rewards and goodies, you can upgrade the Quest Rewards with level points. Further making them an even better option.\n\n\nSadly the dungeons aren't very random, and you can often get the same routes over and over. I do hope they add some procedurally generated versions, along with more quests.\n\nSo far it's fun, and considering the price it's well worth it in my opinion.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JgIMddTc60","September 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The art style is cute, the animation is adorable and while I sometimes would lose half my party due to drift when I had to take a sharp corner, I never felt like the game was being unfair or cheating me in any way.\n\nThe game is more than reasonable at its current price and I look forward to seeing what other additional content the developers put in between now and official release.\n\n10/10 would accidentally steer my group of cosplaying peasants into a spiked barrel again.","September 10, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

The game is fun, and it is great to beat quests or watch your little minions die.\n\nThere are a few things that could be better.  In the game traps are way more deadly than monsters.  The designers clearly know this because some of the later levels are really trap heavy.  The monster variety is at best OK, and there are no powerful bosses to defeat, sometimes just rooms with more enemies.\n\nAs you get more peasants to your party and level them up, combat against the weak enemies becomes easier, but the giant blob gets harder and harder to avoid traps.  So, while traps start out hard, they become very very hard, and while monsters start out maybe average in difficulty, they become very very easy.\n\nThere is a crafting mechanic, but I found that I always had so many resources that I would craft all items as soon as they were unlocked.  Armor upgrades and level upgrades make your guys a little tougher, which offers a little help against traps.  Also, going into the dungeon without selecting a quest and I found the difficulty of the floors could ramp up quite high.\n\nThere are only two different looks to the dungeons.  Still the game is very fun and pulls you along.  Once you have maxed out your levels and unlocked everything there is not much else to do, but getting to that point will only take you a few hours.\n\nThere is more good than bad about this game, and it is still early access so more improvements to come.

Also another point I would like to make out is the fact that when I am running so fast, I end up running into a fire pit and all my men die...  now honestly how is that enjoyable?\n\nAlso I find it very frustrating that because they move so fast I also find it hard to hit the pots and crates because there moving all around so fast in so many different directions. On another note I would like to add that trying to complete the level as fast as the default time is set for is a bit unfair considering I cant rush to break all the barrels and crates and again keep track of and control my people and then rush to find the exit all in 55 secs or whatever and fail the level and only get 2 stars... that needs to be increased by like a min for all levels and runs because it was a miracle when I was able to get 3 stars considering, Again Im not going to be able to enjoy the game if I cant take my time or at the very least not have to feel rushed and then i miss things and get frustrated because of it.\n\nAlright so overall the games amazing, literally been playing it for a while now, and On a more positive note.. the games interface and gameplay is very much enjoyable. I enjoy the enemies and the crafting system and grinding system as well. this is defiantly a game for the price that I would recommend, dispite my negetive comments about the game. this game plays out very well and just needs to be tweaked a bit, perhaps the ability to add in a little bit of magic, some new spells would work out great for this game. my last suggestion would be to have some type of Co op mode because this game should be also playable with friends, also some in game voice chat would be awesome too!","December 21, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed my time with it so far. You get to delve into a randomly generated dungeon, go through several floors, and make it to your destination. You unlock more classes, upgrades, and missions as you play. The basics are solid and it has an addictive quality to it that brings you back for more.\n\nUnfortunately, it also leaves you wanting more. I know it is in early access and I really hope they add more depth to it. I would love more customizability, more classes, better control of your squad, possibly taking control of one at a time for short durations so I can get some of the hard to reach gold without demolishing my squad. I would also love to see some more loot, the ability to equip individual soldiers, maybe even some kind of funny story.
