I'm enjoying it. But otherwise the engine is just too dated for me to recommend to someone who has no rose colored glasses.\n\nAlso, after playing a few levels of the Entente campaign, I've noticed that unlike Blitzkrieg there are no persistant "core" units that gain experience and can be upgraded through the campaign. This makes it more of a series of set piece battles.\n\nThere is a (free) Spanish Civil War mod for the first Blitzkrieg that has a campaign for both sides and as I recall does include core units and I would recommend that over this stand alone WWI mod.\n\nOn the positive side there are 3 campaigns (French, German, Russian) and a lot of unique (to the era) units modeled with numerous guns and armored cars and tanks. Also are a number of different cavalry units that function like faster infantry which I thought would be useful for flanking and attacking artillery behind enemy lines but they seem to have difficulty attacking.","April 9, 2015","true","5.1"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","44","48","5","0"

You buy one, simply gotta have the others. It's very intriguing to see the various ideas the developers had in mind unfold in this engine.\n\nEven if the games weren't perfect in terms of execution of said ideas.  World War One is one of those games that knew what it wanted to do but was rough around the edges in execution. Still, you couldn't hate the game for striving to be different. Even if it was at least a little.\n\nVeterans of Blitzkreig will feel right at home with this game, how this game plays is pretty similar to that of Blitzkreig. But isn't a blatent copy in the slightest. For starters, armored vehicles are not as common place as in Blitzkreig. Remember, this is the first World War were talking here. Armored vehicles were not in full affect yet and weren't as deadly. Infantry squads, calvery, and artillery will be the main backbone of your forces. Core units are also gone, but honestly, you can get by without them.  I couldn't see any major differences between them and regular units anyways.\n\nSame with avation being a rarity, though don't hold me up on that being historically accurate or not.\n\nFor those that aren't familar with Blitzkreig. Heres how the game plays: In every mission, you'll be given a set of goals to accomplish with a set amount of forces under your command. You'll have to utilize your forces in such a way that not only completes these goals but inflincts maximum damage on the enemy army. All while minimalizing damage to yours.\n\nBreaking away from the dependence on armor is actually quite refreshing. I like the old timey feel of the exsisting vehicles as they belch out smoke and fumes from their slow primitive engines. Back in those days, a tank was considered hell on two tracks. Artillery was espically a force to be feared. It was the bare boned basics of military power, but it certainly got the ball rolling for future generations of war.\n\nMy only complaints with this game is that there are a few typos, innaccuraces of the equipment, visual glitches, and other small issues such as these. But, you can pretty much ignore them as they don't ruin the game.\n\n\nOverall, if you're sick of World War Two and want to dive into a different period of history. Try World War One, it's an enjoyable expierence that may not be perfect. But you can't hate the game for trying something new.","April 9, 2015","true","3.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

I found this game and purchased it. The gameplay is pretty close to close combat, but differs somewhat than cc. Obvious reasons are they cover different wars. Also, you don't get to pick and choose which units you want to use and deploy for upcoming battles like in cc.\n\nBut, this is a very fun game, if you have the time to plan out all your attacks and how to use your artillery.","May 29, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also the lack of videos or images on the internet did not provide me enough information to purchase it. When it went on sale to $1.24 I thought I might as well try it out. When I first played the game I was surprised at how fun the game actually was. There are 3 different campaigns; The Entente, German, and Russian campaigns with a variety of misisons. The graphics are not the best but what would you expect from a 2005 video game and also the gameplay makes up for it. There is a little bit of historical innacuracy though, with tanks in 1914 but still, it is a good game. I highly recommend this game to any video game strategists that like the World War 1 era.","November 28, 2015","true","16.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
