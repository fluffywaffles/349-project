I can't tell you how many times I'd gotten mad when those little creatures fell though something they should have bounced off of...\n\nSome of the puzzles can be solved in ONE move... and those are later in the game where things should be more difficult.\n\nThe practically non-existent controls are just horrible. Again I can't tell you how many times I've tried to drag and drop something only to move the camera at a moment where seconds are critical. And at one point I couldn't complete a level even though I figured out where every single object needs to go because I can't move my hand fast and accurate enough to save all 69 of the little buggers.\n\nIf the controls were at least improved for some keyboard shortcuts then I'd say it would be a 'meh' game. Something to kill time.\n\nBut as it is right now with the flaky physics the horrible controls I can say that it isn't worth your time...\n\nGood thing I got it on sale for practically nothing or else I'd have complained.","January 22","false","3.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

It progressively gets harder and throws some twists into it; for example, if they fall too far, the little minions die so under certain circumstances you will be required to place your shapes well-before they arrive, or they die.\n\nYou have to be really precise when clicking on the shapes to drag them on the map, which is really frustrating on some of the levels, but still fun in the long run.","January 13","true","3.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

You can place 4 types of jumping platforms and a simple block by dragging them with mouse from bottom left corner. It's very unfortunate that game does not have keyboard shortcuts for choosing which object to place, since on some levels you need to place them really fast, and it's impossible to do with just a mouse.\nGame is poorly made. On start screen there are tiles for "new game", "options", "help", and one more, but there's no text on them.\nFor some unknown reason the game pretends to have a plot in some setting, which it does not. And nobody cares.\n\nStill, the game is very addictive. And short.

I do not recommend this game to people who do not have open minds and look for an exciting, action-packed adventure in a 2D "point a to point b" indie game. Most of the reviews consist of people saying that the game is boring. However, most of those people got it for 20 cents, like I did. It's really not a bad game at all, but the buttons in the main menu really do need to be fixed.
