If you were just going to get one of the trilogy, this would be the one I'd recoomend. The random and daily seed puzzles, plus the level editor and ability to download and share custom puzzles gives this third title in the series a replayability that the first two Hexcells games can't touch.\n\nI was a little hesitant in picking this up at first, since I found the difficulty jump between Hexcells and Hexcells Plus a bit daunting and couldn't imagine a similar jump in complexity between Plus and Infinite, but fortunately that wasn't the case. I found the difficulty level overall in Hexcells Infinite to be somewhere in between that of the first two titles. The game is a challenge, but not a frustration.\n\nI do still recommend the entire series, as it's one of the best puzzle games I've found on Steam (or elsewhere), but if your budget is limited, Hexcells Infinite offers the most for your money.","January 4, 2015","true","8.0"," 62 of 63 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","62","63","0","4"

I regret that only one of them provides special instructions (in this case "each column contains an odd number of blue cells") as I feel more of them would benefit the challenge variety. This absence is also partially responsible for the scarcity of satisfying "aha" moments, when several clues combine beautifully into a challenging part of the solution. Previous games had me complaining about the puzzles' less than perfect elegance: you usually have quite more clues than you really need. This is still a problem, even if it's now marginally less severe than it was. Another issue, especially for newcomers, is that nowhere in the instructions does the game direct your attention to the box at the top left corner, containing the number of yet undiscovered blue cells, even though it's an essential information for many of the puzzles. All of that didn't stop me from enjoying the 36 puzzles and feeling a real satisfaction each time I could perfect one. They are more missed opportunities than mortal sins.\n\nThe real attraction of Hexcelles Infinite, of course, is the randomly generated levels. There are 100 millions of them, so there is no risk of running out before growing completely tired of Hexcells. You can let the computer choose or you can specify a seed yourself, so it's easy to share a level with your friends . There is an option to use the date as a seed as well, and have a "puzzle of the day", but don't expect a leaderboard for it, à la Spelunky. The real question is this: "Are the randomly-generated puzzles as good as the hand-crafted one?" Predictably, the answer is no. Mainly because the elegance issue, that I mentioned above, is considerably worse. Random levels are chock-full of redundant clues, and lack any kind of the symmetry that makes a puzzle attractive. I find that a real shame, as it shouldn't be too difficult to devise an algorithm that gets rid of some of the redundancy, and maybe couple it with a difficulty setting. Are the random puzzles good enough to sustain interest? Your mileage may vary, depending on whether you play casually, or seriously. "Serious" players will lament the low difficulty. Most of them took me less than 4 minutes and I've yet to find one that I couldn't solve in less than 10. But that may be exactly what you're looking for, and as a way to relax and pass a bit of time, the random puzzle generator is serviceable. Nevertheless, my impression is that those that enjoy the kind of challenge offered by the 36 main levels, will find the random ones too trivial for their taste.\n\nAudio-visually, Hexcells Infinite is identical to its predecessors. You get the same white, blue and yellow colours, the same menu presentation, the same ambient soundscapes... It's all very nice and stylish, but a bit of variety, like selectable visual themes, for example, would have been welcome.\n\nHexcells Infinite is the best Hexcells yet. It feature another 36 good, difficult puzzles and the random number generator has the potential to satisfy your need for casual puzzle solving during a great many hours.","September 8, 2014","true","16.4"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","3"

Really makes you think. It's similar to Minesweeper that comes with Windows but much more complex. There were new ways to think about the puzzle added from Hexcells to Hexcells Plus and now even more into Hexcells Infinite.\n\nThe reason this third release beats the previous games a million times over is the infinite play. You can endlessly generate random puzzles, making the game endlessly replayable. Puzzles are short, taking anywhere from 1:30 to 15:00 minutes depending on complexity, so it's a nice way to kill a short bit of time.\n\nThere's not much else to say. The background music is relaxing. The game is easy to learn but still pushes you to think through each puzzle. And you can't beat a $5 price tag. I didn't even wait for a sale on this one after playing the previous games. No regrets.","October 9, 2014","true","76.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/availableusername2/recommended/304410/","availableusername2","availableusername","http://steamcommunity.com/id/availableusername2/","285 products in account","After a couple of hours playtime, I can honestly say that the game is everything I was hoping for.\nIf you didn't like the first two installments, don't bother with this one either since it didn't bring anything new to the table gameplay-wise when compared to Plus. It's essentially an ultimate version with some _really_ hard levels, where you can stare at the board for ten minutes at a time before you have deduced the next possible step.\n\nThe logic involved seems to me to be a bit more advanced than in Plus sometimes. There are for example more occasions, in which the puzzles require counting the remaining blues and determining by addition of unsaturated column-restrictions and number-blocks, that there is no possible way that some unrelated  cells could be anything other than blacks (or blues), often giving you the decisive hint to complete the puzzle.\n\nI'm three levels short of completing the game, but will pause for now, since it's getting late and sleeping during work hours is for some reason frowned upon at my job. But the level-generator is certainly great for long-term motivation and I can see myself going back to it every now and again, even if the resulting puzzles don't seem to be as challening or clever than the hand-made ones.\n\nIn terms of presentation, little has changed compared to Hexcells Plus. Wouldn't have needed to anyway, in my opinion. Saving puzzles is nice though when you're stuck, and as someone who enjoys watching tv-shows or listening to music while playing, the option to turn off music and sound separately is great and much appreciated.\n\nIn conclusion: Truly good successor with very well designed puzzles and another difficulty-increase. The level-generator is the icing on the cake, I recommend this game to every puzzle-fan. Though if you've never played any hexcell-game, you might as well start with Plus (or even the original, which I've personally found a bit too easy, but still makes an excellent tutorial to the series). Just play them all in order, and continue playing infinite for the random-puzzles once you're done with the handcrafted levels! :)","September 1, 2014","true","74.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/304410/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","Sequel to Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite is more of the same in a similar package and with fairly similar ambient musical theme and abstract graphics. This is in no way a bad thing.\n\nLike in the originals, the game mechanics are simple but interesting: you have to find out whether all the hexes within the puzzle are blue or black with rules similar to Mine Sweeper and Hanjies. Baseline is that you can always deduce everything: no guessing is required. Though guessing is not punished either. Nevertheless, you need a near-perfect streak to acquire most achievements.\n\nThe mechanics have not changed at all after the originals: black hexes contain a number that states how many hexes around it are blue, and blue ones might contain a number stating how many hexes in a two-hex radius are blue. In addition there are Hanjie-like column-numbers that state how many blue hexes are there in a given line.\n\nAll 36 puzzles are new, so the owners of the original ones will be pleased. The difficulty curve is a bit steeper than in the original Hexcells but little less than in Hexcells Plus. In effect, it is great as a stand-alone title requiring no knowledge of the two games from before. For me it took 8 hours to complete all 36 hand-crafted puzzles.\n\nThankfully, saving within a puzzle has finally been provided! I have to wonder why it wasn't featured in the originals. The other new, much-sought after feature are the random-generated puzzles that add a ridiculous amount of replayability: you provide a random number seed and the level is generated, there being supposedly 2 billion levels. Unfortunately, I found the random levels frankly uninspiring and underwhelming in difficulty when compared to the original puzzles. Curiously, the way the random seed is provided introduces a social feature: you can post the coolest random levels (i.e. their seeds) to public forums for others to try. With so many random levels, there are bound to be some gems in the flock discovered only by trying.\n\nWith Hexcells Infinite, I'd wager this kind of puzzle game has pretty much been perfected as a concept. I would certainly welcome there being more of these cleverly crafted and well-designed puzzles. The graphics are as perfect as they can be for an abstract game and the ambient music fits the abstract theme splendidly.\n\nIf you already played and enjoyed Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, this game is a must-buy. Otherwise I'd really recommend either Hexcells or Hexcells Infinite for their balanced difficulty curves.","June 3, 2015","true","15.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Ha, Hexcells Infinite just laughs at that.\nThe puzzles are so well made and most of the time you'll stare at your screen for a good 10 minutes until you see what you have to do for the next step, and often it turns out to be the most simple thing, the game hides its clues very well in the least obvious way possible, so I really recommend playing the first two games before this one to get you ready, but before you do that, i'll let you know, that no matter what, there is no need to guess in all of the Hexcells games at all, so try to think twice before you make your next move!\n\nAnd now, the new stuff! Randomly generated levels, I find them pretty enjoyable, they are all possible without guessing, which is impressing! The only problem I have with them is that they are kind of "too easy" compare to Hexcells Infinite levels, but I don't blame the creator for that, they are still very enjoyable to solve.\n\nAnd the last thing left, the level editor, yes you heard me, a LEVEL EDITOR, everyone likes level editors (Ri.. right??), however, the level editor does not come with the game and needs to be downloaded from the Steam Community, but I didn't really mind that, the level editor also has an auto-solver that tries to solve your puzzles to make sure they are 100% possible without guessing, and I find that neat, the editor is fun to mess around with, and will sure give you a few hours of enjoyment.\n\nAnd now for my final opinion:\nHexcells Infinite is a MUST for any puzzle fan, it's great, fun, and cheap, and has a great replay value because of the randomly generated levels, and the level editor.","September 1, 2014","true","106.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game base mechanics feel like a mix between Sudoku and the old Microsoft Minesweeper.\n\nOne difference should be pointed out, though: Sometimes in Minesweeper, you would end up having to guess, because with the information available to you, there were more than one possible solution. Not so in Hexcells. There's always enough info to get you one step further. You just have to be able to process the information properly. Don't get me wrong - there are times when I've been completely stuck. Some of the later pre-made levels are monstrously tough to do flawlessly. The fact that you know it's all down to you and your abilities though, makes it more of a challenge and less frustrating.\n\nThe ways the information about the board is communicated to you, has been one of the primary points of evolution in the series. To my mind, the developer has been extraordinarily clever in devising new ways give you hints. If you haven't played the earlier games, the major difference for you as a player, is that the boards are much more varied in this version, simply due to the developer having more tools available to play with. The earlier games are good, but this version truly shines.\n\nThis latest iteration is called Infinite for a reason, though. He has finally been able to make a level generator, which only needs an 8-digit seed to produce a board. That means if you really want to, there are 100,000,000 boards to play. It's not really infinite, but for all intents and purposes, it might as well be. One of the fun things about this level generator, is that it gives you the possibility to challenge other players to complete the same boards as you do. All you have to do is tell them the seed for that board.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of abstract, number-type puzzles, this game should keep you occupied for quite some time.","January 15, 2015","true","312.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

If you play it properly and not just by clicking random cells until you finish it, then it is superb.\nIn order to get the best out of this game (and in my opinion the only way to play it) you should challenge yourself to not make one single move if you are not 100% sure about it. As many have said before; the puzzles are supposed to be solved without having to guess or be in doubt whether the cells should be blue or not, so do not guess, do not think "hm, maybe this should be blue", "this is probably right" or anything along these lines. If you are not completely sure, then do not click.\n\nImprovements have been made since the last two games. One is that you can save your puzzles and then go back later and finish them (which is what I recommend you to do if you get stuck. Take a break, go do something else and then come back later and you will see new per,c  that you did not see before. It is so easy to get stuck focusing too narrowly on one area or staring blindly on a spot that might already be solved). The other thing is that a random puzzle generator has been added. Although the random puzzles are easy and does not require much effort and thinking they are still addictive! It is very relaxing to solve them and great if you just want to wind down a little bit.\n\nIf you are already a fan of minesweeper or sudoku, then you will LOVE this game. Hexcells is the perfect mix between those two.\n\nIn conclusion; I cannot recommend this game enough! I loved the first two ones, Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, and now with this one having a random puzzle generator just makes it the ultimate puzzle game.\n","March 11","true","120.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.\n\nThe Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.\n\nplaying Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to "calculate" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.\n\nLater versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.\n\n\n10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did\n","May 28, 2015","true","11.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

It truly is a complete masterpiece and I don't think anyone could come up with a better long lasting puzzle idea if they tried. Wheras I find most puzzle games loose there charm after a while of just doing very similar puzzles over and over again I find that hexcells has enough variation to keep it intriguing and fun to play for hours on end!\n\nSo hexcells infinite is a follow up to the originals, hexcells and hexcells hexcells plus. They are pretty much identical games with a few differences. I will cover all of the games in this review because I think if your going to play them you should start from the beginning and play all of them. The original hexcells is a very easy concept version of the two later games. I say concept because this is what it felt like at this stage. Its as if he was just testing the water as to whether people enjoyed it. It was very simple and when replaying it, it only took me around 1 hour to complete. But then you go on to hexcells plus. This is a very large step up in difficulty and really does get you thinking. Infinite follows on with this step up in difficulty following around the same level of difficulty.\n\nWell what do you do in hexcells? It's basically an upgraded version of minesweeper. Having the field instead in a hex format makes for much more extensive gameplay. They have extra functions in around the hexes instead of just numbers. You have {} which say that the hexes are connecting each other. - - show that they aren't connecting each other. You have large orbits (Not sure what to call them so that name will do?) which show how many hexes are in a large area. And finally there are numbers above some rows that show how many hexes are in that row. So all of these new elements really make you have to think and utilize all of them together to complete a level without making mistakes.\n\nThis newest entry series introduces a new feature called inifnite mode. It is a randomly generated field of hexes that is unique every time. There is said to be 999,999,999 different combinations so good luck getting through them all. I have currently done about 150 puzzles. This is where the real longevity of the game comes from. Although infinite mode isn't quite as challenging as the story puzzles it does make it so you don't have to keep playing the default puzzles over and over. I have found myself playing hours on end on this mode.\n\nThere is one thing that makes this truly better than minesweeper. No guessing. Yes you heard that correct. There is no guessing at all in hexcells. The maps and algorithms are specially crafting so you never find yourself uncertain to whether there is hex there or not. This makes the gameplay infinitely more fun and makes it so it doesn't get aggrivating after a while.\n\nSo if you are a fan of minesweeper or any puzzle game at that hexcells is definitely for you. You can currently buy the hexcells complete pack for a price of £5.99 which is an absolute steal for the amount of time of gameplay you can get out of it. It is an ideal game to spend 10 minutes or so on now and then whenever you have a moment.\n\nReally this isn't the kind of game I expected I would lose my life to but i'm glad I found it!\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","July 31, 2015","true","32.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It has been called a cross between minesweeper and picross, and the description fits the basic mechanics. The game is soothing, with great sound and visual design, and with no time pressure. Although it doesn't end when you make a mistake, instead allowing you to continue playing, it does encourage you to keep mistakes to a minimum by giving you a score at the end of the puzzle, which is used to unlock furthur puzzles.\n\nAs for the puzzle design itself, the puzzles that come with the game have a great difficulty curve, but one which works best if you've played the first two games. It starts off with a refresher on the mechanics, but quickly becomes devilishly difficult. I fully recommend sleeping on some of them and coming back with a fresh pair of eyes; this is something the game lets you do, as you can end a puzzle and come back at any time. One potential issue with this is that it forgets which clues you have highlit or dismissed, although you may consider that to be a good thing as it forces you to reconsider every clue when you come back to the puzzle.\n\nThe automatically-generated "infinite" puzzles are much less difficult, but still fun for the most part. There is also a level editor that can be found on reddit, and a subreddit for user-made levels, which can be very fun.\n\nI heartilly recommend getting the complete pack and playing all three games in order, for anyone even mildly interested.

Do you enjoy cracking puzzles using logic? Do you want an endless amount minesweeper inspired logic puzzles that require 0% guessing and 100% pure thought to solve? Well Hexcells Infinite is just the game for you.\n\nAesthetically the game is very minimalistic, clear and clean. The ambient music and the soothing ethereal piano keys played, when you unravel successive hexes, can be quite relaxing.\n\nThe game has a finite amount of hand-crafted puzzles with a decent enough difficulty curve. The earlier levels are pretty easy to grasp and as more elements and guidelines are introduced the puzzles get increasingly harder. The last of the hand-crafted puzzles can be seriously challenging to beat using just your logic and not guessing without making any mistakes. But like I've said each and every one of these can be beaten without guesswork, just need to look at it in the right angle.\n\nAfter you've completed the hand-crafted there's the infinite puzzle generator. While I've noticed that the levels you get using the generator are usually a lot easier than the last of the manually created levels, so there's not that much challenge there anymore for me, but I still occasionally find myself popping back in to complete a few of them. It's refreshing to warm up your brain's logical thinking with them I suppose.\n\nAll in all I have to recommend this title to any puzzle fans and especially to those who love minesweeper (because it's pretty much minesweeper but better).

The board starts with an oddly shaped field made of orange hexagons. Mines are marked by left-clicking a hexagon, turning it blue. Hexagons are revealed by right-clicking, showing the number underneath if you click correctly and shaking the piece and adding a tally mark to your mistake count if you're too hasty in your decisions.\n\nHexcells Infinite expands upon the original two Hexcells games by giving players an additional thirty-six puzzles to complete that contain familiar gameplay elements for Hexcell veterans. Unlike the original Minesweeper, Hexcells is a much more complex game involving a board marked with various different types of clues that give the player hints about how many mines are in each column or in the surrounding area of the board. Hexcells also includes the dreaded ?, a marking that denotes a hexagon that has an unrevealed amount of mines around it, as well as numbered mines that indicate how many mines are in a two-piece radius surrounding the hexagon. These clues come together to create a thought-provoking experience that provides players with more depth and interaction than the traditional game of Minesweeper.\n\nOf the three Hexcells games, the original Hexcells remains my favorite. Both Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite include a few gameplay elements that I find more frustrating than enjoyable (namely the addition of ? hexagons that make an otherwise well-balanced game irritatingly challenging and often cause the player to have to make risky clicks based off of luck and some logical guesswork). However, if one were to purchase only one Hexcells game, that game would have to be Hexcells Infinite. As the name implies, Hexcells Infinite is the only game in the Hexcells series to include a puzzle generator, opening up endless gameplay and increasing the value of the game ten-fold.\n\nHexcells Infinite can be seen as an expansion to the original two Hexcells, adding thirty-six new levels for players to complete, or it can be played as a standalone experience, with the basics of the original Hexcells being explained in the earliest levels of Hexcells Infinite. This is the third and final game of the Hexcells series, with the developer not intending to produce more. After completing the set of levels contained in Hexcells Infinite, be sure to check out the original Hexcells games for more hand-created puzzles or continue on playing Hexcells Infinite with some of the randomly generated Hexcells levels.","January 2, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You never need to guess; the information is always there.  The magic here is in the ways the information is presented (at varying times you will learn how many tiles are on in a given column, row, or diagonal, how many tiles adjactent to a tile are on, how many tiles in a region are on, and whether the tiles that are on are contiguous or not).  Early in the game there is enough information to happily click through and solve the puzzles; late in the game, every bit of information has you trying to figure out how it can combine with existing information to yield one more "yes" or "no."\n\nThe end result is incredibly satisfying, a well-earned "perfect" score.\n\nIt also has replay value with a random level generator, but the real magic of the game is in the hand-crafted puzzles that force you to collate all the available information until the next logical action pops out.\n\nIt's a thing of beauty, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys logic puzzles.\n","April 3, 2015","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It’s the best of the Hexcells games, and the random level generator on top of the main game’s levels gives it more gameplay.\nLength: 4-8 hours (Main game)\nScore: 7/10\n\nFull Review: For those not familiar with the Hexcells series, the gameplay is similar to Minesweeper in that you must determine which cells on the board contain blue hexes, and which are vacant. There are various ways the game indicates which cells contain hexes, and which are vacant.\n\nVacant cells will often contain a number indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes (though sometimes they merely contain a question mark). Simply left click to mark a cell as containing a blue hex, and right click to mark it vacant (the game will indicate if you’ve made a mistake).\n\nAs you progress through the game more ways to determine which cells contain hexes are introduced. Columns (even diagonals) will contain a number indicating how many blue hexes are in that column. Numbers (for both in vacant cells and columns) will sometimes be encased in curly brackets indicating that the hexes are all connected in a line. Numbers may also be surrounded by a hyphen, indicating that not all the blue hexes are in a line (so there’s at least one break).\nBlue hexes may even contain a number, indicating how man blue hexes are in a 2 cell radius.\n\nThe main new feature to this game compared to past games in the series is its random level generator. So after you’ve completed the 36 levels in the main game, you have the option to keep playing as many randomly generated levels as you please, giving the game more longevity than past iterations.\n\nThe difficulty of Infinite is greater than the first game in the series, but notably less than the second. The difficulty curve is much more natural, and lends itself well to players who are new to the series. Depending on if you’ve played the past games or not, Infinite will probably take you about 4-8 hours to complete the main game.\n\nHexcells Infinite manages to fix one of my main criticisms towards its predecessors, namely that you may now exit a stage mid-way through and save your progress, allowing you to resume playing later.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn’t manage to the other main criticism I’ve leveled at the series. That being to introduce something akin to Picross’ overlay feature, allowing you to map out a potential solution before applying it to the board. This would be especially useful in more difficult stages when you must look at how many different cells and numbers interact together to determine which cells contain hexes, and which cells are vacant.\n\nIf you’ve never played Hexcells before, this game is a good one to get. The series pack often goes on sale for under $3 if you want to get all the games. If you only want one game in the series, then it’s best to just get Infinite. It has all the features of the prior games, a reasonable difficulty curve, and the level generator should help keep you busy if you want more stages to complete. If you’ve played the first two games then the decision really comes down to if you want more levels or not. However you choose to go, it’s worth giving Hexcells a chance.","February 25, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

The puzzles in the “campaign” portion of the game can be incredibly challenging to solve, but they don’t build much on the mechanics of the previous two games. Overall these puzzles were fun, but they didn’t exactly reinvent the wheel. A random, seed based puzzle generator is the main feature to be added to Hexcells Infinite. An essentially infinite number of puzzles can be generated, which was a feature noticeably lacking from the prior two games. Hexcells Infinite is simple enough to feel intuitive to anyone who’s played minesweeper, yet it can still remain challenging to veterans of the logic puzzle genre.","October 19, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The 36 main puzzles of the game are well made and very challenging, although some of the time you'll just be looking for that one piece of information you missed to progress forward. A lot of the puzzles are huge, and it takes some time to find that one tile you need to swap.\n\nThe second part of the game doesn't shine as bright, though; the infinite levels. You input or generate a random string of numbers, and a puzzle is made from that. When you've passed through the crafted levels, you'll likely find these generated levels simplistic and more of a timesink than an actual challenge. It's mostly repetition from what you've learned from the designer's levels, and while there may be some golden nuggets among these numbers, there's an 8-digit string to generate levels from, which is where the "infinite" part comes from. This of course doesn't mean they're bad, they're just not as good as the designed ones.\n\nAll in all, I can say that if you like brain training games that challenge your logical side, this one's worth it, and the infinite levels serve nicely as a filler for when you've got nothing better to do.","March 27","true","56.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They fixed one of my major gripes from previous iterations with this one in that when you exit a puzzle, it saves your progress so that you can continue at a later date. My only two issues remaining are as follows: 1) you cannot see, on the main map screen, which levels you have perfected (no mistakes), which is irritating if you are going for the perfect score; 2) you have to be 100% sure of every tile if you are going for the perfectionist badge as there is no 'undo' option, so one mistake on a massive grid means beginning all over again.\n\nThat said, I'm a perfectionist, and I get mad with myself when I make mistakes! If you haven't played these games, check them all out. Infinite introduces the 'infinite' puzzle mode, which relies on seed-based generation to present you with one of one million puzzles to work on, so it will keep you going for a while! That said, many of the generated levels (having completed over 60 at this point) are the same map with different layouts of blues and greys - unsurprising, but I seem to get one map in particular quite a lot.\n\nHighly recommended for puzzle fans.

Similar to Sudoku in that it's a very logic-based puzzle game, using deduction to find out which tiles are blue/black. In previous Hexcells, there were often multiple ways to solve a puzzle, in Infinite, it's often the case that there is only one approach to solving a level, which I found enjoyable and frustrating at times, staring at the puzzles in hopes of finding that one clue to progress onwards.\n\nWhat's new in this iteration is the addition of a level generator, which takes a number as a seed. Played around 70 of these so far and they're very varying in difficulty. Some that I've played can seem to be very similar. Also added in is the ability to save mid-level.\n\nWell worth it for the price for a few hours' casual enjoyment and easy to pick up for a quick puzzle (or ten!).","September 24, 2014","true","101.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gunstable/recommended/304410/","Gunstable","Gunstable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gunstable/","158 products in account","This is a must-buy game for fans of logic puzzles. It is similar in concept to Minesweeper, but is played on a hex grid. Gameplay consists of deducing which hexes are empty and which should be marked blue ("mines"). The similarity to Minesweeper ends there, and Hexcells improves on the experience in a couple of very important ways.\n\nFirst, the levels in Hexcells are hand-crafted, not the randomized grid of Minesweeper. And the level design is flat-out brilliant. You're led through a series of challenges of gradually increasing complexity, at each point figuring out new ways to combine the information you have and make forward progress. In all, the main levels constitute perhaps 6 to 10 hours of gameplay.\n\nThis version of the game (Hexcells Infinite) also includes an infinite mode with computer-generated levels. These aren't quite as aesthetically pleasing as the hand-made levels, but they are still very enjoyable. With infinite mode the game has infinite replayability.\n\nThe second thing that makes this game so fun is that all of the puzzles -- including the computer-generated ones in infinite mode -- can be solved using pure logical deduction. No guessing is needed, ever! (One could solve levels using trial and error, but that really isn't in the spirit of the game.) The sense of satisfaction here comes from figuring out the logical deductions, the "aha!" moments, that allow you to advance. The levels are brilliantly designed to give you just enough information -- if you're clever enough to piece it together.\n\nBuy all three of the Hexcells games. Each has different puzzles and all are equally rewarding.","February 6, 2015","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has great relaxing music and visuals, and the puzzles themselves are designed to be fun and relaxing.\n\nThat first paragraph is the one I copy/pasted between all of my Hexcells reviews. Hexcells Infinite continues the trend the others set, but is FAR more polished with more features.\n\nFirstly, along with the standard 36, there's a new puzzle generator using 'seeds'. Seeds is just a random string of numbers used to generate something, in this case a puzzle. You can choose for the Puzzle Generator to either randomly generate a seed for you(and therefore a random/new puzzle), or use the current days date, making it a sort of daily challenge. Either way, you can share the seed with friends and compete to see who does better.\n\nSecondly, there's far more sounds and music tracks to listen to while you play, all of which are wonderful and relaxing.\n\nAnd lastly, theres some customization options now. For those who have played the other two Hexcells, you know of the mechanic/clue thats a blue cell with a number in it that tells you how many blue cells are in the area, and that you can left click it to make it highlight its 2 cell radius. In Infinite, there's an option to make that highlight flash, or to make it not flash and have a black border. Either way improves visibility in the way you like it. Next is that you can switch which mouse button does what, so instead Left Click for Blue Tiles and Right Click for Black Tiles, you can reverse that so it's Left Click Black, Right Click Blue.\n\nAnyway, if you like Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, then Infinite is a absolutely must have. If you haven't played any, and can only afford one of the Hexcells games, then I recommend this one, as it has the Standard 36 Puzzles, Puzzle Generator, More Music/Sound, better Customization, and just generally better overall. And for those who don't know, each Hexcells has little text tutorials that does wonders for teaching and isn't invasive/hand-holding.\n\nEach new Hexcells DID introduce new mechanics, and while Infinite does explain it properly, I'd say get the Hexcells Complete Pack since it's such a great Puzzle game. But again, if you can only get one of them, get Infinite, I definitely recommend to any Minesweeper/Picross/Nonogram/Puzzle fan.","March 6, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The generated puzzles tend to be more simple than the handmade puzzles but it's better than nothing.  There is also a way to import user made puzzles using a code, so that's great too.\n\nEasily recommended for any fan of logic puzzles.

Once you complete all the levels the game still has replayability with the daily puzzle option.

Hexcells Infinite addresses both of those issues, though with varying success. It has to be said that the concept behind Hexcells is fantastic, and my issues with the games truly stem from wanting more, more, more!\n\nAs I said in my Hexcells Plus review, you'll get the most enjoyment out of the game if you  are disciplined and refuse to let yourself make a blind guess. Every puzzle is solvable without making a guess, even when you're absolutely convinced that there is no other option but to guess. You'll find (if you post on the forums) that you've inevitably missed some subtle piece of logic which will get you past the hurdle.\n\nToo Easy\nThis issue was addressed in two ways - later puzzles are harder, and community made puzzles - although I don’t find my appetite for these puzzles sated yet. The later puzzles got quite difficult and took me a significant amount of time to solve, which I enjoyed and appreciated. The community made puzzles are a good way of getting some tricky puzzles to do. Lastly, I have to say that I was disappointed to find that the first few worlds were once again a too easy tutorial, and I wish that the tutorial levels had been put into a separate section of the game so that we could have had 6 full worlds of puzzles to exercise “the little grey cells” to quote Poirot.\n\nToo Short\nAgain, this second issue was addressed in two ways - infinite mode, and community made puzzles. Infinite mode generates random puzzles for the user to complete and it certainly satisfies the issue of there not being enough puzzles. However, whilst it delivers quantity, it fails at quality. By quality I mean difficulty, because the randomly generate puzzles are far from difficult. It seems like a great idea with potential, but it could definitely do with some difficulty settings so that you can request hard random puzzles. The community made puzzles offer some harder choices to do, but it will take time for the selection to be built up.\n\nCommunity Puzzles\nI know this is getting a bit long, but this is an interesting new part of this particular Hexcells game. I will point you to the post that explains it and strongly suggest that you watch the two videos there because they do all the explaining (I originally didn’t bother to watch them and was confused for it). It is very easy to play custom puzzles, you simply copy the puzzle to the clipboard, open Hexcells, and click the option in the bottom right to play a custom puzzle. Making your own puzzles is something I haven’t yet explored. One note is that I’ve learned to mostly avoid any that have custom rules because the logic sometimes seems a bit sketchy leaving you to guess.\n\nCommunity Puzzle Links**\nHexcells Infinite Announcement - Custom Level Support\nHexcells Inifinite > General Discussions > Topic Details > “Level Editor: Create and Play Custom Levels!”\nHexcells Infinite community shared levels on Reddit\nGameplayThe concept of this game is wonderful. It adds a few levels of complication than Minesweeper and the solutions are all attainable through pure logic. No guesses are required, if they are sometimes tempting to do, so get in touch with your inner vulcan mind.\n\nSome of those complications I mentioned include:\ncells are hexagons\nhint numbers are quite varied, and form a set of logical rules\nin cells\nat the top of columns/rows\nsignify that "mines" are adjacent\nsignify that "mines" can not be adjacent\na larger hex area has a certain number of "mines"\nControlsVery simple - right click and left click. Plus, now featuring a button in-game to flip the button functions! Rejoice! This can also still be changed about in the options dialogue that pops up when opening the game.\n\nAlthough, by this time I've become entirely accustomed to them and didn't make too many stupid mistakes by hitting the wrong button.\n\nStorylineNo storyline, doesn't need one.\n\nSoundRelaxing gentle zen echoey noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does! It's fun to go back to the really easy puzzles and click through like mad to get a cascade of tinkling noises.\n\nGraphicsVery crisp, clean, and clear. The numbers are reasonably large. Some puzzles form an interesting overall image or pattern, and overall, the puzzles come across as well designed. There is also an option in-game to make blue cells with numbers have a different outline effect.\n\nPros+ crisp clean graphics whose job is to be functional\n+ simple controls to grasp\n+ more interesting concept than random old Minesweeper\n+ improvements over the first two games\n+ community made puzzles create more variety\nCons- still lacking in really tough puzzles\n- the random puzzles are too easy\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

It´s funny seeing this game accomplish something with way more difficult rules that microsoft coudln´t (looking at minesweeper right now).\nBut still, they are sadly too easy. They all feel the same and after a little while, i just got bored.\nNo comparison to what this game still does perfectly: The actual game.\nThe levels created by Mr. Brown are once again extremly well executed and with them, i would recommend this game to anyone enjoying thinking a lot and from time to time putting some numbers into the puzzle.\n\nEven with the "disapointment" of the level generator, this is still one of the best puzzle games on steam.","September 25, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you progress through the levels, you are also introduced to some new mechanics accompained by a tutorial level to make sure that you understand them. Because the puzzles are carefully and wonderfully designed, you never have to guess your next move, but finding it gets hard in the later puzzles. The interface is clean and the sound effects are cool. Hexcells is easy, Hexcells Plus gets harder in the second half and Hexcells Infinite steps back a little at the beginning, but in the end offers the most challenging puzzles. It also comes with a seed-based puzzle generator, adding 999,999,999 additional puzzles (even if they aren't hand crafted, they're still good). My recommendation is that you get and play all three games in order, but if you can only pick one, pick Hexcells Infinite, it's main levels difficulty is nicely spread not to mention the puzzle generator.","January 7","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main focus here is you, your mind, and your way of thinking, helping you evolve your thought processes and think more outside the box as you progress.\n\nThis game also comes with "Infinite Mode" which generates an unlimited amount of puzzles once you are done with the "campaign" levels. Once you finish those levels, the Infinite Mode puzzles are quite simple, and I find that I am challenging myself to finish the levels as quickly as possible with no mistakes, like Minesweeper.\n\nTill now, I'm still enjoying this game and open it up every so often to pass some time.","February 27","true","89.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Imagine if Minesweeper met Nonograms and had hexagonal babies... then you're close.\n\nPure deductive logic. The solutions are unique and reasonably tricky, but fair. There's no trick questions or guessing. If you're used to Japanese deductive puzzles (like Kakuro or Ken Ken) then ignore the previous 2 iterations and jump straight to this one.\n\nUnfortunately the 'infinite' puzzles are a bit inconsistent. Many lack much of a challenge, meaning you can kinda mindlessly click through them, akin to Minesweeper: relaxing but not overly taxing.

Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream "NOOOOOOOOOOO" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?\n\nWELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue.\n\nHexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.\n\nThe levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.\n\nSpeaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.\n\nThe Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\n\nScratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!","January 21, 2015","true","29.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

No new mechanics are added compared to previous games, if you played them you know what to expect but that is not necessary in order to enjoy this one.\n\nIt is Minesweeper-like game where your goal is to decipher the pattern and mark the blue cells by gradually eliminating empty ones. They contain numbers which show how many blue cells are adjacent to them. New rules are introduced which add to game complexity, such as number of cells in columns, clusters of cells that must be separated from each other or adjacent to one another and blue cells with numbers which show how many of them are located in a 2 hex radius. I completed the game in slightly less than 8 hours. Much of it were spent in staring at the screen in order to find which cells to eliminate. Ending levels are really big and spotting sometimes obvious solution can be quite tricky.\n\nThe biggest change is introduction of an Infinite mode, you can play as many random generated levels as you want. Your brain cells will be happy, your free time surely will not.","May 17","true","21.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Rage quits aside (just imagine sitting on level 6-5 for the last 20 mins, going strong and there's only a small patch of orange left, and you accidentally click on the wrong tile... yeah it happens a lot), this is a fantastic puzzle game. It's like a mix of minesweeper and sudoku so you know that makes it a challenge.\n\nThe 'graphics' in Hexcells Infinite are such a nice contrast from the typical 1080p, 4K modern games that require 2 Titan X's to run, and the simplistic GUI and overall layout of the game make it incredibily intuitive once you get started.\n\nThe 'infinite' feature of Hexcells is the randomly generating level packs that you can play, however, seeing as each one has a seed and thus is randomly generated, the levels lack the same quility and puzzling or challenging factor as the hand-crafted ones. Sometimes I might get a seed that is relatively small (around 30-40 blue hex's) and literally covered in 0's and 1's, and you just finish them in seconds, maybe even a minute. Other times I might get a seed that is larger than lvl 6-5 (which is actually so big it nearly doesn't fit in my display), but this time it lacks almost any useful hints that actually get you anywhere (unless you spend 20 minutes cross-checking every hint and their overlaps).\n\nAlthough the 'infinite' feature of the game seems a little broken, Hexcells Infinite is still an amazing game, and it is definitely worth your money. It will immerse you for the next few hours as you keep telling yourself, "Oh, I just need to finish this one level, I'll be done in a sec" until you finally finish (or then you miss-click).\n\n9/10 will recomend to anyone, even if you don't typically play puzzle games.","April 30, 2015","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It would take a player about 1,141 and half years (with a 6 minute per puzzle average) to exhaust every available puzzle, and that's assuming that they never eat, sleep, or take any breaks. If you were to buy just one installment of the Hexcells franchise, it would be a mistake not to get this one. It simply has the greatest value per dollar spent. (roughly 228 years of gameplay per dollar if you were wondering, and that's not even when it's on sale.)\n\nNumbers aside, this game is an absolute masterpiece. From the minimal sound effects to the tranquil soundtrack, the sound design is spot on and keeps the player engaged. The gameplay is heavily influenced by japanese logic games and minesweeper, but it still manages to feel completely original and unique. More importantly, the concept is easy to learn and it only takes a few minutes for a new player to get used to the gameplay and environment.\n\nAnd that's not even the best part - the best part is that it NEVER feels impossible to solve. More often than not, when a player makes a mistake, they immediately realize what they did wrong. Even if you feel like you're stuck, there's always that one number you missed that tells you where to look. This game is like a great magician, in the sense that a great magician leaves nothing to chance despite how wildly impossible their act may seem. If you love puzzle games, Hexcells Infinite is a must for your Steam library.\n\nI give this game a 9.8/10.\n\nNot a perfect score for the following reasons:\n- Highlighting an external grid number underneath another highlighted external grid number works OKAY, but I'm sure there are better options than white on white lines.\n- You can make any number of mistakes on the infinite puzzles without facing any sort of penalty. Maybe I'm just being nitpicky at this point, but it just seems like a loose end in an otherwise flawless game. They could at least have it set up in a way where the puzzle doesn't count as completed if you make 3 or more mistakes.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Themes! I'm talking unlockable themes, different hex colors, player-created backgrounds, custom cursors, and so on. This game would certainly benefit from workshop access and, dare I say, skins. It'd be nice to have a change in scenery after playing with the same background and color scheme for hours.","May 25","true","38.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlagwerk/recommended/304410/","schlagwerk","Paparazzi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schlagwerk/","211 products in account","The first and most obvious comparison of Hexcells is to Minesweeper, with two extra sides, and that's what you're going to get. Minesweeper is great for killing a few moments, from the basic versions in Windows 2000 and XP to the shiny new ones in 7 and 10. Start menu, "mines", press Enter, and away you go. Even when the hardest difficulty defeats me time and time again, I still find myself looking for it over Solitaire or Hearts.\n\nSo why does the "ambient logic" of Hexcells annoy me so much? Well, if you've picked up on how pretentious that quoted phrase sounds, you're riding the same wave of boredom that I am.\n\nTo put it plain, this game feels more like a tumor growing on Minesweeper than any real advancement. It's slow, it's overcomplicated, and it's not really about puzzles. It's about processes of elimination, like Sudoku, and with the pressure to complete every stage without error, you will feel discontent when you have to guess what's behind that next orange tile.\n\nDon't kid yourself on this point: if you're looking for any shred of entertainment you'll have to guess. Life is too short to work out every combination and deduce if you're about to ♥♥♥♥ up the tantalizing "Mistakes: 0" in the corner when there's regularly 50+ tiles and 10+ column hints to combine. Math majors aside, I don't know who could find that fun.\n\nBut enough of taking potshots at my humorless peers, let's take potshots at the developer instead. This game really is dead-set on monopolizing your time and attention. Minesweeper is a game to be played for a few minutes, preferably with the ability to quickly background it when something more important pops up (e.g., your boss rounds the corner). You're better off playing it on mute anyway; the audio is annoying and the interface is minimalist to a fault. Quick, exit to the stage select screen without touching the mouse (you can't) and without waiting for the pause menu to fully scroll into view (good luck). On OS X, this game disables every normal exit strategy to simply access another window - Cmd+Tab and Mission Control - and for what reason? Both Microsoft and Apple go to great lengths to disallow this behavior because even with the best of intentions, no application is so important as to block access to everything else. Yes, you can exit with Cmd+Q, yes, you can play it in a window by guessing at keyboard shortcuts, but disabling the ability to use my system as I see fit while it is running is really what made me cross over from indifference into irritation. And with gameplay this shallow, that's the strongest emotion this game musters up.","November 25, 2015","false","2.5"," 11 of 32 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","11","32","0","0"

It is similar to minesweeper, but with an important difference: there is no guesswork, everything can be worked out entirely through logic. So if you ever feel stuck, you know it is not due to poor puzzle design, but because you simply haven't reasoned your way through the next step yet.\n\nThere was one small downside to the previous Hexcells games, which is that it didn't remember how far along a puzzle you were when you quit the game. And since some of the later, more complicated puzzles can easily take more than half an hour to figure out, it is a welcome addition to Hexcells Infinite that it now stores your intermediate progress within a puzzle.\n\nIf this type of logic puzzle appeals to you, I highly recommend getting the Complete pack containing all three Hexcells games for the full experience.","February 1, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This obviously gives the game replayability which the designed levels don't really have, however the down side is that the random levels have a tendency to be feel fairly samey after a while, and it rare to find anything really challenging. But still it is a nice option to have and no doubt some relatively fun levels have been picked out by the community by now, so of the three this is definitely the one to get - although I think the entire trilogy goes on sale for a very reasonable price regularly enough, giving the advantage of easing you into the game more progressively, as well as having a bunch more of the excellently designed levels to challenge yourself from the two earlier editions to add to the ones in this edition.","January 16, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then, you'd hit a brick wall, can't solve this one! It'll have to be a guess! I once was playing a game. A proper one, of course! 99 mines. Expert level. Then after figuring out where all except three were. Brick wall. Right infront of the finish line. Had to guess. Failed it. Lost the game after all my work.\n\nI went on about minesweeper, because thats essentially what this is. Except for three things. They're hexagons, not squares. Theres a few gimmicks, like a count on how many mines there is in one line. And finally, NO GUESSWORK! NO ESTIMATION! Just a set order to figuring them all out. Thats so great!\n\nTheir is a good amount of challenge to this game. But only a limit. This one does have a random generator, but because it's random, the quality of the levels are decreased. You may run into a hard one, but it'll be rare, and probably just because your missing something important. If you want the difficult levels that the developers focused on making, get all the games. Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and this one. They all have a set of premade levels for you to challenge yourself.

The basic Minesweper-like premise of uncovering and filling in hexagons based on numerical clues remains, but the premade puzzles are more well thought out than ever. You are able to save your progress and come back later, a welcome addition, as well as restarting without having to exit the level entirely.\n\nThe infinite puzzle generator is the real draw of this game, and it does not disappoint. The algorithm doesn't generate puzzles that are quite as clean and stripped down as the main game; there are often redundant clues. This also means they tend to be easier, though, which comes as a relief to me after spending an hour unsuccessfully wrestling with a level 6 puzzle. I was a little apprehensive about the procedurally generated levels; I was reminded of Minesweeper's frequent guesses and subsequent frustration. There's no guessing required, though, at least in the levels I played. Really, having played the other two games in the series, I should have known better. There are daily puzzles (specifically, puzzles using the current date as the seed), and you can also play random puzzles. If you like, you can use the seed of a given puzzle and share it to challenge your friends.\n\nAll in all, if you like this sort of puzzle game, you should pick up Hexcells Infinite. It's worth it at full price. I'd recommend getting the others as well. Hexcells seems fairly easy to me in retrospect, but Hexcells Plus is every bit as hard as this game.","September 4, 2014","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay across the series is essentially the same (which is why the Curator links for the first two games also point here), but I'll cover the important differences between the three titles.  In the interest of full disclosure, the "infinite replay value" bullet point above only applies if you have "Hexcells Infinite".\n\nLet's just get the elephant in the room out of the way first; the parallels with Minesweeper are obvious.  That said, calling this a "Minesweeper clone" is like calling a Lamborghini a "Honda Civic clone" because they're both cars.  Even so, taking a Honda Civic around the block will still give you a decent idea of whether you like driving cars or not, so it's a starting point.\n\nThe Hexcells games will most appeal to people who like Minesweeper, but thought the game mechanics got a little bland and are irritated by the fact that some blind guesswork is almost always necessary on the harder boards.  Here, you've got a wide variety of "cell types", but arguably more importantly: no guesswork ever.\n\nThat's not to say Hexcells isn't tough; the first game may lull you into a false sense of security, I'll admit, but by the time you're solving the latter puzzles of "Plus" or "Infinite" you'll realize that this is a Dark Souls[www.gamesradar.com] of cell-logic puzzling.  I lost count of how many times I got stuck for minutes at a time, just staring at the screen looking for the next clue, finally seeing it, getting excited at the prospect of homesteading another swath of the game board...only to find that the logic train derailed after a single cell or two.  But it's not just that it's hard, it's that -- it's hard to describe without playing the game, but it's a common theme in people's comments -- you can tell that the author did it on purpose.  He knew you were going to be at that exact spot, thinking that exact thing, and he deliberately pulled the rug out.  It's just something about the way the puzzles go: there's a devilish humor in some of the dead ends.\n\nThe first game ("Hexcells") definitely has the easiest of the "designed" levels, and introduces most of the game mechanics.  It's a solid game on its own, and I would certainly recommend starting with it, but if you're only going to buy one of the three, skip it (but don't...buy the bundle).\n\nThe second game ("Hexcells Plus") features much harder "designed" levels (although they do start out pretty easy as well), and again I would certainly recommend playing it in sequence as part of the trilogy...but if you're only going to buy one, skip it (but don't...buy the bundle).\n\nThe third game ("Hexcells Infinite") has "designed" levels on par, difficulty-wise, with "Plus".  If you're only going to buy one of the three, this is the no-brainer choice because in addition to the manually-designed levels, "Infinite" also has a randomized level generator (the pedants in the audience will point out that it's really just a set of 10,000,000 procedurally-generated levels, but...yeah).  It's also the only one of the three to support user-created levels (the support is clearly a bolt-on in all its kludgy glory, but bless its heart it does work and kudos to the developer who went back in and added it in an update at the community's request).\n\nThe generated levels aren't nearly as hard as the lovingly-crafted "main campaign" levels, but they're difficult enough to give you a bit of a think and personally I like the fact that I can chew through them a few minutes at a time with a lot of action-packed, exciting clicks and right-clicks.  I've even encountered a few that had "gotchas" that almost looked deliberate.\n\nAs a last parting shot, just in case there are any of you out there who are thinking "I liked Minesweeper's gameplay perfectly fine thank you very much...but yes, the forced guesswork was annoying", check out Simon Tatham's "mines" implementation[www.chiark.greenend.org.uk].

Still a bunch of clever puzzles based around a hybrid of minesweeper, picross, and similar ideas,. The benefit of them being hand-crafted is that they can pull some neat tricks and have a pretty good difficulty curve, and you both know that there's some sadistic jerk out there responsible for it when you get stuck on one and then get to feel smart when you beat HIM instead of the computer.\n\nWhat's new is the "Infinite" mode, which randomly generates new puzzles. They're still satisfying to play, but they do show off why the previous two games and the other half of this one have human-made puzzles. The machine-generated ones don't have nearly the intricacy or intentionality that a person can come up with, so even though they do add to the game, they're not quite the same. It is interesting seeing the differences though, and they have their own kind of flavor, but they're generally somewhat easier and a bit...weirder. Still enough fun that I got all the achievements though, but the highlight is the main mode, and if you want more of those puzzles, the previous two games have those (although if you can beat this one, the first game will be very easy, and you really should've started there first).","April 25, 2015","true","75.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have almost 100 randomly generated puzzles completed and I am planning on trying to reach 1000. This makes the game so much fun and replayable it's unreal. The last games didn't have this and you had to just replay the levels, which basically forced you to memorize it, bringing down the fun. But this....I can't get over it.

It is similar to minesweeper, but with an important difference: there is no guesswork, everything can be worked out entirely through logic. So if you ever feel stuck, you know it is not due to poor puzzle design, but because you simply haven't reasoned your way through the next step yet.\n\nThere was one small downside to the previous Hexcells games, which is that it didn't remember how far along a puzzle you were when you quit the game.

This obviously gives the game replayability which the designed levels don't really have, however the down side is that the random levels have a tendency to be feel fairly samey after a while, and it rare to find anything really challenging. But still it is a nice option to have and no doubt some relatively fun levels have been picked out by the community by now, so of the three this is definitely the one to get - although I think the entire trilogy goes on sale for a very reasonable price regularly enough, giving the advantage of easing you into the game more progressively, as well as having a bunch more of the excellently designed levels to challenge yourself from the two earlier editions to add to the ones in this edition.","January 16, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's almost the same as the second Hexcells game but has some improvements, the puzzles are challenging again and definately worth playing. The price tag is a little higher than the previous games, but you get infinite puzzles back for that which is definately worth it! There are also some other improvements, the puzzle saves when you quit (this didn't happen at the previous games) and all settings are available from ingame (in the previous games, you had to restart and change some settings in a special configuration window). All this improvements and perfecting makes Hexcells Infinite the best puzzle game I played in years! If you don't have the game yet and you like puzzles, buy it as fast as you can!\n\n+ Puzzle Mechanics\n+ Can be extremely challenging\n+ The progress of the puzzle will be saved when you quit\n+ Unlimited playing time with the Infinite Puzzle Mode\n+ Some nice small improvements compared to the previous Hexcells\n+ Price is still very cheap\n\n~ Can be sometimes frustrating\n\nI rate this game 9.2/10, it's great, cheap, gives you unlimited puzzles, more than I could ever expect!","May 18, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anything more than two mistakes means less points.

This game is basically an upgraded version of Hexcells, but the puzzles are more challenging. They also introduced a reset option to make messing up more convient and a procedurely generated puzzle option for limitless puzzles. The game is way more difficult then Hexcells and Hexcells Plus and covers about the same material. Concidering how difficult it was I think playing the others first might have made this one more palatable as it starts out with a high level of difficulty. The soundtrack is fairly smoothing (something like a musical wooshing) and at one point I didnt notice it was playing loudly until I was asked to turn it down.

In short, this is the minesweeper of the new generation.\n\nHexcells Infinite provides enjoyment for both newcomers and veterans alike. Newcomers can enjoy the slow romp of increasing difficulty that teaches you the mechanics of the game. With veterans, they can immediately jump right into the tougher puzzles via Infinite Mode, which gives you difficult random generated puzzles, without concerning themselves with finishing the easier ones (that the newcomers are meant to finish).\n\nHaving Hexcells Infinite invalidates the existence of the 2 previous Hexcells games. The previous 2 titles end up only existing as a way of gifting to your friends and supporting the developers. This is absolutely fine because Hexcells Infinite is the next step in its evolution as a game sequel. Everything you need and more is in this definitive sequel.\n\nUltimately, this is game that is an expertly made for the expert to be. It has evolved in the right direction and should be played & kept by many for generations to come.","February 12","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only does this game add new puzzles for you to solve, it also adds a random generator for you to enter a random seed and get solving! Too much time on your hand? Don't worry, there are many, and I mean MANY, puzzles waiting to be solved by pure logic and process of elimination. Happy Solving for infinity and beyond!\n\nHere is my original Review for "Hexcells".\n\nOriginally posted by Enix:A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.\n\nContent\nMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?\n\nHexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.\n\nSound & Music\nShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.\n\nGraphics\nDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.\n\nWeakpoints\nSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard. Don't worry, if you are the enthusiastic puzzle type of gamer, you will get used to loving this game!","August 23, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for is many hours spent staring at yellow, grey, and blue hexagons, wondering for five straight minutes where the next move is, then this is made for you, but if you're hoping for perpetual puzzling potential, then move along.\n\nBe aware that the problem with the infinite mode is my only complaint. This is still a great game, but since the infinite mode is such a big part of the game that it's in the title, it has to be addressed.\n\nThe campaigns through all three games have a good number of memorable puzzles, some of which employ excellent variations in implimenting of the game's hint mechanics, but no such thing can be found in the infinite mode. Infinite puzzles are all bland, unmemorable blobs, and they offer no surprises in how they combine various hints. After playing about 15 infinite puzzles, you can be fairly confident that you have seen everything infinite can offer you in terms of challenge--even if it can challenge you at all. If you've managed to complete the entire campaign honestly, working to understand complex chains of hints, then most infinite puzzles should be trivial to complete.\n\nA trivial puzzle is not a fun puzzle.\n\nSo, yes.

I strongly recommend it to both casual and hardcore puzzle fans. While I've never played the two previous games, I've also never played a puzzle game that so elegantly turns simplicity into difficulty without any sort of contrived pressures such as time limits or fail states. You'll go from feeling like Aristotle to agonized trying to faultlessly solve later levels.\n\nSome describe it like Minesweeper, but I have no attachment to minesweeper. I never even understood it until a friend explained it to me in my 2nd year of college. You just deduce (and in my experience, with enough thought you'll never need to guess and check) where blue and gray hexes are in a field of uncovered, yellow ones. It's simple, but grows fairly deep as new mechanics are added.\n\nBetween the 36 handmade levels and the practically infinite levels, Hexcells Infinite packs more than enough content for me to recommend it at a full price. While it begins easy and ends quite hard, there's no fail state, so you can play as carelessly or cautiously as you wish. It also has some of the best puzzle mechanics for such a simple foundation such that it doesn't need to necessarily increase the number hexes to increase the difficulty of a level. The designers deserve a lot of praise, as the later levels are able to both hide and provide information, cleverly entwining hints and further complexity into one hex. It's casual, for sure, as it doesn't pressure you. I like this, because some of the levels truly frustrate me. If anything, it actively tries to sooth you with its clean and calm ambiance.","June 22, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only does this game add new puzzles for you to solve, it also adds a random generator for you to enter a random seed and get solving! Too much time on your hand? Don't worry, there are many, and I mean MANY, puzzles waiting to be solved by pure logic and process of elimination. Happy Solving for infinity and beyond!\n\nHere is my original Review for "Hexcells".\n\nOriginally posted by Enix:A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.\n\nContent\nMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?\n\nHexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.\n\nSound & Music\nShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.\n\nGraphics\nDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.\n\nWeakpoints\nSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard. Don't worry, if you are the enthusiastic puzzle type of gamer, you will get used to loving this game!","August 23, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty curve is much steeper in this last one.

If you haven't played any of the previous games, I highly recommend buying the original Hexcells before buying Hexcells infinite. While this game can be played without the previous two games, it's much harder to comprehend the scenarios and best moves without the original game as a guide/starter.\n\nIf you've played the previous two games, Hexcells Infinite amps up the difficulty. As a personal analogy, I didn't have much trouble with the first game until somewhere around World 6. On the second game, I started running into trouble about halfway through World 4/beginning of World 5. In Hexcells Infinite, I'm running into blocks around late World 3/early World 4.\n\nThe random puzzle generator works as intended; all puzzles that came up for me were all unique solutions. On average, the puzzles seemed reminiscent of Hexcells Plus in their difficulty; I think the main levels in Hexcells Infinite were, on average, harder than the randomly-generated puzzles.\n\nHexcells Infinite delivers on it's promise and is a satisfying last game of the series. I highly recommend this game and its predecessors to anybody who likes puzzle games.","December 30, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean that in a literal sense -- your IQ must not be high enough to understand it.\n\nYears ago there used to be this board game "Mastermind".  It was hard as hell, you had to deduce the colors that  your opponent had chosen and was hiding behind a tiny screen.  To make it more difficult, you could have blanks.  You had a limited number of guesses to deduce what the colors were.\n\nFlash forward 20 years to the game "Minesweeper" included with Windows '95.  In that game, as many of us remember, you had to figure out which of the hidden squares on a grid held a mine and which did not.  You were told, given an empty square, how many mines bordered that square.\n\nHexcells Infinite is a wonderful combination of both.  It requires focus, patience, and some abstract reasoning abiliity.  Some evenings, after a long day at work (or working two jobs), I actually find it pretty relaxing to be able to focus my thoughts on something else.

Another means that there are that number of minuntes bordering the hex, but they are not next to each other (for example, [3]).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/304410/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A logic puzzle that is like a combination of Minesweeper and Kakuro. Simple design & graphics, fitting music. You have numbered tiles that tell how many adjacent mines there are. And later on there are numbers outside the grid that tell how many mines are in that column and numbers inside mine tiles that tell how many mines are within a two tile radius. You use the information given to get through tiles and eventually uncover the whole area. There are no game overs (so you can continue on despite guessing or making mistakes) but you can do the puzzles without guesswork.\n\nThe controls are pretty simple (left click to mark as a mine, right click to reveal). You can also right click on column numbers/mine numbers to hide them. It's not very obvious but you can access the menu/restart the stage by clicking on the word MENU on the top left corner.\n\nI enjoy logic puzzles and these kept me entertained for a several hours (I spent a good amount of time just thinking about the problems and eventually got hints from people on the forums).\n\nThe Infinite version finally allows for saves so you can safely take a break during puzzles (which I often did to reset my mind and try again later).\n\nIt also introduces randomly generated levels (based on seeds) so you can keep playing after you finish the campaign. However, from my limited experience, the randomly generated levels are usually not as satisfying as the dev-selected campagin levels. The generated levels don't usually require thinking about more than one layer of information at a time and have a good amount of simple cascades. I didn't really think about or appreciate the developers' puzzle design skills until I started playing the generated puzzles.\n\nThe most polished and, in my opinion, the best of the three Hexcell games. The difficulty curve isn't as steep as Plus (they offer more levels that help show needed concepts) but I'm not sure if Infinite is a little easier than Plus or if Plus' puzzles conditioned me and helped me solve these faster.\n\nIf you like logic puzzles like Sudoku/Kakuro you should try the original Hexcells first. If you enjoyed Hexcells and are looking for a new and harder challenge, this will probably be your cup of tea.","January 10","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cheesing in the Cells.Genre: Minimalist Casual Atmospheric Number Puzzlers\nDeveloped & Published by: Matthew Brown\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review about the entire Hexcells Series on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nHexcells is a minimalist puzzle game that I like to think of as a combination of Minesweeper and Sudoku. A comparison that has probably been made elsewhere. Every level is basically the same. You’re presented with a variable number of cells with a number in the top right corner telling you how many blue cells there are in the puzzle. The challenge is figuring out which cells are blue and which are numbers. If you guess incorrectly, it’s counted as a mistake that will affect how many points you get at the end of a level. The numbers on or adjacent to cells are telling you how many blue cells are connected to them. It’s up to the player to figure out the pattern by examining the numbers. In general terms, if there are two unknown cells connected to a cell that has the number “2” on it, they’re both blue cells. There are several different mechanics used to confuse the player and make them logic out the solution. Upon completing a level, you’ll be rewarded with points that are used to unlock additional groups of levels. As such, this does requires you to complete most of the puzzles with a minimal amount of mistakes in order to progress forward.\n\nHexcells: Infinite Features\nHexcells Infinite is the fully fleshed out title. It has Steam cloud, the most challenging puzzles (36 new ones) and a random puzzle generator. It also has the ability to change the mouse buttons. The random number generator has the same pluses and minuses as most randomly generated systems do. It’s a lot of content but the quality of those puzzles will be all over the place compared the developer’s handcrafted ones. Still, there’s a neat level here and there. Additionally, the player is able to save their place in the puzzle and quit the game if they need to. The other two games do not.\n\nMy Main Issue With Hexcells\nHere’s the problem I have with the entire Hexcells series. It’s a pretty good puzzle experience, if you play it how it’s intended to be played. However, I feel that they have a problematic design flaw: all of the puzzles can be cheesily completed. If you’re stuck at a certain sequence, you can just click through the rest of the puzzle making as many mistakes as you like. (I had some puzzles at 50-60 mistakes). What about the points you would get from a near perfect completion? Well, once you nearly finish the puzzle, take a screenshot and then instantly replay the level with your own personal guide. It’s possible to win all three games this way without much effort on your part.\n\nPC Settings & Audio/Video\nIt’s a minimalist game so there really aren’t many settings to change. Since its running on the Unity engine, the Unity launcher menu pops up when you start the game every time. It allows you to change resolutions and turn fullscreen on/off. The graphics quality is set to beautiful and can’t be changed. However, I was able to play this on a basic, five year old laptop running Linux Mint and there was absolutely no trouble running it. Alternative keys can be changed here as well. Hexcells Infinite was the only game of the three that allows you to swap the left and right mouse button functions.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nOverall, I think the Hexcells series is a decently executed puzzle idea with plenty of content. I take issue with the lack of anti-cheat but it's not enough to make it an anti-recommendation. (Thanks to a friend for making a case to change my mind on this). It’s a fun logic number puzzle series. And I did play the three games how it was intended too, with a few exceptions. I had quite a bit of fun deducing the my way through the levels and had several “aha!” moments despite it’s more casual nature. Additionally, it maintains a mellow and atmospheric experience that I can appreciate. While there is the less honorable part of myself thinking “you can just easily ‘cheat’ this game and not spend hours on it”, that doesn't disqualify it from being a decent puzzle game. So, if you can avoid cheating yourself, get the Hexcells series. But if you can’t restrain yourself from looking up help on even the slightest bit of challenge, I probably wouldn't get it. Otherwise, that's my thoughts on this series.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","January 15","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "campaign" is nice as usual, neither worse nor better than the previous. This time, though, they introduced a random generator, so you can play an infinite amount of riddles - hence the title. These do not feel as polished and nice as the campaign puzzles, but it's a nice addition when you've completed all the games in the series.","July 1, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That doesn't stop it from being awesome, though, this game is worth it's price just in the audio alone.\nThe game might remind you of Minesweeper, but unlike that luck based "puzzle", you will never have to guess what's under any of the hexes. If you don't know what to do, then it's all your own fault.\n\nIf you haven't played Hexcells or Hexcells Plus, then I would recommend that you try those first. The difficulty curve is much steeper in this last one. If you have played the other games, this one adds a pack of even more challenging levels, and an amawing level generator that adds virtually infinite replayability.\n\nIf you want a good puzzle game, buy this, now.

The acceleration of difficulty in the puzzles is not quite as steep as in Hexcells Plus, so you could start with Hexcells Infinite without first playing Hexcells. (I recommended practicing with Hexcells before diving into Hexcells Plus.) This edition comes with a really neat feature to generate puzzles randomly (hence the "infinite"), which provides endless hours of puzzle-solving fun! My only complaint is that the randomly generated puzzles seem to be relatively easy, for the most part, due to a lot of duplicated/unnecessary information provided. I don't know what sort of algorithm the authors use to generate the puzzles, but if the algorithm is flexible enough, it would be nice if the amount of information provided could be customized so that players could choose their difficulty level. Otherwise, Hexcells Infinite is a great puzzler that I'm sure I will be enjoying for a long time to come.","November 29, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In short, this is the minesweeper of the new generation.\n\nHexcells Infinite provides enjoyment for both newcomers and veterans alike. Newcomers can enjoy the slow romp of increasing difficulty that teaches you the mechanics of the game. With veterans, they can immediately jump right into the tougher puzzles via Infinite Mode, which gives you difficult random generated puzzles, without concerning themselves with finishing the easier ones (that the newcomers are meant to finish).\n\nHaving Hexcells Infinite invalidates the existence of the 2 previous Hexcells games. The previous 2 titles end up only existing as a way of gifting to your friends and supporting the developers. This is absolutely fine because Hexcells Infinite is the next step in its evolution as a game sequel. Everything you need and more is in this definitive sequel.\n\nUltimately, this is game that is an expertly made for the expert to be. It has evolved in the right direction and should be played & kept by many for generations to come.","February 12","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a mode with infinite or more accurately "more puzzles than anybody has time to play", which allows you to keep playing new puzzles for as long as you want after the main puzzles are done. The downside is that the puzzles have differing difficulties and there's no way to say "generate a medium level puzzle".\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, there are no new mechanics from the other games in the series, but I consider that a good thing. The core gameplay was fun, so I'm glad that it wasn't changed. That said, some may feel that this game is essentially the same as the others but with things mixed up a bit.
