Due to everyone having issues posting a review currently I am writing this as more of a test and first impressions review rather than an in depth review at this time.--\n\nThe game drops you in with a tutorial and right away you qucikly realize that this is going to be a puzzle game that feels like it was inspired by the legendary Tetris at first glance. Except this game has something else to it rather than just dropping puzzle pieces down to get you to make them disappear. You are playing as a space ship commander that is on a mission to retrieve energy to save the sun, which makes your puzzling a bit more interesting.\n\nThe puzzle pieces dropping are combined to do specific maneuvers and powers. You combine them in a way to move your ship, destroy asteroids, or pick up some cargo. This makes it pretty fun to have this extra thought process going on while trying to avoid having the pieces reach the top for a game over.\n\nYou start in a "Story" mode and do missions that have you collecting energy to save the sun. On the left side of the puzzle screen you will be shown combos that you have to use to navigate your ship through whatever obstacles are shown at the bottom of the screen, or blast away at things in your way. As the pieces drop you must flip them and place them in a way that matches these combos to achieve the correct action for whatever it is your ship needs to do. It is simply explained by your friend "Pea" who makes it wasy for you in the tutorial without any enemies being around. As you adveance further more obstacles appear to make you have to think more aobut your end goals. Of course matching pieces that don't perform actions is important too for combos and filling up your special move meter.\n\nAs I said this is a quck first glance so I can't say much aobut more advanced game modes, but my first impressions are that this is a fun puzzle game with some new ideas in the "falling blocks" genre of puzzle games. Based on the few missions I played I should also note that you are able to collect in game currency that allows you to buy ship upgrades, better ships, and different commanders. So there appears to be some extra collectible and RPG elements to this as well.\n\nGamepad support works fine for me and I have had no issues with it through the first few missions. The game also has 9 Trading cards, for which you get 5 drops as well as Steam Achievements.","February 13, 2015","true","2.8"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","27","30","3","1"

This game will get your brain going, let me tell you!\n\nLetters, numbers and arrow cubes will drop (you will be able to rotate numbers from 1 to 4 for example) and you will have to get combinations to move your craft up/down or right/left, get armour and shoot your enemies as fast as you can. Also, your enemies will constantly be moving so you have to be attentive in that regards. What I really like about this game is the fact that you really have to plan your moves (in advance, like a chess game) to be able to beat your foes as fast as possible. If you actually managed to get an “A” ranking at the end of each mission you will get a fair bit of money to upgrade your spaceship.\n\nAs you progress, you will be able to get other ships and commanders to help you in your missions.\nGraphics and soundtracks are decent and the game runs smoothly. The controls are easy but it will take you time to master them.\n\nOne small negative for me is the loading time between missions, it is a bit slow.\n\nFor $5.94, your brain will have a work out and you will have a lot of fun.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Challenging\n-	Fun to play\n-	Achievements\n-	Trading Cards\n-	Well structure idea\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Loading is a bit slow between mission\n\nMoney well spent!

Was looking for something to fill in my 'casual' niche, and this fits the bill. Ended up getting a free key from somewhere, but I think it's worth a few dollars.\n\nYou essentially control a space ship (movement, shields, firing, etc) by clearing certain patterns of blocks - a slight twist to the usual "match 3 and clear" type of puzzle games. Initially it seems quite limited (I stack all my D blocks here with a space next to them in case I need a 2 block to fire, etc), but after you understand the mechanics you can start to combo and become much more fluid (i.e. move up one AND immediately fire, rather than one and then another in separate moves allowing you to potentially be shot back). There is also some degree of flexibility as you further unlock different ships and different pilots (who all have their own special power that you can utilise) + upgrades you can purchase with credits earned through mission completion. It also looks fine as a game, and the audio does the job.\n\nI haven't yet played too far into it, but for me it's a thumbs up for being a good and quick timefiller if you haven't quite got enough time to play some other games.","February 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I wanted to wait and reserve judgement until I played a bit more of it, but I find that I really don't want to play anymore for one reason alone.  Too much loading time.  I'll run though a mildly accurate account of loading time.\n\nThese are the game events that occur and an estimated execution time.\nGame Launch to main menu = 30 seconds.\nLoad game to play mode = 30 seconds.\nPlay game length = 240 seconds (four minutes, but this widely varies).\nGame death and automatic restart loading time = 30 seconds.\nGame victory loading time = 30 seconds.\nSpecial pause time (Game pauses when you use your special move.) = 10 seconds.\nBoss appearance pause time = 10 seconds.\n\nSo lets say you just want to play one quick four minute game.  In your quest for your four minute game you will have to wait for loading screens and pause events for an approximate total of 2 minutes.  Which means that one third of your total time in this game you will spend looking at loading screens.  Obviously there are other reviewers who look upon this game with more positivity than I do, and I do see why.  There is an entertaining game in here between the loading menus.  I just no longer have the patience to see it revealed more fully.","February 13, 2015","false","3.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","2"
