"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdentityNon/recommended/337150/","IdentityNon","TRU±Identity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdentityNon/","287 products in account","Key supplied by developer for review.\n======================================Sentinels of the Multiverse (Read on for the full review!)\n======================================\nTL;DRDon't let the fun and colorful graphics fool you, this comicbook-esque card game has a lot of depth and challenge to offer. It is well designed and fun to play, and also sports some great developers.(Note that there is no actual story or campaign mode. You set up a battle and get to the action.)\n\n======================================\nPros+ Graphics: Colorful comicbook style!\n+ UI: Immersive and in-line with the comic-book theme. Looks really cool. Some things could be bigger or smaller, I feel.\n+ Sound: Good music, satisfying sound when cards are moved.\n+ Variety: Heroes and villains all have a unique style and playstyle.\n+ Simple: To play, hard to master. There is a lot of depth to hero and card interaction.\n+ Convenient: Put away your rulebooks and damage counters!\n+ Pre-built: No deckbuilding meta stress. Pick up and play. Also, this is probably a big factor in how balanced this game is.\n+ Faithful: More video game adaptions should be this smooth.\n+ Developers: Communicative, engages with community regularly.\n+ Multiplayer: The developers promised it. The developers delivered. No matter what the game, the ability to play with friends is always a plus!\n+ Price Point(DLC): You can pickup the season pass and (in the future) the second season pass for tons of DLC/content, however...\n\nCons- Longevity: Base game content is sprase without the DLC, although keep in mind it's not about the amount of vilains, but the way the fights go down, that add to the longevity.\n- Campaign: If you are the type who likes to unravel story, conquer enemies and levels, upgrading and powering up and unlocking achievements and abilities and cosmetics along the way...this won't be for you.\n- UI: Interaction at times can be stiff or finnicky.\n- Story: Would be nice if the starting dialogue was tailored based on villain, heroes present, and environment. For example, maybe rivals skip the small talk and just diss each other.\n- Confirmation: For example, with multiple card discards, it seems odd to go one at a time with confirmation, instead of batch selecting with a highlight and then confirming.\n\nNeutral+/- You will probably have to do a little research to learn to play well early on. Stick to low difficulty stuff until you learn your interactions.\n\n======================================\nIntroductionSentinels of the Multiverse is an adaption of a physical board/card game. It offers an accessible, challenging, and varied experience to anyone willing to put in a little time to learn the intricacies. It is a faithful reproduction, balanced, satisfying, and the developers seem solid with a lot of community interaction and involvement. The comic styled theme is deftly executed, which adds a lot to the experience and charm of this title.\n\nGameplayYour gameplay will consist mostly of strategizing: you pick what heroes to use, villain to face, and environment to do so in; by carefully choosing what cards to play, what cards to use, and the order certain events happen in, you can have a large degree of impact on how well or poorly you perform in your fights against evil. The tutorial covers the basics and is comprehensive, but can leave you lost as to how you are supposed to properly utilize heroes, or what heroes may be good for specific tasks. My advice in this regard is that no matter how you approach this game, if you are new to it, stick with the same heroes and an easy villian initially, and you'll learn soon enough.\n\nThe expansions massively increase the size of the roster, but even with the base game, there is a large variety of options for villains and heroes of which all feel unique; offering you the ability to adapt or to play the way you want with a large degree of freedom. While certain heroes are definitely more suited to certain villains, you don't ultimately have to use them to be successful.\n\nIn Sentinals of the Multiverse, you put a card into play at the start of your turn; this card may be a one off, a piece of equipment that stays on the field, or an on-going effect/power that can be utilized every turn. After you play a card, you can use one of many powers, of which each hero has a unique variety, as well as their own inbuilt power. Normally, you can use one power per turn; these powers can be anything from drawing one or two cards, healing your team, damaging the enemy or yourself, dealing low damage to many (or all) targets, or buffing your fellow teammates. Equipment and powers tend to fuel your cards--in turn fueling your hero--and be where most heroes derive the bulk of their strength or utility. After you have run out of powers you can use, you will draw a card, and then your turn will end. Pretty simple, right? It's really the interactions that make up the intracacy of this game, which is beautiful, because the actual act of playing is simple and easy, but the ability to do so well is entirely about your knowledge and cunning. This makes for satisfying defeats and triumphs.\n\nGraphicsThe art could certainly be better in some respects, but the style is consistent and very well executed. There could stand to be more animations and effects. The comic style lends itself to nice and quick transitions and creative menu graphics. Everything is bright, colorful, and vivid, so you really get that saturday morning hero vibe at all times.\n\nWell, being that this isn't exactly a AAA 3D game, I can't comment on lighting, shaders, the quality of the models and animations, etc. so that's about all you'd want to keep in mind.\n\nAudioThe music in SotM is very pleasing. I almost don't want to start games because I really like the main menu track especially. The sounds utilized for the various damage type are actually quite fitting and have their own charm. I really like the sound of the cards. Sound seems underutilized in SotM, and I feel like it could desperately use some subtle sounds when highlighting menu options and especially when clicking them. Well, the good news is, you don't really need much sound in a title like this, so it doesn't have as much impact as it would in a 3D adventure FPS.\n\nConclusionSentinels of the Multiverse is a great card game for those familiar or unfamiliar with the physical game. It offers a lot of pros, with almost no significant cons. It's easy to pick up, but it might take you a bit to learn how to utilize heroes to their fullest. The graphics and music will keep you pleased while you are sitting there trying to think your way through anything, or waiting on a friend in the newly implemented multiplayer.\n\nIf you are a fan: Pick it up.\nIf you are new: Consider picking it up. Definitely pick it up if there's a good sale.\nIf you are new but love the genre: Pick it up, you'll be pleased, but plan to get the DLC.\nIf you are new and willing to pay a bit for the DLC: DEFINITELY pick it up, the expansions massively increase the available content.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 8, 2015","true","5.2"," 65 of 85 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","65","85","4","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/firebomberseven/recommended/337150/","firebomberseven","FireBomberSeven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/firebomberseven/","342 products in account","Digital version of an incredibly addicting tabletop game with tons of replay value. The UI is smooth and easy to use, and all the cards are very readable at different resolutions. The ability to active/use cards without having to double-click each one is very handy once you get used to the game and learn the cards by heart - which will happen if you use a hero long enough. The music is great as well, which was a pleasant surprise, and fits the superhero theme wonderfully. The inclusion of unlockable variant promo cards is a great addition, because each varant changes up the base power of the hero, or in the villain's case can really change the way the villain plays. This adds even more variety and combinations to a game already full of hundreds of hero/villain/environment combinations. And with the expansions inevitably on their way, there'll be even more. The tutorial is also really well done so you don't have to worry about being familiar with the tabletop rules before hand. It really walked through everything you could possibly need to know about how the game works, which is nice for those who've never played before.\n\nOn the flipside, the only thing I don't really like about this digital version is the lack of online multiplayer, although it is coming in a future update. The game does, however, lend itself really well to playing multiplayer locally by simply sharing the computer. And of course being able to play the game solo when you're craving a Sentinels fix is really where this game shines. Controller support would also be nice for playing on a TV, but that is also coming down the pipe eventually. Handleabra games is really doing a nice job of making the transition from physical boardgame to digital version.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it plays exactly like the tabletop version. Each player takes control of a superhero and teams up to take down a villain. Each hero has it's own unique deck of cards with wildly varying playstyles between each hero. Legacy, for example, is the paragon of justice who uses his cards and abilities to buff and defend his team of heroes, while someone like Tachyon uses her super-speed to burn through her deck drawing and discarding cards, many of which do more damage based on how many specific cards are in her discard pile. Each hero's deck of cards fits the hero's theme and superpower wonderfully, making for a different experience and strategy with each hero.\n\nHowever, the villains also have a deck of cards full of minions and nasty super-powered attacks to take down the heroes. At some point during the game the villain's card will trigger an effect that causes it to flip over, which changes up the mechanics of how the villain plays - and sometimes changes the max HP the villain has. Plus each villain has a nemesis (or multiple ones) attached to it, which means the villain does extra damage to his nemesis, and vice-versa. And you can't forget about the environment you're playing on. After the villain has had his turn and all the heroes have gone, the environment itself gets a turn and draws a card from it's deck. Sometimes the environment deck helps the heroes out in someway, most of the time it does horrible, horrible things to the players like having pterodactyls steal all of your equipment. Each enviroment has it's own gimmicks to it's deck. Megalopolis has lots of city hazards like a speeding train that can damage both heroes and villains, or cops that show up to aid the heroes. Meanwhile something like Wagner Mars Base has a self-destruct timer, which if it reaches the end kills both the heroes and the villain and everyone on the Mars base ending in a draw.\n\nThe game has hundreds of combinations, as each time you play you pick a villain, and environment, and anywhere between 3-5 heroes. Everytime you play even just changing one of those from the previous game can really affect the outcome of the game and change the strategy you'll be using. The game has so much variety, and the rules are so simple to pick it up, that it makes itself very addicting. You can play dozens of times and still be surprised when something crazy happens that flips the current game on it's head. I really can't recommend this enough.","December 22, 2014","true","16.2"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","37","41","0","1"

Even if you own the physical version you'll benefit from playing a few rounds to clear up any misconceptions you may have about the rules. Overall anyone that loves managing resources (in this case your hand), optimizing cost for effect, and figuring out challenges will LOVE this game.\n\nTo unlock the variants I think you need something like this:\nTachyon: 5+ burst effects played in one turn.\nLegacy: Get KO'd on wagner mars base by Baron Von Blade.\nBunker: I think I got this one by activating all of his modes in one game.\nWraith: You need to use the infrared lens twice in one turn. (Use utility belt with 2 copies in play or have embolden from Fanatic on Wraith with 2 copies in play.)\n\nBaron Von Blade: I think I got this one at megalopolis while fighting Citizen Dawn. I got it after killing Citizen Sweat, Blood, and Tear in the same round.\n\nOmnitron: Again this one took place in megalopolis this time against Warlord Voss. I had Tachyon, Legacy, Haka, Absolute Zero, and Ra on the team. I got this after killing both of his ships with ONE CARD.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nAlso don't be surprised if you develop the urge to buy the physical version to play the other heroes and villains.

While the current version doesn't support online play, it is much more user friendly to new players in comparison to the tabletop, allowing for a much quicker tutorial or first play. While you may not play against each other in Sentinels, the tension is extremely real and you'll easily find yourself anticipating or dreading the card flips as they come up. What's funny is that each game will never feel the same due to the number of variables of what does or doesn't happen for both the heroes, villains and environment.\n\nIn addition to the gameplay, the game has in depth bios of characters and bits of their evolving story on the flavor text of cards. The universe that the game exists in is expansive beyond just the tabletop experience, and you'll notice that the way how the character plays in the game is very representative of how their character bios describe them. There's also a lot of story that isn't just rubbed in your face, which will become a lot more relevant once they release the expansion material that exists right now for the tabletop game.\n\nWith Handelbra and GtG games both working hard to continually develop the digital version after it's release, this game is definitely a must buy for anyone who loves tabletop, card, or cooperative games.","December 23, 2014","true","63.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Those of us who are familiar with the tabletop game can skip the tutorial playthrough, but I skimmed through the manual just to make sure I understood the UI.\n\nThere is a lot of cards to keep track of but that's no different than the original. Fortunately you don't have to jockey the life & modifier counters in this, which takes up some extra time when you're playing the actual card game.\n\nBut the digital version has a shortcoming in this area; it doesn't mark temporary damage type immunities on the cards. So, for example, you must remember the last damage type you did to Omnitron when it has that Adaptive shield-type thing in play. I played against it with four characters and by the time I came back around on next turn, I had often forgot and ended up wasting an attack of the same type. I'd like to see some graphic indicator, such as a colored version of the min-card symbols, temporarily added while under such effects.\n\nThe indicator thing isn't a total loss. You can actually use a rather extensive "Go Back/Undo" feature that gives you a few options on how far back you want to replay. So if you mess up like this, you can just start your turn over from a few recent save points corresponding to the beginning of a character turn. This should also come in pretty handy when you miss or forget a good synergistic play between a couple characters on the same round, and for those new to the game.\n\nI also wish that we could rt-click on the "mini-cards" to get the full text version to pop up, instead of having to use a double left click. Just personal preference, but the right mouse button isn't in use anyway so it would make sense.\n\nDespite some qualms about the UI, it definitely remains the same SotM card game that gushes theme, has unique character powers/styles, and forces you to make tough strategic decisions. My favorite solitaire card game. I'm happy to finally get it on the PC.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone into sophisticated tabletop games with a lot of theme, or anyone who thinks a superhero themed card game brawl would be fun.  One warning - it can be a difficult struggle to win.  But that's a plus in my opinion.","December 22, 2014","true","24.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

Once it starts getting low, for instance, Bunker's suit starts to smoke and is filled with bullet holes. That's a nice touch over the card game.

Thoroughly enjoyable, really nicely balanced, can't wait to see multiplayer.\n\nNormally when playing these sort of games, I tend to go for a dps-heavy line-up; I've never felt comfortable with support characters or "play this to do this in x turns time" shenannigans. Sentinels of the Multiverse is the only game I've ever played where I've enjoyed experimenting with my hero lineup, to the point where I've been happy abandoning my usual strategy of "whack it until it's dead" with a balanced lineup, or even a buff heavy team.\n\nThe game itself is simple enough: pick a villain, 3-5 heroes and a battlefield(or environment, as the game terms it) and off you go. The game itself is lightweight at first, but has a surprising amount of depth, as various cards played kick in at various points in a character's turn and can have multiple effects. A large amount of time is spent in the hands of the Gods of R, N and G but at no point does it feel cheaty - it's the same odds of pulling a particular card whether it's the real game or the computer variant.\nAnd therein lies the kicker - it feels like a card game. The sound effects are spot on, the turn flows quite quickly, and the graphics - while not up to the high standards of your average internet ♥♥♥♥♥ - hit the spot.

If you get people together at your place, it'll play just like the card game (it's a coop, so you can show your hand to each other), only it'll be tracking all the effects for you!\n\nIt also comes with undo, letting you rewind back several steps.

Next pick a supervillain, each with its own set of rules and a "flipped" state that changes things further.  Finally select an environment that plays by its own rules and may hurt or help both sides, and have at it.\n\nThe magic of Sentinels is that no two encounters will be the same.  Cards may come up at just the right time for your band of heroes to pull together impressive comboes.  Legacy's "Heroic Sacrifice", preventing the damage taken by all other heroes until his next turn, would allow Fanatic, whom most of her abilities include self damage, to go ham for a turn with no drawbacks.  However this luck of the draw can work in favor of the villains, especially when some have special conditions that cause an instant loss for the heroes, such as when Baron Blade exhausts his entire deck.\n\nThink on your toes, prepare for anything that the villain might pull on you, and you are ready to join the ranks of the Sentinels.\n\nAlso to those who might be complaining about not enough [insert aspect here], this was the contents of the starter box for the physical card game and more heroes/villains/environments are on their way.  I eagerly wait the time where I can recreate dealing over 200 damage in a single turn with Unity against Akash'bhuta.

It's a client for a cooperative superhero battle card game that involved a lot of number crunching, so this version simply lets you strategize and listen to that sweet, sweet music. A number of other little touches make the game pretty special, although the interface is a little stiff.\n\nWhile this game does all the complex computations for you, it also requires you to confirm every little choice that requires player input. Those are things you'd normally handwave in the physical game with stuff like 'villain does 4 damage to all heroes, but Hero X played Damage Negating Card Y, your turn Hero Z'. Be prepared for some clicking once a game really heats up.\n\nMultiplayer isn't exactly bursting at the seams - this is very much a game to pick up with a friend or two - but the existing community is actually pretty friendly!

Each of these has its own deck, so there's a strong theme for each. Eg. Ra is a straightforward hero who burns things, gets certain cards into play, then helps everyone burn everything. Legacy mostly buffs other characters, Tempest is good at crowd control, and so on. No character is totally locked into one role, though. The villains and environment play automatically (play top card of deck, follow rules on villain card) and each has its own theme. The villains have two modes with special conditions for flipping, so each battle has distinct phases like Baron Blade giving up on his superweapon to attack you directly. You're racing to get hero cards into play while fighting the villain and his minions and averting some location-based disasters like angry T-rexes or a Martian self-destruct device. So, there's a constant struggle to cope with threats as they arise and there are tough decisions to make about what to focus on. Expect to lose sometimes, especially against the nastier villains and environments. As in the original, there are ratings to warn you about each hero's complexity and each villain's difficulty, though not about the locations. (Try Insula Primalis first.) Difficulty is usually somewhat lower with more heroes.\n\nThe bad: it can be frustrating when certain card orders come out, especially the "lose all your stuff" cards. Some heroes are crippled by effects like that, making them feel useless against those villains. On the other hand, there are some effects so useful they can seem abusive in your favor. (Volcanic Eruption + Flesh of the Sun God = everyone bathes in lava, only bad guys take damage.) Those are just excessive cases in a game where finding powerful combinations is very important and fun; teamwork is key.\n\nAbout this online version: you're getting a straight copy of the card game, with 10 heroes, 4 villains, and 4 environments. Currently $20 will get you all of the expansions through "Cosmos" besides "Vengeance", the "Tactics" spinoff (and maybe unimportant promo cards like the Prime Wardens, I think), though some aren't released yet. The digital format can make it a bit hard to read the cards without clicking on them to magnify, so players unfamiliar with the cards may be annoyed at first. Note also that online multiplayer is still in beta as of this writing (15.8.26) but is easy to opt into. Expect to treat this as a solo game at first, but it's fun even in that solitaire format.","August 26, 2015","true","20.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I playtested the last two expansions for it. I made my own custom heroes and villans for it. So yeah, I love SotM.\n\nThis game provides you with just the base game and no expansions for it. So, it gets a bit bland. The creators of the game (a team of 4, if I can recall) have promised the expansions as DLC.\n\nNow, you must go into this game expecting a card game - nothing more, nothing less. I have bought into the lore and the mythos, and my imagination takes over for the distinct lack of animations, et al. I can see others having trouble with this, and I cannot blame you for it.\n\nThe biggest advantage is that it does away with the "Keeping in mind of all the status effects and how they interact, and bean pushing". It's also much, much faster.\n\nThe flip side is that Sentinels as a card game is a distinctly social experience, especially when you and your friends roleplay the characters, e.g. "I, Bunker, fire my grenade launcher at the unsuspecting group of minions. Pthoom. Pthoom. Pthooom. Shrapnel rips apart Citizen Hammer and Citizen Autumn, while Citizen Spring falls down from the Concussive Blast." (Hammer takes 3 damage, Autumn takes 3, and Spring takes 2).\n\nHere, you just click and things happen. There's also no multiplayer or banter.\nYawn.\n\nThe team's planning a Campaign mode, too : Let's see how that pans out!\nHere's to Sentinels.","December 27, 2014","true","11.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I bought the digital version to play alone, since my board game group only meets once a week, and we don't want to play Sentinels every time.  It's a different kind of experience playing alone, where strategy takes precedence over socialization.\n\nIt's great that all the fluctuating bonuses and immunities get calculated for you, and the rewind feature is nice if you want a "do over" without having to backtrack through everything that just happened.  Expect a game against easy villains to be 30 minutes or less.  Grand Warlord Voss takes about an hour.  So far I've played against every villain with no bugs or glitches (which is quite an accomplishment, given the sheer variety of card interactivity).\n\nSentinels Digital is a really good tactical stretegic solitaire experience.  Much better than say, Elder Sign Omens, which is solitaire Cthulu Yahtzee.  If you are on the fence about buying the tabletop game, this is the best tutorial you can get, for less than half the price.  The artwork is vibrant and colorful, befitting the comic book superhero theme.  Even if it never gets online multiplayer, I will still enjoy this one as a solo challenge.","April 11, 2015","true","16.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's similar to a game like Magic: The Gathering in a way, however, it's also very different. It's not a "CCG" (because it contains expansions with cards, you don't buy "packs" and try to get cards or build decks). This is true in both the card and video game versions. The game is strictly cooperative, 1 to 5 players versus the Villain, the base game (the video game at least) has 4 villains and about 10 heroes. Cards are dealt out, you play various ongoing, one-shot, and other types of cards to get an effect or deal damage to the villain or it's minions or devices, it in turn, tries to kill you all (Grand Lord Voss is a PitA).\n\nWhat really impresses me is how well it plays, both single and multiplayer (multiplayer has some weird hitches and people don't see cards at the same time, depending on how fast they click or have their animation speed set) and you do a lot of "voting" and "suggesting" what the other players do or can do, that's handy for text, but a bit less-so for voice (the game does not support voice natively, you'll need your own client), though I understand why it's set up this way) it's ages beyond how well the various versions of Magic play on Steam (though they're nice, they don't work as well and seamlessly as this game). It's extremely addicting if you love comics, superheroes, cooperative card games, board games, or just doing stuff with your friends, (though it plays perfectly fine solo also).\n\nCheck it out; you'll be glad you did!","March 13","true","71.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thromnambular/recommended/337150/","Thromnambular","Flutterbat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thromnambular/","149 products in account","OverviewSentinels of the Multiverse is a super hero themed single player/cooperative card game that offers a unique twist on the genre by having you manage a team of heroes with unique abilities instead of playing units to fight your opponent. Unlike most card games, all cards are available from the start--you don't have to unlock anything. There is a physical version of the game, and this digital version is perfectly accurate to the physical one.\n\n\nGameplayPeople familiar with card games similar to Magic will find some very basic similarities in this game, but for the most part, Sentinels is fairly unique. Rather than pitting you against another player, you (and up to 4 other people) choose 3 to 5 hero decks and are tasked with playing against a villain deck that runs itself while dealing with the hazards posed by an environment deck. Unlike Magic and its derivatives, instead of fighting with creatures or units, your team of heroes relies entirely on their innate abilities and the various passive, active, and one-shot abilities represented by their cards to defeat their opponents.\n\nSentinels offers a fresh, interesting take on the card game genre and pulls it off very well. Every villain poses a fun, unique challenge and every hero has its own, interesting way of taking on those challenges and synergizing with other heroes. Even the locales in which you play bring their own unique flavor to the game and shake up the way you approach your goal. Sentinels is a lot more about the rules set by each specific villain and location than it is about its basic rules, which means gameplay varies more than in other card games from match to match.\n\nIts cooperative gameplay also sets Sentinels apart from other card games, and makes it one of the few options out there for people who like card games but aren't interested in a competitive experience.\n\nVisualsThough the art on some of the older cards may be a bit simplistic, which actually made me overlook the game at first, the art on newer cards has improved a lot. Overall, Sentinels has a very charming art style appropriate to its comic book theme.\n\n\nReplay ValueWith so many combinations of heroes, villains, and evironments--along with advanced difficulty mode and monthly challenges published by the developers--Sentinels offers a LOT of replayability.\n\n\nConclusionSimply put, Sentinels is a lot of fun to play. For TCG/CCG veterans, it's a unique, refreshing take on a familiar and somewhat stagnant genre; for players new to the genre, it's an accessible card game that's fun and easy to learn yet offers plenty of depth to hold their interest. The art may not be as breathtaking as what you'd find on most popular card games, but this is a book you definitely don't want to judge by its cover.\n\n\nQuick Pros/Cons+Unique, fun gameplay\n+Lots of variety\n+Coop\n+Cheap\n+High replay value\n+Nice soundtrack\n\n-Somewhat lackluster visuals","May 9","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

If you love card games/board games this is a game you should check out. If you love co-operative strategy games, this is a game you should check out. If you love all three this is a game you should get. The entire "plot" of this game is that you or a group of people control super heros by playing cards that corespond to some of their abilities. With your team of super heros you are trying to take down a super villian. In general all the super villians have the same pre-requisit to kill them (get them to 0 hp) however each villian has their own set of fail conditions. But it's usally that all your heros get KO'd. Each hero has their own play style and even some of the varients that just change the main power on the card can affect their play style.\n\nHowever this is a game that I would say needs all the expansions to get a fulfilling experience out of. This isn't a $10 game with expansions it's a (if you get the season pass and i'm sure there is going to be a second season pass as well but for now $30) $30 game that comes in multiple parts.","April 12","true","85.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I have probably spent 2-300 hours playing the physical game, and I am not exaggerating when I say that it is one my favorite tabletop games of all time. AND I've also kickstarted Season 2 of this game, so there you go--I told you, and I'm not hiding anything!\n\n\nNOW THEN! On to the review!\n\nPros:\n+This game automates a lot of the functions that go off in the card game, while also explaining them to you, improving your own experience when it comes to the physical game.\n+Unique artwork that, as far as I can tell, seems to have been done by the artist for the game (cannot confirm, if someone from Handelabra would let me know, that'd be swell! :D)\n+Pleasant music that suits the mood rather well, the vast majority of the time--it helps set the mood with a lot of games, I find.\n+It has online multiplayer!\n+Very few bugs; I can't think of a single one that I've encountered in my 30+ hours with the title.\n\nCons:\n-Very rarely have I seen anyone playing multiplayer on this game\n-Some fights are nearly unwinnable (though, to be fair, that isn't Handelabra's fault, that's more a problem with the design of the card game)\n\n\nWell, that about sums up my feelings on the game. I'll be honest, it's solid, and if you enjoy the card game, you will enjoy this. However, if you've never played the card game before, I'd highly recommend giving this a look if you're curious about digital card games. The price is right, the company that makes the game is friendly and VERY helpful, and the gameplay loop, while simple, is incredibly addictive and creates that "one more turn" mentality that I get from games like Civ, strangely enough, despite this being an entirely different genre!\n\nSo yeah, I cannot praise this game higher. I rate games like this: Buy, wait for sale, or pass, and this game? It gets a 'buy' out of the gate just for being as superb as it is. You wouldn't expect a digital conversion of a card game to have such a nice aesthetic, along with the obvious amount of care and effort that Handelabra has put in on this title. So again, I cannot recommend this game enough.","May 22","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Confused on how Omnitron works in the card game? try it in the computer game!\n\nThough (the computer game) is cool and applies some effort in simple animations, it may not be for everyone. If you are a card-game player, you will like this, and if you haven't, you might pick up the card-game for real... because there is nothing like sitting down with friends and playing for real on the table, with chits, cardboard flags and socializing the game.\nI havent tried multiplayer (just came out today in MP patch) but it will be interesting to try it out.\nI have played with others over one laptop and the big-screen tv.\nNot as fun as the cards, but a lot less mess to clean up after the game.\n\nI recommend this to all card gamers at heart and all owners of the actual card game as well.","October 16, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I absolutely adore the game. It's super quick to learn and every hero and villain plays differently. It's even a ton of fun to play solo- but it takes up so much space!\n\nThis version is pretty much perfect for me. It's the same game.. Same mechanics, same rules, same characters, but takes up a hell of a lot less space and does the calculations for me (which those who've played the card game know there's a lot of calculations).\n\nThe one issue I have is I'm having to rebuy things I already have. I mean, I'll buy all the DLC for it for certain, but I already spent nearly $200 on this game... but I enjoy it enough on the PC to drop the $35 (plus the next sets of DLC, I look forward to Vengeance!) on it.\n\nI also would love to see remote multiplayer.\n\nBut what about someone who's never played the card game? That's the big thing for this.. how is it for someone who doesn't play it already?\n\nWell!\n\nSentinels of the Multiverse, just the base game has a ton of potential options for play with 10 heroes, 4 villains and 4 environments (and so many more to come).\n\nEach hero plays differently, and often not just in terms of "their cards do different things", there are actually different playstyles for each hero. The same goes for the villains and environments. Every set up of heroes, villain and environment you play will play a bit differently.\n\nThe mechanics are simple, which is because this isn not a digital card game but a digital reproduction of a physical card game, so the mechanics are all ones that a human mind can track. This doesn't mean they're weak though, they function very well for the idea of the game.\n\nThe strategies are fairly in depth in how you stack your team, including the order you play them in, and the more you play it the more you'll come to understand which strategies work well against which villains, and which characters go best in the 'first player' position.\n\nThe game plays like a comic book. All it needs is pithy dialogue between the heroes and villains in combat- Though there are little quotes on ever card. If comics books and super heroes are your thing, it's definitely up your alley.\n\nThe super heroes in Sentinels of the Multiverse feel like.. somewhere between knockoffs of and hommages to archetypal heroes such as Batman, Superman, etc. Each one even has a bio, if you feel like getting more immersed in the world. If you played City of Heroes back in the day, you'll find the characters and world have a similar feel. I still think the folks over at >Games played it.\n\nOver all?\n\nIf you've played SotM and want an easier way to play solo: Instabuy.\nIf you've played SotM and don't like it: Pass.\nIf you've never played SotM, and like digital card games: Buy it.","April 15, 2015","true","55.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Absolutely amazing!\n\nI love card strategy games and Sentinels of the Multiverse is no exception. The world of Sentinels that is brought to us through the games wonderfully expresses the creators' love for their favorite comic book settings while at the same time offering interesting characters and stories that are all their own.\n\nThe game holds great depth and variability between the multiple heroes, villains and environments which can comprise a game: each of them is well designed, both mechanically and thematically, to the point where I have a blast playing as any heroes in any environment against any villain. Comboes and synchronicity are everywhere: two heroes you may not like individually may have a combo together that you love, or a villain that you trounced easily in the city might be a completely different challenge when facing her in the ruins of Atlantis. It is an adventure just to explore the full space of possibilities which the game holds.\n\nI'd say the Steam version of the game is well worth it, even if you are planning on acquiring (or already own) the tabletop version: the Steam version lets you get in some intensive play in which you control the entire team of heroes and have the opportunity to experiment with extreme plays and risky, involved combos before suggesting them at the game table. Better to try it out in this setting, where the computer keeps track of all those stacking effects and lets you trace back (in a limited capacity) through a sequence of plays back to a precise phase you want to re-examine or retry.\n\nI was disappointed at first that the Steam version doesn't have multiplayer, but I am sure that it is in our future.\n\nIf you are a fan of card strategy games, cooperative games, superheroes or comic books, you owe it to yourself to give Sentinels of the Multiverse a look!","March 31, 2015","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Otherwise it really helps people who own the actual card game hammer down rules that may have been up to interpretation or were unclear.

Even when Losing, i've found that most of the time, everyone in the group is having a great time.\n\nAlso, if you're new to the game, quite a few people will help you learn how and what you might want to play. Especially with the option to see each other's hands as you're playing the game, it really makes for a great game.\n\nI'm not too sure as to the point of the hidden card option, but i suppose it makes it a little more difficult to play with your allies as they can't see what you have. Although you can still use the chat function it's just a mite bit harder to understand what people have.\n\nReally solid game, if you ever liked the Actual card game, this is a must buy with a season pass.\n\nI think the only gripe i have is the unlocking of the varient cards. With how specific some of the requirements are, you have to get insanely lucky or be excessively deteremined to get it. IIRC, there's an option to type in a code to get them, but you don't get the achievement along with them.\n\nAll in all 9/10 would get crushed by Omnitron again\n\nEdit Edit: Please be aware that this game is based off of the card game, not the board game: Sentinels Tactics","April 25, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the mad scientist trying to smash the moon into the earth to the creepy,  but innocent little girl who can't help that her nightmares become real and attack people, to the drugged-up serial killer who eventually overdoses when the heroes track him down and brawls with them for the remainder of the game, none of them (or at least, very few of them) are just big buckets of hitpoints for the heroes to whittle down.\n\nIt perfectly captures the feel of a comic book crossover, and even features fun variant intro quotes when heroes fight their "nemeses."  And the lore is actually pretty good, if you get into it, though I do wish the game had a bit more of the information availible on online wikis.\n\nAnd, as a video game adaptation, it works very well.  The art and dialogue are all crisp and clean, the card art is usually big enough to read without sacrificing the fun flavor text and art that help bring the title to life, and the controls are generally intuitive and easy to use.  It even offers unique, non-microtransaction-based means of unlocking "variants" for the heroes.  Plus, many people have commented that having a computer to do all the math and run all the mechanics for them allows them to better-understand the paper game!\n\nAlso, the devs support the game fairly frequently, and allow people who don't care about achievements to just unlock the variant cards that are just unfairly difficult to acquire.\n\nI only have three major words of warning, and one criticism, for potential customers to heed.\n\nFirst, the game is rather chopped-up, with a lot of content partitioned off into DLC.  If you're going to buy the title, you might want to wait for a sale on the season pass to get ahold of it.  Second, the game is a fixed-deck experience, not a trading card one.  If you want the same kind of customizability or Skinner-box hits as those kinds of games, this one will not provide.  Third, this is almost-completely an adaptation of the card game, with little attempt made to "video-game" it out with story modes and things.  (Which, though I'd love a story mode, is just as well.  The game is already pretty "narrative" via its mechanics.)\n\nAnd, as a critique, it is, thus far, *incomplete*.  But, since the devs are a smaller team and programming Sky-Scraper, Setback, the alternate fight system from Vengeance would all be difficult, I get why.\n\nThis is a superb adaptation of a superb game, and I cannot recommend it enough.","March 31","true","102.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've logged well over a hundred games of the physical card game and played the Android version of SotM extensively.\n\nSentinels of the Multiverse is all about that final big battle against a super villian. Everything has built up to this. You play with 3-5 heroes, I suggest 4, and go head-to-head against a villian. The gameplay isn't overly complex so it is easy to learn. Villian takes a turn, each of your heroes take a turn then the environment takes a turn. I love the environment as it can really change the experience of a game. Fighting in a big city isn't the same as fighting on an island full of dinosaurs.\n\nThere is a lot of replayability as well. Each time you combine together different heroes, villian and environment you are creating a new experience. Can you beat each villian with every combination of heroes in each environment? You can? Fantastic! Now turn on advanced mode to change all the villian powers.\n\nThis can be a very challenging game and you will lose as often as you win, especially at first. Advanced mode ramps up the challenge significantly. But I rarely find it unfair or frustrating. I've had enough last second wins to know that there is always hope even when things seem impossible.\n\nSentinels of the Multiverse the card game is one of the best super hero themed tabletop games out there. But it is a very fiddly game with a lot of damage and status modifiers to keep track of. First Handelabra gave us the brilliant Sentinels Sidekick to aid tabletop players and now Handelabra has managed to translate that card game flawlessly for Steam.\n\nAnyone who loves card games will love this game. Worth every penny.  And yes you should buy the season pass.","February 15","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even when Losing, i've found that most of the time, everyone in the group is having a great time.\n\nAlso, if you're new to the game, quite a few people will help you learn how and what you might want to play. Especially with the option to see each other's hands as you're playing the game, it really makes for a great game.\n\nI'm not too sure as to the point of the hidden card option, but i suppose it makes it a little more difficult to play with your allies as they can't see what you have. Although you can still use the chat function it's just a mite bit harder to understand what people have.\n\nReally solid game, if you ever liked the Actual card game, this is a must buy with a season pass.\n\nI think the only gripe i have is the unlocking of the varient cards. With how specific some of the requirements are, you have to get insanely lucky or be excessively deteremined to get it. IIRC, there's an option to type in a code to get them, but you don't get the achievement along with them.\n\nAll in all 9/10 would get crushed by Omnitron again\n\nEdit Edit: Please be aware that this game is based off of the card game, not the board game: Sentinels Tactics","April 25, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aawood/recommended/337150/","aawood","Internet Pedant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aawood/","450 products in account","Sentinels of the Multiverse is a fully co-operative card game with a heavy comic book theme. You pick a villain, a group of heroes, and an environment to battle in, and then fight it out. The game plays mechanically simply... each hero gets to play a card, use a power, then draw a card... But there is a lot of depth and complexity here, and you'll need to come up with clever strategies to keep ahead of the game.\n\nVariety and replayability are key here, and that's expressed well in the cards. Picking a character doesn't just change a couple of variables; everyone has their own completely unique deck with their own gimmicks that come in to play. Bunker is a guy in a transforming mech suit, with different modes that improve some of his traits at the cost of others. Tachyon is a speedster who blasts through her deck, being able to launch absurdly powerful attacks the bigger her discard pile is. The Visionary is a precognitive psychic who specialises is controlling the flow of the game over direct damage, and so on. Unlockable variants take this a step further, giving characters alternate base powers that can substantially change how they play.\n\nAs someone who's a big fan of the physical card game, this is my preferred way to play; there can be a lot to keep track of and it's great to have the game do this for you, especially with any special information only a click away. They've also added weekly challenges to take on, Steam achievements, and a lot of other additional elements.\n\nBasically, if you have any love for these types of games, you can't afford to pass Sentinels by. I recommend not just getting this game, but also the DLC season pass; the amount of extra content already out is *absurd*, with new heroes, environments, and villains, and more on the way, and the game gets exponentially better as you can try out new combinations. For the price, the DLC is a steal.\n\nAlso, the music kicks ♥♥♥.","April 17, 2015","true","46.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cutegoblingirl/recommended/337150/","cutegoblingirl","cute goblin girl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cutegoblingirl/","486 products in account","The tabletop version of Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative puzzle/risk-management game in which each player takes the role of a single Hero with a customized deck. The players then work together to cover each others' weaknesses and bring down the Villain. A third type of deck, Environment, defines the place the fight is taking place and adds complications.\n\nIn the video game version, a single player takes control of the entire heroic team, unless you're using online multiplayer. Bizarrely, it's actually easier this way; the single player has more to keep track of, but can manage all the heroes as a unit. It makes it MUCH easier to pull shenanigans, like making sure multiple heroes keep their pieces of a card combo ready for use or having one entire hero present for the sole purpose of dying (poor Tempest ...)\n\nOverall this is a fun card battler, with a lot of potential for growth. It should be noted, though, that it's seriously on the easy side for a cooperative game. While something like five out of six games of Knizia's Lord of the Rings or two out of three games of Elder Sign end in failure, I've only ever lost against Sentinels of the Multiverse when playing carelessly or going for a "stunt" victory for an achievement. Using three-hero teams and avoiding using more than one of the most powerful heroes (Legacy, Tachyon, Visionary) will help to mitigate this.\n\nNote: Yes, this game divides its characters among a LOT of different DLC packs. Note, though, that these just exist to parallel the expansions the base game has received, and $5 for a DLC expansion vs. $30+ for the same expansion in cardboard isn't too bad.","April 24","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the exception of the first three mini-expansions, there is only the base game at the time of writing, but more expansions are supposed to be out soon.\n\nHowever, the PC version of the game does have one major flaw; that being that it's essentially just a direct port of the tablet version of the game- nowhere does it try to update the controls or interface to take advantage of the wider variety of controls you can use on a PC. You use your mouse in place of your finger, and that's about the only real change- a real pity, especially when you consider that they're selling the PC version for 5 USD MORE than the tablet version, so doesn't that warrant some extra development time to take advantage of the extra features a PC can give us?\n\nDespite this, Sentinels is still the same light strategy co-op card game that tabletop fans will expect. Three to five heroes take on a villain deck, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Unlike games such as Magic the Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! where you construct a deck before the game, all the decks in Sentinels of the Multiverse is fixed, allowing each deck to have a different feel and playstyle to better suit the feel of the character. For example, if you're playing as the heroic Legacy, you'll find plenty cards that allow you to support other heroes, increasing their damage output, or even protecting them from damage. If you play as the super speedster Tachyon, you'll constantly be playing multiple cards and building up for a final strike. If you play as the psychic Visionary, you won't be doing much in terms of direct damage, but you'll constantly be manipulating decks, allowing you to pick which cards will be drawn next. And this doesn't just apply to the heroes- the villains and environemnts are equally varied in that each feels significantly different from the others, despite all working under the same rules.\n\nHaving played the game dozens of times in real life, I'm glad to be able to play this on my computer now (shuffling all those decks for a solo game makes setup a bit of a pain), and I'm eager to see the rest of the expansions make it in- I can't wait to play as Omnitron-X and The Scholar, or to battle against Iron Legacy and The Ennead.","March 1, 2015","true","236.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has simple rules and is easy to pickup and play. Each hero has an unique deck and style of play to give them flavor. Heroes fits a variety of themes with a wealth of powers and abilities to cater to many different strategies and styles of play. For Example Legacy excels at buffing team damage, healing, and with the right setup can tank damage for the entire team, Tachyon is a flexible utility character who is all about burning through her deck with rapid card draw and multiple card plays, she gets more powerful as her discard pile grows.\n\nOne of the joys of the game is finding and discovering how powers can interact with other heroes to compliment and feed off of each other and make devastating combinations. Example: Legacy does "Heroic Interception" an "ongoing" type power to make the team immune to damage or "Take Down" an "ongoing" type power to lock the villain deck, then the Visionary uses "Mental Divergence" (Take an ongoing out of the trash and put on top of the deck) to make those Legacy powers a retrievable resource. Ra uses some fire damage to hit Absolute Zero which helps Absolute Zero fuel "Thermal Shockwave" (Fire damage he takes can be converted into a Cold area of effect attack) to wipe the board of minions.\n\nVillains have their own decks full of powerful detriments, damage, and minions to make battles challenging. Villains have a normal mode (or form) but also a mode where they "flip" when they meet a certain condition (think of it as a final "desperation" form) where they will have empowered effects that often raise the stakes and accelerate the battle.\n\nThe Environment is another factor and is like another entity onto itself. The environment has its own complete deck and place in the turn order. Most environment effects are minor detriments or boons for the heroes, but some can be brutal and game ending if you aren't prepared. With clever play you can use the environment to great effect against the villain. For example: In "Insula Primalis" (Think of Xmen's Savage Land) There is a card "Velociraptor Pack" that attacks the target with the lowest HP, So you can weaken enemies for velociraptors to gang up and kill for you. Or at "Wagner Mars Base," there is a card "Oxygen Leak" that causes MASSIVE "Toxic" damage to everything if you don't deal with it for a full turn (effectively venting the atmosphere into the vacuum of space), but if you can find a way to make your team immune to "Toxic" damage you can have "Oxygen Leak" trash the enemy while you remain unscratched.\n\nThe game has a few unlocks which give you alternative versions of her heroes with different innate powers, but the game has no true persistence, The characters have all of their powers and features right from the get go. The replay and variety comes from all of different characters, bosses, and environments playing off of each other in unique ways help keep the game fresh, it is rare to see two battles play out in the same way. Something that was a minor nuisance in the first game can be a devastating game changer in the next game.\n\nMultiplayer is a lot of fun, and chat works great to help communication, but it could still use a few more features: more keyboard shortcuts, tool tips, and some minor improvements like an indicator for lag/sin, a method to view player status, and a way to alert/ping players. Regardless the game itself rises well above any of those minor scruples. The game is just fun, and is enhanced tremendously with more people to share the experience with.\n\nThe game really shines in its wealth of clever hero combinations you discover and ways you manipulate the villain and environment to your own ends.The challenge is figuring out the best way to go about mitigating the damage the boss will continue to throw at you, while managing the growing amount of minions (crowd control), being wary of the environment, and finally actually developing a strategy to wear down the boss so you can defeat them before you become overwhelmed. When you succeed in pulling out a near impossible comeback or clever reversal it's one of the best feelings this game has to offer. However there are plenty of frustrating moments where the environment will completely nullify your team, or the villain will chain together some brutal combo the wipes you out.\n\nThe UI is simple but functional, most things are clear and easy to understand. However having more tool tips on the small versions of the cards, and clearer card labeling could really aid to speed up the game and make gameplay feel smoother. Some key things like if card will attack ALL heroes or just a couple heroes isn't clearly indicated through labeling or tool tips. So often you will find yourself in a situation where a card is forcing you to chose the order of how your heroes recieve damage and you need to go back and re-read the card itself, or click on the "meanwhile" button to get out of the choice window to look at the broader picture and view all of the modifiers before you go back to smart choices with all of the info. This situation comes up A LOT and is my biggest gripe with the game. Sure, eventually you will memorize the card with repeated play, but it would be nice if there was a quick way to glean the info quickly without having to go back and re-read, particularly when you are learning a new villain or environment.\n\nSome other minor things can sometimes be fiddly, like sometimes in the middle of a choice you can't consistently just right click on a card to expand it to full size. So instead you need to click on the "meanwhile" button to go back to the general game view, find the card in question, expand it from there, and then finally go back to the choice screen to make your decision. It would also be nice if you can see a re-creation of the modifiers leading up the choice more visually. For instance if an enemy is immune to a certain damage or will retaliate if you fulfill a certain condition you have to memorize that info or hunt for it since it isn't clearly indicated visually in UI.\n\nThe go back/undo feature is handy to fix blunders and silly mistakes, but it would be nice to have the UI help with a little more information to aid in getting the summary of the info from any said card quickly for faster (but smart) decision-making.\n\nDespite some minor gripes with lack of UI features, the game is faithful to the table top and adds much to the theme and atmosphere. It is great solitaire card combat game, and is great co-op too.\n\nIn Summary:\nPlayers control heroes in a co-operative team to take down the villain or boss in a hostile environment.If you enjoy managing your resources as a group, optimizing an effective strategy, all while improvising through challenges the deck, villain, and environment will throw at you to squash your plans then this game will give you A LOT of bang for your buck.\n\nYou know that feeling in a traditional RPG where you have a party of adventurers and you are against the final dungeon boss and you have to use all of your abilities and resources peal through the defensive layers and overcome the puzzle and tempo of the boss fight to win the battle? Now imagine a game where the whole game is that. RPG boss fight after boss fight. That is what this game is in comic book form!","October 24, 2015","true","152.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Would save the world again.\n\nSentinels of the Multiverse is wonderfully made game that is both challenging and very fun to play. Any fan of card games and superheroes is sure to enjoy this. The advantage of the digital version over the tabletop is the fact that you don't have to keep track of all the damage modifiers -  and it works really well.\n\nIt is also confirmed that they will add in the Expansion Packs in the form of DLC's here on Steam - which as long as they are reasonably priced, will be excellent.\n\nSadly it does have some downsides currently - such as a lack of online multiplayer, and a lack of any sort of story-driven campaign - but I do know thankfully that online multiplayer is going to be added in later this year (2015). Hopefully they will add a story-driven campaign as well at some point.\n\nSo far I give SotM a 7/10. When/if they add in multiplayer/campaign, then this will rise to an 8/10.\n\nSo my advice would be, if you are a fan of card games and/or superheroes - BUY THIS GAME!

Its so boring I once feel asleep waiting for my turn, while i was in voice chat with my friends on top of it.  The game didn't seem to have any bugs of note.\n\nThis seems to be a newer game so if the devs want some specfic feedback on what i'd like to see improved, here it is.  The interface really could use some more animations, that would prolly be the biggest help in just making the game more entertaining.  The second thing would be attempting to speed up players turns/ someone waiting time.  For instance, if an ability hits mulitiple characters, show them all losing health at the same time, instead of one by one.  Instead of listing out and forcing us to watch every moddifier on every single attack, just do the animation of the attack and show the moddifiers.  Make the game about paying attention or not.  Not sluggishly going through every action.  The thrid thing is a minor knit, if trying to get in a game with freinds, its really annoying having to type out the name of the game to get into it, especially with errors in spelling, wrong spacing, while this can be overcome, I wish there was an easiser way.","January 15","false","8.6"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","12","24","3","0"

Its tactical depth slowly reveals itself, which is the mark of a good card/board game. However, with only 4 villains, I found the game got old pretty darn fast. This problem is made worse by the fact that 2 of the 4 villains - Baron Blade and Omnitron - are  pitifully easy (I have never lost to either of them yet) while the other 2 are frustratingly hard and not that much fun to fight because of it (and they work disappointingly similarly to each other to boot!).\n\nNow that I have beaten the 2 hard villains once each, I NEVER want to fight them again. So that's half the enemy content persona non grata already, and the other half making for a somewhat boring game because you know you will win.\n\nIt's a game crying out for expansions, in fact you could say the game is almost DESIGNED to make you want expansions, as the central mechanic is fun and works really well! As I said, the game particularly needs more Villains (more Environments wouldn't hurt either).\n\nEither way, I highly recommend it. 7.5/10\n\nWill add to this when the dlc is available.\n\nEDIT: First mini-pack came out and added a very fun new Hero, a new Evironment and a new mid-range difficulty villain who is fun to fight - just what the game needed. Upping my review score to 8/10.\n\nEDIT #2: The 2 villains I labelled as unfun to fight are indeed hard but I also sucked at the game when I wrote the initial review. I have now soundly beaten those villains a few times and actually find them challenging/fun instead of unfair/unfun. Hence upping the score again to 8.5/10.","January 31, 2015","true","53.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/337150/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Sentinels of the Multiverse is a computer card game. In it, you control a group of heroes, and you combat a villain. The game is represented by cards – each character is a card, with their own power and hit points, and their own unique deck. The game proceeds by having the villain (controlled by an AI) play, then the heroes play, with each hero having their own hand of cards, and then having the environment (again controlled by an AI) play.\n\nThe gameplay is about what you’d expect out of something like this, and all in all, the decks of the various characters are reasonably interesting. The villain throws something at the heroes every turn, be it some sort of attack, a minion, something which blocks their progress, ect. Sometimes, the villain card itself will attack as well on top of whatever the card they drew doing.\n\nLikewise, each of the player characters in their own turn gets to play a card, then use a power, and finally draw a card. This power can either be the power on their card, or a power on a card they played. Some cards give passive bonuses, some are powers which have to be activated during the power turn, and some just are a one-shot ability which does something.\n\nThe environment basically does stuff to help or impair the heroes and villains. Some of the cards are really disadvantageous for the heroes, some hurt the villains, some do very little, some are easily gotten rid of, and some are very deadly.\n\nWhile all of this is reasonable enough, it becomes clear very quickly that the game is short on content. The game comes with ten heroes, four villains, and four environments. Given you can play with up to 5 heroes every round, you’re really looking at only a handful of games before you run out of new content. There is an “advanced” mode for the villains, but it is really ultimately just a minor tweak which ups the villains’ difficulty rather than giving a real burst of new content.\n\nBut there are packs of heroes and villains which can be purchased as DLC…\n\nAnd that’s really what this is – the base game is basically a demo for the “full game”. You can buy the season 1 DLC pack for as much as the base price of the game ($20 right now) which greatly increases the content – overall adding 8 new heroes, 14 new villains, and 8 new environments. The base game experience just isn’t very varied, and you will likely quickly become bored with fighting the villains after one or two times.\n\nThere isn’t really a story or anything else – while there are character background pages, expecting any story beyond that will leave you disappointed. And while there is a new weekly challenge every week, most of them require the DLC, and in any case, they’re just the standard scenarios, just with preset villains and hero sets – and as far as I can tell, none of them really incorporate stories or anything special like that.\n\nReally, then, this isn’t a complete game without the DLC – so expect to spend as much as the base game + the DLC, meaning this is basically a $40 game, not $20. At the sort of price range they’re asking for, I don’t think this game is really worth it – frankly, I got about three hours of vague interest out of it, followed by about five hours of achievement hunting and the realization that I wasn’t really having fun anymore.\n\nOverall, I don’t think that spending the extra money is really going to make it all that much more fun – just increase the amount of time you spend on it being vaguely amused at best. There are just so many more games out there which try so much more to make you happy, I just can’t really say that you’d be justified spending your time on this one. It isn’t awful, and it is an okay-designed card game, but there’s just nothing special about it.","March 12","false","10.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Anyone who finds turn-based strategy games slow would beg for the pace those move at, because this is far, far slower.

And if the tutorial is that rough, I know better than to try to take on the rest of the game, even if I did manage to get past the tutorial battle.\n\nIf you're looking for something difficult to play that wants to to waste far more time than most other types of single player games can manage to waste in the first fight of the game, then look no further!

To that end - this sucks.\n\nI'll break it down with some choice arguments;\n- The game begins with a tutorial that basically plays the game for you for 15 minutes whilst explaining very little in a lot of words.\n- The meat of the gameplay involves playing various combinations of heroes on a choice of stages against a choice of villains with no overarching purpose or story to speak of at all.\n- You cannot customise any of the decks in any way.\n- The interface is clunky to use and confusing to look at.\n- The pace of the game is monumentally slow, particularly if you have to read a lot of card text (which you most definitely will).\n- A lot of the game is locked behind the DLC paywall, which to my mind is priced quite high considering most of it just adds more heroes, villains and stages to choose from and does nothing for the directionless gameplay.\n- As of this writing, there is basically no online community to speak of.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom though, the decks that are in play are quite interesting and each hero has a unique theme, feel and playstyle. The villains do pose quite a threat and the addition of the environment having a deck is interesting, although it often seems to screw you in seemingly unfair ways. I expect these aspects probably make for a great board game, so it's a shame that as a functional video game this is kind of a failure.\n\nOverall? There are a lot of vastly superior options if you want to play a card game. The only reason I can think of to get this is if you really enjoy the board game, but even then - just play the board game. Then you can threaten your friends with physical violence and liven the whole thing up a bit.","March 8","false","3.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Tracking minutiae of when various effects start and end is all taken care of. Given the potentially complex interactions between abilities that is an achievement. It allows players to experiment with the different heroes and try out strategies much more quickly than with a physical set.\n\nHowever, it is better viewed as a sentinels solitaire game or a sentinels puzzle.\nBecause there are no other human players (and hence all cards in all hands are known) there is none of the cooperative aspect from the physical game. Multilayer would have significantly improved matters. The variant unlocks require playing in counter intuitive and sub-optimal ways waiting for combinations of cards to randomly come out of the villain deck in the correct order. This moves in the direction of puzzle rather than trying to win the game itself. But frustratingly, a puzzle with a high degree of randomness in it.\n\nThe other aspect is the user interface. There is a strong case of tablet-itess with this one.\nDragging cards up to play them with the mouse often triggers the "you must be meaning to swipe on your touch screen to scroll through your hand" action. When multiple cards are to be selected (e.g. for discard) they must be chosen one at a time rather than for example, click three and push a "do it" button.  When a card is to be played on a villain card, why can I not drag it to the card I wish to target?\nEvents are not collected together as they perhaps could have been. Cards which have effects like - do one damage then do another one damage - could have been collected together where there is no possibility of other effects interfering between them.\nThere is a lack of animations to help the player understand the context in which actions are occurring. Why did this card just appear in the middle of the screen? Whose deck did it come from? If you are familiar with the game you can probably work this out, but more animation would help? Why was it drawn? Sequences like The Visionary's one player draws a card and plays a card make visual aids to keep track of game state (e.g. whose turn is it really) important.\n\nIn summary: it might be an interesting additional experimental tool for existing players, but it is not a good introduction for new players and not a substitute for the interaction of the physical game.\nNeeded more work on the interface to make a good PC port.","April 2, 2015","false","63.6"," 37 of 78 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","37","78","0","3"

Despite a couple interesting mechanics, there are so many other card-battle games that provide more for the money (MTG, infinity war, hearthstone, scrolls, etc).  Don't pay $15 for it unless you really want an asymetric and/or super-hero themed card-battle game.\n\nPros:\n- The comic/card based combat is a cool idea, and I like the asymetric gameplay.\n- The environment being a force that can help or hurt either side makes you stay on your toes.\n- Simple gameplay, if you have played any card battle game, this will make sense immediately.  If you haven't, you should be able to pick it up in 5-10 min.\n- Some of the villians (Citizen Dawn) are pretty interesting and unique.  Others not so much...and there are only 4.\n\nCons:\n- Very few villians/heros/environments to start with.\n- The hero options you have are mostly pretty derivative (a tank that looks kind of like a tank, a psychic, a theif, an alien version of storm, an angel, etc).\n- Similarly, the art direction is totally servicable but equally forgettable.\n- No customization of any of the decks.  Want to tweak a hero's playstyle?  Too bad.\n- Many of the decks' playstyles are not particularly flexible, you will have the play the character the way it was designed to be played.  Basically, creativity seems to have limited usefulness here.\n- The few heros who are somewhat unique (such as absolute zero) are interesting at first...but once you figure out how they work you realize there isn't that much to them after all.\n- Multiplayer, if you can find a game at all, is pretty lackluster.\n- Again, really only enough content to dip your toes in, this should have been a free demo.  I would not pay any amount of money for this amount of content.\n\nMeh/10","March 6","false","9.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/henrywald/recommended/337150/","henrywald","Henrywald","http://steamcommunity.com/id/henrywald/","200 products in account","Alright, so it's time I wrote an actual review for this game.\n\nHow do I begin? I recieved this game through Humble Bundle and was quite excited to try it. From the first moment opening the game, I am flooded with many bright colors - not a bad thing in its own right. Immediately, it seems as though much of the artwork looks much worse up close than I had imagined. I can overlook artistic simplicity and the most basic of character design if the gameplay makes up for it. After all, nice artwork is really just a bonus in a really solid card game.\n\nSo let's talk about gameplayThe short answer: it's a mess.\nThe long answer: after playing several games, let me say that the gameplay feels whelmingly complicated because you are in control of very little within the game. You will draw a lot of cards, you will discard a lot of cards. The cards you actually manage to play will slowly whittle down the villian's health. As the player, you manage 3-5 heroes that each has their own deck and trash pile, as well as a playing field. There is a predefined turn order starting with the villain, moving to your heroes, and ending with the environment. Your freshly baked cookie cutter heroes have enough variety to their cards at least, just enough to spend a stupid amount of time looking through awfully designed cards.\n\nSo gameplay is rather unbalanced, but these qualities do not make an awful game, just an underdeveloped one.\n\nUnforgivable FlawsThe first unforgivable flaw to this game is the DLC. There is several times the content of the game contained in the DLC. Copying the brilliant concept from the massive game failure Evolve, there will also be multiple DLC season passes. On top of that, the first season pass alone is twice the price of the game. So apparently, it was cheaper to build the entire game engine and starting content than some extra characters and environments.\n\nThe second unforgivable flaw is the UI. Oh god the UI. Someone needs to set these developers down in a room and explain what a readable text and stylized text are because they don't understand what either are. The player is constantly baraged with all sorts of difficult to read text that doesn't look suited to a comic book or easy to understand. The cards are a mess of difficult to read text that I often find myself reading multiple times to figure out what in the world I'm reading. Scaling of cards is another problem. Do to the nature of the text embedded on the cards, scaling them down looks horrendus. The UI also includes an order system that is brought up every time a group takes damage. This is fine when I need to select 2 of however many cards I want to deal damage to, but what about when there is only one, or when the whole group takes damage with no side effects? Cards also fly by giving just enough time to read them that it is frustrating when they suddenly disappear. On top of all this, the abbundance gradients and clashing colors don't exactly make me feel any better.\n\nThe third unforgivable flaw is the completely undelivered aspects of what it promises.\nBeautifully rendered backdrops? Wait, the tiny, jagged, N64 level 3D landscapes? That is not a selling point.\nBrand new artwork for each hero and villain? Well it may be new, but a couple of static images isn't exactly a selling point either. I have also failed to mention how the low quality characters become multiple times worse in the card images.\nThe music leaves much to be desired, but I could overlook it. Though I will not overlook the music in aspect to the DLC. There are currently 4 volumes of soundtracks. Divided into the sets of DLC. Yet another shameful display of money grabbing.\nThe unlockable variants in game through secret challenges are no joke. They are so secret, I can't find them in any menu leaving me only to assume they have arbitrary unlock systems.\nIn SummarySentinels of the Multiverse is a game with some potential. The comic book-esque style it advertised is horribly lacking. The UI is horrendous, the artwork is amatuer, and the music in not any better. If you can get past these flaws, all you have to look forward to is an unbalanced, shallow card game full of cookie cutter characters.","April 11","false","1.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuclearshadow/recommended/337150/","Nuclearshadow","NuclearShadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuclearshadow/","532 products in account","A very limited game perhaps the DLC fixes this but with just the base game it doesn't have much to offer.    The lack of any story doesn't help instead you simply choose the heros you desire,  the villain, and the place.     All the hero's are basically unqiue classes  that following stereotypical abilities and are unorginial  Wraith for example is basically a Batman clone.   The worst part of this is that there is no deck customization the hero you choose will always have the same preditable deck as will the the villians.\n\nThe villains  are limited to a mere 4 and  play differently enough from each other but after defeating all four there is no reason to go back to this game and it doesn't take long to beat them once you understand their deck style and bring the heros that are best suited to counter it.     The enviroment cards are clearly the method to try to mix things up a bit but they too become reptitive  with a very little amount that can occur and most of the time its just a slight annoyance to the player of whatever effect happens.\n\nFor $15 as the base price it's impossible to recommend.  The game feels so unfinished due to the barren content it provides.  The DLC  likely helps this but the DLC itself is more expensive than the base game.  Even worse  "season pass 1" suggests that while more DLC is to come it suggests that not all DLC will be covered by it.    There is no lack of card games these days so I would encourage you to look at alternatives.","March 15","false","4.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Sentinels is NOTHING like Marvel Legendary.\n\nAlthough the tutorials and theme are great, there doesn't seem to be much meat to the game, and I certainly am thinking twice about spending mucho dinero for the expansions just to add some more randomness to solo games.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any leaderboards, saved stats, a card shop, in game currency, or continuity between games. In other words, the replay value is not what I expected. The bosses take a loooong time to beat and it's been a chore. It may simulate the board game perfectly, but I need more.

All the rules are intact and it is easier to play thanks to the computer keeping track of all the cards, abilities, and status changes.  What is lacking, however, is an online cooperative mode that you can play with others.  The fun thing about the card game is interacting with other players to figure out a strategy.  The video game is just starting out so there is plenty of time for improvements and additions to it.  I'd give it a 4/5.

Unfortunately for Ambuscade, Haka wasn't alone, and a fight was soon underway.\n\nAmbuscade begins by pulling a few guns and shooting our intrepid heros. Haka counter's with a (People's) Elbow Smash.

Absolute Zero (Heroic Mr. Freeze) struggles to do anything.\n\n.....\n\nAbout ten turns later, Ambuscade is reeling, slapping a stim pack on and hoping that he can find his cloaking device.

Recently, my brother bought the PC version and we've been playing it often)\n\nSo, if you know the real one and also consider it the best cooperative game ever, you don't need to know anything else - it's the same awesomeness but with everything more automatic...the tokens, the effects, the math...same fun, less work! Honestly, you'll love this version!\n\nNow, if you don't know what Sentinels of the Multiverse is, just imagine that you and your friends are superheroes and you need to group together and fight a supervillain, in a scenario that constantly keeps throwing modifiers.\n\nYou have to act as a team, studying what cards to play, keeping in mind what the other players will do. It really involves a lot of strategy, but the comic book look and supeheroes theme, makes it very fun to play.\n\nAfter two or three games, you can easily understand the game mechanics, and you'll start to notice that some heroes match better with others...or you can just hit randomize and go for it! Like I said above, the computer version makes it easier to keep track of all the stats and modifiers, so the gameplay is much smoother.\n\nThere are different heroes, villains and scenarios, with more to come in future DLCs, but for now there are enough for many hours of fun, alone (but playing at least 3 heroes, to have a chance at winning) or with friends and family, in couch co-op (you only need one game).\n\nI really recommend this game, if you love comic books and cooperative games!\n","February 10, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recently, my brother bought the PC version and we've been playing it often)\n\nSo, if you know the real one and also consider it the best cooperative game ever, you don't need to know anything else - it's the same awesomeness but with everything more automatic...the tokens, the effects, the math...same fun, less work! Honestly, you'll love this version!\n\nNow, if you don't know what Sentinels of the Multiverse is, just imagine that you and your friends are superheroes and you need to group together and fight a supervillain, in a scenario that constantly keeps throwing modifiers.\n\nYou have to act as a team, studying what cards to play, keeping in mind what the other players will do. It really involves a lot of strategy, but the comic book look and supeheroes theme, makes it very fun to play.\n\nAfter two or three games, you can easily understand the game mechanics, and you'll start to notice that some heroes match better with others...or you can just hit randomize and go for it! Like I said above, the computer version makes it easier to keep track of all the stats and modifiers, so the gameplay is much smoother.\n\nThere are different heroes, villains and scenarios, with more to come in future DLCs, but for now there are enough for many hours of fun, alone (but playing at least 3 heroes, to have a chance at winning) or with friends and family, in couch co-op (you only need one game).\n\nI really recommend this game, if you love comic books and cooperative games!\n","February 10, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The style is authentically superhero in nature, feeling like panels lifted from a comic book. I appreciate the page turn wipe mechanic to illustrate the rotation of turns from character to character; though, this effect slows the game down, so I eventually did turn it off. Also, the animations for damage infliction have been improved since launch, which demonstrates the developers dedication to refining and expanding the game, though these quickly become tedious.\n\nThe characters are diverse, as are the cards that you play to simulate their superpowers and manuevers on the battlefield. In general, the cards are well-illustrated and have great flavor text. Combining the abilities of different heroes often results in synergies that mirror a team of superpowered beings working together to defeat one arch-villain, as well as containing that random element that can make CCGs addicting by their ability to reveal combinations and pitfalls over time.\n\nI did find the characters to be wildly out of balance, with some being useful against virtually every foe and in every circumstance. While other characters require very particular draws or circumstances, or the understanding and exploitation of a self-damage mechanic to make them effective. I tended to avoid these, focusing instead on looking at the pool of abilities that the team possessed, which may well have been the focus the developers had in mind.\n\nSimilarly, most of the villains are interesting puzzles to solve that present different challenges depending on your chosen cast of characters and the environment in which you do battle. However, some villains operate under a broad rule-breaking mechanic that renders a particular character almost useless, or they have one particular trick around which you have to orient and time your strategy. I felt those villains had less replay value than the more broadly accessible and understandable villains. Others may appreciate these asymmetric enemies more than I do.\n\nFortunately, the season pass has, thus far, yielded fun additions of heroes, arch-villains and environments. If I had a criticism, I'd like to see more playable hero characters in relation to the number of arch-villains, but the mix might be sweeter to someone else's taste.\n\nThe music is upbeat from the main screen and varies appropriately with the various environments; though, like the comic book page turn wipes, I did eventually turn it off. Much more quickly, I turned off the sound effects: those become repetitive almost immediately (especially the projectile damage sound effect, which gets played frequently).\n\nA major shortfall of the game is the lack of customization of individual hero decks. While variants on the various heroes and villains in the game can be opened up by meeting very specific gameplay requirements, they amount to having a single different core power. Being able to unlock and select different cards in an attempt to kit out a particular hero to face a specific enemy would have added another layer of strategic depth and might have made the more narrow villains more interesting to me.\n\nTaking into account the fast game play, the colorful illustrations, the great writing on the color text and myriad combinations of heroes, arch-villains and environment (with many more coming down the pipe) that play out in many different ways, I can't help but to give this game a total thumbs-up.","July 17, 2015","true","107.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even when it was just single player I've liked how they've adapted Sentinels from the physical card game into the digital card game and its layout they have here.  There is a lot of information you can dig up to know more about all the characters and check out any card that's in the game.  The tutorial that it starts you on is helpful as it guides you by the hand in the first few turns to get a feel for how the game goes before it lets go of your hand to have at it.\n\nSo many heroes, so many synergies...but oh so many nasty villians and environments which can make it interesting and a bit crazy.  The prices here on Steam for the game are a rather good deal when you consider how much the physical boxes plus all the mini packs are.  The promo cards, which are variants of heroes and villians, are unlockables (or with a cheat code of sorts) instead of more DLC which is really nice.  Some of the unlocks are...annoying to say the least.  There's a certain team setup that will basically let you work out all of them in time, but then it's more of a mini game instead of playing the actual game.  Some of the variants are quite worth it though as it changes how they play.\n\nThe multiplayer beta is definately...a beta.  It's still really fun to be actually be able to play this with other people as you actually would.  You can control more than more hero if you want which is good since you need a minimum of 3 to start the game (up to 5).  The voting system is useful to help guide how actions are taken and the ingame chat isn't too bad.  The access of it may be a little clunky, and perhaps unoticeable at first but it's getting better.\n\nDefinitely loving having this game on Steam! :D","August 24, 2015","true","116.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very faithful to the original and really captures the essence and feel of fielding a team of superheroes against a villain (and their minions) in a unique environment. One of reasons that I enjoy the game is that it does a good job of keeping track of all of the on-going abilities, pluses, minuses, impacts and conditions which are easy to forget or overlook when playing the card game. I *believe* that there are a few minor bugs in logic to still hammer out, but for the most part I think that the game is very enjoyable.\n\nThere are also Variants of the heroes and villains, so you have some desire to go back and keep playing in order to unlock another aspect of your favorites. If you prefer Handalabra gives you a code when you click on More Info, so you can simply unlock the varients quickly and easily.\n\nThis is a terrific game to get a quick skirmish in. These battles last 30 minutes or so, so they are not too long. I found the music compelling and sometimes find myself humming the theme. I wish there was a little more variety in the sound effects. All melee attacks sound the same; all projectile attacks sound the same, etc. It would be very cool if Expatriette’s Tactical shotgun sounded differently than Wraith’s Throwing Knives. For better or worse there is no character speech at all in the game.\n\nThe artwork on the cards is good, effective for the style. I enjoy it, although some may find it underwhelming. I also laugh at the subtle humor in their characters.\n\nI find myself really looking forward to the next DLC to add to the list of villains and environments. As of this writing Multiplayers is approaching testing, but I saw people enjoying it at Gen Con.\n\nIf you enjoy Superheroes, or non-stress card games, this game is a sure hit.\n","August 16, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Again, where it isn't totally faithful to the art, it adds more by depicting characters at different amounts of damage.\n\nFor people who own the card game, this will really let you explore the game fully, because the computer takes away all the fiddly counters. Less time spent with setup, and book keeping, means more time spent playing. Due to this, I have gained a better understanding of the game, and enjoy it more.\n\nYou should know this: The various combinations of heroes, environments, and villains can make the game nearly impossible to win, or ridiculously easy to win. Experience with the various decks will eventually guide you to the difficulty that you would like.\n\nOn that note, Sentinels currently provides weekly scenarios for you to beat. It's nothing more than different combinations of decks, but like I said, that's what makes the game challenging.","January 24","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Fourth point, the game clarifies some rules interactions I hadn't thought of, so that's box number four. Not having to do all the number-crunching yourself is a fifth plus. The only downsides to the Steam version are that you can't enjoy holding the cards in your hand, that buying multiple copies for friends after you've bought a single game for yourself doesn't seem to work (the gift button remains grayed out), and that my favourite character hasn't been published yet and doesn't seem to be in the chute for publication either.\n\nOh, and I also like the music.

I've fallen prey to this before with my digital board/card game collection on my phone.  Handelabra however, man, they've done it just perfectly.\n\nThis game was made with constant communication between the digital creators and the original creators, and it reflects so well.  The rules are faithful, and any uncertainties that crop up in the physical game are ironed out here by the original creators (Greater Than Games).  As a result, not only does this play smoothly and faithfully to the game as one would hope for, but it also serves as a definitive FAQ on rules.  Fantastic!\n\nThe concept of the game and the mechanics behind it are incredibly simple; A group of heroes need to take down a villain in an over-the-top comic book boss fight.  That's it.  The rules are equally simple, essentially boiling down to "Do what each step of the cards say, in conjunction with the turn order".  It's simple enough in the physical form, but the digital version handles all that for you and ensure you can literally sit down and play, especially with their short and sweet tutorial that explains the interface and base concepts to achieve this.  In case something works a little differently than you'd anticipated, there's even a rewind button (albeit with a reasonable limit on just how far back you can go), allowing you to reassess what you were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe theme has the potential to be very rich, and this digital format really brings that out, with some music and small graphical displays to highlight this.  I would recommend that those wanting to truly embrace the feel of it to read the flavour text on each card, as it really helps bring it to life with the narrative.\n\nWith the new multiplayer update, the largest feature lacking from the game is now rectified, making this the most faithful and enjoyable digital rendition of a board/card game I've played, a spot previously owned by Talisman, for those not able to play these games in person, or instead preferring to just have a digital game handle the rules and turn orders on their behalf.\n\nThe only other feature I'd like to see is an integrated story mode, as I find this helps to make up for the lack of direct human interaction that these games are supposed to have.  However, the fanbase for this game is creative and always in pursuit of new challenges, meaning that such a thing can be found around the forums without too much difficulty.  These range from general storylines to increasingly more difficult challenge modes, in addition to the integrated achievements the game has for unlocking extra cards (promo cards, minor variants of original hero or villain cards - given out to those who pre-ordered the physical boxes of the game and its expansions, truly minimising content variation between the digital and physical variants of the game).","October 27, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a true adaptation of a well recieved indy card game wherein a team of 3-5 heroes duke it out with one villain in a setting.\n\nThere are plenty of heroes to choose from, 4 villains in the base set (more with expansions) and 4 settings (more with expansions) which makes for a large number of unique combinations and possibilities. Expansions only add to those combinations.\n\nEach hero, villain, and setting has an entirely unique deck that provides them with their own "feel". I won't detail them all here, but there are a number of parallels to popular fictional characters, even so the game keeps its characters very unique.\n\nSettings provide random events that happen every turn, one or two cards in a setting deck may actually help the players, but most of the time the deck provides chaos that must be dealt with during the battle (a volcano errupts, there is a hostage situation, water is flooding the battleground, etc...)\n\nThe original card game was co-op, unfortunately the video game isn't co-op unless you all want to get together and pass a mouse around (I won't judge). This game is a fantastic solitaire game, but it would benefit most from a multiplayer online upgrade. The Steam page says it is local co-op, near as I can tell that means playing on the same PC (it would work well if your PC is hooked up to a TV and could be tonnes of fun with friends).\n\nAnyway, the game is great, pick it up and enjoy it.","July 22, 2015","true","52.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Additionally, the expansions have introduced several new variants. I feel like this is enough to shift my recommendation from no to yes.\n\nI still wish there were achievements, but ultimately the variants and weekly one shot are accomplishing what achievements would have.\n\nIf you've been waiting, go ahead and buy the game. I highly recommend getting the season pass as well.\n\nMy original review is below.\n\n----\n\nI really, really, really like this game, but I'm not recommending it.\n\nI was a fan of the tabletop card game before playing this digital version. This is an incredibly faithful recreation of that experience. The only reason I'm not recommending the game is because of a lack of content and features for the $15.00 price point.\n\nPROS:\n+ Faithful recreation of the tabletop gameplay.\n+ Faithful recreation of the tabletop art.\n+ Hero and Villain variants provide something to work towards, and a variance on standard gameplay.\n+ Amazingly corny music is amazingly appropriate. I catch myself humming it in the shower or while doing dishes.\n+ Trading card support!\n\nCONS:\n+ No achievements.\n+ No campaign or story mode.\n+ No situational challenge mode (i.e. beat this villain at location with these heroes).\n+ Not enough variants to unlock.\n+ Variant unlock requirements are somewhat obscure. You'll probably have to look them up.\n+ Absolute Zero is still Absolute Zero.\n+ Lack of beer and pretzels experience.\n\nBecause of the above, the game is just not something I can recommend to a general audience. This game is only really good for new players to Sentinels who want to practice by themselves, or veterans who want to experiment with different hero combinations before their next board game group gathering. And people who can't ever get a group together to play the tabletop game due to work, school, or other life obligations.\n\nI hope that one day this game is updated with a lot of the missing content. I'll gladly change my recommendation when that day comes.","December 27, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","9"

Maybe it's because I'm terrible when it comes to competitions, but I can entirely get behind a fully cooperative tabletop game, and the variety of heroes, villains, and locales keeps things fresh.  The video game version is entirely faithful to the tabletop version, and while it doesn't have all the expansions yet, it continues to be fresh for me as a solitare or multiplayer game.\n\nIf I had any complaints about the game, it's that the chat function in multiplayer could be a bit better positioned so it doesn't bog down gameplay as much.  It's better off with just using Steam's voice chat, though that's only viable with friends.  Also, maybe adding in some more shortcut options for certain cards like Visionary's "Twist the Ether" card to streamline gameplay would be nice.  It's a necessary evil of the interface, I assume, but it does get annoying having to click or press the same button over and over when it interacts with multi-target abilities; just having an option to apply the same effects to every target would be nice.  (Though since I also own this on my iPad, I should say that the keyboard shortcuts are very welcome.)","January 6","true","55.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I have really enjoyed playing this one!\n\nMy only complaint, if I had to be really nit picky, is that the game allows you to perform actions which that would be useless without warning.  For example, if you have a card that destroys an ongoing and the only ongoing on the board is indestructable, the came still lets you play the card.  It just doesn't do anything.   While I appreciate the merits of letting you make your own mistakes, it would be nice to have an option for a confirmation box in situations like this example.  I feel it would make the game a little more forgiving for players that are not as versed with the cards.\n\nDespite this slight opportunity, I would have to say that this is a well implemented game overall.  Fun to play!  Excellent interface!  Very user friendly!  If you have ever played SotMV, this is a must have!

While it sounded cheesy at first, playing a turn-based cooperative superhero card game turned out to be the best time I ever spent away from studies. It was very easy to pick up the rules, each hero felt different from the rest, there were hilarious homages to real comics spanning numerous companies, and we would find ourselves immersed after hours planning, laughing, dreading, and cheering for the results of a simple card game. We weren't students escaping from engineering studies; we were superheroes fighting for mankind.\nFour years later, the strangers are now great friends, expansion packs have been collected, and we still come together over the internet to save the multiverse every week.","February 15","true","81.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Additionally, the expansions have introduced several new variants. I feel like this is enough to shift my recommendation from no to yes.\n\nI still wish there were achievements, but ultimately the variants and weekly one shot are accomplishing what achievements would have.\n\nIf you've been waiting, go ahead and buy the game. I highly recommend getting the season pass as well.\n\nMy original review is below.\n\n----\n\nI really, really, really like this game, but I'm not recommending it.\n\nI was a fan of the tabletop card game before playing this digital version. This is an incredibly faithful recreation of that experience. The only reason I'm not recommending the game is because of a lack of content and features for the $15.00 price point.\n\nPROS:\n+ Faithful recreation of the tabletop gameplay.\n+ Faithful recreation of the tabletop art.\n+ Hero and Villain variants provide something to work towards, and a variance on standard gameplay.\n+ Amazingly corny music is amazingly appropriate. I catch myself humming it in the shower or while doing dishes.\n+ Trading card support!\n\nCONS:\n+ No achievements.\n+ No campaign or story mode.\n+ No situational challenge mode (i.e. beat this villain at location with these heroes).\n+ Not enough variants to unlock.\n+ Variant unlock requirements are somewhat obscure. You'll probably have to look them up.\n+ Absolute Zero is still Absolute Zero.\n+ Lack of beer and pretzels experience.\n\nBecause of the above, the game is just not something I can recommend to a general audience. This game is only really good for new players to Sentinels who want to practice by themselves, or veterans who want to experiment with different hero combinations before their next board game group gathering. And people who can't ever get a group together to play the tabletop game due to work, school, or other life obligations.\n\nI hope that one day this game is updated with a lot of the missing content. I'll gladly change my recommendation when that day comes.","December 27, 2014","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","9"

I bought it upon release, since an old friend of mine had introduced me to the tabletop version of it, and I was enjoying it. I bought the season passs, but I had one bad game and then set it aside, not playing it for months. Now we're in January 2016 and I've put almost 20 hours into it in the last two weeks.\n\nSo if you buy this and don't get into it right away, step back for a bit (not four months obviously) and then come back to it again. You won't regret it.\n\nBut what *is* this game you might ask? It is a co-operative digital card game, which you can play solo or online as a group of unique superheroes, against any one of a number of unique villians, in various environments. I haven't played online so my review is based on my single player experiences.\n\nThe graphics are limited to drawing of the various heroes and villians, with some slight changes as they take damage and become incapacitated, as well as damage animations. The music however is pretty badass. But what about the gameplay?\n\nThe tutorial is recommended when you start to get the basics down; the villian has a turn where they play cards, and then the heroes go. Each hero can play a card, use a special power, and then draw a card. Certain things may cause you to skip one or more phases, and if you skip the first two on your own you draw two cards. After all the heroes go, the environment you are on has a turn, and this can be good or bad depending on what environment you pick.\n\nThe goal is to defeat the villian, but each one is different, and this is where the meat of the game comes in; the strategy. A fight against the same villian can be different depending on which environment you have; you can also have your team  be anywhere from 3 heroes up to 5, which can cause differences in the battle as well, and each heros deck and powers make them distinct from one another. Also, each villian also has an advanced mode if you're looking for a more sizeable challenge. So the number of various scenarios you can have is very large.\n\nThe game has no story or campaign of the sort at the moment of this writing. They have introduced what is called a 'weekly one shot' where the community gets a specific challenge based on a certain group of heroes versus a certain villian in a certain environment, and then are encouraged to discuss it on the forums. There are also "variants" on the existing cards you can unlock, but the condiitions for doing so are very convoluted in some cases so it is best to refer to the well written community guides to determine how to do so.\n\nOutside of unlocking the variants and the 'one shots' then the game is basically setting up your own matches by yourself and with friends to see how you do. You can let the game randomize a match for you, or set one up yourself. As I said, there are numerous combinations in the base game, but to get the best experience it is recommended you try to get the DLC for the additional heroes and villians to increase the replayability of the game.\n\nIt is expensive, what with the main game at $17 and the Season Pass at $21, but for the fun you will have it is worth it. Absolute 10/10 recommendation.","January 26","true","51.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This version (the base, at least) is almost entirely faitfhful to the original. Where it isn't original, it offers variant versions of certain character decks. The UI is helpful, colorful. and loyal to the original game's art. Again, where it isn't totally faithful to the art, it adds more by depicting characters at different amounts of damage.\n\nFor people who own the card game, this will really let you explore the game fully, because the computer takes away all the fiddly counters. Less time spent with setup, and book keeping, means more time spent playing. Due to this, I have gained a better understanding of the game, and enjoy it more.\n\nYou should know this: The various combinations of heroes, environments, and villains can make the game nearly impossible to win, or ridiculously easy to win. Experience with the various decks will eventually guide you to the difficulty that you would like.\n\nOn that note, Sentinels currently provides weekly scenarios for you to beat.

At the time, I only knew about it as a card game, and it was quite enjoyable. When I found out that there was a video game version of it, I was eagerly excited. When I had the Steam bunks, I eagerly bought it, and whenever a new DLC/expansion came out for it: "Shut up and take my money!"\nI cannot tell you how many hours I've poured into this game, and with the inclusion of interesting and challenging Weekly One-Shots and the inclusion of the achievements, I cannot tell you how much I recommend this game.

Secondly, I love the card game, which I also own, so being able to play more often, and with friends abroad, ticks the second box. Thirdly, the game works well and has a nice, clean style that clings nearly perfectly to the card game (with some eye candy added), which is the third box. Fourth point, the game clarifies some rules interactions I hadn't thought of, so that's box number four. Not having to do all the number-crunching yourself is a fifth plus. The only downsides to the Steam version are that you can't enjoy holding the cards in your hand, that buying multiple copies for friends after you've bought a single game for yourself doesn't seem to work (the gift button remains grayed out), and that my favourite character hasn't been published yet and doesn't seem to be in the chute for publication either.\n\nOh, and I also like the music. I wouldn't say it's anything special, but it's catchy and fits the game very well.","April 7","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly the art doesn't detract a lot from the experience and it is all a certain unified comic book style rather than differing per deck, so it's neat how it all ties together.\n\nIt's a little plodding in pacing sometimes, and some card actions require a bit of streamlining (you to tell the system to go ahead with a default more than not, in my experience), but generally the game is actually really good fun, The team versus villain thing works well, as it makes the game cooperative with friends (so there's no Mario Party situation of everyone falling out), and having the environment as a deck with its own turn makes things interesting to work with, since you have to keep reacting to both the villain and a general hazard in the background.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid aside from the minor hiccups mentioned earlier though - there's decks that work well together such as Visionary and Haka, where Visionary causes Haka to draw loads of cards and Haka consumes them all in his power up moves, and Absolute Zero works beautifully on his own to back up most any roster of teams. Villains will often require you to act a certain way to counter them, or generally favour a certain type of team, but it's pretty fun to learn these and beat them once you've figured out the patterns.\n\nI'd give it a decent 8/10!","May 20","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
