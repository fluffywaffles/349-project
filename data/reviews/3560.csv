The game is fun, as it brings a childhood classic back to life, atleast with a new video card for me to be able to play it in a higher definition and in a much more clear picture. Complicated at the start, but once you get the jist of it, you become wanting to attempt at beating the game, finishing it, and the only way to do that, is to finish the complicatingly hard challenges that they have, and level up to the highest. In a few months of playing, atleast you can screenshot it for how well it is.","January 1, 2014","true","6.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Bejeewled Twist is the only game in the series that breaks some new ground, and it's well worth checking out.\n\nOn an 8x8 grid, you match gems by twisting a group of four, clockwise, so that three or more like-coloured gems line up. Those gems are removed, new gems drop into the grid, you score some points, and that's the basic premise. It doesn't get much simpler- everyone can pick up Bejeweled Twist and play a little.\n\nUnlike classic Bejeweled, the game ensures that at each time, you have at least one possible move on your board. That's a generous gesture if you remember classic Bejeweled where running out of moves was an instant game over. But just because you always CAN make a move doesn't mean each game is endless. Par for the course you fill up a "progress meter" to advance in levels, and as you advance, all sorts of assorted nasty stuff is added. Locks make it impossible to move gems, and as they start to fill your grid your control over the board is heavily impacted. Bomb gems detonate after a couple of turns- you need to match them so they disappear. Should they trigger you get an increasingly smaller chance to still defuse them, but that's mostly based on Lady Luck and we all know you can't trust her. Simply put, the further you get the harder it gets to keep moving on.\n\nA couple of neat mechanics improve your score. Each time you make a match a small counter goes up, eventually increasing a score multiplier. Max it out to 10 and you get a chance to trigger the insanely awesome, over the top Fruit Bonus (dancing fruit gems, anyone?). From Lvl 2 onwards, you get a Bonus Sequence of colours to match, filling up the multipliers a little faster. And just like the classic Bejeweled games you get to make matches of 4, 5 and 6 gems to create flame, lightning and hypergems, all of which are designed to clear up the grid more easily.\n\nIn terms of game modes Twist is a bit sparse. You get the classic mode where you try to surpass your highscore and a danger-free "relaxed game", which is the same without any nasty bomb stuff. There's also a timed mode, challenging you to get a high score in 2 minutes, which tends to run out of challenge quickly: There's only so much you can do with the mechanics and sooner than later you will have "maxed out" your score. A bit more interesting is the challenge mode, where a couple of different tasks in increasingly harder variants are available: This really is an interesting bonus and you may find some rulesheet there that really tickles your fancy.\n\nBut ultimately, the meat of the game is classic mode. Without time limit, with always calculated risk and a wide variety of  valid tactivs this really IS the "Twist" game, and for the moderate price, any fan of Match3 should give it a try.","December 9, 2014","true","20.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And nothing had compared, to the feelings I began to feel when I first played Bejeweled Twist.\n\nI have played games such as Skyrim, Call of Duty Ghosts, Battlefield 4, and they are all ok I guess. But this is the first game I have ever felt romantically involved with. I get home from a late day of work, working minimum wage, with nothing to do except for wallowing in my self pity and hatred. But when I feel sad and like I could die, Bejeweled Twist has always been there for me. Every gem I twist I feel a flame of confidence and happiness build up inside of me. As the multiplier builds up, so does my heart. And every round I pass, I feel like I could dance for hours. The bomb gems make the game scary at points, but it gives us a great life reminder. That although life has happy points, eventually life will run out of chances, and everything will end. Just like Bejeweled Twist when I trigger a bomb gem.\n\nOverall this game is a 10/10, and not just a game, but a best friend. Buy this game today, and if your life is feeling rough, once you start twisting those gems and exploding lightning gems your heart will scream with delight and your body will dance with euphoria.","June 24, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","7","11","3","0"

The "twisting" aspect is interesting, but ultimately leaves me frustrated with the other aspects of the game, like the score multipliers and whatever else, because you lose your multipliers if you don't make matches in one move. Say you're out of moves, and you have to make three moves to make a match. Well, you'll be down from 6x to 4x in a hurry.","October 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Twisting the gems into place instead of just dropping them requires a bit more thinking about placement. Especially when you've got bombs ticking down, and locks that create roadblocks, all while trying to get the combos just right for maximum bonus points.  Also it's really nice to be able to switch between challenge mode and zen mode, so you can play when you want something more intense, and also when you want something to relax to.  I've always liked the Bejeweled games but I've never wanted to actually buy one until this game.  I like the upbeat music.  I'm not a fan of the somewhat creepy booming voice that tells you how well you're doing, but it's in all the Bejeweled games and not specific to this one. People that play the other games probably won't mind it, and it's a tiny complaint compared to how much fun it is to play.","June 23, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each Bejeweled is practically the same and delivers the same amount of fun in each. The goal of the game is to switch around a certain amount of jewels to put together a series of 3 or more in a line to make that line or set disappear. The graphics are perfect for the game. The sounds in the game can feel repetitive at times. The overall gameplay of the game is awesome and really burns some time for when you have time to spare. There are endless stages it feels like. Each level of the bejeweled series has its own tricks and treats for you to enjoy. I highly recommend playing these and getting any of these great Bejeweled games when you have a chance. I love playing them and these are highly recommended for anyone working in the office or at home.
