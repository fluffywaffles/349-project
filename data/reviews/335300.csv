The real reason to upgrade or buy Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is for the drastically improved  core content  and  game flow.  DLC and Scholar Bonus content are worked into the game more naturally.  Many issues the community had with the design have been attempted to be addressed via drastic layout changes.\n\nDetailed Review\n\nThe Controversy\nDark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is a new rendition of Dark Souls II.\n\nThere are three major complaints the community had with this new version that I'd like to address:\n\nThis is just a minor graphical update that the PC could've handled originally (DirectX 11)\n\nThe Dark Souls II community would be split apart on two separate servers.  The old DirectX 9 server and the new DirectX 11 server.\n\nThe 60 FPS durability bug. *Update*\nThe Developers have acknowledged the durability bug and are planning a fix.\n\nSource: http://info.darksouls.jp/other/pc/information_detail/2015-04-16-01.html\nAlthough the existence of this game does split the community, the cost of upgrading for exisiting users is offered at a substantial discount:\n$20 for owners of the previous game who also had the DLC\n$30 for owners of the previous game who do not own the DLC\n\nThe cost to upgrade is pretty small considering the massive amount of time many players spend playing these Souls games (500+ hours isn't too uncommon).  Multiplayer is very active at pretty much all levels of play at this point on the DirectX 11 version.\n\nA comment on the community split\nIf you're having problems with finding multiplayer on the DirectX9 version, I'd definitely recommend considering the upgrade, especially for PC users.  The entire community could arguably reunite and stick with the DirectX11 version.  It's not expensive and the changes have added variety and a much more fair challenge to all of the game's core areas.\n\nIf you're worried about having to make a new character and start from scratch, I guarantee you it won't take as long as you think.  You might even enjoy the fresh new playthrough(s) as much as I have.\n\nA comment on the graphics:\nThe contrast between light and dark has improved.  Torches and spell effects look better.  This is not the reason to get the game though.\n\n\nThe Real Reason to buy or upgrade to Scholar of the First Sin\nMany forum posts I read discussing this game were very focused on the DirectX11 graphics and how this game was just reselling slightly upgraded graphics and nothing else.\n\nThe real reason to pick up this new version is for the massive amount of changes made to the core adventure.  What do I mean?\n\n*Semi-Spoilers*\nThe developers/designers have stepped through every single area in the original game and made massive revisions to:\n\nPlacement, amount and type of enemies.  You'll find new, area appropriate enemies all over the place that weren't originally there before.\n\nSome enemies have been removed or reduced from their original locations entirely.\n\nThere are some new NPCs you can summon to your aid that are running some pretty cool builds.  The placement of some old NPC summon signs have also been adjusted to make those NPCs more useful in their respective areas.\n\nMany Major items and upgrades have been moved around drastically.\n\nBarriers are erected in areas you wouldn't expect.\n\nShortcuts added in other places.\n\nThankfully this version removes the free preorder bonus weapons that are automatically handed out to every character you create (making starting equipment slightly more meaningful).  Don't worry, they can still be purchased for souls at a certain vendor, deeper within the game.\n\nThe DLC areas can't just be immediately accessed for free any more.  You must earn the right to enter each DLC area by finding the appropriate keys in very lore appropriate locations within the game.\n\nMany, Many, new invasions.  Some of which are random.\nThe actual line-by-line changelist for Scholar of the First Sin is so massive that it would take too long for me to list it all here.\n\nJust know that every area that is not part of the DLC has undergone substantial changes.\n\nYou should just experience it for yourself.  Reddit was trying to list all of the changes and the list just runs for pages long.\n\n\nWhat do all these changes mean?\nIf all you wanted out of a Souls game is the story and you've played Dark Souls II already, there's nothing new to see here. (Unless you haven't played the DLC and the Scholar content...)\n\nIf you like Dark Souls for the adventure, the multiplayer and the encounters though, this update is definitely for you.  The revisions made to this game result in an extremely polished gameplay experience.\n\nIt's very obvious that careful thought was put into these revisions to make certain areas more enjoyable to play through.\n\nScholar of the First Sin was more fun to play through than the DirectX 9 version as a result of these content changes.\n\n\nThe DLC: The Lost Crowns + the Scholar of the First Sin Bonus Content\nQuick note on the DLC since there are some people who may have played the main game but not the DLC yet.\n\nThe DLC has excellent level design / bosses and supplements the story very well.  Each area also introduces some really cool and unique equipment that can help spruce up your character's fighting style or utility.  The designers may have very well used what they learned from building the DLC to help make the original game flow better.\n\nUltimately, Scholar of the First Sin does a great job at  naturally  working the DLC and Scholar Bonus content into the game in a way that feels natural.  They don't feel tacked on like in the DirectX9 version.\n\n\n\nWhen you look at this new game as a whole, it offers a gargantuan amount of real estate to explore, co-op and pvp in.  Many of the changes that were made to the game, could only have been made after analyzing the community response to the original version of Dark Souls II and watching how regular users play the game via online streams.\n\nTremendous Value, Highest Recommendation","April 14, 2015","true","149.0"," 765 of 884 people (87%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","87","765","884","39","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nvshadow/recommended/335300/","nvshadow","#NV (B-Day)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nvshadow/","265 products in account","'Are you the next monarch? Or… merely a pawn of fate?‘The Emerald Herald\n__________________________________________\n\nIntroduction\nThe 'Soul' series is known for harsh difficulty and rewarding gameplay in which dying is mostly the players' own fault for making a wrong move at the wrong time.\n\nIn difference to many modern RPGs the lore is kind of hidden as well as it's neither presented in amazing cutscenes nor illuminated from every perspective.\nThe player has to actually read dialogues and item descriptions, revealing piece by piece of the backgrounds and the story.\n\nIn 'Dark Souls II' the main recipe of the series stays the same: A lonesome traveler in a kingdom (haunted by an undead curse) starts a journey full of fighting, exploring and dying. The player will get crushed by hammers and axes, pierced by spears and arrows, cut by daggers and swords, melted by fireballs, cursed by hexes-... there are definitely lots of ways to die and you have to face all of them if you want to survive and see the end of your journey.\n\nThere are many negative aspects that stick to 'Dark Souls II' since its release. Many of them are still somewhat present but with the three DLCs, the 'SOTFS' edition and several patches many aspects have changed. I don't want to make another huge review about the game's content (you could easily fill several pages about lore, characters and stuff), so I'll make it 'short' (well okay - it's still quite long) and focus on some main points that bothered me in many reviews.\n__________________________________________\n\nSome say the game is too easy compared to 'Demon's Souls' or 'Dark Souls'…\nThe changed enemy positions in the 'SOTFS' edition and the great levels of the DLCs shall provide some nice challenging experiences for anybody. From my point of view the difficulty level has the right balance between 'challenging‘ and 'frustrating‘. Sure there are some annoying parts, some ganking and some cheap deaths, but it never feels too easy or so hard that I think I may never be able to do it. Even the 'Fume Knight' and the 'Frigid Outskirts' are manageable. And for players who still think it's a piece of cake: Fortunately there is a convenant for you mad ones that increases the overall difficulty even more.\n__________________________________________\n\nSome say the game is ugly…\nThe 'Soul' series was never known for the best graphics of the generation but all the time the overall picture was great and the 'charming' atmosphere made you forget about some of these muddy textures. 'Dark Souls II: SOTFS' is not breaking with this 'rule' but the improved graphics of the 'SOTFS' edition are definitely a good improvement and especially armors are now very detailled. (However with texture modding and ENB and stuff you were able to get nearly the same results out of the original 'Dark Souls II')\n\nThe varied landscape in combination with huge buildings and massive monuments of the past (and several nice particle effects) really creates some admirable places where you are able to forget the hopelessness of your journey and immerge into Drangleic – at least until an invader stabs you.\n__________________________________________\n\nSome say the game is not worthy of the 'Souls' series as it feels empty and without the special feeling of its precursors...\nThey say it's no real 'Souls' game, just something else. Sure it’s neither Allant nor Gwyn, neither Boletaria nor Lordran. However Drangleic has several memorable moments, names and characters as well. The story and the lore are atmospheric and well done and I get nearly the same feeling as in the other games. Especially the DLC stories and areas are totally brilliant. They could be imagined as different Archstones and small parts of the world that create an exquisite overall picture, be it the Brume Tower or Frozen Eleum Loyce.\n__________________________________________\n\nI'm a huge fan of the 'Souls‘ series and I've spent several hundreds of hours in the different games: I‘ve visited Boletaria and fought with King Allant, walked in the Valley of Defilement and felt like a demon myself after killing Garl Vinland and the Saint Astraea. I’ve travelled through the holy city of Anor Londo, met the former Lord of Sunlight and brought peace to the legendary knight Artorias and the darkness known as Manus in a time and world long forgotten...\n\nThe 'Souls' games were always full of memorable moments and from my point of view 'Dark Souls II' is no exception in this category: On the top of the castle I fought the Mirror Knight under a rainy sky, I’ve challenged the proud samurai Sir Alonne in a duel and travelled to a castle sunken in a sea of fire - At the end I was finally able to meet a king who has lost everything.\nIt was definitely a remarkable journey.\n__________________________________________\n\nCons\nIn comparison to the precursors some decisions and changes aren't entirely positive, like e.g. the high amount of bonfires, the immediate teleportation ability or the simplified upgrade system. Some parts of this old 'gloomy desperation' and helplessness that haunted you in the other games are missing - but there are also positive changes that improve the gaming experience: The 'SL1 invader twinks', the 'Dark Wood Grain Ring' rolling (a.k.a. the Ninja Flip) and the lag-stabbing insanity of 'Dark Souls' are nearly gone, respecing your character is now possible and the sheer amount of different weapons, spells, armors and items (Fashion Souls!) is simply amazing and enables many different builds and styles. In addition some of the items that had to be farmed for long hours in the Original 'Dark Souls II' (e.g. Visible Aurous Set) can now be aquired more easily in chests and treasures.\n\nAnd above all... since 'Dark Souls II' the game finally features beards - praise the sun for this milestone! \[T]/\n__________________________________________\n\nConclusion\nFrom my point of view make the changes of the 'SOTFS'-Edition the games' atmosphere and lore more coherent and provide challenging new fights and changed enemy positions.\nThe DLCs of 'Dark Souls II' are simply amazing and provide exactly what Souls veterans are looking for: fantastic levels with shortcuts and hidden paths, new interesting stories with remarkable characters and challenges from which even the toughest veteran may burst into tears.\n\nStill 'Dark Souls II‘ is not perfect and overall more a Titanite Chunk than a Titanite Slab. However it’s still damn good and keeps me interested even after over 100 hours. It’s probably an 8.5 out of 10 - well at least if your nerves and your will are strong enough.\n\nSo in the end… it is time to meet your fate Bearer of the Curse. Take a last look at the bonfire, your last anchor in this sea of darkness. Pick up your sword and your shield and move on into the unknown. And never forget your Estus flask…\n\n...you’ll need it. Trust me.","November 9, 2015","true","114.6"," 463 of 539 people (86%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","86","463","539","60","16"

Yes, and no. Depends on the person I'm talking to, really. So here's what I think:\n\nYou should get Dark Souls II: SotFS edition if:\n\n* You don't own Dark Souls 2 but think you want to play it.\n* You own Dark Souls 2, but none of the DLCs.\n* You are a huge Souls/DkS 2 fan and want to get every last game and version.\n* You play Dark Souls 2 mainly for the PVP/coop.\n* You're interested in trying the Souls games for the first time, but not quite sure what to pick. You're not willing to spend 5 minutes looking for, and installing a 3rd party patch to make a poor PC-port(Dark Souls 1) tolerable.\n\nYou shouldn't get Dark Souls II: SotFS edition if:\n\n* You have Dark Souls 2 and the DLCs already, and aren't interested in the PVP/COOP aspects too much.\n* You have Dark Souls 2, but don't enjoy it too much because you feel it can't quite fill the boots of Dark Souls 1. This version of Dark Souls 2 will not fix your issues. It will make Dark Souls 2 even more, well, Dark Souls 2.\n* You are new and interested in the Souls games, but not quite sure what to pick. Looking for, and installing a 3rd party patch to make the poor Dark Souls 1 pc-port enjoyable is not a big deal for you.\n\nI own the original Dark Souls 2 + all the DLCs, and have played through them multiple times. I personally think the changes to the graphics and gameplay of vanilla Dark Souls 2 were absolutely not worth the 15€ price I had to pay. To be completely honest and blunt, it pretty much feels like a small scale "enhanced edition" overhaul mod. Skyrim modders have done far more impressive things to that game.\n\nOn one hand it is cool that they changed the enemy and item placements to make a playthrough partly a new and refreshing experience, but on the other hand it's often just the regular enemies of the area multiplied by 2 or 3 to make things more challenging. Unfortunately, many times this also makes progressing through the area much more of a tedious grind. The updated graphics are nice, and the game is very pretty to look at.

Do I agree with such practices? No, I do not. Do I think this should have been free? That's a bit questionable. Why? After seeing the things done with the game, I do think that this needed some effort to be done and effort costs money, the question is, is this tolerable knowing they promised us a game that was going to be supported? Kind of, knowing that it probably took some time to make and I'll say it again, time is money.\nI do think that it should have been even cheaper, probably 10 Euros (I'm from Europe) or so would have been a fair price.\n\nLets look at the facts, this really is a paid "update" more or less, it does include some major changes to the game such as item placement and enemy placement which really do make a big difference compared to the initial experience and some graphical and performance upgrades.\n\nIs it worth paying 15 Euros if you already beat the game or own the game, in my opinion yes, it does look better and does run better, the item and enemy repositioning makes the game feel fresh and an overall better experience. Don't forget that this probably wouldn't have even existed if it wasn't paid, because the people in From Soft need to eat as well. I hope that this review won't spawn hate, but objective and rational opinions based on what you read.\n\nIn short, I do not like the way they did it, but I do realize it probably wouldn't have been done for free. Is it worth it, I would say yes. Please stop giving this bad reviews because of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you are, they did a good job with this "Special Edition" and it costs as much as a DLC pack would cost for any other game. I do see why people might be or are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of at From's marketing, but try understanding that we might have not even gotten this updated version if we didn't pay for it. People spend like 5-10 Euros for a dlc pack that contains a few weapons and a few virtual hats or masks and yet there is no one complaining about that and you people complain for paying 15 Euros for a remastered version of a game that launched one year ago.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope you re-consider about buying this.","April 2, 2015","true","91.2"," 686 of 933 people (74%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","74","686","933","27","28"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/335300/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is such an insanely rich and expansive game; FromSoft could have released two separate games. Which is kind of what they did.\n\nBack when Dark Souls II was first released people considered it a hollow and bleak follow up to the original Dark Souls, me included. However it wasn’t without its high points and strengths. FromSoft took much criticism to heart and released three DLC packs with an incredible amount of content in each to offset some of the lacklustre areas from the main game, as well adding several elements that pad up the lacking story somewhat. They wrapped it all up in a new graphics package, slapped a full price tag on it and flung it back onto the selves. A gutsy strategy, but the game is better for it. The game is an immersive role-playing monster that keeps sucking you in. Furthermore, it has an insane amount of options and content to explore and exploit. Finally, it retools and refines many of its predecessor’s aspects. Dark Souls II is a behemoth of a game that merits any self-respecting gamer’s attention.\n\nDark Souls II picks up thousands of years after the original Dark Souls and continuously throws you down a well of unyielding challenges and adversity with the express purpose of hardening you for the next battle. The original world of Dark Souls is gone and in its place is a dilapidated, nearly abandoned kingdom called Drangleic. You are an undead, who ventures to this land to find a cure for your, and your family’s hollowing condition. The game sets of off with the bare minimum, as is a staple of the FromSoft narrative style. You’re forced to discover the bulk of the story for yourself. This is where the developers went overboard. Instead of hiding plot and infusing it with delicious lore, they now provide you with the bare minimum of plot and nearly drown you in lore. Admittedly, the lore of Dark Souls II is incredible and novels could be written on its depth and enriching character. However, the lack of apparent plot rather withholds you from thoroughly exploring it. You, as the player, are not motivated to investigate items, characters, or world as explore. The only thing you’re told a few minutes in is to “seek the king”. When you eventually do find the man in question he’ll tell you to seek adversity. Finally facing the final boss is punctuated with a resounding “what the hell was that?”\nThe thing is, that when you finally discard the narrative’s notions, and do explore on your own accord, you’ll be rewarded immensely. It seems almost as if FromSoft did not just want to make the gameplay difficult, but also the story. The Scholar of the First Sin edition provides some context to the ordeal, but you’re mostly left to your own devices in terms of plot direction and interpretation.\nWhile the story may not be too captivating, the general gameplay is thoroughly addictive. It is common knowledge at this point that the Souls series are difficult. The difficulty spike from other games requires you to learn and to invest effort. The eventual successes after many a loss will feel monumental. This risk reward structure is enthralling to say the least. Not only do you earn valuable progress, but also experience and valuable items to customise your character and playstyle.\n\nDark Souls II is a genuinely personal experience, and the game offers you near countless tools to differentiate and customise your experience. While the game does force you to picks a class at the very beginning, you easily deviate from your initial resume. From the starting area the world lies open at your feet. Hundreds of weapons to try. Dozens of armours to wear. Loads of magic spells to learn. Zounds of monsters to slay. The game lends itself to all manners of play. You can play a buffed out tank and brave hordes in plate mail. Or stay lithe and swift and put out ludicrous amounts of damage. Physical matter not your thing? The try the magic arsenal. We have lighting, darkness, fire, and poison; even this blue stuff that just kills things. You can have it any way you want, and hardly any play through will be the same. There are even special weapons that combine the styles. The insane degree to which you can adjust, mix and match makes for some incredible fidelity. It is therefore good that the game also has a respec button to mulligan your build when you see fit.\nHowever, it is important that your stomping grounds for your personal build is well tilled, and unfortunately, that is not always the case in Dark Souls II. While character tools are amazing, the level design is somewhat lacking. Rather washed-out areas and straight corridor stages make up the majority of world. A true shame, because the original Dark Souls and its predecessor Demons’ Souls all had environments that were maze like and harrowing to traverse. Making it to the short cut in the old games was a relief. In Dark Souls II it’s just a convenience. This issue is mostly resolved in the three DLC areas that send you into completely disorienting maze like tombs, towers and cities to fight even deadlier enemies, but also find even more and better loot.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Dark Souls II addresses many complaints from its predecessors, but also introduces some new, and unwelcome changes. Praise be to the sun when the backstab got nerfed. Praise be to Vendrick when the online connection now takes place via dedicated servers instead of P2P. Hail to the crowns for the new dual wield animations that allow for the amazing samurai, ninja and berserker builds that flay and destroy the many bosses. Dark Souls II has taken care to make good on several sigmatic issues with the original, and FromSoft has succeeded in most cases. The result is a more playable and durable system that is more manageable to use.\nOn the flipside though, the game introduces a stat called soul memory to govern the interaction between players. It basically changes the thresholds for cooperation and invasions from level based to purely experience based. This skews to balance to nearly ridiculous levels where proper online play becomes extremely hard or downright non-existent until you manage to reach a later section of the game where you may or may not fit in. Furthermore, boss design, the Souls’ series great pride, has taken a hit. Most bosses are souped up guys in armour with broken tracking and disjointed hitboxes. The number of monstrosities that do show up are hardly a challenge. Some fights against these blood knights are extremely amazing, but the majority is forgettable. Once again, the DLC bosses fix this issue to a great extent.\nIn general, enemy design is based on “guys in armour.” What is even worse is that FromSoft decided to just go for the horde approach when it came to enemy placement and difficulty tweaks. When you die it’s either due to a horde of cheap, enemies, or one enemy with infallible tracking on its weapon. The Scholar version addresses this with amended enemy placement, but the damage is already done.\n\nDespite some shortcomings, the overwhelming amount of content, immersion and options ultimately make Dark Souls II a main course on any video game dinner menu. The meaty length and beefy options allow for a multitude of approaches that can fit anyone’s playstyle. While the story doesn’t flavour the dish too much, the underlying textures provide a distinct taste that will have to dig in a little deeper. Although the chef’s final changes may divide the guests on what wine goes best with it, at the end of it, you’ll be satisfied and well fed.","September 28, 2015","true","41.7"," 105 of 118 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","105","118","10","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leshoyadut/recommended/335300/","leshoyadut","Лешоядът","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leshoyadut/","109 products in account","To start this off, Dark Souls 2 is not Dark Souls 1. It wasn't trying to be, and it never will be. Nor, in my opinion, should it have tried. There are some things I dislike about Dark Souls 2, but on the whole it's an excellent game.\n\nI will lead with the things I dislike:\n-Invasion mechanics in DaS2 are dumb. Basically, it's either horribly unfair to the invader (because it can be incredibly easy for the invadee to summon 2-3 helpers) or horribly unfair to the invadee (related to my other problems), with very little room in between for good invasions outside of fight clubs.\n-Soul memory is dumb. I like the idea of trying to prevent twinking, but the way they did it is terrible. SM is the total number of souls you have ever collected, and this includes the souls you have lost in blood stains you have failed to reach. With multiplayer matchmaking based on this, it's extremely punishing to new/inexperienced/bad players, because the more souls they lose, the less their SM reflects their "skill" at the game.\n-I strongly dislike the hollowing mechanic in DaS2. Losing max health when you die is, in my opinion, just bad gameplay. It makes it so that instead of needing to improve (or git gud, as the saying goes) to progress, you have to improve just to reach the same spot you were at before. On top of that, it just makes the game easier for people who don't die much. Both of these points feel counter to the philosophy of Dark Souls as it is, but to make it worse, you can now get invaded while hollow. It's a bit easier to go human for when this does happen (you don't have to rest at a bonfire), but it's still pretty stupid for someone to have to do that just to fight on even footing with the invader (and I say this as a red phantom).\n-Some enemy placement, especially in Iron Keep and Shrine of Amana, is bad and the designer should feel bad. Don't get discouraged by these zones (or any zone, really; these two just felt like their difficulty was gimmicky). You will likely hate them and yourself by the end of each.\n-Reusing bosses. This was something that bugged me a bit in Dark Souls 1, too, so I don't count it as a strong negative, just something that From tends to do that I dislike. Not a big deal in the end, though, especially since they have done it less than in DaS1.\n\nWoof. That ended up being a bit longer than I intended, and it may paint a bad picture for the game, but I assure you the rest more than makes up for it. Speaking of, now we get to the good parts:\n-Generally smoother gameplay than DaS1. A lot of people have complained that the controls feel looser or slower than DaS1, and I would have originally agreed. However, having gotten used to the changes, I find the combat to generally work better.\n-Overall, a much better port than DaS1, and it has 60 fps. Not a huge count in its favor, but the game is definitely prettier and runs better.\n-The world is huge. Yes, this was the case in DaS1, and no the world of DaS2 is not as interwoven. But I'm okay with that. The levels are large and sprawling, giving me a great sense of progress with just how far I've run since the last time I was in Majula.\n-The lore is, in my opinion, just as good as DaS1's was, but with a different feel. Don't go in expecting DaS1 lore; while definitely a sequel, DaS2 is still its own game. In a way, I actually enjoy its lore more. You get to know the big players in DaS2 in a way that you never did in DaS1, and you learn the progression of Drangleic better than you did Lordran. You still have to piece it all together, you still have to talk to all of the NPCs, and you still have to read item descriptions.\n-Magic is, in my opinion, much improved in DaS2. I didn't mess with it much in DaS1, though, so take my word with a grain of salt here. Regardless, the different styles of magic feel unique and distinct from each other, and the way magic scales is nice.\n-Weapons in PvP have wonderful variety, though a bit less in PvE. Due to the changes in scaling, Dex weapons tend to be inferior to Str weapons in PvE, but both are quite solid in PvP. For PvP, it truly depends on your favorite playstyle, whether you want to be light and fast, or heavy and strong. For PvE, bleed and poison (which scale off of Dex in DaS2) are nigh useless (they either applies too late to be useful, or the enemy is immune anyways), which takes away one of Dex's biggest benefits and makes it feel lackluster compared to Str. Other than that, both styles are enjoyable and viable.\n-Enemy/boss variety is great. A lot of people complain that the bosses in DaS2 were boring compared to DaS1; however, I think there are a couple of factors here that play into this. First and foremost is that these people were already quite experienced with DaS play from their time in the first game, so they are going to have a much easier time with DaS2 on their first run than they did with DaS1 on their first run. Secondly, there are simply a LOT more bosses in DaS2, which can make some of the ones that you had an easy time with less memorable. I personally feel like the bosses are thematically excellent, both in terms of boss arena, aesthetic, and attacks, especially in the last half of the game (including the DLCs, though they have their crappy fights, too).\n\nOn the whole, I tend to agree with the general sentiment that DaS1 is better for PvE and DaS2 is better for PvP. That being said, I also find DaS2 to just feel more replayable than DaS1 was. There is a lot more to the game in DaS2. Both are excellent games, however, and I don't think DaS1's greatness subtracts anything from DaS2's greatness, or vice versa. So if you like the dark fantasy genre, and are looking for a challenging game to pick up, I cannot recommend DaS2 enough. As with the first, prepare to die -- a lot. But pick yourself up, and don't you dare go hollow.","November 18, 2015","true","230.8"," 125 of 149 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","125","149","9","10"

You will die and lose anyway doesn't matter how powerfull and pro you think you are. If you don't believe me, then go and try PvP.\n\nNow I will try to sum up by making list of some cons and pros.\n\nPros:\n- even when you beat all bosses and watch credits you can still play this game,\n- many, many different armors and weapons which can be upgraded, everyoneone will find weapon he enjoy (in, let's call it 'late game' of course),\n- bosses looks very effective and they are real challenge like they should be even if you summon other players for help,\n- covenants makes game more interesting (especially Company of Champions),\n- rumors say that maximum level is 838,\n- it is quite long and for me it wasn't boring,\n- varied locations,\n- VERY GOOD DLC'S,\n- sound is awesome, especially in boss fights,\n- more than 3 classes to chose at the beginning,\n- a lot of treasures and secret locations to find,\n- sometimes makes you satisfied,\n- video isn't perfect but it's good,\n- learns how to deal with loss.\n\nCons:\n- magic makes game easier, it's too powerfull,\n- there are still Xbox prompts,\n- sometimes playing this game is just waste of time (trying kill boss 2 hours and fail),\n- AI sometimes decide to commit suicide,\n- MESSAGES  2 centimeters from Illusory Walls so you can't 'open' them,\n- you can be invaded by more than one player when you are going to finish stage which you try do from hours,\n- cheaters,\n- sometimes PvP is not possible because of servers,\n- MATCHMAKING by Soul Memory and not by level (for some it may be good thing, but in my opinion that was a bad idea).\n\nI recommend that game to everyone who have time and who is looking for challenges.

Escher painting, but each location individually looks good. The weapons and armor are extremely numerous and varied. There is an insane amount of magic spells in the game as well. The online connectivity is far more reliable than the first game.\n\nThere are a few technical changes from dark souls 1 that you might not like if you're really attached to the first game. Estus drinking is slower, stamina regenerates slower, the stats are different and backstabs/ripostes are not instant. The graphics are improved though slightly different style than the first game. 60 fps, which makes the game feel a lot more responsive.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the new stat adaptability, you need to level it to increase the invincibility length on your rolls or else you won't be able to dodge very effectively.\n\nBasically it's a change from the first game, and whether you like the new stats or not, the fact is this game offers way more content, customization and technical improvements across the board compared to the first.","April 22","true","263.2"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","69","78","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaduly/recommended/335300/","shaduly","Kaelyn Tristram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaduly/","94 products in account","I've been bored for quite awhile.\nMost of the games I have, I either had played out several times already, or wasn't interested in.\nBought plenty o' mediocre games which I regretted after the first few hours of gameplay.\nHonestly, for some time I thought if most devs were even trying at all anymore.\nUnfinished products being sold on steam which never get finished. Empty promises, poor design, etc.\n\nThen I stumbled across this spiked, polished gem.\nI had heard alot about the Dark Souls franchise but never really gave it a go, so when Steam held a sale and Dark Souls was in it I figured why not.\n\nIt's been ATLEAST 4 years since I've been this excited about a game and dragged along into it's lore.\nThe sheer detail of the story Dark Souls offers aside from the marvelous combat is amazing, if you're willing to venture out and catch up on it that is.\nIf the lore does not interest you, then that doesn't matter because Dark Souls 2 doesn't neccesarily need you to know it's story, though it's handy to listen even if you're not interested. NPC's can sometimes give hints or help out if you get stuck and don't know what to do.\n\nThe good:\n\n- Though I have not played Dark Souls 1, I had no problem with following the story. Dark Souls 2 continues a thousand years after Dark Souls 1.\n\nOnce you begin digging, all sorts of questions pop up about the true nature of the world around you.\n\n\n- The combat is so mind-boggling that it took me several hours to grasp it's design.\nInstead of most RPG's where you don't really care about your stamina untill it's so low you should already be worrying, Dark Souls takes it a different swing. Easily switch from 1H to 2H which have their own benifits and bad perks.\nAlot of weapons also have different movesets so almost every weapon you find is an entirely new way of handling combat.\n\n- PvE is purely focused on rational thinking, timing and remembering the patterns and movesets of your enemy. Be it a minion, or boss. So don't expect to win by continously spamming R1.\n\n\n- PvP ( my personal favorite. ) is where it gets interesting. There are many ways of PvP in Dark Souls, and many of them reward you with items ( and souls ) if you win the battle.\nIn a sense, PvP is has the same "rules" applied to it as PvE but with a twist.\nTo me, PvP is a gigantic mindgame. There are tons of people who simply spam an overpowered (ultra)greatsword, or stabbing weapon they have upgraded to the max, but by no means is the only way PvP goes down.\n\nThanks to the wide array of different movesets you always have to be on your guard, if you cannot figure out your opponents moveset you will have to figure him/her out inside of battle, which requires a calm mind to assess the situation and figure out a plan to defeat your opponent.\nI love figuring out my enemy. The moment is tense. Your focus is at maximum. One wrong misstep, and you most likely will lose the fight.\n\n\n- Scenery/world: I've read so much comments about people complaining about Dark Soul's visual quality, and I can't say I agree. Sure, it's not next-gen graphics with everything cranked up to the maximum, but I feel like Dark Souls wouldn't be such a gem without the gritty, near realistic medieval art style.\nAt points, the view can be astounding and more than once took my breath away.\n\n\n- The challenge. It's what makes you come back to play again. It's what makes you feel unimaginable joy when you finally kill that one boss you couldn't kill before. It's what makes this game to not be plain boring.\nDark Souls does not hold your hand, and that's where it stands out.\nIn my opinion Dark Souls has gone back to the roots of gaming. Where you have to immerse yourself in the game and learn it's mechanics to survive instead of getting carried on hands with adjustable difficulty's where you can set it so low, the NPC's are dumbed down to a point it's not even satisfying to kill them.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n\n- Hitboxes are at points non-existent in Dark Souls. Where you get hit even if you dodge, or are several feet away from the weapon that isn't supposed to strike you.\n\n\n- Alot of times invaders will be much stronger than you and will have ultra greatswords that kill you in 2 hits, or rapiers/spear to spam R1 on you.\nDon't worry, as this is not the only way PvP goes down, and in time you'll learn how to defend against these weapons.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDark Souls is NOT something you should buy if:\n\n- You have a life.\n\n- You cannot handle death, frustration, or unfairness.\n\n- You don't want to be sucked in Dark Soul's world.\n\n- You can't look past small glitches, cheesy hits or hitboxes that should be there.\n\n- You dislike getting punished for your own mistakes.","December 8, 2015","true","92.9"," 74 of 87 people (85%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","85","74","87","18","0"

I also, however, wanted more, so I decided to wait until the inevitable full-package of the second game. Fast forward quite a while, and I'm playing Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin. I haven't completed the game yet (I will, of course, though), but I have been so frustrated by the combination of a number of problems (some larger than others) that I have been urging myself to write a review for this game. It was one specific area from one of the DLC sections that pushed me over the edge (I won't detail anything too much as I don't want to spoil the game for anyone wishing to play it).\n\nMy first complaint with the game is the clear design decision for the team to focus on making the game difficult. While Dark Souls was extremely well designed in most respects, with mostly balanced enemies and the only difficulty stemming from the player's faults, the second game has enemies and areas specifically designed to frustrate and kill you. Bandai Namco clearly wanted to play on the popularity of Dark Souls as a 'difficult' game, with the marketing and even the intro of the game being focused on how much you're going to die, and the team at From Software working on this game clearly misunderstood the principles of its predecessors. While the game plays best with enemies being encountered sequentially (due to the nature of the game's combat), Dark Souls II seems all too keen to throw hand-fulls of enemies into your path for seemingly no reason. While a single enemy (or two at most) would usually be fine to tackle due to its moveset being based on the requirement to dodge its attacks, it's common in Dark Souls II to find four or five moderately-difficult enemies running at you, obviously promoting the 'lame it out' tactic or a slug fest. This is only emphasised by the game's focus on bosses having additional summons - they don't make the bosses any more interesting, just less fair and more frustrating. Yes, Dark Souls did have multiple simultaneous enemies at various points, but they'd usually be balanced by having low health, low damage outputs or predictable movesets, making the encounters much more fair and fun than the frustrating encounters of Dark Souls II. Not only are encounters frustrating when they involve a needless plethora of enemies, but one-on-one encounters have been ruined by every enemy's tendency to automatically track the position of the player at all times. While an enemy is charging up an overhead attack or sprinting towards you, they'll usually slide idiotically across the ground so that their move is guaranteed to connect with you. This becomes ridiculous when the hit-boxes of several moves are much wider than the moves themselves, probably due to clumsy implementation. I should also point out that a lot of enemies have too many defensive options, to the point at which the only option for a slow-attacking character is to wait for an opening, put in a single hit, then wait again. This is because many enemies have a frustrating combination of having wide swings, fast movement, no wake-up or cool-down time or extremely high poise. Pair this with the frustrating auto-tracking, and the game is practically telling you to 'lame it out'. The difficulty with a lot of the bosses isn't the boss itself, but the urge to get an extra hit in that will result in just getting hit. In some cases, if you do get that extra hit in but need to roll away immediately, what would have been a successful roll in the previous game becomes useless, as the enemy will just change their attack direction to face your new position, or even catch the air around you and cause damage without actually hitting you.\n\nThis brings me onto my next point - a number of the game's mechanics have been completely screwed-up for absolutely no reason. My earlier point about attempts to roll away from an enemy's attack being almost futile is only enforced by how much the invincibility frames of rolling have been ruined. I found the old rolling and Equip Load system of the first game to be fine, so I am baffled that they managed to ruin rolling so much with their new Agility-skill-based system. Now, what would have been a safe roll in Dark Souls results in getting hit anyway in Dark Souls II. There are far less invincibility frames than before, so the unreliability only makes the game more frustrating. If I successfully dodge an attack in a game, I would usually be rewarded by not taking any damage, rather than just getting hit anyway. Then, the new backstab system feels very clumsily implemented - when I am trying to swing my sword a few feet behind someone, the game will instead make the character attempt a backstab (and, obviously, fail due to the distance). This wasn't the case in the last game, as the backstabbing animation would only trigger upon a successful backstab. When I'm fighting enemies, I shouldn't be in a position where I am fighting the controls as well. Then, there's the point of the healing system. The Estus Flask system of Dark Souls was absolutely fine - players had a reasonable number of consumable health potions, called Estus, that could be refilled at bonfires (which were usually very distant from each other), but had to maintain a good amount of Estus Flasks for use in boss fights as well, which were usually quite a way away from the last bonfire. Now, the player can just buy an infinite amount of additional health items called Lifegems, which heal slower and less than Estus Flasks, but can be carried in an enormous max. quantity of 99 at a time. When paired with an increase in the amount of bonfires to refill the Estus Flask, the availability of health items is no longer a problem. I am seriously confused as to why the developers felt like the system needed changing, as it worked extremely well in the last game.\n\nFinally, I have a massive problem with the general laziness of the game's design. In the last game, areas were large and complex, with single bonfires to cover most areas, many directions to go in and a large focus on opening shortcuts to make the path from the bonfire to the boss easier. It is also very important to note that the world of Lordran in Dark Souls was interconnected, with a main hub called the Firelink Shrine and routes back to the shrine being opened up from the areas that the player visits. The world of Drangleic in Dark Souls II, on the other hand, consists of a series of corridors in comparison. The game's attempt at a hub area, called Majula, branches off to a few other locations, but only really acts as a headquarters of sorts for the player, rather than a meeting point to loop back to. Areas usually end in dead-ends, and rather than looping the areas around in a clever way the developers made it so that the player can teleport between any bonfires from the offset, of which there are far too many (some areas have five or six bonfires, which is ridiculous). So, the reward for defeating a large boss is often the option to just teleport back to Majula, rather than explore a new area. Not only is the world completely disjointed, but it doesn't even make sense at times. I won't spoil any locations, but the impossible space in a few of the areas is so dumb that the realisation of how stupid it really is breaks any sense of immersion. This is the same for a couple of progression blockers, but I won't go into detail. Not only are the areas lazily designed, but the enemies are too - most enemies are humanoid, even if it would make for sense for them not to be, and too many (including bosses) are simply large humanoids with big weapons and similar movesets. Rather than mixing up the boss designs, they are often just given additional enemies to spice up the fight, usually resulting in more frustrating bosses that, again, promote 'laming it out' tactics. I've run out of characters.","May 17, 2015","false","117.4"," 837 of 1,246 people (67%) found this review helpful 94 people found this review funny","67","837","1","94","160"

(don't take my 'played' time as a given on Steam).\n\nLet's get the bad stuff out of the way first, and maybe add a sprinkling of good stuff too, just for balance.\n\nMost, if not all of the bugs and glitches from the original are still here, including the 2x durability loss bug that occurs at 60fps.\n\nMy musings:\n\nThe much touted graphical changes aren't really an upgrade, just a few tweaks to lighting (makes some areas a little darker or a little lighter but not much else), and textures (SLIGHTLY less muddy than vanilla).\n\nThe gameplay remains the same as vanilla too apart from slightly different enemy locations (some actually make more sense within their respective levels now) and unfortunately a ton more gank squads.\n\nPersonally I've never been a fan of artificial difficulty with regards to placing more and more enemies in an area to ramp up the difficulty, I would call this lazy and uninspired to the nth degree, totally shameful.  I would much rather have less enemies to fight but in more interesting and dangerous locations, for example, fighting a 2-hand weilder on a narrow bridge with no rails over a sheer drop, or an archer in a tight coridoor etc.\n\nThe durability bug is the deal breaker for me though, it's been there from the start and FS have done NOTHING to even address it, even after all the exposure it's had. It's like FS live in this tiny bubble that no outside influence can penetrate.  It's disheartening to the extreme, especially as Bloodborne is so much better in this respect than DS2 will ever be due to B-team's lack of care and attention.\n\nThere's no doubting that DS2 is fun, but, for me, not for the right reasons and the same thing applies to Scholar.\n\nIf you don't own Dark Souls 2, or own it but NOT the DLC then this is an ideal purchase.\nIf however, you own Dark Souls 2 AND the DLC avoid like the plague, as for my money, this hasn't enough changes to justify being paid content, only a cash-grab from a severely floundering B-team.","April 13, 2015","false","2.0"," 277 of 406 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","277","406","10","17"

Similarly a buggy and annoying level up selection. In the past, you could use your mouse and click which stats you wanted to level up, now its bugged to using the arrow keys to move the selection up and down the stats which afterward will unlock using mouse select(only up to the stats you highlighted the arrow keys)\nThese are just the intial issues i've noticed so far\nis it improved over the dx9?

If you're new to the game, I'd also recommend getting this version (but perhaps after playing Dark Souls 1).\n\nIf you already own the original with all dlc's I wouldn't recommend the upgrade at the asking price. Aside from some asset shuffling (enemies, items, etc.) and some really minor geometry changes, there isn't a whole lot of difference between this and a modded DX9 version.\n\nWait for a sale.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the game itself:\n\n400+ hours with the original base game, I can tell you I think the game is fun, but fun doesn't make it good.\n\nCons:\n\nSome of the design is poorly done, some of the art is incredibly lazy, the story is all over the place with far too many vague references to the first game, online play has frustrating latency, and the matchmaking while implemented with good intentions is broken.\n\nPros:\n\nThe character models/textures are fantastic, the soundscape is immersive and the voice acting superb. The animations are more fluid than previous 'Souls' games leading to tighter character control, which, in a game as focused on the action and timing as this, makes it a joy to explore the many and varied environments the game offers.\n\n\n\n45+ hours into the 'upgraded' content:\n\nThe 'enhanced' graphics seems like it's only for lighting and some bloom. The textures don't seem to have been touched, or at least not the terrible ones I've noticed. They did make clever use of the lighting effects and using torches as triggers though.\n\nThe enemy/item shuffling, at least in New Game, isn't too surprising or even that challenging as they are the same enemies that were always in the game.  It is kind of refreshing to find that The Pursuer actually pursues, and at least the item shuffling gives a reason to explore the same old areas again.\n\nNot much for new content that I've found so far, some 'new' npc invaders one which actually has new acquirable equipment.

There's a steep learning curve that comes at the expense of tears, anger and sometimes hardware. I think that with every death in this game, you lose a part of yourself irl. Perhaps the true spirit of the game is that the longer you play, the darker you soul becomes.\n\nNone the less, the artwork, cryptic storyline and freedom to find your death in all sorts of lovley places makes this one hell of an experience. I don't know if I would exactly reccomend this game. It was given to me by my brother who has a long term realtionship with the series and insisted it I was time i played it. Some 200 hours later, I've completed the core game, and $ for game/per hour is obviously pretty good.

Areas have better and often more sensical/lore friendly enemy placements and the game feels a lot less empty. General progression is much more fluid in contrast to the game's general difficulty increase; vanilla may have been easier, but having to reach Iron Keep just to get the dull ember, or having to go through the Belfry Luna just to get the bastille key were a pain. In Scholar of the First Sin, these items exist in their appropriate areas.\n\nI haven't finished Scholar just yet, but it already feels like the definitive version. General difficulty improvements and bug fixes are implemented from the get-go and the difficulty increase of the PvE experience never feels too over the top. There are more NPC summons in place to prevent people getting too stuck in certain areas after the game dies, NPCs appear in stranger places, sometimes more appropriate ones. A few hiccups remain from the conversion to 60fps, however, including some erratic movement from enemies that may attack far too quickly for you to parry, although capping your framerate somehow will fix these issues.\n\nIt still has the same problem Dark Souls 2 and 3 have - coming from the original Dark Souls, where poise was a gamekiller and parrying was almost a necessity, DS2 and 3 feel much easier and harder, allowing for viable dex builds and with less enemies having crazy amounts of poise, but parrying has been made a much more difficult and often pointless endeavour that is hard to drill out from your mind. The games went from a slow and clunky mess where parrying and poise breaking caused you to min/max and optimize, to a much more fluid game where dual wielding isn't awful and all weapons feel impactful, although some have their niche appeal.\n\nIt's a hack and slash, now.\n\nBut after all that, it's still Dark Souls, just with a roll that isn't locked to four directions upon locking on, and with more friendliness towards fashion or whatever you specifically want to use, without the instant backstabs or the horrendous lag. People's main complaint come from the fact that it isn't a direct sequel. That's part of what makes DS2's story so great. To quote Arin Hanson of GameGrumps regarding these games: "You just go." That's precisely what DS2's story and level design is about. You aren't supposed to be clear on anything, not until the last second. Spend some time looking through the lore descriptions, listening to dialogue, or even just watching VaatiVidya's youtube videos and DS2 suddenly becomes an amazing evolution of the established Dark Souls plot, all hidden away under a shroud of player confusion and unclear goals.\n\n"I believe they called it Drangleic. Perhaps you're familiar. No, how could you be. But one day, you will stand before its decrepit gate. Without really knowing why."\n\nI don't wish to spoil much for DS2 newbies, but the plot being masked with a lack of information is both the game's strong point and its weakness. In DS1, you are given three distinct goals from a potential three different NPCs. In DS2 everything is vague; level design makes no sense and worlds seem to be connected together by dull, empty rooms with barely designed lifts that seem to shatter real-world physics, something often criticized by fans. But remember the epidemic of memory loss sweeping Drangleic? How would you remember how you really found yourself at your destination? All those dull, dark, empty, impossible and badly designed rooms are symbolic of the curse eating away at your memory, which is a strong focus of much of the game's story and characters. Nobody reliably remembers why they came or how they came. The symbolism simply compliments those barren rooms being necessary transitional/loading areas. It's amazing to me that all the prerequisites to truly understanding the story and the journey are given to you in the FIRST CUTSCENE OF THE GAME.\n\nDark Souls 2 is a shining example of an underappreciated and fine sequel. Not bogging around in what was, no matter how great, but reimagining what was. A fresh new take on something you're already very familiar with, yet it suffered for the art. It doesn't have as many memorable moments in the base game as Dark Souls 1 did until the very end, whereas Dark Souls 1 had you venturing through painting worlds, falling through collapsed prisons and fighting remarkable bosses to great music, DS2's base game has a few decent bosses and gets much better as you access the DLC areas. Dark Souls 2 may not have as huge an impact on you as the first game did, but it certainly outclasses the first mechanically. You no longer have to be a tryhard to drive away invaders or stay hollowed for fear of constant OHKO invasions. It plays better, runs better, but being developed for the x360 and ps3 at the time, DS2 isn't going to leave your mouth agape too often.\n\nIt's a good game.

This means that that character you spent 250+ hours leveling, gearing and upgrading? Yeah, you won't have access to him/her anymore. Bad luck, mate. The worst thing about this is that they choose to pass this off as "impossible, due to the DX9 to DX11 upgrade", which I know is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I could transfer my saved files from several other games, including Serious Sam, Titan Quest, multiple Resident Evil titles etc.\n\n2.\nIf you're a Dark Souls achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ like myself, you will have to grab every single achievement again. That means venturing to NG2+ in order to obtain spells like Wrath of the Gods, Great Chaos Flame and more.\n\n\nSloppy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like this is not okay, From Software.\n\nA final note: While my in-game play time will read about ~1 hour for this game, don't be fooled. I have around 260 hours into the old Dark Souls II, but due to this being an ENTIRELY NEW LAUNCHER, for whatever bloody reason, it doesn't count those hours.

If you have played the original and are thinking about buying this re-release then you can read on.\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nThe good:\n\n- The lighting in this game is better because now you actually need torches to be able to see in some dark areas (The Gutter).\n- Invading and Co-Op NPCs are much better and feel more alive. Hell, they're even mocking you if they manage to kill you and they also have other surprises ready for you…\n- Better enemy placement: In some areas the enemy placement makes more sense lore wise and gameplay wise.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Some areas have become optional or even meaningless. Exp: Before you had to kill the Gargoyles to get the key to light the fires in the Lost Sinner boss room. Now you conveniently find the key on your way to the Lost Sinner. Where I have to ask myself: Why do we even take the hassle now to kill them? There is no real rewards for them anymore. They even made Dragons Aerie optional, why?\n- Better graphics are not that noticeable for the most part and where they could have improved the graphics by simply improving the details (or even adding any details at all! I'm looking at you, Forest of Fallen Giants King's Door courtyard) they didn't.\n- Enemy placement (again): What is a good point for Dark Souls II: SotFS is also a negative point. In some areas the new enemy placement is ridiculous! To a point where it is plain annoying and not really harder. I'm looking at you Heide's Tower of Flames.\n- Arbitrary road blocks: Now you have petrified statues everywhere and quite often they don't even make any sense from a lore perspective.\n\nThe game is still awesome in it's own right but I simply think in comparison to the original a downgrade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/335300/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is the "director's cut" version of the original Dark Souls II with all DLCs included. I don't think there's need to introduce the Dark Souls series as you've already heard about them before for sure. It's an action RPG where you play as a cursed character that can't be killed (is always resurrected). That leads you to Drangleic kingdom where you expect to break the curse, with help of mysterious woman, the Emerald Herald.\n\nWhole series are well-known for the high difficulty. I think Scholar is even slightly harder than Dark Souls and for those who think it's still not enough, there are options to make it even harder. Interesting feature is the option to restart specific location to "new game plus" difficulty.\n\nWhere the first Dark Souls used to make difficulty via unique and unexpected enemies, Scholar's difficulty is more based on overwhelming you. Instead of making harder, clever and unique creatures, the game just throws groups of enemies on you. But even though the enemy placement and amount, the level design still keeps the high standard Dark Souls series are known for. Every location is made with exploring in mind, containing many secret passages and crossroads offering huge amount of playtime for those who want to see everything, and almost every dead-end or secret is rewarding you with an item (guarded by powerful enemy).\n\nWhat I liked about Dark Souls II (Scholar) is that the game doesn't push you to go to specific locations. Of course, you'll have to beat every main boss through the game, but that doesn't mean you have to beat them at specific time. There'll be many passages where you'll get frustrated pretty easily but you can just ignore them for some time and go somewhere else. Until the last third of the game, you can always pick where to go, and not just follow linear location structure that you might've experienced in other RPGs.\n\nWhat gets annoying pretty fast are the NPC invaders. If you play online, other players may attack you, but there are also many NPCs who will invade your world to kill you. Sadly, they aren't a big challenge (except one optional invader in the beginning of the game), they just annoy you with repeated showing up. The game in the description even praises including invader Forlorn, who just ends up being pain in the...\n\nDark Souls series are typical for their unique online features, and Scholar is not different. You can always see notes put by other players on the ground (secrets and hints, but also lies and troll messages), you can see ghosts of people who died at your place and you can get help with bosses from other players (and vice versa). I found the notes being most important, as it brought to me good hints and laughs many times. But it also shows something typical for Scholar of the First Sin - you'll meet pretty often notes "beware of duo" and "beware of trio" (due to the enemy design I already mentioned).\n\nThe game has also strong plan for Player vs. Player combat, as most covenants (specific groups where you gain your rank, you can join only one at a time) will require you to invade other players' games and kill them. You might be afraid of getting invaded pretty often but that's not right - through my play I was invaded only few times and it was mostly in specific PvP locations where covenants give tasks to protect the place from other players.\n\nThe environment and graphics are gorgeous. Of course, you can't expect top level graphic details, but you won't mind it for the depth and variety of all locations. You'll visit forests, castles, deadly dungeons, dragon lairs, sewers full of rats, caves full of spiders and more... and you'll love what game designers made, as they made a great compromise between technical and visual level design.\n\nIf you haven't checked through playtimes of DS players, let's make it clear - Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is a long game. It offers you tens of hours for a single playthrough considering just sticking with the main path. Add many side paths, secrets, optional bosses and DLC content, and you are getting even higher with the time game provides you. And if that's not enough and you want a bigger challenge on something you have already experienced, you can always pick New Game+, New Game++, New Game+++,...\n\nIt's not a perfect game, personally I liked more the first Dark Souls (because of better balanced difficulty and more memorable locations), but that doesn't mean it's not a great game. I've enjoyed Scholar of the First Sin and if you want a game that won't hold your hand and leaves you to the challenge, you'll love it!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 24","true","57.7"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","38","44","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Legendary_Linux/recommended/335300/","Legendary_Linux","Legendary_Linux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Legendary_Linux/","450 products in account","First, let me address the controversy surrounding Scholar of the First Sin. If you want to skip this bit, the actual review starts in paragraph five. Dark Souls II came out about a year ago. The graphics in the trailer looked better than the in-game graphics. People were upset, as if this was some new affront to gamers everywhere. Then people played the game, decided they really liked it, and the world spun on.\n\nFast forward a few months and From Software announces a new version of the game called Scholar of the First Sin. It includes updated graphics, support for more simultaneous multiplayer connections, extra NPCs for both lore and combat, revised enemy placement, a new boss, and an alternate ending. Furthermore, most of this content will be available as a free update to current Dark Souls II owners.\n\nThe updated graphical engine (DX11) was incompatible with the old engine (DX9). Thus, rather than replace the old engine entirely, they decided to release the DX11 version of Scholar of the First Sin as a standalone paid upgrade. As a bonus, they included all the DLC.\n\nSo what are people complaining about? What's the controversy? People are upset about paying $20 for what they percieve as a graphical patch. In reality, the DX11 version contains the revised troop placement, allows for up to six people to play simultaneously, and yes, is also a graphical upgrade.\n\nWhat about the game, though? Isn't this a review? Yes, yes it is.\n\nScholar of the First Sin is great fun to play. If you played Dark Souls II, you'll enjoy the new enemy placement. It does two things very well. First, the new placement shakes things up. Enemies aren't where you expect them to be anymore, so even for veteran DS2 players, each map is a new experience. Secondly, the new placement is more devious. Harder enemies appear sooner, many others have better placement, and you'll find yourself panicking more than you did the first time, which is a welcome change. Dark Souls II was easier than its predecessor, and the new enemy placement in Scholar addresses that problem. Perfectly? No - but I'm happy with the results.\n\nExtra players in multiplayer is a blast. Four person boss assaults are both fun and hilarious, and fight club on the bridge just got a whole lot messier.\n\nThe graphical differences don't immediately pop out at you since many textures look the same. But having played for a while now, I've found myself stopping on multiple occasions because I just happened to notice that the horizon was a lot more pretty, that fire now illuminates the things around it, that metal reflects light the way you'd expect it to, and that sometimes god-rays are a nice addition to a scene.\n\nSomething else I want to address but can't put my finger on - the game feels better. I don't know if they optimized the engine, or if the controls are slightly more responsive or what, but the whole experience is more comfortble. I realize this point is entirely without solid evidence, but I felt it worth mentioning.\n\nSo to those of you who own Dark Souls II and all it's DLC, I think this game is worth picking up. It's a fresh take on something we love. Oh, and they got rid of that miserable preorder bonus gear.\n\nTo those of you who don't own Dark Souls II but want it, get Scholar of the First Sin. It comes with all the DLC, and you'll never have to know why the first four paragraphs were written.","April 3, 2015","true","94.7"," 288 of 456 people (63%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","63","288","456","22","1"

I have full DX11 support and most of the other consumers do also.\n\nIf Fromsoft can't launch an "upgrade" (wich cost me 15 euro) with full optimization, then i cannot recommend this upgrade. My advise is to wait for the patch, Or just don't buy it. From other people's reviews, it seems that the game is not much of an "upgrade" but more of an moneygrab.\n\n*EDIT*\n\nAfter toying with Dll. files, i managed to actually get past the problems, however, changing Dll's is not something i would recommend doing alot.\n\nThe game is actually not that improved. Yes the storyline is better now, and item placement / enemy placement has improved, but this is practically the version that should have been the original and not the upgrade.\n\nAnyhow, unless you have not played Dark souls 2 in it's original, i would recommend playing this one as the full experience.\n\nThanks to Sam for the edit heads up.","April 2, 2015","false","45.2"," 180 of 279 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","180","279","8","1"

Probably.***\nAll spoilers are covered by spoiler tag, if you haven't noticed yet. So yeah. If you spoil something for yourself, blame curiousity.\n\nSo, after seeing a lot of disappointed negative reviews, claiming that the Scholar of the First Sin was the worst thing since the infamous E.T., I've decided to buy it and find out myself.\n\nBut first things first. I live in Russia and prices are pretty much localized here, so I've got my upgrage (I own all of the DLCs) for hillarious 5$. Was I disappoint? Well, find out yourself:\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThat's what the biggest complaints have been about. People claim that there are no improvements, and that they'd rather stick with free GeDoSaTo and the original game. Here's what I saw.\n\nThere really is only one thing that didn't get a graphical update. World textures. While it is rather disappointing, the SotFS really made it up by the use of lighting. I was really shocked to see the beautiful use of lighting in Things Betwixt and Majula, and it continues to impresses me still, even though I've progressed a lot in my very first SotFS save. They've made a great job making some sort of 'artificial darkness' that vanishes away as soon as you get a torch. Finally we've got a chance of seeing this 'perception vs. safety' feature we've been excited about before DkSII came out. Character textures seem to be improved a lot, as my character's face looked far more detailed on the creation screen and in the game itself. But really the biggest improvement has been made with *particle effects*. Yeah, you've read this correct. SotFS improves on particle effects such as souls, sparks, Pursuer's eyes and so on.\n\nGraphic improvement is 7/10\n\nENEMY PLACEMENTS, IMMERSION, GAME PACE:\nMany many more Pursuer encounters, and these are rather unexpected. Now the guy really pursues you. Every Pursuer except the first one drops Twinkling Titanite, making a good early game source of it. Also, there are a lot more enemies in stages, but I didn't feel overwhelmed. It is impossible to run through now as well, so SotFS seems to fix all the problems original DkSII had with enemy placement and AI. There are a lot of things that add immersion, for example, two hollowed Royal Soldiers beating the hell out of giant trees, like if they still followed orders mindlessly. Overall, the game feels slower, more tactical and thoughtful, immersive. and co-op oriented.\n\nSotFS gets 10/10 in this category.\n\nITEM PLACEMENTS:\nThe most notable change is Dull Ember being almost in the beginning of the game. Some of chests' contents have changed, some chests were added as well. Most of them contain weapons and shields you'd get later in the game, and some bodies contain weapons that took time to get, but weren't way too powerful (Whip, for example). Out of the most non-spoilerey weapon placement changes: two Broken Straight Swords in the beginning of the game instead of one. I've not seen any new armor placements, but now some sets that were only available in NG+ are now farmable in regular NG pretty early in the game. Go get your hands on your Shadow Sets and enjoy your SL 30 Uchigatana builds, folks.\n\n8/10 for item placements\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\nI haven't played the new larger scale PvP yet, but I indeed had some fun with co-op. For some locations it is recommended now (Heide's Tower of Flame, I'm looking at you), and for some reason it's way too much fun. With three (maybe more) summons at the same time, this game really turns into a jolly co-op experience. With more enemies added on stages, four players in one co-op sessions seems to be barely enough. Now to a little bit of PvP I've played. Just once I invaded a guy and his summon at Heide's Tower of Flame, and it feels good. Enemy placement does miracles, and the host won't be able to tank you out while his friend takes care of enemies anymore. Invasions turned from a "PvE-quicklyclearthearea-PvP-PvE' experience to constant pressure from both players and enemies, no matter how many players are you co-oping with.\n\n9/10, a subject to change since I'm yet to see large scale fight clubs and PvP in general\n\nA NEW INVADER:\nAn NPC invader that invades you in Forest of Fallen Giants with the Blue Flame, Soul Greatsword and Soul Vortex. Pretty much speaks for itself. I want his set.\n\nlow SM build/10\n\nSAVES:\nThey don't transfer. But to me it wasn't even a downside: I usually don't even go on NG+1.\n\nIndiffirent/10\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI'll be honest: I own the original DkSII, all the DLCs and guess what? Even though I paid just 5$ for the SotFS, I'd pay three times as much because SotFS feels fresh. It isn't a simple "add a DLC" PTDE (which is praised for some reason), but a massive rework of the game. In spite of what everyone says, SotFS is one of the best remasters I've seen. Enjoyable, suprising, beautiful, with more difficulties to overcome, it adds more replayability to already replayable game.\n\n9/10, "Game of the Year" of the Year.","April 2, 2015","true","183.5"," 177 of 287 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","177","287","10","5"

Went through Morrowind, Oblivion, Dark Messiah etc. just to figure out one day that these type of games were my thing...or so I thought.\nChallenge was the one thing all of these games were lacking (dead? just reload, man!) and that changed when I got my hands on the Prepare to die-Edition of Dark Souls.\nOver a 100 hours on Steam and I'm pretty sure about 4 times as much on the 360 made me forget about all the other games (at least made some cash at Game Stop). So much about Dark Souls 1.\n\nWhen I started DS2 SOTFS (let's keep it short, right?), the character editor, much like in DS1 didn't really impress me...no great variety of hairstyles, beards (but at least some weird tattoos you can have right in your face). Didn't matter to me though...DS1 has left a huge impact, following that came huge expectations of course (go play Saints Row if you wanna play as a bearded lady!).\n\nSo why on earth would you spend money on a game, that slaps you harder than a 13 year old girl, you just snatched away the cellphone from?\nWhy spend money on a game that's graphically not as impressive as so many games nowadays and that doesn't help you get through all the stages with a fancy mini map and quest logs and the like?\nLet me tell you why, young Padawan...\n\nEvery time you die, your life bar shrinks and you'll become more and more hollowed (meaning you're gonna look like an old cucumber with white eyes), making death a serious thing, as you're not able to save and reload manually, unless you make your mom pull the plug (more about PvP later). Therein lies the challenge, which, combined with the demanding combat system makes you actually cautious about your enemies' attack patterns and surroundings.\nSo many have mentioned it already and they're absolutely right: patience is the key.\n\nAlso, the Boss fights in the Souls series are an absolute highlight, although SOTFS makes you fight the same (or similar) bosses in some areas  Yes, I'm talking about you, Dragon Rider, Covetous Demon and Smelty!  ,\nbut that's just a grain of sand compared to the amount of bosses with all 3 DLCs, from complete pushovers (how did I die to Prowling Magus, though) to bosses that will leave you with trauma and eye bags.\n\nThat leads us to the biggest feature: Online Multiplayer.\nStarting with Co-op, you can just skip the part with trauma and eye bags by summoning up to 3 friendly players (in SOTFS, previously 2 in DS1 and DS2) who will help you finally beat  the Fume Knight  that annoying boss who keeps killing you with only a sliver of HP left.\nOr you could use those friendly Phantoms™ (available in White™ and Gold™) to clear an area before a boss fight, send them home and face said boss alone or with less phantoms (recommended on the first playthrough, the more phantoms you summon, the more HP has the boss).\ntalk to an NPC called Mild Mannered Pate to get an item that makes you available for others to summon you as a phantom\n\nAnd now to the dark side of Dark Souls (heh):\n\nPvP\n\nI wish I could tell you about the horrors I have experienced during this part of the game, but this review is long enough already and you're still reading it.\n\nOnce you get out of the cozy, welcoming place called Majula and visit a new area, you'll sooner or later get invaded by another player. These phantoms don't wanna help you beat a boss, rather make you cry and enter midlife crisis earlier than you might have planned (well, a portion of them at least).\nOther than that, beating another skilled player, landing your first parry, or beating a group of gankers (no one likes gankers) is just as rewarding as beating Sir Trauma of House Eye bags.\n\nI could write so much more about PvP but that part is best experienced on your own, after a few fights you'll know if it's your thing or not, anyways.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPro's\nOnline Multiplayer (Co-op and PvP)\nBeautiful environments for the most part, especially the DLC areas\nAs good as no loading times (only when you fast travel or die)\nCombat system (button smashing won't help you much, you gotta plan those attacks and manage your stamina)\nRewarding good play, punishing bad play, in other words: it's not an unfair game (not always)\nSo many different weapon classes, you'll definitely find tools that suit your style of play\nGorgeous armor (also great variety and cosplay oppurtunities)\nNew Game+ (you know you want that challenge!)\nBosses\nGavlan\n\nCon's\nWeapon durability issues still not fixed\nLaggy online play sometimes\nCheaters that might ruin a cozy PvP session (rare though)\nTrauma and eye bags...seriously\nYou will have to break up with your girlfriend once you enjoy the game\n\nYeah...I guess that sums it up pretty much. Would I recommend that purchase? Yes!\n\ntongue but hole/10","February 4","true","578.6"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","26","30","11","2"

Maybe for some, but it is family, still For me Dark Souls II had the job of filling Dark Souls I's foot steps and from what I heard before playing, it had a very tough standing with me. Some of my pessimistic expectations got confirmed, not all though. In the end, I got stuck with it. And not because there is nothing better to play.\n\nSo here are some bullet points about my mental starting point and in opposition my verdict so far.\nI try to focus on what gripped me most, that being lore and atmosphere, also the frustration/accomplishment ratio and Online Playing.\nFinally I add a tl;dr kind of conclusion.\n\nWhat I thought I knew about it, before I even owned it:\nIt is too try hard in being difficult, maybe even plain unfair.\nThey misinterpreted the source of success, that made DSI the ember that slowly grew into a steady flame, even a bonfire (Firelink Shrine):\nYou associate it with home and - just like home - might have dreaded the return at first, but when finally entering, all those memories remind you of its livelyness. pull you in, stuff you with heaps of food (not just the sweet but also the healthy, sometimes bitter kind) and finally necessary goodbyes are a pain. So much, that you can't but visit the interwebz and claw for more: lore interpretations, artworks, guides and ideas for your next char, speedruns...  but i digress.\nThe story.... what story?\nUnfaithful Miyazaki's creativity ran off and had an affair with Bloodborne.\nThis double release thing smells.\nIs the Coop/ PvP Sys any good?\nAfter a few hours on tape, here is what I think now:\nYes it tries hard to be difficult. Especially in the first area (Forest) I still get cranky about the invisible column every mob seems to rotate on and hitting me last second, no matter, if they wear a turtle tank outfit weighing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But luckily that ceases to be much of a problem later on.\nThe fact, that you cannot really counter this resulting randomness simply with skill, has also been home to Undead Burg (DSI), so I can't really complain in that department. (Speedrunners said that, not me! So no 'git gud' plz.)\nI have to say, in DSII I found myself shouting and spitting: THIS IS JUST UNFAIR! a lot more often than in DSI. Levels can be mean and harder than their bosses, we have read it here. More bonfires do help a bit though. Ergo this point stays on the list for me.\n\nHome? Firelink Shrine is one thing, maybe your parents home, considered you have good childhood memories. Majula is another, maybe your first own flat in a different city.\nThey are both home, but in different ways.\nThe return to Demon's Souls hub design makes comparison just as hard. So I limit it to saying, I very much felt at home in Majula as well, and that is an important starting point to falling for the series imho.\nThis particular feel, maybe because it plays music where there is none otherwise, maybe because of the dusky light with its melancholic vibe or because of those people inhabiting this forgotten spot by the cliffs. It fits.\nWould have been awesome, if they made more of a development - or rather degradation - in those NPCs. This would have made the location a perfect paradox, a safe resting place for you, a brutally beautiful harbinger of oblivion and nothingness for the others.\n\nThe hub design produced less interwoven levels. Warping made shortcuts unneccessary, I get that. But this little tinge of achievement, when you turned the lever or activated this elevator, I kinda missed that. DLC tried to make a better job at least.\n\nStory or lore wise I do not think they changed much conceptionally. I liked the basic idea of humanity in DSI better and the woven lore seemed a bit more tighter knit, layered and more easily understandable/accessible for a starting point. The sequel's strong point is building up on this lore fundament. But they could have invested more here imho.\nTaken for its own lore, I missed a lot up until the ending, which I did not get at first when it played: So thats it? Seriously? But after a visit to vaati a lot suddenly made sense. And the backtracking afterwards - checking, if the videos had a basis - pulled me in and got me into thinking, just as much as DSI had (and no other game before that).\nThere is history, tragedy, ambivalence in character (friend or foe alike) and questions asked, that I want to seek answers to myself.\nBUT I miss NPC quest lines on the scales of the Onion Knight or Solaire. The Pate and Cale thing was a fun idea though.\n\nCreativity in design or mechanic? Mh...Not my area of expertise.\nAnyway this is a tough thing, because DSI had no expectations to fill with me, but there was less recycling and less 3v1. DSII: Some bosses felt (sometimes even were) the same. Looking Glass Knight (DemS?) or Old Iron King had some fun ideas. Though frustrating, Fume Knight was boss.\n\nDouble release still smells to me, but it got fainter.\n\nOnline Playing.\nThey made a lot differently, most to the better, I think. So start with my\nNegatives:\n-The Soul Memory system makes it a mean job to try and keep your overall souls count low, in order to avoid the magic Havel with power stancing dragon tooths at some point in late game. Hard thing when you run for the first time and decide to pvp later on.\nI need to reserve a ring slot for a soul eating Agape Ring, so not to continue to rise in SM with every PvP or Coop match. Also there's no easy way to recreate the SL120-for-PvP-understanding in DSI. But DSIII wants to change that, I have read.\n- Invasion only via consumables, so you continually have to spend souls here as well. While the top ranks of two popular covenants (butterfly-wings-wearing-and-poison-spitting criminals and over-zealous cyber policemen) require you to invade around 500 times succesfully in a row (reds)... Why not just make it esport compatible then, I wonder? With controllable match making or based on rank and not SM.\n- No more indictment for cheap players, so duelling honorably is devalued.\n\nThe Good things for me:\n- No P2P connections means more succesful invasions/coop, lag's still a thing though.\n- Power-stancing and many shield piercing weapons add variety to builds.\n- No punishment for covenant hopping means more fun for me testing around, although there is less to try out.\n- Options to reenable invasions in areas you have already cleared.\n- Playing around with rings and items. (Invaded someone in Iron Keep, finally found him waiting on the last of the beams in this chimney kinda thing you drop down from above. Those four? archers standing on top, still in place. The moment before I dropped to the first beam, he activated a seed... it was over fast).\n- Over-zealous policemen-to-the-rescue system.\n- More Sunlightbros per host!\nConclusion/tl;dr:\nCompleting the story line and DLCs, I feel a certain emptiness, only finishing a gripping book could trigger. Seeing I even wanted to leave out the second one entirely and just wait for DSIII, I have to admit, this emptiness means something.\nDespite its flaws, it has a right to be valued on its own and there, is a top game.\n\nIf you have played DSI already, go play II as well.\nIf not, give it a try. The beginning is hard, but it gets substantially easier, with some infuriating black-outs in between.\nIf - like me - you love to discover the stories or worlds in games, play DSI first, if not done already. It gives you a basic understanding and makes the world of Drangleic (DSII) much more fascinating.\nIf you are into gameplay mechanics, play both or better all of them.","January 27","true","188.1"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","26","31","4","0"

Whilst that is not completely true this game can be quite challenging and requires quite a bit of skill. But you can also cheese the game by playing all the bosses co-op which I don't recommend doing because it will ruin the satisfaction of finally beating a boss after dying a million times (Not literally a million times)\n\nOne of the first mistakes I made in Dark Souls II was when I beat the first boss which in my opinion was really easy and after that I actually thought I was invincible all that changed when I walked the wrong way and I met The Pursuer who really isn't the friendliest guy you will encounter in Dark Souls II, so in approximately 5 sec I got punctured by his 400kg sword and I was as dead as a doornail. I thought to myself I must have done something wrong and went back to fight him again this time after getting a few levels higher. But guess what? I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me again, and that kept happening for at least 20 times which really broke my spirit and wanted me to quit the game and never play it again, but something had awoken in me and it gave me the urge to continue to try beat this piece of ♥♥♥♥. So after some magical hours of dying over and over again I finally managed to stun him with a giant ballista and got two shots in him with it, his health bar so small that you could barely see it. I saw his look of fear whilst he charged his final attack at me which I dodged with finesse whilst at the same time attacking his side with my Fire Longsword. It was over I had slain The Great Pursuer and was left standing with wounds all over my body, but I had done it, after so much time and effort I finally beat it....\n\nAfter this fight I actually found out that I could have skipped this boss and fought an easier boss but to this day I am still proud that I beat The Pursuer with such a low level character and with so little knowledge as to how to play the game.\n\nTo this day this game is one of the top 5 games I have played.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Praise The Sun \[T]/.......","May 20","true","260.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","20","21","4","0"

Loving the new remix of enemy placement and key items. The game flows better now. This is the definitive version of Dark Souls II!\n\nPlaying the vanilla, I personally felt that some areas are unfair and unimaginative by throwing tons of tough enemies in one location. This version removes those kind of stuff but at the same made some areas more difficult but not boring.\n\nGraphics isn't as good as DX9 version + Gedosato, but the item and enemies remix, accompanied with lightning upgrade makes this version enjoyable even for me who have spend 100+ hours in the original version.\n\nFor the Newcomers:\nStarting is tough, but as you level up and learn patterns, you will overcome things you thought impossible.\nBe patient, use strategy, be aware of your surroundings.\nSome areas with tons of enemies can become much easier if you approach slowly.\n\nTips:\n\n- Running low on flask and durability near a boss door? Drop your co-op sign and help others win the fight, gain souls, restore flask and durability, and restore humanity, all at the same time while warming up for your own fight.\n\n- For melee build players: dont forget to raise your ADP stat for better rolls.\n\n- If you're overwhelmed, lure enemies so you can take them out one by one. Utilize narrow hallways, doors, walls, stairs, ladders, etc. This game will try its best to kill you so no shame in using all the available options to increase your survival.","April 5, 2015","true","75.6"," 74 of 115 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","74","115","0","0"

What was once a game based on exploration and risk taking, has now turned into a game where overpowered monsters stop you from going anywhere but a linear path and the risks have been reduced to the grind of killing enemies over and over.\n\nFor instance, Heide Tower and the Heide Knights:\n\nThese knights where scattered throughout the world of Dark Souls 2 and you had to defeat them to obtain a weapon or piece of armor (which was no easy feat). Not in SotFS they are all located at Heide Tower and all there loots are now random drops. What makes this "enhanced edition" worse is none of the actual mechanics have been tweaked. The hit-boxes are still terribly large leading to moments where you swear you evaded a stabbing blow but it turns out your enemies blade has a magnet or something as you magically get sucked into an animation of you getting stabbed. (this happens way to often).\n\nAlso the CLIFFS! You'd figure they would fix how often you magically slip off although both your characters feet are planted firmly on the ground. But that also remains.\n\nIn short Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the first sin adds a bunch of crap without actually fixing anything people were complaining about.\n\nI understand that the game is supposed to be hard and unforgiving, but it's hard to enjoy that aspect when all the difficulty come from the bad mechanics and not the actual world and enemies.","June 24, 2015","false","34.0"," 39 of 56 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","39","56","2","1"

The new enemy and item placement didnt seem that important at first (well it doesnt in the first areas) but in later areas there are some changes which make much more sense than before. Also some of the items make much more sense now (torch) and whats also really cool is that you fight the Pursuer many times in many different locations now. AND I saw I think 3 completely new enemy types which werent in the original nor in the DLCs.\n\nI have over 100 hours playtime on the original Dark Souls 2\n\nTo anyone who didnt played the first game and thinks about starting with Dark Souls 2 because they think its easier: Dont do it, play Dark Souls 1 first, dont be scared by the difficulty, thats not the point of Dark Souls. Its not as hard as the media says it is.\n\nYes, Dark Souls 1 is much better than Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 2 is still one of the best games of 2014, what does that say about Dark Souls 1? Anyway, this is my review for Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin:\nLet me start with something I dont really care about in a Dark Souls game, the Story. I know the hardcore fans really like to delve deep into the lore and Im also interested in that, but I never do that "research" myself. Thats why I cant say much about the story of Dark Souls 2, only that the first game had more interesting characters and a more interesting world.\nOkay now lets talk about what Dark Souls 2 does worse than its predecessor and there is quite something. The worst part of DS2 is the first real area of the game you visit, the forest of fallen giants, and everything beyond that until the final Boss of that area. In this part of the game the level design is extremely dull which makes exploring boring. The enemys you encounter are fine, but they also get dull after a while. The first time you will play this game I dont think that this will be a big deal for you though, but for me on my second and third playthrough these levels were boring to play again. What makes these levels even more boring is the graphics of the game. Texture quality is sometimes terrible and lighting is dull and there is no interesting architecture. On top of that the bossfights you encounter are also not that special, but they are fine. Still, the taurus demon from Dark Souls 1 for example is one of my favorite boss fights in the whole franchise, and thats the first boss of the game. The visual design of the bosses are unspectacular, the arenas you fight in are dull and all of them kinda have the same attack patterns.\nBut again, thats just the first 3-4 areas of the game (maybe 3 or 4 hours), after that the quality of the levels, enemys and bosses gets better and better. You can also go to Heide Tower of Flame right from the beginning but there is no point in doing that. The game is FULL of items of any kind you can think of. There are many items which are designed for certain playstyles. That means that you will find many many many items which will be totaly useless to you. This is another reason exploration in DS2 isnt as fun as in DS1. Weapons and Armors you can find are rare, most of the cool stuff you have to buy.\nI was still motivated enough to explore, but it wasnt as rewarding as it should be.\nThere are TONS of weapons in this game, but most of the weapons are just different versions of the same weapon type (for obvious reasons), a little bit less would be better I think, especially because your inventory will be full with all kind of crap. Every enemy you fight could drop some useless armor, NOBODY every will use but you loot the enemys anyway, because they might give you life gems or crafting materials. In DS1 you had less weapons, but the same amount of variety and depth, there are just too many unnessesary items in DS2.\nOne of the worst design decisions of DS2 are the life gems and herbs which refill your spell uses. Both of these completely destroy the balance of the game. On your first playthrough this wont have a huge impact (depending on your skill), but on later playthroughs you will realize how broken these items are. In DS1 you had a set amount of Flasks and spell uses, so the developers always know how to balance each area of the game. Another weird and unnessesary change is that you cant level up at any bonfire anymore, you have to teleport back to Majula and talk to the girl. This is one of the most stupid decisions, cause I sometimes was simply too lazy to level up because I didnt wanted to go through the loading screen, run to the girl, skip her dialouge, run back to the bonfire, teleport to the area I was in, wait for the loading screen and continue.\nAlso the fact that you can teleport anywhere right from the start of the game shows how much lazier this game was developed compared to the first one. In DS1 every part of the world was connected to each other somehow in a clever way, so that you didnt need quick travel and only very late in the game you unlocked quick travel. If they wouldnt have quick travel in DS2 the developers will be forced to design their world better, so they went the lazy way and just made quick travel right from the start.\nOkay okay, I talked a lot about negative things and actually there are still more negatives (I wont even start talking about PvP) and you might wonder how this game still got a 8.5/10 rating. Well first of all many of the things I mentioned might not even have a huge impact on your playthrough, those are just things which dissapointed me because Dark Souls 1 did them so much better. Also many of the above problems are not present in the 3 DLCs regions. Those are actually the best part of the game apart from some dull enemies.\nDark Souls 2 is full with content. For your first playthrough you will definitly need more than 50 hours (DLC areas are optional though), there are TONS of weapons, armors, enemy types, boss fights, areas, anything. The quality of the boss fights is sometimes good, sometimes average, sometimes fantastic. Less would be better here. Also the difficulty fluctuates a lot from boss to boss. The Iron King Boss ,or whatever his name is, is much much easier than the smelter demon, which is the boss before him and the Iron King is supposed to be the final boss of that area.\nThey simplified weapon upgrades and crafting, I like some of these changes but sometimes when I play DS1 again I feel like they simplified too much. The combat is as good as in Dark Souls 1 and with dual wielding you actually have more play styles now. Whats also new is that you loose a little bit of your maximum health every time you die. I can understand the reason behind this, but its just annoying. I would prefer some other form of punishment.\nThere is so many things left I could talk about, I  barely scratched the surface of the things I did talk about and this review already got really long. Dark Souls 2 is just so big and for that alone its worth playing, so let me conclude:\nDark Souls 2 is an epic adventure despite its flaws. Its challenging and rewarding. It misses the genius of Dark Souls 1 and has some dull parts, but there is more than enough that makes up for that (especially the DLCs). The only reason you will be dissapointed at the end is because Dark Souls 1 was so ♥♥♥♥ing good and Dark Souls 2 feels like a rip off which didnt understand what REALLY made Dark Souls 1 so special (its not the difficulty). But again, dont let me blind you by all my criticism, Dark Souls 2 is still one of the best games of 2014!","April 4, 2015","true","25.2"," 99 of 164 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","99","164","7","8"

I'm not sure what to say, every aspect of this game is better than perfect. Dark Souls II is as good as a video game can possibly be, every person in the world should play this not just hardcore gamers.\n\nDark Souls II has made me see life through different eyes, it has taught me many valuable lessons. It's much more than just a game you play for fun or passing time. It truly deserves to be remembered, every moment spent playing Dark Souls II should be savored. I'm not exaggerating when I say this, Dark Souls II is a really special and unique game. I just can't find the right words to explain how perfect this game it, YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME .\n\nComparing design quality of DLCs with Base Game (DkS2) is like comparing Minesweeper with Battlefield. If Base Game made you grind your teeth, Season Pass will make you tear your hair out. Simply take Level of Difficulty in the base game, then multiply the number by 10 and you'll have an idea of how difficult DLCs are. Season Pass is better than the base game in every single aspect, it's everything Dark Souls II should have been. It almost feels like they cut the best content of their game, only to re-release it as DLC later and make more money!\n\nThis is one of the finest RPG titles of this generation, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in video games","September 24, 2015","true","79.7"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","37","55","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GonzoHattori/recommended/335300/","GonzoHattori","GonzoHattori","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GonzoHattori/","58 products in account","Normally, I'm a big fan of the Souls games, however, one thing I am not a fan of is FROM SOFTWARE's inability to be reasoned with. I was accused of cheating for using a few mods that made the game playable for me. In particular, I was soft-banned for using DS2Fix and x360ce. These two mods do the following:\n\n-DS2Fix: Fix a glitch in the game that causes the durability of your weapons to decrease at twice the normal rate when playing the game at 60 FPS.\n\n-x360ce: Allows you to use directinput gamepads in Dark Souls (in other words, most older gamepads before the XBOX 360 controller).\n\nI have written a request to Bandai Namco to have my ban lifted after admitting that I used these mods (I later bought myself an XBOX 360 controller after finding out about soft-banning), and FROM SOFTWARE told me that since I violated the EULA (even if it was only so that I could play the game the way it was meant to be played), that my soft-ban will not be lifted.\n\nSince a lot of the achievements in the game are a lot more difficult to obtain without any sort of online interactivity, this ruined the game for me in a lot of ways. That is not to say that the achievements and the game are impossible to beat solo, but it will be a much less enjoyable experience as a whole, considering that several bosses are, for the most part, large mobs, as opposed to the much more interesting and creative bosses found in Dark Souls and Demon's Souls respectively.\n\nThe game also puts a lot of emphasis on ambushing and surprising you in inconvenient locations just to make sure they get a couple of extra deaths out of you, which in my opinion is just cheap. After being ambushed and dying as a result of said ambush, it becomes pretty easy to figure out what to do in subsequent attempts, but it just seems blatantly unnecessary. The game is not terribly hard, but you will die simply because you're not ready for every single ambush and surprise the game has in store for you.\n\nAnother thing I would complain about (but kind of seems moot, considering that I'm soft-banned anyway), is the concept of soul memory. Every single soul you collect is added to a stat that matches you up against opponents (and potential allies) with similar amounts of souls. For novice players, this can be troublesome, considering that a lot of souls that are collected will inevitably go to waste, either through the purchase of items, inefficient leveling, or simply through permanently losing souls. Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne do not utilize this system, and in my opinion, it's better that way.\n\nLastly, another thing I don't particularly like is the concept that enemies can disappear. Permanently. If you play through a stage enough times, and keep killing the same enemies over and over, they will eventually stay dead, making soul farming more difficult, unless you have plenty of bonfire ascetics onhand. The only problem with using those is the stage that they're used on is raised one more difficulty level and EVERYTHING is reset for that level, which compels you to have to redo the entire stage (it would be foolish not to), and fight a stronger version of the same boss at the end of the level.\n\nTherefore, soft-banning aside, I consider this entry in the Dark Souls series to be the weakest entry in the series. It does a lot of things that makes it ever-so-slightly less enjoyable than other FROM SOFTWARE gems.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game only if you're a die-hard Souls fan, if you're very careful not to use any sort of mods whatsoever, and if you don't already have all of the original Dark Souls II and its DLC. Remember, ANYTHING other than the what the game originally came with can result in a soft-ban, and you will NEVER get unbanned ever again.\n\nIf you want to be safe, you should probably just stick with the PS4 or XBONE versions. FROM SOFTWARE, like a lot of other 3rd party console developers are not particularly good at releasing PC Ports.\n\nTLDR:\n-Don't use mods.\n-Make sure that you use an xinput gamepad (for example, the XBOX 360 controller).\n-Don't purchase if you have DS II with all of its DLC already.\n-Not as good as other Souls games.\n-Might want to play the PS4 or XBONE versions instead.\n\nOverall:\n4/10 - PC Port\n7/10 - SOTFS (in general)","January 17","false","41.3"," 47 of 73 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","47","73","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/335300/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","Dark souls 2 falls in a weird place for me. I definitely think its worse than Dark Souls 1 but I would still consider it a great game. Keep in mind while reading that I'm mostly into dark souls for the single player experience, and haven't really gotten into any PvP elements at all, those really don't interest me. I will say getting invaded when your trying to head to a boss you've already lost to half a dozen times is really annoying.\n\nAnyway, lets talk about the pros. While the combat is different from Dark Souls 1, and at first I considered it worse, its just different. Rolling works different, weight of your character, weapon swinging and enemy tracking work differently in Dark Souls 2 and after using it for about 25 hours I'd say its still fun, but personally I prefer the combat of the original. I don't really have any complaints or issues with it, but the feel of DS1 was more up my alley. But the combat was definitely fun. Another thing I think this game did well was using different types of healing and other variety of items that felt much more usefull. Lifegems are basically essential to use, especially in the early game. Later on as you obtain more estus, you'll use these items a lot less, which is kind of a shame. I liked the idea that estus wasn't the end all be all of healing. Hopefully dark souls 3 uses more of this element of permanently lost healing items. The enemy desing is impressive and still very good, but not nearly as creative as 1, and I don't really think thats an opinion. I mean one level is just filled with generic spiders, or at least they look like spiders, and its quite boring to look at when you consider what Dark Souls 1 brought to the table. But I'd still consider this a mostly positive point.\n\nNow, the negatives. First of all, a minor one. Why can't I just exit the game without returning to the main menu and having to open it again just to fully quit? Every time I quit it would take me to the main menu. I just want to exit the game! It really annoyed me, but its a minor thing. Another thing, and this is an issue I have with the original as well, give me a pause menu that pauses the game. I realize that they don't want you to be able to spam healing and stuff in a pause menu, but give me a pause that literally does nothing but pause the game. A lot of people, including me, need to be able to pause to do something in real life, or to answer a message, ect. I feel like adding a pause menu that does literally nothing but pause would be a benifit.\n\nLast negative, and the big one. The level design is the most disappointing thing in this entire game. It feels so uninspired. This is probably due to the adding of traveling between bonfires that you get from the beginning instead of later on, making the developers lazy with their level design. But whatever caused it, the levels can basically be described as this. Enter a new area, find the easy to find early bonfire. Find your path to the boss. Find the bonfire thats basically right next to the boss, Kill the boss, get the bonfire after the boss, repeat. Dark souls 1 was much more creative. Sometimes you had one bonfire connecting like 2 or 3 different areas or bosses. And even when you didn't, the level felt more like a world as opposed to a level in a video game. I wish the level design was on the level of dark souls 1, but without it, the game falls below epic.\n\nI will say the game runs well and I had no issues with the port. I think Dark Souls 2 is a smart pick up for those who enjoyed the original, however if you've never experienced a souls game, play the first one before this. Its better, in my opinion.\n\nFor most:\nWait For A Sale\nFor those who loved the original:\nBuy At Full Price","February 26","true","45.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

A few smatterings of pretty lighting, some fancy particle effects, and (extra) enemies placed in new places, which allow them cheap shots on veterans and new players alike. It feels like I paid $30 (Upgrade + DLC) for a version of Dark Souls II that was edited by a bored teenager, giggling as he sticks enemies all over the place and randomly puts graphical sliders on maximum. Every "bone" the original game would throw you is now gone. In their place, a hollow waits to stagger you as three of his friends stunlock you to death. I'd rather go back to playing Bloodborne. By comparison Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin feels clunky, awkward, and artificially difficult. It's hard to believe this was brought to us by the same company that created Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne. This wasn't worth starting a new game for, much less paying money. Modders have already outdone this 'update' in less time, for free, and with better support. I'm disappointed with you, From Software.\n\n::EDIT::\n\nTo be fair, I have noticed this game runs better on my PC as opposed to its predecessor. I had to fiddle with graphics settings in the DX9 version, and I can have everything set to High + Resolution Oversampling and still get completely smooth performance. The combat, however, still feels slow and sluggish, especially compared to the original Dark Souls title and the new Bloodborne. 60 FPS means nothing if your character handles like he's mud wrestling. Speaking of 60 FPS, weapon degredation is positively awful as it's based on frame rate (intended for the ~30 FPS of a console) so your weapons can break in minutes on this port.\n\nChangelog:\n\n+Added pretty graphics.\n+Added Hollow Zerg Rush.\n+Added artificial difficulty.\n+Added extra snipers.\n+Added "improved netcode."\n-Removed persistant soapstone signs.

I've played both Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 for several hundred hours each. If I had the money I would buy Demon's Souls and Bloodborne too. I already gave the original Dark Souls 2 a positive review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/superlotus97/recommended/236430/\n\nHowever, I'm somewhat disappointed by the Scholar of Sin version of Dark Souls 2. The main reason is due to the ramped up difficulty. It's not too hard for me (keep your "git gud" comments to yourself), but it's harder than it needs to be.\n\nNo, I'm not going to complain about the "cash grab" that some people are moaning about. At least not directly. This is a business after all and the more profitable Dark Souls is, the more similar games we can expect in the future. For example, I was surprised to learn that Namco Bandai (publisher of Dark Souls) is also the publisher behind Lords of the Fallen.\n\nOne small thing I want to mention before getting to the main part of my review is that I had trouble getting x360ce working with my controller even though I didn't have any problems using it with Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls.\n\nAside from the graphics improvement, the item and enemy placements have changed in this new version. By doing this, they were able to make the game even harder. Why would they do this? The answer is simple. They wanted to offer something new to people who had already played through Dark Souls 2. There were many news stories about this increase in difficulty that served to generate hype for the new version (although many people would have still bought the new version even if nothing changed except the graphics).\n\nI've heard from many people who were pleased by this increase in difficulty. However, this comes at the cost of discouraging new people to the series. Dark Souls and other Souls games are already unfriendly to newcomers as it is. While I would prefer the game to be easier, I am more concerned that this is going to turn off people who try this game out as their first souls game. For those new to the series I would recommend playing the first Dark Souls which I believe is a better game overall.\n\nAside from turning off new players to the series, the increased difficulty attracts elitist fanboys that try to impose their ideals on others. This isn't as much as an issue, but it still can get annoying. One streamer I know had to switch to sub only mode during his blind playthrough of Dark Souls due to that chaos caused by random people causing trouble in chat.\n\nI have every intention of playing through this new version of Dark Souls 2 as well as the DLCs which I haven't played (and have heard they are the hardest content of any Souls game). The DLCs thankfully are unchanged although I suppose some people who have already played the DLCs will be disappointed that nothing has changed.\n\nI'm quite surprised at how many people say Dark Souls 2 is easier than the first game. About a month or two ago I went back to Dark souls 1 and finished a playthrough with a character that didn't use magic or a shield (both of which I was very dependent on when I first started playing the games). I beat most of the bosses in the second half of the game (including the first 2 DLC bosses) on my first try and I only summoned an NPC for two of those fights. So while the first game was quite challenging, the difficulty was more fair for the player compared to Dark Souls 2. I'm not a fan of the platforming challenges in Dark Souls 1, but overall I think the difficulty was handled better.","September 13, 2015","false","397.1"," 50 of 84 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","50","84","6","15"

This game fails to grasp what made dark souls so enagaging, and instead goes for the "LOL YOU DIED THIS GAMES HARD LOLOLOL DANK MEMES"\nYou are going to see a lot of references to "difficulty" in this review. This is a criticism of the games approach to difficulty, which in my opinion is the wrong way to go about making a souls game.\n\nPros\n-Beautiful game\n-Optimized to the max\n-Lore is cool and engrossing, as is per regular with souls games\n-Zero Technical complaints\n\n\nMAIN GRIPES\n-This games "difficulty" is far too reliant on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. With beginners being punished for stuff they could NOT have possibly known without prior knowledge. Dark Souls 1 was punsihing in its difficulty, yes, but it always felt fair. In Dark Souls II, there are more cheap deaths that are almost unavoidable in the first hours then there were in the entirety of Dark Souls I.\n\n-Certain changes were made to the core game in order to make the game more "difficult" The health system has been changed to take away a little of the players max health every death. This can be restored by using human effigies, which are a limited item (save for online play) that mimic the function of humanity in the first game. This is an unnessacary addition to the game, and hurts the game by making more frustrating for the sake of "difficulty"\n-More on the health system, the developers intoduced lifegems, whch are similar to the moon grass in demons souls. The introduction of another healing item, along with the nerfing of estus, what with the much slower healing time and smaller quantity from the start, RUINS the game. It creates a never ending cycle of having to buy lifegems, which you will do in lieu of levelling up because they nerfed estus so much, so then you will continually die because you have lower stats, so you will buy more life gems. The lifegem in itself is a self defeating item, and was only added to make the game more "difficult"\n\n-Every enemy with a sword/weapon, which is most of the enemies in the game, (more on that later) has a tracking overhead attack. This attack can track you until the last split second, allowing enemies to redirect and turn nearly 360 degrees in order to hit you. This is in stark contrast to the first game, where enemies could track you to a degree, but their attacks had WEIGHT, IMPACT, and MEANING. It added to the fight when you dodged out of the way from an attack, and felt the ground shake beneath your character, and had to immediately decide what your next move is.  In dark souls II, the moment is ruined as most enemies will spend the fight pirouetting around until they hit the ground, and IMMEDIATELY wind up for the next attack. The challenge of the enemies doesn't feel legit in DS2, and instead feels like a crapshoot of luck if you actually dodge the enemy attack or not. Especially with the MASSIVE hitbox issues this game has for the sake of "difficulty"\n\n\nMinor Gripes\n-Every other enemy is a dude with sword/mace/etc. Moveset variations are virtually nonexistent from most of the enemies.\n\n-What was once one difficult enemy in Dark Souls 1 is now several "difficult" enemies in Dark Souls 2. Rooms are filled with groups of enmies and the player is quickly swarmed, adding to the "difficulty"\n\n-Area/Map design is messy and feels disorganized. In DS1, most of the areas felt very precisely thought out, and were a joy to traverse. Areas in this game feel very slapdash without any real thought to the path the player will take. It feels like the priority in the levels was the best enemy placement possible in order to kill the player. Which adds to the "difficulty"\n\nI was so excited for this game, and am sorely dissapointed that i did not enjoy it.\nIf you have enevr played Dark Souls, you may find enjoyment in this game. But after playing the first game and enjoying it for its attention to detail, fair actual difficulty, and engrossing gameplay, this game feels like an absolute chore to play.\nCannot reccommend for returning souls players.\n","September 22, 2015","false","27.8"," 39 of 64 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","39","64","2","2"

The souls series is one of my favorites in gaming. I'll try to approach this review the best I can. Combining both my love for praising of the sun and with a view of the game from a non-die hard fans point of view.\n\nIn Dark Souls 2, you are an undead, forever without light, cursed with never being able to die. The game is in third person and looks wonderful as SotFS. Dx11 polishes up and makes the game look pleasing.\n\nThe sun in particular.\n\nYou're in Drangleic, and within it there are a lot of ways to die. You'll be doing that often, so might as well jump off the first cliff you see so you can get a taste of it now, rather than later.\nThis game is for the lore lovers and masochists, and at a tipping point sadists. Sometimes both.\nYou go from Bonfire to Bonfire. Fighting unique and detailed (sometimes) bosses.\n\n\nPros:\nArtwork and Locations[/h1]\nFrom the items you pick up, to the areas you explore, each one feels and looks unique. From beautiful to horrifying this game will have your eyes wandering, blinded and violated. In the best ways possible. Each place works in favor of itself.\n\nLore[/h1]\nThe story is deep. Read every item you find. Every. One. Each contains a bit of lore. Sometimes just some crafting notes, but most of the time, the weapon, item, or armor you find has a place in the world you're playing in. Some are even from the distant past. Long, long ago.. back when Gwyn, Lord of Cinder vanquished the dragons.\n\nSound and Music[/h1]\nSilence is scary. Noises are vibrant and feel nearby. While there is a score, most of the time you'll be hearing nothing. Followed by sounds of..whatever doesn't Praise the Sun. The music you will hear is usually contained within the boss battles you'll be doing. Turn your volume up.\n\nBosses and Mobs[/h1]\nEach boss is different. Each boss has it's own story. Enemies as well. A wide spectrum and ray of bosses await you. From the benevolent to the putrid, every last boss will be a remembered experience. Some you can skip but, I highly recommend you defeat them all.\n\nPvP[/h1]\nThe souls series uses an invasion and soap stone placement for PvP. Meaning, at any given moment in the game, another player may use a Cracked Red Eye Orb and attempt to invade your world. It works both ways. Another thing you're allowed to do is place a sign down, allowing others to summon you in for what would be hoped a respectable match of fisty cuffs. Sometimes this is not the case. Beware. Always.\n\nDifficulty[/h1]\nWhile difficult at first, if you take the time to learn the curve you will inevitably come to Praise the Sun. You can even fuel your addiction for praising by burning items to increase the surrounding area's difficulty.\n\nReplay Value[/h1]\nI got a lovely 64 hours in on DS2. Worth every death. After beating the game you can either clean up the area and do side quests or devote yourself to a covenant or... you can begin you're second (third) journey to Drangleic. Increasing all area's difficulty +1. Hence, often referred as NG+(+)\n\nRewarding[/h1]\nEach death is either a lesson or another key missing off your keyboard. Regardless once you've completed whatever, or whomever you're struggling on there's a sense of accomplishment. One that I haven't really felt as strongly for with any other game. It is painful, but it is rewarding and bittersweet.\n\nVoices[/h1]\nYou wont ever hear your character speak or say anything aside from their death throes and screams. Aside from that, the voice actors you will hear did a pretty decent job of fitting the characters you'll be encountering throughout the game.\n\nThe Sun[/h1]\nSelf Explanatory\n[/list]\n\nCons:\nCamera[/h1]\nWhile the camera will usually be your friend, if you ever get back into a corner or hit a particular angle: You might as well die. Nothing too major to gripe about, still worth a mention.\n\nSprites[/h1]\nIf using a bow or zooming in and you spot an enemy a long distance away, you'll notice that sprite like animation. Where the enemies look jittery and almost buggy, as if the fps surrounding them suddenly dropped to 5. This didn't happen often but when it did, it was always an un-immersive eye sore.\n[/list]\n\n\nConclusion:\nDARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin is a highly enjoyed game with a deeply embedded story, rich visuals, stunning displays and divinely disturbing music.\nI recommend this game to any and all who are willing to die, over and over. With a sweaty-palmed sense of accomplishment, this game will have you neck deep in souls and sun light.\nEither wait for a sale, or drop the money bags for the current price ($50) doesn't matter. You're dead in this world. The only thing that matters is the Sun. Praise it.\n\nPraise the Sun/Sun.\nWould Sun again.","May 13, 2015","true","63.7"," 86 of 151 people (57%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","57","86","151","32","4"

The bulk of my DS2 experience has been with Scholar, and I'm still not exactly sure why that is. Naturally we always have to play the latest edition of a game, especially if it's multiplayer-enabled. That's what everyone else does right?\n\n---------------\n\nBefore I go any further, I should point out that this review is actually the conclusion to my huge Dark Souls 2 write-up. If you absolutely positively must know what I think, then have a look:\n\nPart 1 - http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/236430\nPart 2 - http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/271942\nPart 3 - http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/271943\nPart 4 - http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/271944\n\n---------------\n\nWith that out of the way, let's focus on Scholar of the First Sin. This edition of the divisive sequel offers numerous changes to the world. Many of the areas have been made more difficult. There are now more enemies to contend with, additional NPC invaders, and exploration has seen some slight revamps. Ultimately, these changes create a "different" Dark Souls 2, and that's not necessarily better. It's still a great game, but let's focus on the specifics.\n\nThe first really noticeable change is in Heide's Tower of Flame. There are Heide Knights everywhere, and they're still sitting around. Upon defeating the Dragonrider, these lazy knights will make your life miserable. In DS2, the tower was a rather bland area, with its plethora of giants just standing around waiting for an Undead to fight. This area now all but forces co-op. Only the Dragonrider is required for progress, so you can always come back later. This change is IMO a good one. It makes the player pause and consider options.\n\nA number of other areas received enemies in places there weren't any before. I was shocked when I revisited DS2. It's practically barren by comparison. However, sometimes SotFS fills that void with Pursuer appearances. Now I liked The Pursuer the first couple times I fought him. He's a dangerous foe early on, and a pretty solid fight. When you fight him several times in a single area, he becomes that clingy weirdo you met through an online dating website. He sorta gets the hint after you leave the Lost Bastille, but then he shows up in the tutorial area and it's just... Why? Go away already!\n\nThen there is the prevalence of NPC Invaders. Early on these folks were intriguing. Now? They're just a nuisance. Claiming victory over an NPC Invader is the hollowest victory imaginable. None of these clowns are ever as good as a human opponent, but they show up frequently, hoping that you'll care. I will admit that Armourer Dennis was a hurdle, but that's because he shows up very early on (in an optional area). Everyone else is a bum that exists solely to fill space.\n\nThere are a few other enemy re-arrangements that definitely improve on the original game. That hallway of turtle knights in Forest of Fallen Giants? Replaced by a few skeletons (Praise the Sun!). There's no exploding undead rushing for you and Straid as soon as you teleport to his bonfire. Amana's Shrine is a little bit more dangerous. Aldia's Keep is busier than before, and the Dragon Shrine is really well-done. The Undead Crypt seems to have gotten a few more ghost-spawning statues. This can create some nasty pincer attacks if you let things get out of hand. Earthen Peak doesn't feel mostly abandoned and...well I think you get the idea by now.\n\nWhile I don't appreciate all of the changes Scholar brings to the table, I think that overall it's my preferred way to play Dark Souls 2. Keep in mind though that this is just my view. If you spent a long time with vanilla DS2 (100+ hours), you might not be too enthused by Scholar's changes. Then again you might also find them to be invaluable. That said, these changes also aren't substantial enough to make someone who hates DS2 turn around and love Scholar (or vice-versa).\n\n-----------------\n\nSo with not one but five(?!) reviews on the subject, I should have something significant to say about Dark Souls 2.\n\nUnfortunately I don't. My criticisms are not unique and I don't really have anything to add. There have been countless discussions about this game, and I simply wanted to see what it was all about. For what it's worth, I found the game to be very enjoyable. I suppose this is one of the faults of reading too much about a game before playing it. A good chunk of my time with Dark Souls 2 was spent confirming whether or not everyone else was right or wrong about every little aspect. I think I ran into this same issue when I played through Final Fantasy XIII. It's exactly what everyone said it was... for better and for worse.\n\nI guess I'm now supposed to say what camp I belong to. Dark Souls 1 or Dark Souls 2? My answer is... ehhh actually I'm feeling pretty exhausted. Ask me again in 10 or 100 years.","December 28, 2015","true","98.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Dark Souls 1 bosses made you go "OMG WTF IS THAT ♥♥♥♥?! IM FIGHTING THAT???" whereas Dark Souls 2 bosses make you go "Oh ok, looks like I need to defeat this guy in order to progress further". But I think I've come to a point where I feel happy that it's getting challenging because the first few hours seemed to be quite a breeze until you get to Iron Keep where you're once again getting shot by Knight Archers with overpowered arrows so big that Andy Dufresne could use it's holes as escape tunnels.\n\nI miss the "All is ♥♥♥♥" feeling in Dark Souls 1.

This game has not moved the enemies but added numerous ones to the early game levels, making it much more difficult to progress with any achievment. Would not recommend to new players. If you just want the complaint Dark souls 2 i would honestly reccoment buying Dark souls 2 and getting the DLC for a properly designed game.\n\n\nHaving over 100 hours in the original game, i wanted to download this one for the extra DLC and "updated graphics". All i got was major disappointment. I played Dark souls 1, and Dark souls 2 religiously but this game just gives me a sour taste with the series. The updated graphics is just a lighting change, to the point where if you enter an area where you cant see, you better start praying you have enough torch to get you through. Though that is not a complaint, it makes a mechanic of the game more useful.\n\nHaving just over an hour in the new game i already see what they're trying to do to players. The "Artificial Difficulty" that the souls franchise has never reigned true, it only punished for new players. An example of this would be Sens castle is dark souls 1. Punishing the player for not being observant of his surroundings. In the ORIGINAL dark souls 2, you learned how to dodge in Heides tower of flame, through the slow attacking behomeths. Which ultimately helps you with the Halberd wielding boss fight.\n\nThese two seemingly minor part of the game, set you up for the rest of Dark Souls. The first two areas in the original Dark Souls 2 were meant to teach you how to play the game through basic mechanics, but with scholar of the first sin, they threw it out the window. They implemented "Artificual Difficulty" into the game, adding numerous enemies that are unneccesary in the beginning areas.\n\nHaving only been an hour in i am discouraged to keep playing. The swarm of enemies that are unfair to the player is enourmous. With the small miny bosses "Heide Knights" roaming everywhere it's hard to work around them, or with the forest of the fallen giants, their are foot soldiers in the original dark souls 2 which are easy to manage if you play strategically, but now they replaced them all with Hollow Elite Soldiers. Not only increasing the difficult when they did this, but the sheer amount of extra enemies they inputed was phenomenal.\n\nWalking into No-Mans Wharf i was amazed by how much you needed a torch to move around. Forcing you to utilize it in that area. I have no issue with this but, No-Mans Wharf already had numerous enemies to handle while trying to light the lanturn in the middle of the levels. The reasoning of adding more is beyond me. In the original their are maybe 5 Vangarian Soldiers around with a few foot. Now theres at least 3 more and dogs that surround you so quickly you're already bleeding.\n\nTo someone who has not played a Souls game before i would not recommend this, unless they wish to use a guide to help them with horde control in a non-horde control centered game.","June 13, 2015","false","83.4"," 77 of 136 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","77","136","5","4"

Don't get me wrong, this game is good but bearing the Souls name and its status as a follow-up to a very phenomenal video game probably didn't help with the overall reception. There's just too many retreads which may make the game a bit too familiar with longtime players and a change in design philosophy believing that "more is harder" instead of "less is more" like in the first game. The changes that they've introduced gave me a polarizing reaction especially on how they handled poise and some RPG elements. If you've adored the first game's consistency and how FromSoftware made Lordran's crumbling and desolated locales look lived in, prepare to be disappointed because the kingdom of Drangleic is a hodgepodge of geography and terrain locations. I know that suspension of disbelief is a necessity when playing video games but you've got to admit that placing an iron castle surrounded by a sea of lava above a windmill is kind of silly. Simply put, Dark Souls II is a game made to punish its players and will do anything to achieve that goal instead of inviting them to a land of strafe that's inhabited by seasoned warriors and brutal monsters.\n\nThe situation's a lot different for newcomers though. If you're looking to get into the Souls series, this is a good entry point because it's more accessible than its two older brothers. A cleaner and better UI than the previous game, a more straightforward progression system, and an easier time to connect and cooperate with stronger people should get the going a lot more tolerable.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game because I enjoyed it and the difficulty is as good as ever. A lot of things didn't bode well with me but the prospect of finding new discoveries kept me playing for hours. Veterans of the Souls series might not get the same satisying experience as with the last two games, but it's still worth a try if you're meaning to test your wits once more against a cast of larger and more powerful enemies.\n\n\nAnd there you have it.","March 10","true","209.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

The truth is, I kept coming back to Dark Souls II, hoping I'd see something better in it, something that made it worthy of calling itself a sequel to one of the greatest RPGs ever made, but I never did, no matter how desperately I looked.\n\nTo make a long story (or rant in this case) short, everything you could possibly want from a Dark Souls game isn't in this. Exciting, strategic combat has been replaced. Every weapon has damn near the same speed, so PvP is entirely about trading hits and PvE is entirely about praying that the enemy you're facing doesn't start it's next combo with it's no-start-up-frames flurry. Interconnected, metroidvania style level design is replaced with straight shots, spreading out like spokes from the starting town. As for the world itself, physically believable locations, all of which could be seen from one another, are replaced with...well, you take an elevator up past a windmill and end up in a volcano.\n\nWith Dark Souls 1 already released and Dark Souls 3 weeks away (when this review was written), this isn't the kind of sequel that's going to be looked back on fondly as a standout entry in the series.

Shaders and illumination have grown extremely in quality, while textures also got an increase in quality but without having much of an impact as the new shaders/illumination have.\n-If new to Dark Souls 2, this edition has the same price as a new game (and less than the standard 60 USD mark) and comes with all 3 DLC, which many claim, and I agree, are even better than the base game (not to minimize the quality of the base game).\n-New audio touches, many of them add to immersion, while being something small, it adds to the whole experience.\n-New enemy placement: there has been many changes regarding enemy placement, in some places there are even more (thus effectively making the GAME HARDER), in others the enemies are in different spots, there are even some new variants of enemy (say, a Hollow Royal Soldier two-handing a Estoc). These changes make the game harder at points, while at the same time help veterans get some feeling of fresh-ness.\n-Maximum players online increased from 4 to 6 (3 invaders and 2 Phantoms (helpers) + the Host).\n-Better Optimization.\n-DLC keys used to access the DLC areas were blended into gameplay, being found as one plays instead of being given right away to the player once he starts playing. This makes the transition and access to the DLCs more natural and intuitive.\n-Better AI takes smarter decisions when it comes to combat and pathfinding, this paired with the fact that at many times you will be outnumbered by enemies (and take into account this version adds even more enemies) makes the game effectively harder, but not unfair.\n\nOverall, I consider this version to be better than the original Dark Souls 2, while the graphic improvements may not be that astonishing, the new illumination its beautiful enough to notice, while the textures improvements are more discrete. A recommended buy for newcomers into the series and a must-buy for fans of the Souls games for it has enough of a fresh feel.\n\nNote: the patch that original versions of the game (PC's DirectX 9, PS3 and Xbox 360 editions) doesn't contain all the things this edition has. In fact, the most important change that adds to the feel of being fresh, the new enemy placements, are exclusive to this new version, and let me tell you: they are worth it.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I have 150 hours on the original Dark Souls 2 on PC and about the same on Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition, but I have close to 10.000 hours on Dark Souls 1 and around 700 hours on Dark Souls II for PS3 (I moved to PC later).","May 5, 2015","true","118.4"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

I like it because it's insanely difficult, however this isn't difficult, this is just annoying. In Dark Souls, the reason you keep playing is because once you've beaten that insanely hard boss you really feel like you accomplished something (not something you get in video games very often). Instead of making the enemies have better AI, they took away all of your own abilities. The bosses are in no way harder, they just revamped the whole world to make you hate playing it. Dark Souls 2 base game was great, because the enemies were in smart positions and it was just fine, but this version only adds enemies with more health that do more damage than the enemies in the base game, and this may just be me, but it seems like soul drops are worse in this version.

You WILL be disappointed and upset.\n\nIf you loved Dark Souls because of it's artstyle, do not get this game. When I first walked into the Heide's Tower of Flame area I thought I had started playing a Kirby game or something.\n\nIf you loved Dark Souls because it presented a hard but fair and enjoyable challenge, do not get this game. I love Dark Souls 1 because it manages to be a single player game while at the same time presenting a really fun and decent challenge. And it did so with out relying on any cheap or annoying gimmicks. The same cannot be said for this game. It will repeatedly put you against the same dark magic spewing miniboss time and time again. Somebody in the lighting department decided huehue, DARK Souls, let's make certain areas pitch black DARK. Just to make the player use a torch lighting mechanic that adds nothing to the gameplay what so ever. You will repeatedly lose maximum health with each death that cannot be regained without using this game's equivalent of humanity (did I mention that they completely trashed the old humanity system?).\n\nFarming has been nerfed, now if you kill any enemy a certain number of times they will dissapear entirely from the game, only to return if you use and item that raises the area to the next New game level (NG+. NG++, and so on).\n\nOn the topic of health and cheap tactics, all healing has been nerfed. The estus flask heals you much slower, and the only alternative you have to it besides miracles, soul gems, heal even slower. Humanity does not exist in this game so don't even consider relying on that. Healing speed is not the only nerf the estus flask has gotten. The Kindling mechanic is gone. You now start with 1 swig in your flask and can have a maximum of 12. The upgrade process only increases it by 1 at a time. Oh, and you still have to upgrade the actual potency of your drink, that hasn't been made any easier to compensate.\n\nThe previous point is worsened by the fact that all character animations have been drastically slowed down. Did you love Dark Souls because of how smooth and fluid it's movements and controls were? Then do not buy this game. I swear my character was walking through some kind of syrup. This is somewhat lessened by adding points into the Adaptability stat (Read as, you must waste souls to level and extra stat in order to use your estus flask without moving in slow motion) but even after that the animations and recovery periods from any action are still slow.\n\nI mentioned an Adapability stat. This is not the only new stat that has been added which is nothing more than a piece of a previously present stat. Remember how nice it was that you could boost equipload and stamina at the same time? Not anymore, that has now been split into 2 stats just to force you to spend more souls in leveling. The splitting of stats has actually even forced the pvp meta up 50 or so levels. Hope you like grinding through enemies that stop respawning.\n\nIn all, Dark Souls 2 abandons things which made Dark Souls 1 great, trades fair and fun challenges for annoying and cheap ones, messes with mechanics that did not need to be chagned only to leave them worse than they started, and is overall a disappointment after playing through the masterpiece which was Dark Souls 1. Your money is much better spent on the first game, at this point I am certain that I can guarantee you will have more fun with it.","June 20, 2015","false","20.4"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","5"

It has some features in common, but the nearly perfect combat system from the first game is severely clunkier in this game. Your character has the reflexes of a piece of meatloaf, and you have to grind out stats (agility) in order to effectively dodge attacks or raise your shield quickly.\nAlso, this game lacks a sense of proportion; "challenge" in this game translates to a horde of enemies (as many as 12 rushing you at once). When the frequency of attacks coming at you (from 3 or more eager enemies) is higher than frequency with which you can dodge, you will get hit unless you are constantly backpedalling. This is a very effective, very necessary, yet very boring strategy.\nNumerous minions (sometimes respawning) make certain boss fights a bit of a dice roll, since keeping an eye on all 7 enemies and a boss at once is next to impossible. You either get lucky and the minions don't get in the way, or these minions immobilize or fatally poison you. It's as if Fromsoft ran out ideas for bosses that could present a challenge on their own. In fact, LOTS of the boss fights are crowd fights. You in an arena with 30 skeletons. Yes, actually. Also, there are two identical enemies used in two different boss fights. And boss fights revived from dark souls. Reduce, reuse, recycle.\nAnother common "challenge" is the "wall of attacks" enemy: the one that chains attacks together more frequently than the rate you can dodge (and requiring more stamina to block than you have). And because difficulty, why not put two of them in the same room so they don't get lonely? Balance is important in a souls game. Come on.\nAlso, if you thought that trying difficult areas over and over is the key to victory, eat your words. You lose 5 (10?) % of your maximum health everytime you die. You must be punished for trying. This is FUN. FUN doesn't love you. FUN demands a sacrifice (above and beyond what you PAY for this game).\nAll of these things will assault you while you trek through levels composed of differently textured concrete boxes and outdoor environments that reminescent of the Harry Potter games made in 2002 (*cough* shaded woods). It is strange how some areas of the game can be SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL AND WELL POLISHED and others can look like they were drawn in nail polish.\nThese annoying things I've complained about don't appear everywhere in the game, and it is definitely possible to enjoy several unbroken hours of this game, but dark souls II forces you to go through really tedious bull way too often.\nAnd finally, forget having estus at the beginning of the game.

There is not much about it. It is still the very same Dark Souls 2, but if you're a season veteran looking for a new challange - you might want to grab this one using your discount. If you're someone completely new to the game - you're probably going to have an absolute BLAST because not only the game has become interesting from level design POV, but it already contains all the amazing DLCs!\n\nIn a nutshell:\nCONS:\n- The graphics look sharper, but not at all better.\n- Most likely not worth the price unless you're sick like me or you are not new to the game.\n\nPROS:\n- A LOT of stuff has been revamped, reimagined and because of this THINGS ARE STARTING TO MAKE SENSE LORE-WISE! WOO-HOO! By this I mean enemy placement and item placement. Almost right off the bat the game has managed to force me to adapt anew and I kept saying something like "You guys are not supposed to be here!".

Having played a ton of RPGs, I found it difficult to put aside all the actions I had learned from playing them, and then having to start from scratch with a DS game. Once I realised how to play the game differently from all the others there was no stopping me. I had originally started with DS2 (dx9) but had hit the same roadblock. Now, having bought this version I'm ready to step in again, staff in hand and homing soul pew hovering over my sorcerer's head, living (or should I say hollowing) to fight another day.\n\nSotFS in some ways is different to the original what with enemy placements, loot locations etc. The vast majority of the changes are welcome (I'm looking at you No Man's Wharf), and I only have one or two minor grumbles to mention. I'm just hoping there isn't another Sen's Fortress type of area otherwise I might cry a little.\n\nI kind of understand the grumbles about the new version. Having said that I'm a big fan of From Software and happy to throw my money at them. I don't care if I get hate about this. We're all entitled to our own opinions.\n\nIn addition to being a fantastic game, here's a FWIW section ....\n\nGood stuff\n*Enemy placement. Having played some of the original I still had held its mental model in my head. So of course, I am having to start from scratch which is great. The game is keeping me on my hollowed toes.\n*Music. Matoi Sakuraba is amazing. I listen to the DS music a lot when not playing and hearing the music played while fighting a boss is an amazing feeling!\n*Environments. Really interesting environments with nooks and crannies to explore, secrets to find, and enemies to run away from!\n\nMinor grumbles but not game breakers\n*Coop. I love summoning and being summoned by other players as there's still that sense of jolly cooperation. I would also like the option to have my summon only available to friends too. To have the choice would be good.\n*Meaningful NPCs. Dark Souls had the endearing Solaire, whose story (for me at least) was emotional. I feel that DS2 lacks an NPC of this calibre and would love to experience that sense of 'I must help this person!' in the game. That said, I'm only 20+ hours in so maybe there is an NPC who is as endearing as our wonderful Solaire.\n*Soul memory. I just really dislike the feature. It makes me mindful of acquiring souls so I don't out-soul my friends if they are offline. Soul level would be a better indication of coop. Yes, I know there's the Agape Ring but I would still prefer the choice.\n\nIf you are new to DS2 then I am confident you will love this game. If you want tips, here are some that a DS friend told me that helped.\n\n- Slow and steady. This is my mantra when playing. Entering a new area? Turtle up, and walk forward slow and steady.\n- Try all classes. If you're unsure or finding a particular class annoying, play around with other classes until you feel comfortable with the gameplay. It took me a while to realise I love sorcery. I seriously fecking love sorcerers :D\n- It's OK to cheese. It's not cheating, it's being strategic. If you played DS, remember that knight in Undead Burgh? He can't climb ladders. Try luring it out .... :)\n- Leave/rate messages. Drangleic is a harsh and unforgiving world. Leave helpful and/or funny messages for your fellow hollows to help them on their way (ambush right, don't give up!). Also rating other players' messages will restore some of their health. You never know they might be fighting a boss when you are rating. Plus it's all in the same spirit as jolly cooperation and Solaire would be proud of you.\n\nBuy the game and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Remember you're not the only one going through the pain and torture :)\n\nMy summon name - Hala Cookie or Hala Creamcakes. Give me a hearty wave if we meet.\n\nPraise the sun!\n\nHala xxx","April 6, 2015","true","145.7"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","33","57","2","0"

(again, i am biased, but i stand by it.) very few RPGs have been able to effectively blend the single and multiplayer experience in the way the dark souls series has. you can play for hours by yourself and forget you're online and then stumble into the wrong area at the wrong time and get invaded by someone out of nowhere. the game of cat and mouse and the combat between a real life oppenent in this game is unmatched by any other out there. every kill and death online has meaning-was earned. hard fought. the fights are tense and i love it. the iron keep bridge fight clubs are a huge attraction for me. levelling up your character by testing your skills against other players in a 1 on 1 duel-it's such a blast. and i haven't even really mentioned the enemies. scholar of the first sin is filled with tons of nasty enemies that will punish you for every mistake you make. the bosses even more so. it's another thing i love about the dark souls games. it's that feeling of hitting an obstacle that seems insurmountable until you step back and looks at it, study it, and then finally, conquer it. the dark souls game, and this one especially, capture that feeling in a way no other game has. the feelings of accomplishment are always that much more meaningful when they're preceeded by tons of feelings of failure and frustration at one's own mistakes. i especially enjoyed learning each enemy's moves and attacks and learning what weapon/spell/tactic it would take to defeat them. skill has always been sufficiently rewarded in the dark souls games. and the more of it you have and the better you are at the combat mechanics, the more you are rewarded. dark souls 2: scholar of the first sin is my favorite game...i just wish i could do more than recommend it.","December 28, 2015","true","465.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

Another big bonus for dark souls 2 is the steady 60fps throughout the whole game, the game just felt soo much more better then the original where it had a 30fps cap and would drop to 15 fps in areas like blightown.\nThe level design is not as memorable as the original. You remember areas in the original like Anor Londo, Sens Fortress, Ash lake, The painted world etc. The areas in dark souls 2 are not as memorable or interesting. There are a few exceptions of course like Majula which is just beautiful and a much better main hub then firelink shrine. The world of dark souls 2 is not as connected as the original it just has branching paths from majula where in dark souls 1 every area of the game is interconnceted which each other and all link back to the main hub firelink shrine.\nThe pvp is alot better then the original because not everyone is trying to backstab you every fight and it overall just feels more better making it more fun. It took me 38 hours to beat dark souls 1 and it took me the same amount of time to beat dark souls 2 which was a funny coincidence. The crown trilogy dlc also adds more hours of fun and shows off some great level design and locations. I have to mention that beating the ancient dragon was one of the most satisfying things ever in a game.\n9/10 (Amazing)","March 31","true","38.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game is not known for having a great story. But if you follow the lore carefully is quite interesting. But we know what made Dark Souls series famous, you will die! and a lot. Some people complains it is not as hard as the first one. Maybe, maybe not. This is a game where your own skills can affect everything so much. I have seen people finishing the game without leveling without saving without using bonfires. So the community probably master this game so far. Still, this game has online, the best of it! You can co-op, you can PVP! you can do all you want wherever(or at least in most places) you want.\n\nI have been so addicted to this game that this became the first game I actually did 100% of the achievement! And I am still happy playing it!\n\nLets talk about the game itself:\n\nStory: This is not a story driven game, but the lore of this game is amazing and very interesting. You should totally see the youtube videos called "Dark Souls 2 Lore" and support if you like them.\n\nGameplay: Simply great. You know that a game is good when you have overpowered gear, a walking tank, and tiny fellow kill you with a dagger, skills and poison. The game is full of haters, cheaters, hackers etc. But most of the community play the game fair and square. Mob is not extremely hard. So some people may complain it is too easy compared to DS 1. I love the game if you want it more hard simple join the covenant of the champions and shup up!\n\nGraphics: This was supposed to have outstanding graphics. I don't think the graphics are bad, but texture are not so good. Also Dark Souls 1, with DsFix looks prettier than this. So it could be improved for sure. I think the issue is that the main core of the game was made to run in last gen consoles.\n\nAudio: I have a really nice audio setup(7.2) And when my sister came to me for something and I rested in a bonfire, she said, there is something burning. She was tricked totally. So I will give the audio a better grade than graphics.\n\nDifficulty: This game is made to be mastered. You cannot play 10 hours and dream to be "gud"(referring to the community) It is easier than DS 1 I think but just burn some aesthetic on the bonfires and voila! I like this game the wait it is.\n\nIn overall, this is currently my favorite game so far so I totally recommend it!","June 8, 2015","true","712.4"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","25","42","8","4"

By and large, they are correct - the game still looks like DS2. Models are slightly crisper, a few improved textures here and there, but NOT worth the £20.00 upgrade for the Graphics upgrade alone. The main improvement is in the Lighting department - especially under Torchlight conditions, for example in the Gutter, wherein the light is smoother, shadows are better, the whole thing stutters a lot less - it's fairly awesome in comparison.\n\nGameplay wise, it's DS2 with all the DLCs and some expanded Flavour texts. However, the developers have also shifted enemy placements, added a few new enemies and many many more NPC Phantoms, Shades and Invaders. Combine this with the new maximum of 6 players (intended for 3v3) and many 'fun' multiplayer events can happen (From Software, whichever developer decided to add the Valley Children invaders in the Black Gulch, there is a spot in hell reserved just for you. I've seen 2 players + 2 AI wiped by 2 of those guys).\n\nHowever, it all comes down to the simple fact that I was going to buy the DLCs anyway, and this version saved me a couple of Pounds and gave me a couple of boosts to boot! Excellent Value for someone in my position.\n\n\nTL;DR\n-I own DS2, but none of the DLCs\n--Worth it if you enjoyed DS2 and/or want to play all the DLCs.\n\n-I own DS2 and some/all of the DLCs\n--Probably/Definitely not worth the cost, unless you're really into the Multiplayer and want some 3v3 action.\n\n-I do not own DS2\n--You should do.

I still give it a thumbs up, because it does do it's damn hardest to capture the spirit of Dark Souls...just the wrong spirit.\n\nWhat made Dark Souls great was NOT IT'S DIFFICULTY. It was the way that difficulty communicated the world to you. It build a cohesive, narratively dense environment that communicated its history through the brutal, unrelenting, uncompromising trials you face. Its goal was to build EMPATHY in the player, for the characters and monsters of the world. You intuitively understood that the reason the bosses were so powerful is because they, in turn, had to survive in the same grim reality you do. Dark Souls wanted you to take its world seriously.\n\nDark Souls II, on the other hand, feels more like fan fiction. The land is thematically disjointed. The characters are mostly perfunctory echoes of the original game. Mechanically, the game does some things different but not in any way that enriches the experience- some design descisions seem to have been made solely to throw off series veterans. Some enemies seemed to have been made just to frustrate, with unpredictable attacks and animations that seem to hit long before you even see them coming.\n\nIt's not awful by any means. There some absolutely amazing environmental settings and there are quite a few characters that look more briliant than anything in the entire series. It just feels like a lot of independently good ideas that are held together by duct-tape rather than a unifying theme. The more I play it, the more it feels like this game misses the point.\n\nIf you played Dark Souls for the sheer challenge and deep exploration, this game is more of that- in some ways even better.\n\nBut if you loved Dark Souls for how it made you FEEL about your own life, this game is severely lacking.","February 10","true","43.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The main reason for this is that you get access to fast travel right from the start. A lot of the areas are more linear and since you can freely warp between safe zones you'll ignore most of the areas once you've travelled through them once. They lack the reasonable connectivity of the previous game too. That's not to say that there aren't any nice looking areas in this game, it's just you end up spending less time travelling through them and the immersion takes a hit. I enjoyed planning for long trips in DS1 and as a result I probably know Undead Burg better than my actual neighbourhood! (If you hated the constant back and forth in DS1, then this isn't a complaint for you!)\n\nCombat- and techwise this game is an improvement from Dark Souls, everything seems to flow and work better and there's probably even more options for building and gearing your character. Multiplayer is active as hell (even on higher levels I kept getting invaded all the time, human or hollow) and connectivity issues seem non-existent, even with the region lock off. Some in-game systems have been changed for the better and some complications have been streamlined, like now you can swap freely between covenants without penalties, or helping others in co-op heals away your "cursed" healthbar and makes you human again. You'll probably still need to consult a wiki to figure some things out or find out how many secrets you've missed.\n\nThere's a story that probably makes sense only when you connect all the dots, but then again it was similar in Dark Souls how you probably started making lore connections only after completing the game at least once. These are not games to play only for the story. DS1 and DS2 are connected only via references so it's not like you'd miss out on the plot starting with this one.\n\nNot having played Demon's Souls I can't compare to that, but while I found a lot of the designs in DS1 groundbreaking and really innovative, DS2 has more recycling going on. Most of the equipment and enemy types and even bosses seem to be brought back and instead of creative monster design about 90% of the things you fight in DS2 are humanoid armoured enemies. Less imaginative. Then again, maybe it's just that I played DS1 first?\n\nThe three expansions packed into this edition were good, they weren't over in an hour and they felt a lot more challenging than most of the stuff in the base game, the Fume Knight encounter especially. Not having played DS2 without this Scholar of the First Sin edition I couldn't really say what all the other changes/additions were, but there's more stuff now making this the best deal for newcomers. The pricing sucks if you were an early adopter but that's how it always goes with GOTY editions.\n\nWhile Dark Souls 2 is eventually more forgettable than the previous one, I still enjoyed my time through it, it is a great game. Dark Souls (1) even with some jankiness is still the most important game of this decade in my opinion, so you should complete that one first (and maybe learn something about yourself in the process). Once that's done and you still hunger for more, then Dark Souls 2 is a fine game to continue with, even if it isn't as groundbreaking. Just make sure you have lots of time, it's not a short experience.\n\nCome to think of it, Dark Souls 1/2 are kind of the original MMO experience for me, like it was 10 years ago. There's huge worlds to explore and weird monsters to encounter, you get to figure out your gear and once in a while when you're immersed some other player appears to backstab you, so you're constantly on your toes. And no subscription fees or micropayments!","July 25, 2015","true","266.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/335300/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","Disclaimer: I have put over 1k hours in Dark Souls 2, so I'll be looking at this from the perspective of someone who's experienced with the base game.\n\nDark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin is a 'remastering' of the game already released. There's new item locations, new enemy placement, and overall fixes to things that were an issue in the base game. Of course, the game does look nicer: DX11 over DX9, lighting effects are much more apparent and prettier, and a lot of the areas just look...better.\n\nFor those who have played the base game, expect some tricky encounters that may play on what you know, and do things that will surprise you. A lot of the encounters require more thought than before, and feel more entertaining to go through. However, some of the new encounters are overdone: There's a miniboss that you can fight three times in under ten minutes in one area. Some areas just increased the number of enemies there, and did nothing to really change the encounter, just threw more at you. For the most part, though, I was happy with how some fights and placements were mixed up.\n\nThe new item locations encourage different kinds of weapon use much earlier: Things such as the lance class weapons can be acquired way earlier, so you can experiment with them as you're leveling, instead of waiting until near end game to even find one.\n\nUpgrade materials are also drastically more common: Instead of being forced to stick with one weapon throughout most of the game, you can now upgrade multiple weapons at once much easier, and experiment. This is a very welcome change, as, again, more weapons are available sooner than before.\n\nNetplay is also much more interesting. You can now have one extra summon, and you can also have multiple red/grey phantoms attacking you at once. This can cause some really hectic and enjoyable multiplayer experiences. More importantly, however, Scholar had fun with the NPC summons. There's a lot more gimmick-y builds that you can summon to help, and a lot of them are very good at what they do! They're a lot more fun than the quest NPCs, that's for certain.\n\nThings I didn't like about Scholar: Boss AI is mostly unchanged: All the tricks I used in the base game still work just as well here, including AI loops. DLC areas (These are built into Scholar, by the way: You just have to find the keys!) are unchanged, and as mentioned, some of the encounters are a bit much in the wrong ways.\n\nOverall, if you are new to Dark Souls 2 and want to experience the game fresh? I highly recommend Scholar. It enhances a lot of the things from the base game, and while it still has issues, remains my favorite game in the Souls series. If you've already played the hell out of DkS2 and it's DLCs? Maybe wait for a sale, but the game changes enough so that you'll still be interested in plowing through it once more.","December 17, 2015","true","169.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It gets realy tedious having to fight them over and over. Also a lot of enemies which were non respawning originally now respawn like all other enemies. From Software have just taken a blinkered aproach to making the game harder but in my oppinion they have just made it much more tedious.\nThird main difference is the price......... they have charged us .....for a patch....... which is not worth paying for.\nIf you own the original stick with that, only consider buying this if you have not already purchased the original.","April 3, 2015","false","6.1"," 131 of 248 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","131","248","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theevilbob/recommended/335300/","theevilbob","TheEvilBob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theevilbob/","438 products in account","I've already reviewed Dark Souls II - the summary being that I didn't recommend it, but mostly because I think it's a very unpredictable thing if someone will get a kick out of frustration and failure. Not a bad game, just not something that everyone's going to like. A lore that's only hinted at in bits and some unfortunate graphics in spots only heighten this uncertainty.\n\nHowever, SotFS edition I'm just going to not recommend at all.\n\nIt doesn't do much with 64-bits? Possibly the wider register will help with some mid-powered systems but for some reason the minimum requirements have jumped up a bit. Strange since the 'updated graphics' are virtually non-existent. There are plenty of comparison shots online to browse and maybe for some people it will be compelling but it seems to be little more than a different graphical filter. By no means did they overhaul their textures, so don't expect your graphics card to be getting more of a workout.\n\nThe game balance has been ruined in favour of expanded multiplayer. This is probably a criticism that not everyone is going to agree with - I'm sure there are plenty who think it's still not hard enough. Or there are those whose sole retort will be 'get good', and bravo on their wit. But, where the difficulty had previously felt correct for the experience, there are now many places that feel like you're being strong-armed into summoning others. This new scaling has resulted in single player feeling untenable in places and, should you get 5 or 6 people together, pretty much make any encounter a joke.\n\nFinally, they've altered the location of enemies. This might be a somewhat petty complaint but they didn't just move enemy type A from location X to Z. They didn't just give A a couple of friends. They replaced enemy A with enemy E which, as far as I can tell, shouldn't be there according to the bits of lore I've seen. Sure, maybe I missed something. Maybe they just wander freely and have a movie night or something, but it feels like they're just ignoring what they want in the name of changing it up a little to justify a price tag that shouldn't have been set so high.","December 24, 2015","false","33.4"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","16","27","3","0"

And so you peer... Into the fog, in hope of answers."  The Ancient Dragon\n\n__________________________________________\n\nPreface\n\nThe Dark Souls Series is often revered as one of  the  hardest games made period. Unlike most other RPGs of modern times, Dark Souls doesn't feed players a free victory. The series will neither send you up against easy enemies meant for farming nor provide you with easy shortcuts to avoid bosses that are "impossible". The Bosses which DS2 pits you against aren't designed to be easy wins for player, but experiences to refine fighting skills and challenge the player. If you have come to this game looking for an easy win and an experience analogous to most modern RPGs, you'd best turn away here and find another game. But, if you are looking for a fresh gaming experience that will challenge your reactions, and provide a fresh take on RPGs, I cannot recommend this game enough.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nGameplay\n\nDark Souls 2 has, in my opinion, some of the best gameplay of any RPG I have ever played; both the PvP and PvE combat experiences are refined and clear.\n\nThe weapon wielding system is versatile, consisting of dual-wielding, two-handing, and even power-stancing, a game mechanism that provides weapons with a whole new attack move set. Combat mainly consists of intertwining rolling, blocking, and attacking when you are not under siege yourself. The game features a variety of weapons from Daggers to Halberds to Ultra Greatswords to Whips and, of course, shields. Overall, I would say that the combat system is not only clear and easy-to-understand, but also extremely fun.\n\nDark Souls 2 also naturally provides players with a reliable source of income (souls), which are used as both a mechanism to level up your character as well as purchase items, eliminating the need to grind enemies for basic items (although it may be necessary for levels later on in the game). In my opinion, the souls currency system is fair and provides players with a pretty good end-game curve.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nGraphics and Atmosphere\n\nThe game's setting constantly changes as one progresses through the game, placing enemies that fit thematically and visually in each environment. In the Iron Keep, a castle atop endless pools of lava, you might find Knights in plated metal armor while in the depths of the Gutter and Black Gulch, you will find rotting zombies and giant worms.\n\nScholar of the First Sin Edition (SOTFS) features new and revamped graphics, turning fights into epic battles and, if you take a minute to just look off into the distance, the settings are beautiful and detail-oriented. The level progress naturally and the layout is clear enough so as to not confuse players which way is the correct direction.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe multiplayer features of Dark Souls can really be split into 2 main categories: cooperative gameplay and PvP battles\n\nThe cooperative gameplay feature of Dark Souls 2 can be a little finicky, as there are no clearly defined summoning limits or ranges built into the game (upper and lower), but playing along with friends can make this game much more manageable in later playthroughs and harder areas. It is important to note, however, that to play with friends, the 2 players must be of a similar 'soul level', a value that is analogous to experience. All in all, though, the cooperative feature of Dark souls 2 is very fun and engaging for both parties, the summoner and the summoned.\n\nThe PvP fighting gameplay is a completely different story. The fights with other players truly are a battle of wits and skill. Who can roll at just the right time? who can get that crucial backstab during the enemy's back-swing? Although some PvP summons are involuntary and occur as a result for killing too many NPCs, the system is largely voluntary, greatly reducing possible frustration over being invaded at an inopportune time. I find the PvP feature to be  very fun, especially after clearing the area of enemies and in later points of the game where it can be hard to farm souls off of enemies.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nBosses\n\nOne of the main attractions of the Dark Souls series is the the boss fights. These fights are almost always manageable either in a solo situation or the with the NPC summons for a reliable tank.\n\nHowever, every once in a while, you will stumble upon a boss that will make you want to rip your hair out, but in a good way ( ♥♥♥♥ you, Fume Knight ). Again, it is important to note that these bosses, although frustrating, are beatable with just a little sweat, blood, and  Jolly Co-operation. The game designers somehow always walk the line between "Okay, I see you" and "I am inches away from pounding my keyboard to dust". And for that, I give DS2's game designers my utmost respect.\n__________________________________________\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn my opinion, Dark Souls 2 is one of the very best games available today. Gameplay is highly engaging, enemies are neither too easy nor impossible to fight. Even after just over 7 days-worth of gameplay, I can't get enough of this game. The re-play potential is by far one of the best I have encountered today. Although this game's mechanics  can become significantly easier with an Xbox controller, I have played every single minute of this game with just a keyboard and mouse; all it takes to adapt the game is a little time in the keybind menu. In summation, I cannot recommend this game enough; The boss fights are rewarding and extremely interactive, the multiplayer features are expansive enough to be interesting on a multitude of levels, and, best of all, I can always rely on it for a great time when I just want to play a straight-forward game: Kill and don't die. Now man up and buy the game already, Hollow!","March 7","true","201.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I can understand the mentality behind not wanting to get it again if you already have the game, which is fair. However, the allure this has in comparison to non SOTFS is this: Content.\n\nStep back and ignore the whole DX11 fiasco and focus on the content of DS2 and DS2:SOTFS.\n\nIf you're knew to purchasing DS2, this is the edition to go for. Comes packaged with all DLC. Clean. No mess.\n\nAlready have DS2? Then I'll elaborate.\nSOTFS adds a lot to the baseline experience. Enemy placements where they make sense. (Seriously, Heide's tower of flame with no Heide knights BEFORE SOTFS? Fromsoft pls. Now the place actually has them.) As Bracketed, one such example will be the heide knight placement changes and how they act. Ignoring the cathedral of blue path, going along the normal path to the dragonrider has multiple heide knights giving not a care in the world about you prattling on about your daily business - Until you kill the dragonrider. After killing the big red man, they stand to roam about, seeking to screw your merry day up with multiple perforating stab wounds. Oh, there's also now a guardian dragon by the bridge to blue cathedral. Guardian. Dragon. Low levels. Hellkite Drake anyone?\n\nGraphics: personally, I can't tell much of a difference between the graphics of DS2 and DS2:SOTFS. I'm much more focused on not, say, loosing various organs to the NPC's or invaders. I like my innards where they are. Inside. I digress, the lighting changes are much more immersive than DS2. Gets dark: Truly dark, when entering basement areas or areas with little light reaching it in the first place. Small, minor changes can make the experience much more fluid.\n\nOnline: I haven't had ANY trouble online. Faster matchmaking. More phantoms. More chaos. Lack of blue-bro PvP sadly. I like being blue. Everything I see is blue.\n\nOverall rating? Probably an 8/10.","May 7, 2015","true","129.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I see friends get scared off by this series' reputation, which is a shame, because it's one of the best series in gaming and DSII in particular is an incredibly rewarding game.\n\nI would recommend bringing a controller.","May 25","true","153.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The main Dark Souls mechanics are there, but a lot of other things are pretty different.\n\nIt\'s a pretty common opinion that DS2 is the weakest of the series, and with its shortcomings I can see why people say that. In fact, the very fact that Iron Keep exists makes this game the weakest for me.\n\nNeither DS1 nor DS3 ever made me say \"omg ♥♥♥ this game\" but DS2 made me say it twice. DS1 and 3 levels could be learned and mastered such that you could traverse most of them without taking as much as a single hit. DS2 levels... not so much. In Iron Keep, there\'s no way to get to the boss without fighting at least 5 enemies. Some of the enemies in Iron Keep are even shoved in narrow hallways such that you can\'t even swing your sword while you die, or crowded onto narrow bridges such that they push you off with a single hit and kill you. This kind of enemy placement never occurs in 1/3 so it\'s very frustrating when combined with the fact that many actions that were invincible in 1/3 (opening doors, passing through fog gates) are no longer so. It feels like instead of intelligently placing enemies such that they could be avoided with a proper strategy, they\'ve just been increased in quantity so that they can\'t be avoided at all.\n\nThat being said, it does some things way better than 1/3, namely replay value. Dark Souls 3 has a notably bad NG+ system, where enemies simply gain more health and damage. In DS2, going NG+ will change enemy locations, give bosses new gimmicks, and is generally full of surprises. On top of this, there is the bonfire ascetic mechanic to NG+ an area at any point during the game.\n\nSo I would say that this game did a lot of things better than the Miyazaki Souls titles, but overall it will cause more needless frustration than the others in the series. When you die in DS1/3, you nod your head and know exactly what you did wrong. When you die in DS2, sometimes it\'s not even your fault, and that\'s what gives this game its rep.\n\nOverall worthwhile game, but know what you\'re getting into if you expect something like DS3.\n\nAlso I don\'t know why all the NPCs have a stick up their bums. I find the blacksmith\'s house key and he just tells me to gtfo when I give him business???","June 1","true","23.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

One example of this are the Heide Knights, now for those of you who haven't played the game, these are enemies designed to be fought 1 on 1, they also don't ever attack you first and when they die they do not respawn, so obviously, they are really hard and take decent timing and skill to kill. What did they do with them? They turned them into respawning enemies. They made them aggressive. THEY PUT -LOTS- OF THEM IN A SMALL AREA. THEY ALSO PUT THEM IN WITH -GROUPS- OF HUGE MACE/SWORD WIELDING KNIGHTS.\nSo far it feels nothing but cheap whenever I die as it's huge groups of enemies that kill me. There's no fun in learning enemy patterns because you're fighting 5 of them and any opening can't be taken advantage of or you'' get bashed around by 4/5 other enemies and die.\nIt becomes a waiting game, see how long you can run in circles without attacking and not get bored.\n\nThe graphics are a huge letdown in comparison to the modded DX9 version where if you take enough time, you can tweak it exactly to your liking and you can do so much more with it.\n\nThe only decent thing i've seen so far is that they restored dialogue that they had removed from NPC for no reason.\nThe dialogue that they added back in was vital to the story with one NPC, she now tells you to "Seek the king" and so much more, which actually gives you a direction and a reason to wander around Drangleic.\nThis could have been patched in without costing us money.\n\nAll I can say is that they obviously released an earlier version of the game in the first place in order to sell us a patched version further down the line.","April 4, 2015","false","178.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

To clarify, Scholar of the First Sin is the remastered version of the original game. It comes with all the DLC bundled, as well as having some minor changes to the game itself. This review will first cover the game itself, and then the enhancements added by Scholar of the First Sin.\n\nAs a disclaimer I am a huge Dark Souls fan; I had already played Dark Souls I & II on Xbox 360 before playing this.\n\nMAIN GAME:\nThis is a fantastic game. It is easily one of my favorite games of all time. Artistically, it differs slightly from the first Dark Souls; the first game is more gritty and realistic, this one is more fantastical and surreal. But both games are a masterpiece in their own right. The core gameplay elements are pretty much the same as the first Dark Souls, so returning players will feel at home.\n\nPros:\n+Epic plot that subtly builds as the game progresses. While this game is not very "story based" in the most traditional sense (cutscenes, dialogue, etc.) it has an overwhelming amount of story and lore hidden away in the game. People who liked Lord of the Rings for all the excess lore that the series had hidden away will love Dark Souls.\n+Excellent characters. This game is mostly a lonely game where the main character travels and fights without speaking to anyone. But whenever you meet an npc they are almost always an interesting character. Like in Dark Souls I, the player will slowly understand more of the story as they reach new places and meet npcs.\n+Artistically beautiful game. This game takes advantage of atmosphere to make important moments in the story leave a greater impression on the player. The setting always feels new and unique in different areas. The most important plot moments are always highlighted by a setting desgined to create a specific look and feel. This game tells a story with few words, and that is its most impressive quality.\n+Addictive gameplay. I found Dark Souls II to be even more addicting than Dark Souls I. And I was pretty addicted to Dark Souls I. The gameplay follows a simple system where the player can either block with a shield or dodge by rolling. Doing either of these actions or pressing the attack button consumes stamina. This simple system makes for unexpectedly deep battles. Positioning the character in relation to the enemy is crucial, because the player has to plan where the best spot is to deal with different attacks.\n+Loads of hidden weapons and armor, with reinforcements and elemental infusions available.\n+The silly ragdoll physics in the first Dark Souls where dead bodies stick to you and can be kicked around like a soccer ball have been removed.\n+Even more extensive multiplayer than the first game. Lots of covenants available. Summoning and invasions galore. You can also play the game cooperatively or alone, like in the first game.\n+Extreme amount of replayability. I have never played any game series with as high replayability as Dark Souls (both I & II). There are secret areas to explore. There are loads of hidden weapons/armor sets. There are hidden, optional bosses. There is an extensive array of background lore and plot detail. Most importantly, there is New Game plus, ++, +++, and so on. The game will keep growing more difficult with each replay all the way through the seventh replay, and the player keeps all their equipment and leveling each time. But that isn't even the beginning of the replay value. One of the most impressive things about this series is that each weapon type has a whole different strategy. You can go longsword, greatsword, ultra greatsword, katana, spear, rapier, halberd, scimitar, curved greatsword, hammer, great hammer and lots of other things. You can also learn any of the four supernatural skills: pyromancy, miracles, magic and dark. Depending on what you choose, you may have to level the character differently, and your strategy/play style will have to change. This game has the power to take over your life. Be warned.\n+Brutally difficult, yet manages to be fun despite this.\n+If an enemy drops an item when they die, it shows up right away. In Dark Souls I, it wouldn't show up until their death animation had fully ended, so for every single enemy you had to wait and watch them die to see if you would get an item or not.\n+One of the trademarks of the Dark Souls series is that the multiplayer elements are fully integrated into the story. In most games, if you want to do multiplayer of any kind, you select an option for it in the game menu. In Dark Souls, the single player and multiplayer are integrated into a single experience. Multiplayer elements are activated by finding in-game items that have to be used in special ways to invade "other worlds" or perform summons. When I played Dark Souls I for the first time, the game's whole multiplayer element was a mystery that I had to discover the workings of while playing.\n+You have some options to reallocate your characters' levels if you screw them up, unlike in Dark Souls I.\n+The DLC is fantastic. If you liked the main game it's definitely worth purchasing.\n\nCons:\nThis game is a masterpiece. There are no cons.\n\nSCHOLAR OF THE FIRST SIN UPGRADE:\nAs far as the upgrade goes, I personally was very pleased with it. The biggest benefit is the graphics, but there were also some gameplay changes.\n\nPros:\n+Graphics upgrade. I am coming from the Xbox 360 version of the game, and I was absolutely blown away by the upgraded graphics. So beautiful... *sheds tear*\n+Bundled DLC. The DLC in this game is fantastic. It is gorgeous to look at and as epic as the main story. No Dark Souls II fan should go without playing this DLC, even if they don't play the remastered version.\n+Gameplay updates. So I am listing this as a pro, but it will really be up to the player to decide if they appreciate the changes. Originally, I didn't like that they changed the original game, because in my opinion the game was already perfect. But after playing it I can say I was pleased with almost every change they made. Here's some of the biggest changes:\n***The Ring of Life Protection can no longer be abused by repairing them at the blacksmith upon every death. Not only are less of them available, but repairing them costs some exhorbitant price. Repairing them upon every death is no longer practical. I think this is a great change. I don't think abusing the ring is in the spirit of the game.\n***Lots of enemy spawns have been adjusted. Some of the adjustments are artistic (e.g. having the Heide Knights actually appear around Heide's Tower of Flame, rather than scattered across the world) and some of them are for gameplay. Also, there were a couple parts in the original game where suddenly the non-boss enemies got extremely difficult. For me one example of this was the enemies you fight leading up to the giant old dragon that gives you the ashen mist heart. Another example would be an area before the third bonfire in the Shrine of Amana where there were just way too many enemies. These parts have actually been made easier.\n***The keys to the DLC areas have to be found rather than just magically appearing in your inventory.\n***In No-Man's Wharf, you can actually kick a bridge over in the area right before boarding the ghost ship, so that you get a shortcut to the bonfire. Maybe I missed it before, but I didn't see this in the original Dark Souls II. I was thrilled to see this, because without that shortcut available the pressure to kill the boss on attempt one is pretty high.\n\nCons:\n-You cannot use your save data from the original Dark Souls II.\n\nIn the end, if you have never played Dark Souls II, I strongly recommend purchasing Scholar of the First Sin over the original edition, especially if you liked Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. If you already played the original Dark Souls II, then it depends on how much you like the original game.","October 20, 2015","true","46.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Consistent with Dark souls, you will die... alot. However, you will not want to stop trying, as the satisfaction outweighs your rage. Although, it is fair to say that the bosses in Dark Souls II are easier than Dark Souls. The hardest part will be to actually get there.\n\nJust like the original Dark Souls, you will be thrown into a world with nothing to guide you. You are to become the next monarch of a cursed world. Along with the enchanting Emerald Herald, you will have to seek large and powerful souls. The rest is for you the find out by yourself. Needless to say, people who like digging into the lore and theories will surely love all the beautifully complex stories that this world has to tell.\n\nPros:\n- Great combat\n- Nice build possibilities.\n- Hexes are a nice addition to Magi oriented people.\n- Online gameplay is amazing (Co-Op and PVP)\n- Complex lore\n- Great voice acting.\n\nCons:\n- Bosses are much easier than Dark Souls.\n- FInal boss is underwhelming.\n- Minor bugs here and there.\n- Some covenants ( online alliances ) are somewhat useless compared to others.\n\n","February 22","true","33.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Those new to the Souls (Demon's, Dark) games, this is my recommended to start with.  The Scholar of the First Sin version brought some new twists due to new enemy placement, which was enjoyable after having beaten the vanilla version several times.\n\nThe Souls games are the best there is to offer for Action RPGs between the skillful combat, leveling system, puzzle and challenge, interesting twist on multiplayer, interesting and epic world, and the quality and quantity of content.  While not to say other games aren't good, they can certainly pale in comparison--I already felt the Elder Scrolls lost something after Morrowind, so except for the excellent SureAI conversions (Nehrim, Enderal), I have even less desire to go play such.\n\nI highly recommend this game and the other Souls (no, no need to play them in order, and yes, I think they have successively gotten better but are all excellent).","May 5","true","45.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Things like ledges and vertical space are better used in the form of sniper enemies and mages you can take out to make an encounter easier beforehand, enemy types are also utilized better, better use of level design like that enhances the game and makes it feel like Miyazaki Souls, even though it isn't.\nThe world space is the same, but this remake utilizes it MUCH better. Veterans of the original one I think will be amazed at how the changes affect the game for the better, and how easier it is to make varied builds with important items being accessible earlier (Dull Ember comes to mind, as well as some weapons like the Greatsword).\n\nThe way they integrate DLC into the world also makes it feel like it was always there from the start, not addons, which is great.\n\nThe lighting is much better and more natural looking now, the strong orange glow is gone from daytime areas replaced with a more natural looking sunlight look, and dark areas have more contrast to them (the torch is needed in some areas if it's your first time exploring it, too bad we veterans already know their layout so we don't get this benefit).\n\nThere are also multiplayer improvements, with 6 player active multiplayer and "pools of blood" packing multiple bloodstain deaths into one (very amusing if you check the ones near pits).\n\nOverall, this is the DS2 that should have been in the first place. Are you willing to put the upgrade asking price to experience what you should have gotten in the first place? You decide, but if you're a newcomer then don't even think about getting the old version, get this one.\nAnd if you own the old version but not the Season Pass, it's also a no-brainer since it's only $5 more than the DLC on its own.\n\nGreat redesign of the game, I'm certain this version will be the one leaving its legacy over the years, as this is what DS2 should have been considering its circumstances.","April 3, 2015","true","15.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pretentiouswutangratz/recommended/335300/","pretentiouswutangratz","Me","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pretentiouswutangratz/","182 products in account","It's a decent, robust dungeon crawler with lots of equipment, spells, 4 schools of magic, and lots of content, but I can't help but feel disappointed by it, because it simply can't live up to the wonderful experience that was Dark Souls I, thanks to its poor, often overly linear level design, poorly thought-out world (both in terms of level placement, and the lore of the world), and idiotic, polarising mechanics changes that happened for no reason.\n\nIn terms of how it stacks up against the original Dark Souls II, it's slightly better. Scholar of The First Sin, however, has been criticised too much for the shady business practices behind it, and too unfairly lauded much more than it deserved, when it came to its design changes; and people ignore glaring design flaws that would be criticised to no end in other games. For example, the Pursuer, an early boss in the game, is supposed to pursue the undead, so Scholar of the First Sin opts to place him all about the world. An interesting idea, yeah, but every single Pursuer encounter has the exact same moveset, exact same weapon, and exact same basic arena (that being a large circular or rectangular plane). Other changes, too, like the Heide Knights (an obviously unfair enemy; being able to break out of your combos and instantly lash out for huge damage, encouraging the player to game the system with ranged tactics) appearing in Heide, or the Fragrant Branch of Yore system being much more heavily engrained result in some even more utterly unforgiveable situations; it is literally possible to get stuck in the Lost Bastille, and forced to kill yourself, if you use a certain Fragrant Branch. Needless to say, the level design may visit some interesting locales and vistas, but the actual layout of the levels themselves, and the movement engine, too, is on-par with amateur projects in Unity, even if it is a slight improvement over vanilla DS2.\n\nSpeaking of amateur projects, Dark Souls II's enemies and bosses are also utterly uninspired and game-y. The Old Iron King is a giant, Diablo-like torso, which you fight in a wasteland of lava, and it shoots fire lasers out of its hand. Dark Souls even tackled a similar concept with one of its bosses, but it was executed far better, given a genuinely tragic and sad backstory, and some interesting behaviours, and strangely enough, the Old Iron King is just as bad, gameplay-wise, as its Dark Souls I counterpart. There are also plenty of polarising mechanical changes. Combat in Dark Souls II may seem faster to inexperienced players, but in reality, pretty much every player action in combat has been artificially slowed down; you now chug estus at a leisurely, insanely slow rate, regenerate stamina at a "I've never done cardio in my life" rate, and many movesets have been changed to be slower. Dark Souls II is poorly designed, however, and paradoxically, the enemies still seem to be designed for Dark Souls I; the Drakekeepers in a later area have nearly infinite stamina; the Lost Sinner has nearly infinite stamina, very little recovery time, and the ability to exploit low invincibility frames if the lights are turned off, and many enemies like the Manikins resort to running up to the player and flailing wildly, and these enemies are often placed in groups. All of this enemy placement just feels restrictive and cheap, whereas previous games never heavily encouraged the player to use spells, or ranged weapons, Dark Souls II seems to be constantly rewarding players who do this, while extending a middle finger to those who don't by throwing cheap, objectively unfair things at players, like invaders, i.e human NPC enemies, that have stats too ridiculous for any human player to ever get.\n\nMy biggest problem with DS2, and SoTFS, though, is that it has no soul. Dark Souls and Demon's Souls respectively were great experiences which will stay with me for years to come; and their atmospheres, worlds, and challenges all cultivated games which really resonated with a lot of people, but most indicting thing I can say about DS2, is that it's "just another game".\n\nThe truth is that Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is a fairly good dungeon crawler, which ironically has many fewer design flaws than your average, run-of-the-mill modern games, and one with lots of areas, and countless weapons, spells and armour sets to experiment with, and there's a lot to see,  and there are some stand-out bosses and areas; and the DLC areas in particular have some spectacular bosses (and two utterly ♥♥♥♥♥ bosses), and there is certainly lots of great design work to see in Dark Souls II, but there's too much to hinder the enjoyment of most people who really appreciated Dark Souls I.\n\nPersonally, I recommend that you start with another game in the series, or that, if you've just completed Dark Souls I, you go back and play Demon's Souls; a game which is well-designed, fair, and pays attention to more important details and atmosphere.","July 16, 2015","true","188.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaramelFrappe/recommended/335300/","CaramelFrappe","Caramel Frappe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaramelFrappe/","56 products in account","I admit, it wasn't really cool when From Software decided to charge people $60 for a game that already existed, except they changed things around / the improved edition add on. However for those who already owned Dark Souls 2, got a huge discount and only had to pay $19.99 instead to upgrade their game.\n\nI'm just pointing that out before giving this game the actual review, because although I am a huge fanboy of Dark Souls, I won't be biased and ignore the bullcrap stunt From Software pulled. With that said, let's begin shall we?\n\nDifference between Dark Souls II and Scholar of the First Sin\nI feel it's highly important to point out what the differences are. After playing a good 120+ hours on this game, trying out different builds and getting 100% achievements for this version... it's safe to say I know the major differences are, between the first version and this one.\n\nEnemy placement is the biggest one that comes to mind. A huge portion if not every enemy type in the game is placed at different locations, so despite the locations / zones haven't changed, the enemy locations have dramatically changed. For the most part, this is a positive thing because some rough areas are now easier in this area. At the same time, one or two zones have became unfair or highly annoying to fight through but otherwise it's for the best.\n\nStory / characters haven't changed all that much. You'll run into them in different areas now, and their AI have improved so you'll not see Lucatiel fall to her death anymore (or as often now). Sad to see From Software didn't try improving the story or plot, let alone the elements that makes Dark Souls II insuperiror to the first Dark Souls game.\n\nWhen you purchase this version, you get all the DLCs for Dark Souls II with it in a bundle. But rather than being given the keys right off the bat- you have to explore the world and find them. Two of them are hard to find, while one you pick up along the way without trying. I must advise, if you do the DLCs ... wait till you've beaten the game first. But don't go into NG+ either because it'll make the DLCs all the harder unless you want a bigger challenge.\n\nWhen you enter NG+ ... more red phantoms to fight and this 'Forlorn' invader will likely invade you at random. No matter how many times you've beaten him, he has the chance of invading you at some point again in your travels. While it is annoying, you do get certain NPC loot which wasn't there in Dark Souls II's first version. Speaking of invasions, you are likely to have more co-op signs / invasions occur because the servers have improved vastly. I hardly have trouble finding online players because the connection is solid.\n\nImproved graphics, which isn't saying much. While it does look better than the first version of Dark Souls II ... it isn't breath taking in the leap. I dare say I didn't really notice until certain areas lit up the place. Apart from the lightning and details standing out more, graphics didn't get that much of an upgrade.\n\nSecret Final Boss at the end after meeting certain requirements. But this is a fail of a boss, not fun nor challenging. Heck this optional boss doesn't offer you souls nor an item drop. It's to basically unlock a 2nd ending, which still sucks on par with the first ending (did I mention the endings to this game blow?)\n\nHidetaka Miyazaki did not take part in this game, just as he wasn't involved with Dark Souls II. This is also why people feel the game's story / plot / characters aren't as immersive as Dark Soul's cast.\n\nTweaks to the spells, weapons, cost of items, improved item descriptions, range of co-op soul memory works, and more are all present. They're minor in the end so it isn't going to make me give it more points since it's kind of expected for a company to update their game in favor of the players.\nLooking into the game itself, the gameplay is solid, replayability has always been a strong point in the Dark Souls series, bosses are fun (too many are humanoids though, and a few are not memorable in the slightest), characters / stories are weak, PvP is really addicting to take part in, mechanics have dramatically improved in comparison with the first Dark Souls game, and the DLCs are entirely worth completing for they offer a lot of rich content.\n\nIs Scholar of the First Sin Worth It?\nFor $60 ...? No, i'd rather stick with the first Dark Souls II game. While this is better than the first version, I don't believe it's worth buying it as another game entirely. Is it worth getting for $20 if you already own Dark Souls II? Yes, I agree that is a legit price. Deep inside, I want this to be a free upgrade to those who bought their game, but From Software decided their biggest patch was worth charging people money.\n\nDark Souls 2: SotFS as a GAME gets a 8 / 10 score from me, because the game as a whole is freaken great.\n\nSotFS Edition gets a 5 / 10 ... not enough content added to Dark Souls 2 to consider it a whole new game. In fact i'd go for a 4 out of 10 if it wasn't for the enemy placement and tweaks being such a huge impact to the experience. I again feel it's worth it, ONLY if you already own Dark Souls 2. Otherwise don't bother unless you really want a Dark Souls 2 game but at this point, i'd wait for Dark Souls III to come out this April 16th.","December 12, 2015","true","214.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's had many improvements, but it also suffers from many steps back.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are much improved.\n- More weapons, armors, spells... Variety!\n- Customization! You can reroll your stats now using a semi-rare item!\n- Co-op is enhanced. More coventants to co-op, more "revive" items to allow co-op. Who doesn't like friends?\n\nCons:\n- Level design... It's nowhere near as intricate and interconnected as DkS1 or even Demon's Souls (or Bloodborne for that matter). It's quite a shame. The transitions from zone to zone is bland and unnatural. The levels feel like game levels as opposed to a large believable dark fantasy world.\n- Controls... They are much more "floaty" and there is an ever so slight delay between input and action. It makes the combat feel much more clunky than DarkSouls1. And the change in controls for 2H weapons is very annoying to me personally. I preferred the lock on targeting in DkS1, but in DkS2 you will swing the direction you are facing, regardless of lock-on. While this in theory offers more flexability, it also leaves you open to easy errors and swinging at air instead of your intended target. Walking backwards and suddenly want to swing infront of you? You need to stop walking for a split second before you swing, or else you'll just swing behing you, missing your enemy, and leaving you WIDE WIDE open to get shanked. There's no option to turn this on or off, which is frustrating.\n- Story. While it has a lot of backstory and lore bits to be found if you really want to dig, the overall story as it's presented tends to fall flat -- lacking likeable characters and leaving a lot of things unexplained, even moreso than DarkSouls1, which is saying a lot. This is a controversial con, but I stand by it as my opinion.\n- Bosses. Can you say reskin? There are repeat bosses... Quite a few. Looking at you Smelter Demon, the most obvious of them all. And most of the bosses are generic humanoid of some sort. In this crazy world of Dark Souls, I expected more creativity and variety in the boss encounters.\n\nPros AND Cons(Flip a coin):\n- More PvP. This can be good and bad depending on your feelings about PvP. You can be invaded at any time, no matter how dead or hollowed you are. Are you online? Yes? Prepare to be invaded.\n- More online interaction in general, especially with covenants. While this can be GREAT for day 1, month 1, or even up to month 6, eventually people will stop playing this title online. This will result in a lot of the games content being effectively locked away from you. Do you want to rank up in this coventant to reap the rewards it offers? You can't, because there's no one to invade or co-op with, and you need invasion wins or co-op wins to recieve tokens to present to your covenant... Oh well... I guess I can never, ever get it...\n\nOVERALL; TLDR;\nGood game. Recommended. Flawed, but fun, if it doesn't make you rage.","November 29, 2015","true","85.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If this is representative of the rest of the game then I'm disappointed I purchased this, even though I didn't have the DLC before.\n\nTurtle knights are placed in front of doorways they can't fit through.\nHeide Knights all over the Tower of Flame have monstrously screwed-up pathing (after you kill dragon rider and they all go hostile.) They run all over the place like idiot robots, which was perfectly fine in the nicely constructed original spawns but doesn't work at all there. Half the time they just fall off a ledge.\n\nI think the fact that you can still path-glitch the dragon rider is worth a mention too. I like free souls but, seriously?\n\nCrowds of fodder-soldiers have a tendency to simply bum-rush you rather than wait for opportune moments, like they did when they were intelligently placed in the original...\n\nAnd this is just an hour or so into the game... not even, likely. I don't mind that I can't really farm tower because i bugged the dragonrider and now Heide knights are going nuts (as deprived facing a bunch of those plus big guys at the same time in those little areas is a bit much for me at the moment.) But getting to the last giant is WAY easier. Did they lower the HP of turtle knights? My unupgraded mace, which I barely have the STR for, takes them in three hits! What's the point of placing them everywhere if they're going to be more fodder?!\n\nThe original game had mostly intelligent placement that really kept you on edge even on the third playthrough. This... looks like some dude got really excited with all the big armored guys and couldn't stop placing them in areas he thought would really disappoint players.\n\nGood job.\n\n*Review Update 12-29-15\nHaving now gone through the entire game, plus some of the Sunken King DLC, I can say that the dev update to positioning is absolutely horrible.\n\nSome areas are easier, some are ridiculously harder (and I mean ridiculous - I don't mind hard, but unfair is too far.)\nSome notable stupid placements (like they didn't test them at all) are the desert sorceress on the balcony in harvest valley, shooting fireballs down at you without any way to hit back until you make it up there. Manikens also in harvest valley are just everywhere, and you can't see them until they stab you in the back because they're out of sight on top of rafters.\nDark Souls is supposed to be about intelligently taking in your surroundings and training yourself to notice where enemies are. That's why the maniken jumps down the ladder when you get close, so you have time to react! The new maniken placements don't give you any time to react. They're like cheap horror-film shock value.\n\nThat's only a few of many. The increased threat makes small areas like the Iron Keep laughable. Where enemies once forced you to go in cautiously and engage them in close quarters, now they all just sprint towards you from half the map away which allows you to take them easily one by one whereever you choose.\n\nAnd there are just mobs of enemies which makes dexterous, intelligent, play harder while the big sword and board nub wielders are rewarded for their flailing.\n\nAll in all, if you don't have the DLC then maybe this is, or was, a good purchase. Of course at this point you're probably better off waiting for DS3, which has the original developer back on board.\nBut if you have the DLC then just stick with the original. There's no reason to put yourself through some poorly designed areas when you have good ones already.","April 10, 2015","false","91.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

The increased difficulty that the game trumpeted is nothing more than more enemies with higher stats.

Some NPCs and items have also been moved such as Sublime Bone Dust and Lucatiel of Mirrah. The changes keep things relatively fresh while playing and there's a lot of little touches that change the ambience for the better.\n\nThe new enemy placements can feel a little overwhelming at first but that is usually remedied by playing smart. That said, I was somewhat disappointed in the purported "graphics enhancements." The game still does not feature the real time ambient lighting that its early demos showcase. From what I have played so far I'd say the changes are worth $20. If you're currently spending time wishing that Sony would grace us with Bloodborne then I'd advise you to go ahead and grab Scholar of the First Sin.","April 2, 2015","true","14.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But after I did, I would say it is one of my favourite games of all times. I was hoping I'd get the same (or better) experience with DS2, however this was not the case. Let me explain my reasons and go from least to most important:\n\n1. The graphical improvements are really small. DS1 with DSFix looks almost as good as DS2. And while the game never dropped below 60FPS (which is nice of course), they accomplished this with some very noticable tricks, like reducing animation quality of enemies which are far away.\n\n2. The online components of the game have been improved, which is good. However now you can be invaded even when you're hollow. I find this really annoying. I want to see the player messages and bloodstains, which can sometimes help you if you're lost, without beeing invaded every minute in certain places, by peoply who are farming new players.\n\n3. The changes to the health system and weapon durabilty are really frustrating. Everytime you die you're health bar decreases. This can only be reverted if you use a human effigy, of which you have only a limited amount unlike in DS1. Your weapons durabilty goes down a lot faster, and while the durabilty resets at bonfires, it's really annoying, especially when you're trying to explore a new area.\n\n4. The combat is in my opinion feels clunkier. The game feels less responsive than DS1 and I can't really pinpoint why exactly. In DS1 it was possible to go through the game with a low level character if you knew what you were doing. But in DS2 even at Level 120 I didn't really feel that strong. Maybe I leveled the wrong stats. I don't know...\n\n5. DS1 had a much larger variety of enemies. You had bugs, hydras, demons, crow people, blobs of goo, rats, cats, drakes, walking shells, ghosts, mushrooms, etc. In DS2 you have dudes in armour, and then some more dudes in armour. In DS1 it felt like every area had very specific enemies that were unique and would exist only in that specific area. They were also much more visually intereseting.\n\n6. Increasing the difficulty by just increasing the number of enemies is lazy and boring. It seems like the dev team didn't understand the best thing about DS1. While DS1 had some annoying areas it was for the most part fair and if you were carefull, you could avoid being killed by a pack of enemies. In some places DS2 throws over 8 enemies at you at the same time. And it feels like someone is saying: look at how difficult the game is. It's a real challenge, isn't it?\n\n7. The last two points also apply to the boss fights. The boss design this time seems really unispired compared to DS1. The boss fights in DS2 were made more difficult by throwing multiple opponents at you and adding annoying mobs. This is probably the biggest let down for me. I normally avoid fantasy RPGs because I don't like the setting. But DS1 drew me in, because the enemy design was so creative and weird and so awesome overall. Some enemies are even reused from DS1.\n\n\nIn the end I have to say that DS2 is by no means a bad game but it hasn't really imroved the PvE, lore or visual design in comparison to DS1. On the technical side it's a better PC port than DS1, but with DSFix DS1 isn't really that much worse. In the end I have no interest in playing this game a second time with a different character. Whereas I started a new character with a different focus in DS1, as soon as i finished my 1st play-through and would probably play it again if I had the time.\nI hope that DS3 will be better.\n","February 15","false","74.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Amazingly all the other installments are too, i.e. Demon's Souls.\nI've played all the souls games by now, and here's my thoughts on the rest.\n\nDemon's Souls - Best entry in the series, everything is viable, fun. Go buy it, it's like 10-5 on the PS3 store.\nBloodborne - My personal favorite, rich atmosphere and lore. The best, fastest, and most action paced combat in the series.\nDark Souls 1 - I haven't beaten it yet, but I'm willing to join the chorus and say it's better than it's next installment.\nDark Souls 2 - Just because I rated it poorly doesn't mean I am done with the game, i'm still going to go back and play it. But compared to it's previous installments (Demon's Souls and Bloodborne counts damn it.) It's just not very good, the worst.Closing thoughts, buy the rest of the series starting with Demon's Souls.

The first section of this review will be for people that have never played a "From Software" game before and the other section will focus on the controversy surrounding this remastered version\n\nIt`s difficult but when you start to come around at the fourth boss or so and get the hang of it`s gameplay mechanics, Dark Souls 2 will drag you into the world and keep you immersed for months. The world is rich with story and detail. The difficulty is always fair and when you finally take down that difficult enemy you have been analyzing for hours you get that satisfaction only DS can give you. From an RPG standpoint the leveling , gear, weapons, dialoug...basically everything is done with such class and confidence that it will be hard to find anything flawed. I know I sound like a fanboy but when a game comes around and gives me a whole new perspective of how I play and enjoy video games. you know it`s something special.\n\nEven if you`re scared of the difficulty I promise you it will be worth it, if you give it time. I too was hesitant about playing Dark Souls in general but oh my how glad I am I did.\n\nNow for the package itself. I do think it`s in general a bad idea to release a remaster in the timespan of less than 2 years. It`s a cash-in, although it was primarily made for the PS4/Xbox One users who got a terrible last gen version of this game. They will certainly experience a much bigger difference in both graphics and performance.\n\nOn the PC, the graphical upgrade is nice but DS2 already looked good to begin with. Only noticable change I can see at the moment is the lighting which has improved and actually gives the torch some purpose. With that said. DO NOT buy this remaster for the graphics alone. Not worth it!\n\nAnother controversial topic has been the splitting of the community and I do agree that it was a pretty ♥♥♥♥ move on Namco`s behalf. This needs to stop. On console it`s fine but on PC it`s different. There are no performance differences between the versions which makes the server split pointless. Alot of my friends have the original DS2 and I can`t play with them simply because of this travesty.\n\nScholar of the First Sin does come with all the DLC`s which I highly recommend. Go with the cheaper upgrade version for DS2 so that you can have the great Crown of Kings trilogy, if you haven`t played DS2 yet this is the perfect time. The best version by far , but not worth it if you have finished DS2 and the DLC before hand.\n\n\n9/10","April 5, 2015","true","58.3"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

(+)\n1) You get access to the other two blacksmiths much faster. Ornifex, with the Shadow Woods route opening up earlier, and Bastille's whatshisname, with the Dull Ember located in a less fuky position.\n2) Less explodymummies! This includes Grave of Saints, Lost Bastille and Dragon Aerie (there's actually more there, but the whole area becomes skippable).\n3) More summons to really break boss AI.\n4) The thing that looked like a shortcut in No-Man's Wharf, is now actually a shortcut.\n\nThen there's things that they just changed for no real reason. (-)\n1) The area where the non-boss Pursuer appears first time has hollows scattered around (and other places too with many extra fodder enemies for no good reason).\n2) There's a firebreath spamming dragon before Ornstein, with the actual Ornstein fight still being pis easy.\n3) More of those non-lock-on-able invisible enemies that are almost impossible to hit with certain weapons (spears etc).\n4) They lessened the damage you do with Lightning Spears, AND you only have a third of their uses. While still giving the option to buy them an unlimited amount. So for high Faith and Attunement characters, they're still very much spammable, but crippled under 50 Faith characters.\n\nAnd then there's things they still haven't changed\n1) Enemies with weird turntable-y attack tracking (all of them), or attacks connecting before the attack (Gutter dogs), or animation not correspoding what they're actually doing (hollow soldiers attacking with the shield WHILE also guarding with it somehow).\n2) Heavy weapons not tracking. They had it right for the DLC weapons, why is Greatsword still messed up?\n3) Shrine of Amana.\n4) Not enough materials.\n\nOverall it's a better game, not by much, but I recommend it over the original.","July 31, 2015","true","144.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game was dripping with atmosphere, spectacular world design, interesting characters with heart touching stories, and tight gameplay with some interesting online features. Now this review isn't for Dark Souls, this is for Dark Souls II: Scholar of The First Sin. Scholar of The First Sin of SoTFS is a re-release of Dark Souls II which was released in April 2014 (For PC.)  The game introduced improved graphics and gameplay, a new world to explore with new enemies and new weapons to fight them with. So here is my opinion on Dark Souls II: Scholar of The First Sin.\n\nStory:The Story in Dark Souls II is about you, an undead who has ventured into Drangleic to find a cure for you undead affliction. I won't continue on as this would spoil the game and chances are; if you're reading this review you have no played the game yet. The story is interesting, and not directly told to the player. One of the greatest part of any souls game is the way the story is presented; the story is hidden in item descriptions and in dialogue with the NPC's. The Dark Souls community has done a great job of uncovering the lore and story of the game.\n\nGameplay:The gameplay in Dark Souls II is a great improvement on the first game. The movement is made to feel much more fluent and easier to control, the combat is dramatically improved. Dual wielding is now much more viable in the game as dual wielding makes much more sense; R1 and R2 will use the object in your right hand and L1 and L2 will use the object in your left hand, a new power stance feature has been added to the game. The power stance feature allows for a player to activate a whole new move set exclusive to a set of weapons. The way this works is by holding Triangle or Y on the controller when two of the same weapons are equipped. Magic and ranged weapons have been improved by allowing the user to move when using them. One major issue that I have with the game is that the difficulty feels forced, the main way the games attempts to make things difficult is by just throwing more enemies at you. Upon death you are reverted to a hallow; this means you are unable to summon other player to assist you and the players maximum health is lowered, this is rubbish gameplay in my opinion as it negates the desire to explore the world. The player’s maximum health can be restored with the use of a humane effigy but these items are finite if playing offline. One huge downside is that a controller is highly recommended to play. This is due to the poor control scheme that has been implemented into the game. I use a Dualshock 4 controller to play Dark Souls.\n\nCharacters:The characters in Dark Souls 2 are not really all that interesting. The characters lack what made the characters in Dark Souls 2 likeable; the characters in Dark Souls 1 were interesting and had motives of their own. The characters in Dark Souls 2 are boring, for lack of a better term. The emerald herald is the closest thing to an interesting character but she has the personality of toast.\n\nOnline Features:The game uses online features in unique ways; players are able to leave notes on the group which other player are able to see, this would be helpful if 99% of the messages did not say “try tongue, but hole.” Bloodstains show how another player has died, usually warning players of a dangerous area. Ghost are able to be seen at times, these are other players in their own world. The multiplayer works like this: You are able to summon or be summoned into the world to assist in defeating the environments boss. Upon doing this the player is rewarded with souls and human effigies. A player is also able to invade another player’s world and fight them in an honourable dual, or a not so honourable 1 vs 3. The online gameplay is quite fun but isn’t required to complete the game.\n\nEnvironment:This is where I have one of my biggest problems with the game, the world is often bland and makes no sense. In one instance you are at a windmill surrounded by barren wasteland; you beat the boss of the area and continue onwards. You take an elevator upwards and find yourself at a castle made of iron; the castle has sunken into the ground reaching lava. This makes no sense and ruins the player immersion. Dark Souls handled the environments of the game so much better as the world was beautiful to look at with great landscapes to look at. The whole world loops back in on itself creating all these short cuts which just give the game an overall fantastic feeling to it. Dark Souls II is nothing like this as most areas will end in a dead end forcing you to fast travel elsewhere and take a different path.  While the DLC has improved on this and provided much more interesting locations the rest of the game is still a disappointment with much to be desired.\n\nConclusion:Dark Souls II: Scholar of The First Sin is an amazing game with fun and challenging gameplay, the story is interesting and the online gameplay is very pleasant.  Although I recommend that you play Dark Souls before Dark Souls II: Scholar of The First Sin. You will have a much more enjoyable time with that game, but I am not saying that this game isn’t worth your money. If you enjoyed Dark Souls then this game is worth your money, even if it leaves much to be desired.\n\nShould you buy Dark Souls II: Scholar of The First Sin?\n\nYes, yes you should.","October 6, 2015","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They took what was amazing about Dark Souls and added a more fluid (yet, still difficult) combat. I had a gripe at the begging of the game with instant warp on bonfires, but it is definitely needed because the map is so large. The secrets, lore, enemies, NPCs and overall atmosphere in this game (and Dark Souls frachise as a whole) are what made Dark Souls into my favorite action-adventure franchise, ever. I recommend Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 to any body who likes Zelda, Skyrim or even Kingdom Hearts. I recommend this franchise to people who enjoy old Turn-based Rpgs like Final Fantasy and Legend of Dragoon. I, also, recommend Dark Souls, as a whole, to any one who wants a challenge because this game doesn't hold hands.","March 17","true","83.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Scholars is also a very good game but there are many things that just don't work right. It feels too easy in some locations, while it feels pretty unfair in others. Many locations feel unbalanced compared to their setup in the original.\n\nThere are some nifty additions there that just don't work. For example placing an enemy on an elevator that should trigger the floorplate to make it move again to surprise the player from behind. Most of the time the enemy doesnt trigger the floorplate. Some other times the enemy leaves the elevator but gets stuck. Enemies get stuck in many places or their pathfinding bugs out.\n\nIs it worth buying the same game again? You will have to start from scratch, because you can't just import existing characters from the original game. You have to unlock all the achievements again of which some where a real challenge (at least for me, King Vendrick for example). I think only hardcore Dark Souls 2 fans should buy this new edition of Dark Souls 2.","January 17","true","58.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It also ♥♥♥♥s with the lore of the first dark Souls, which I love, it's nicely implemented and to experience the lore is just awesome. The lore this game has to offer is not quite as good and it's not quite the same way you experience it + there are some things that just dont make sense in any way.\n\nBut it still has quite good gameplay, the only thing that bothers me are areas being hard because of the number of enemies, not because of the strength of one enemy. It's also a bit too easy in my eyes but the Crown-areas offer some  harder stuff, although the level- and gamedesign overall in these 3 parts of the game suck huge ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt at least has not as many bugs / glitches as dark souls 1, there are some, but they don't occur that often, nor d they really impact the game\n\n\nLong story short, if you liked Dark Souls 1 because of it's gameplay alone, Dark Souls 2 SOTFS should be a good game to buy for you","January 4","true","89.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VESTAE/recommended/335300/","VESTAE","VES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VESTAE/","239 products in account","A very good game that is at times overshadowed by the success of Dark Souls 1 and marred by some questionable design choices. Excellent for its replay value, player agency and multiplayer interactions. Also a perfect PC port with excellent performance, in contrast to its predecessor.\n\nDark Souls 2 introduced a lot of improvements to the series that are often overlooked. The weapon upgrade system is no longer so obtuse that it punishes players that don't read guides. The implementation of weapons is excellent and eschews the fairly pointless slow attacks that were present in the first game (ie: black knight sword R2). Movement and control as a whole feels very smooth and has been improved to the point that DS1 actually feels somewhat unrefined by comparison.\n\nPerhaps the most important improvement is the sheer volume of this game. Compared to DS1 there are more weapons, armor sets, rings (and ring slots), spells, and the areas are longer and more numerous. All of these factors contribute to greater replayability and more rewarding experiences in multiplayer. In my experience the limit of ten character slots is not nearly enough for the immense value you can get out of this game. An online community that often prioritises fashion over utility speaks volumes of the creativity of the Dark Souls 2 player base and the game itself.\n\nThe overall experience is somewhat inconsistent in terms of presentation and quality. At its best Scholar of the First Sin is visually impressive, but still retains the lacking appearance of some areas such the Shaded Woods and Earthen Peak. Many areas of this game lack the detail present in other Souls games. Rather than presenting a location that people are supposed to have lived in, many areas  consist of featureless rooms and hallways with varying placements of items and enemies. The lack of small details detract from the overall believability of the world, which is undoubtedly a significant part of the series. The music is also a mixed bag, ranging from the greatly thought provoking and compelling to the uninspired and generic.\n\nThere are some other issues with the game. The enemies often ignore the rules placed on human players, such as stamina and poise. Defining a 'fair challenge' can be difficult when you are expected to fight enemies many times your size, but these instances are a simple lack of internal consistency, which makes the game feel cheap and unrewarding. Conversely many bosses are far too easy to overcome, such as the Covetous Demon or Giant Lord. Unfortunately in Scholar of the First Sin almost any area that could be considered a challenge has at least one overpowered NPC summon available to trivialize the area. The addition of an NPC white phantom to Belfry Sol, a PVP area without a boss, is lamentably stupid.\n\nDespite the many criticisms I could list about balance and design this is still an excellent game. When I got all of the achievements I thought I had seen everything and was done. As it happens I could enjoy over a hundred more hours playing this game. There is always a new weapon to try out, a new character you can make, an enemy attack you've probably never seen before and endless multiplayer elements to enjoy. Even though it appears that Dark Souls 3 will be great improvement for the series, I will look back on this game fondly.","April 7","true","359.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Helias/recommended/335300/","Helias","Black Puppet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Helias/","222 products in account","I will keep this as short as I can so everyone can just go through it. Infact I will only mention the points that I think have a real bad impact on this game. This review has nothing to do with gameplay or bossfights or anything. So If you want to inform yourself about that: Go to a different review.\n\n(I want to add that I actually like this game alot. Its quite good even though it doesnt reach DS1 of course. It hurts me to say this about the game as It does take away from the goodnes it should present you)\n\nSo what do I want to say? The game is good but the community is rather ♥♥♥♥. I mean this doesnt mean that you cant meet nice people. There alot. Just that the bad apples cover about 85% of the damn tree.\n\nNow here is why I say this:\n\nThe games concept is known and easy to understand.\n\nYou as the player have three ways of playing the game. Singleplayer, Coop, PVP.\n\nSinglerplayer mainly requires you, leveling your character which can get boring.\n\nCoop means that you can summon other people for jolly cooperation.\n\nPVP however is the big bad of these three styles.\n\nNormaly PVP is known to be just good old fighting. Some do it with honor and bow and have a skillfull fight and some rather try the sneaky approach to kill you when you expect it the least. Absolutly fine.\n\nWhat isnt fine however is the amount of people abusing what the game gave them to basically always win. And this has nothing to do with cheating or hacking. It also doesnt have to do with your level or soulmemory.\n\nThis is about using weapons or armor, hexes or miracles to an extent that you have an unfair advantage over the other player. Like using the spampier (Rapier Spam) on heavy armored people to just stunlock them into submission until they die. Or using Hexes that one hit kill you if you dont roll away fast enough. And even if you do you get instakilled by the next attack.\n\n\n\nThe next thing about this whole thing goes to the forums. I have been on both game forums for about 4 times. And every time I did regret going there. Once I had a simple discussion about what people think to be the better game and why. Another time I asked what they would think would be the best system in DS3 for Matchmaking. In both cases I have stated my opinion which was: 1. I like DS2 more over DS1 because of the graphics, places and Weapons. 2. I thought that a combination of both systems would be the best.\n\nIn both cases it did not take long for the people to run in and ruin my post. A literal ♥♥♥♥♥torm within seconds.\n\nSo what does that mean? Is the game bad now? No. Its decent. Not as good as DS1 but still good and enjoyable to play. IN COOP. Just dont complain about anything on the forums or have a suggestion to make things better. Also git gud and be a havelchipmunk.\n\nNo in all seriousnes: The game is good but the community of this game is utter ♥♥♥♥♥. You can find nice people that you can play with, have found a few myself, but if you find 10 nice people you will find 10000 bad people. PVP has been ruined because of this community and its mentality.","December 6, 2015","true","406.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The secrets, lore, enemies, NPCs and overall atmosphere in this game (and Dark Souls frachise as a whole) are what made Dark Souls into my favorite action-adventure franchise, ever. I recommend Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2 to any body who likes Zelda, Skyrim or even Kingdom Hearts.

Playing Dark Souls 1 makes me happy. This game, meh. To repeat a phrase for the 10000th time, this game is good, but it pales in comparison to Dark Souls 1.\n\nI can play DS1 sober, drunk, happy, or sad, wakeful, tired, and always find a way to have fun. But in this game, some stuff is just douchey, some stuff a chore, but there are some enjoyable pieces if you stick around. For instance, looting and fashion souls are the highlights of this game. Also performs very well, being lag free on a good PC, with flawless multiplayer connection.

Overall the game runs at a nice framerate and the graphics improvements are a nice sidepoint to the game's already beautiful atmosphere. The "up" on the difficulty meter that has been reported by players and Fromsoft themselves is really just an overexaggerated explanation for the increased spawn rate of mobs in most parts of the game, however it feels better compared to the original release. The change in mob locations as well as the change of mobs in general is a refreshing feel to the game and can overall feel like a completely different game. The online is still filled with hackers, unfortunately I can't 1v1 someone without him going 200mph or backstabbing me across the map and teleporting me into the lava in the Iron Keep.\n\n-Pros\nGame runs smoothly.\nMobs like to overwhelm you and make you feel like a 2 year old like the good ol'days.\nGraphic Improvements appeal to the sense.\n\n-Cons\nPrepare to Die.\nPvP is completely balanced and there are no hackers ever.\nBosses cheese the living hell out of you.\n\nVerdict: Great Game, Souls Fan 10/10 would buy again.","August 3, 2015","true","055.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even I fall victim to that when I decide to stay somewhere for hours farming items that are SUPPOSED to make the game even harder than it already is, and it's not even very hard for me.\n\nThis game (Still not sure WHAT the differences are between normal DS2 and SotFS are) is incredibly beautiful. Sometimes, I like to remove the HUD and just take screenshots of the amazing sceney and sights all around the game. But, with about a year of rebalancing gameplay and graphics and all that, this is supposed to run and look so much better than the original DS2, with so much more story, too. But that's aside the point:\n\nIt's incredibly beautiful, marvelously realistic, and, in EVERY way, incredible. It's magical. In meaning and pure essence, the story this game tells of is crazy deep. It's one of those games that can just...change your perception of life, and/or gaming in absolute general. FromSoftware didn't take long to get noticed with their first Souls game for the PS3, Demon's Souls. My own soul was instantly bought by them when I tried the game myself, and I've been a doofus fan ever since.\nAGAIN, off topic :/\n\nIf you're just not patient, and want to rush through this game, RUSHING WILL GET YOU NOWHERE. THE GAME GETS HARDER AND HARDER THE MORE YOU DIE. YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING (as the opening cutscene basically tells you. But great reward awaits you with every single thing you do in the game. Seriously...\n\nIf you're new to Dark Souls 2, and at this point in time [unless it goes on sale here again], I suggest you buy it on a console. It's cheaper, and, on the next generation consoles, will support MUCH better graphics and flow, resulting in MUCH more efficient gameplay. The requirements for playing the game on a PC aren't too strict. Many reviews mention how smoothly the game presents itself on their PCs. Same goes for mine, and my laptop is about average when it comes to gaming, I'd like to think.\n\nImmense satisfaction awaits. If you've never even tried a Souls game, Go ahead and get a taste of Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition and have all that nice extra stuff included (which I still don't know what's different about. These games can be very enjoyable if you watch yourself and take the game seriously at every moment. I want to see more players love this game instead of hate it.","July 23, 2015","true","36.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Dark Souls 2 seems to be the ugly cow in the farm mostly do to the fact that the original game director was busy with Bloodborne. Well, I must say that is not an issue and the team responsible for making this game did a great job. In the presentation department, the world seems fuller. Also, there are more npcs this time around that breath life into the world. Story, while still vague, is presented in better fashion than the previous game and as you explore along, some areas really depict a believable history in the World of Drangleic. Giants, fallen kings, betryal, war, humanity. The world has rich lore and it's sold pretty well, if you look for it.\n\nCombat feels smooth, new animations look good and are varied. It's a bit slower though and character feels heavier when performing certain animations which I don't prefer but it's not a big issue. Had problems with the lock-on not locking on when I wanted to nor changing targets which is annoying but it can be managed.\n\nThe biggest downside for me is in the boss battles. There are more this time around but they have been stripped down and eased up from previous game. Most of the bossess designs seem unespired and only a few stood out. It does not compare to the Original game where every boss was memorable. While some would be easy but they where still impactfull. Here, not so much.\n\nOn a lighter note, I have to give MAYOR props for the guys who optimized and configured this game. Game runs really smooth and in the highest settings. The original Dark Souls suffered from mayor frame rate drops and I experienced the same in Dark Souls 3 even on lowest settings. Goes to show that the team behind this game, did a great job without the direction of "THE BIG MAN."\n\nTo conclude, the game is great regardless of some minor let downs. Pvp is an improvement. A number of areas where desgined as battle arenas for online play and serve as interesting playgrounds. Some areas are challenging to traverse like Iron Keep and the game changes tone as the game goes on. The world may not be the masterful design the Original was but, it's still a world worth exploring with some amazing set pieces. Also. all three chunks of dlc are superb and challenging. Great stuff here.","May 22","true","55.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaxar/recommended/335300/","jaxar","Jaxar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaxar/","553 products in account","A belated review for Dark Souls II. I actually played this originally on the PS3 (got the platinum for it too) and loved it, before picking it up for a second time on PC. Dark Souls II unfairly received a lot of flak for not being produced by Miyazaki, but the 'Team B' crew still did a fantastic job.\n\nI loved the locations. You had your fire and ice settings, along with very green, very dark settings, and then some almost blind areas (Shaded Woods) which were quite enjoyable to travel through. The overall world layout could have been done better as some of it didn't quite make sense. For example travelling up from Harvest Valley to the lava filled area of Iron Keep doesn't make any sense geographically.\n\nThe new Adaptability stat was an odd inclusion. It seemed quite unnecessary, with most players getting it to 20 and then forgetting about it.\n\nMagic was really well done, with sorcery, faith, pyro and dark magic all being totally viable playstyle options. Faith did take some heavy nerfs later on which was a shame, but to be fair it was probably a little OP at launch, with Lightning Spears able to take out most mobs and bosses quite easily.\n\nThe network side of things was really solid. I have almost zero issues with summoning other players or being summoned myself. I was definitely not a fan of the new Souls Memory mechanic. I think it did more harm than good with it really limiting how much co-op you could do before being out of range of other players.\n\nThe three DLC's were all absolutely excellent, definitely worth the asking price. All of them had brilliantly crafted levels with lots of shortcuts and secrets to unlock, and all had some really well designed and very challenging bosses.\n\nAnyway Dark Souls II is a solid addition to the series and highly recommended. Not as good as the first Dark Souls IMO but still very much worth a play.\n\n\n","June 5","true","73.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If any of those things you don't have, then just get a better game. If it's a Wii, Monster Hunter is the closest thing to this. PS4 has Bloodborne which has fair enemy placement, but still contain the brutal difficulty. PS Vita or 3DS also both have Monster Hunter. PC have tons of games like this that don't require you to own a Xbox or an Xbox controller for no reason. After looking up stuff on this game since it originally came out, I would think someone would have pointed this out somewhere. Just want to make sure you know before your purchase and please don't look through any of the rant if you don't think it's necessary to see why this is so bad.\n\nI was expecting a $40 game willing to have a rerelease for $10 extra to run so smoothly on a $2000 computer with horrible, barely change-able control mapping, delay on only the buttons that matter(Attack, dodge, jump, ect.) to get so much praise on PC. This game is basically unplayable. It should never have gotten a cash grab rerelease just because its spiritual sequel did so well. I want to like this game because it looks like a more exillerating version of Monster Hunter, while still staying generally easy. If I could play this game without the jump glitch existing, I could probably suggest this someone with patience for the controls on this "broken" game. I'm sorry to all who love this franchise, but this game is a waste to anyone who doesn't own an Xbox controller. That fixes the mapping problem, but it still stands that the game won't even input some controls that matter rightaway. This was a redone version of the game that could have been done with a patch, and yet it still doesn't work properly on computer. <--That should not be a problem on a PC game even when it's a port. Sorry to offend anyone with a super computer and access to an Xbox controller used for more than a single game, but this is the worst game I've ver played on a computer and it's because of how badly it misses its reputation instead of reaches it.\n\nThis is the bottom of the rant. If you are here from reading through it you were either interested in why this game is so bad, or you have the nerve of defending it after I stated my restrictions on what you need to enjoy this well planned, but poorly ported game.","April 11, 2015","false","71.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is amazing. Despite what all the people who want to whine about it and suckle at Miyazaki's (the director of Dark Souls 1 and Demon Souls before it) ♥♥♥♥ as the greatest thing to ever happen to game creation, this game is absolutly awesome. ESPECIALLY the newest Scholar of the First Sin edition. As it fixes nearly all the problems with vanilla DS2. Many also do not know the story as to why the original version was moderatly poor and the DLC so good. The director of DS2 suddenly left one day and never came back partway through production and near the end of their timetable so they pulled one of the head guys off of Bloodborne to finish DS2. He did the best he could with the resources and time he had left. Then he was in charge of the DLC from start to finish. See where this is going? After being put in charge the DLC turned out amazing. Enter Scholar of the First Sin. Put in charge of this edition our savior rebuilt the game from the ground up. And while he obviously couldn't just change every little thing he made it into an absolutly AMAZING rework. Moving enemies to places they make sense being, making farming items not the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥♥, and just overall taking everything I originally had complaints about in the vanilla game and brought it up to the DLC standard. If you have never played DS2 dont bother with the original. Get this version. If you were dissapointed with DS2, pick this up on sale and give it another try! If you still enjoyed the original for what it was, grab this version and you will feel like you entered into some magical new game plus version right from the start.","December 15, 2015","true","98.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

There is also a new random NPC invader called Forlorn that will periodically invade you throughout your journey and the Pursuer will now attack you in new surprising locations as well.\n\nOther than that, however, you're basically paying an upgrade fee for very little differences.\n\nNevertheless, it's perfect for those who do not own the original DS2.

If any of those things you don't have, then just get a better game. If it's a Wii, Monster Hunter is the closest thing to this. PS4 has Bloodborne which has fair enemy placement, but still contain the brutal difficulty. PS Vita or 3DS also both have Monster Hunter. PC have tons of games like this that don't require you to own a Xbox or an Xbox controller for no reason. After looking up stuff on this game since it originally came out, I would think someone would have pointed this out somewhere. Just want to make sure you know before your purchase and please don't look through any of the rant if you don't think it's necessary to see why this is so bad.\n\nI was expecting a $40 game willing to have a rerelease for $10 extra to run so smoothly on a $2000 computer with horrible, barely change-able control mapping, delay on only the buttons that matter(Attack, dodge, jump, ect.) to get so much praise on PC. This game is basically unplayable. It should never have gotten a cash grab rerelease just because its spiritual sequel did so well. I want to like this game because it looks like a more exillerating version of Monster Hunter, while still staying generally easy. If I could play this game without the jump glitch existing, I could probably suggest this someone with patience for the controls on this "broken" game. I'm sorry to all who love this franchise, but this game is a waste to anyone who doesn't own an Xbox controller. That fixes the mapping problem, but it still stands that the game won't even input some controls that matter rightaway. This was a redone version of the game that could have been done with a patch, and yet it still doesn't work properly on computer. <--That should not be a problem on a PC game even when it's a port. Sorry to offend anyone with a super computer and access to an Xbox controller used for more than a single game, but this is the worst game I've ver played on a computer and it's because of how badly it misses its reputation instead of reaches it.\n\nThis is the bottom of the rant. If you are here from reading through it you were either interested in why this game is so bad, or you have the nerve of defending it after I stated my restrictions on what you need to enjoy this well planned, but poorly ported game.","April 11, 2015","false","71.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/recommended/335300/","MonikaWeiss","Monika "I.Q." Weiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/","149 products in account","It was about an hour in, once we reached Heide’s Tower of Flame, when we realised that Scholar Of The First Sin is exactly what we wanted it to be. Essentially a rejig of the GamesMaster Game Of The Year 2014 winner we know and love, this current-gen re-release does much more than simply serve up the PC version’s visuals with the stellar DLC collection.\nAlongside such admirable feats, Scholar also manages to force those who have passed through the corridors, caves and climes of Drangleic hundreds of times to rethink their approaches. It forces us, basically, to sheath our cоcksure trail blazing and raise our shields in sweet trepidation once more. It does so with admirable, minutely architectured and always surprising design.\nTake the aforementioned Heide’s Tower. Previously this area was home to hulking, bearded statue types, whose attacks would carve vast swathes of the air around them to get at you. We mastered these chaps through hours of failed attempts. We know when to pull them, when to roll, when to backpedal and when to get our hits in. Here in Scholar, these enemies are augmented by the Heide Knights themselves.\nThese white-clad warriors sit passively until they are attacked, at which point they’ll harangue you with lightning-fast swipes and hard-to-read strikes. You’ll need to measure up whether you want to take on these guys or leave them sitting forlorn as you muscle through the rest of the area. Of course, there’s always the risk that one of the wide-ranging strikes of your hairier foes will tap one of them and trigger their aggression… It’s a wonderfully Soulsian balance of risk versus reward.\nAnd - naturally, knowing FromSoft’s ways by now - there’s an extra twist to this game of will-you-won’t-you. Best the area boss and suddenly, laden with his tasty souls as you are, all of the Heide Knights you left behind will awaken and chase you across the map. A masterful touch that will have you both agape and legging it to the nearest bonfire. You may have bested the area, but whenever you head back to journey through it again it’ll be more dangerous than ever. This happens again and again as you venture through this reborn Drangleic. We’ve picked an area near the start of the game to focus on here, as we don’t want to spoil the surprises that lie in wait beyond.\nPerhaps a little less surprising is that Dark Souls 2 on current-gen outstrips its last-gen counterpart at almost every turn. The most immediately appreciable factor is that frame rate. At 60fps it’s silky smooth, so much so that we actually found ourselves having to slightly alter the speed at which we played. The character models and environments are generally a lot crisper now, too, with minute details, such as the embossed covering of a Twin Dragon Greatshield or the leathery dimples on your wanderer coat really popping out.\nIt’s not all perfect, however. Certain enemies, we noticed, still have jarring frame rate drops when they’re far away from your character. The boars that charge about near the Brightstone Cove bonfire in Tseldora, for example, will jitter about when more than a few paces away. Also some areas, such as the Shaded Woods, don’t really benefit from the new visual crisp-ification. Remember when Silent Hill 2 got remade in HD and suddenly that horrible fog wasn’t quite as foggy? A similar thing happens here and enemies that were once invisible, and therefore terrifying, are now clear to see, taking away their hold on us somewhat.\nBefore you start shaking your head, let’s reel it in. On Dark Souls 2’s initial launch last year a horde of gamers took to the interwebs to rail against a lighting feature which was apparently removed from the final game, yet had been shown off pre-release. It’s back. In Scholar you’ll find yourself entering areas which are jet black without torchlight to guide you. Whereas once these flaming brands were used sparingly, at least until the second DLC pack, now you’ll find yourself praising the sun every time you pick up a Flame Butterfly, a newly essential item used to light a torch without trailing back to a sconce or bonfire.\nThis new lighting system means that there are, on occasions, entirely different techniques required when approaching certain areas. Where once you would cut through a tight corridor with caution thrown to the wind, now you’ll have to use all your senses to pick up sounds of movement beyond your torchflame or the slight indication that there’s something waiting in the darkness.\nIt can be nail-ruining stuff, especially as many of the enemies you wouldn’t normally meet until later in the game now get up in your grill much, much earlier. Heck, one enemy you come across in the Shaded Woods can’t usually be spotted until you’ve restarted in New Game+ in the original version.\nWe admit it's a tired term, but the word ‘definitive’ really does apply to this version of Dark Souls 2. Is this the best place for newcomers to get involved? Yes. Many of the graphical foibles that we forgave in the original version have now been ironed out. Is it worth veterans unsheathing their greatswords once more? Yes. The returning lighting system and artfully re-placed enemy encounters ensure you can tap into that sense of discovery, foreboding and mastery that was once so prevalent and has since become rote.\nWe kept thinking of Fallout and Skyrim when we we’re playing Scholar. You know how sometimes when you’ve played those games for a while you feel like starting over from scratch? You can drop all of your inventory off at a house, or even load a new game and just walk in another direction to see what’s there. In Dark Souls it’s your own experience that gives your character most of its power, rather than arbitrary numbers attached to gear found on the way. You can’t lose all of that knowledge; you’re stuck with it. By releasing this version, FromSoft has allowed players a chance to truly rediscover one of the most involving game worlds in existence. And that is quite something to behold.","September 19, 2015","true","123.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

This game is amazing. Despite what all the people who want to whine about it and suckle at Miyazaki's (the director of Dark Souls 1 and Demon Souls before it) ♥♥♥♥ as the greatest thing to ever happen to game creation, this game is absolutly awesome. ESPECIALLY the newest Scholar of the First Sin edition. As it fixes nearly all the problems with vanilla DS2. Many also do not know the story as to why the original version was moderatly poor and the DLC so good. The director of DS2 suddenly left one day and never came back partway through production and near the end of their timetable so they pulled one of the head guys off of Bloodborne to finish DS2. He did the best he could with the resources and time he had left. Then he was in charge of the DLC from start to finish. See where this is going? After being put in charge the DLC turned out amazing. Enter Scholar of the First Sin. Put in charge of this edition our savior rebuilt the game from the ground up. And while he obviously couldn't just change every little thing he made it into an absolutly AMAZING rework. Moving enemies to places they make sense being, making farming items not the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥♥, and just overall taking everything I originally had complaints about in the vanilla game and brought it up to the DLC standard. If you have never played DS2 dont bother with the original. Get this version. If you were dissapointed with DS2, pick this up on sale and give it another try! If you still enjoyed the original for what it was, grab this version and you will feel like you entered into some magical new game plus version right from the start.","December 15, 2015","true","98.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pivotgod/recommended/335300/","pivotgod","kakyoin-kun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pivotgod/","89 products in account","Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is the new and improved version of Dark Souls II. Being the successor to Dark Souls, one would be correct in expecting an excellent game with refined mechanics, excellent world building and exquisite boss fights. Dark Souls II delivers in its PvP and online matchmaking mechanics, but pales in comparison to Dark Souls' PvE and world building.\n\nThe overall layout of Dark Souls II's world is incoherent and a lot of times does not make any sense whatsoever. You go from a poison ridden mining field, up an elevator to "Generic Lava Level #23." The levels themselves don't flow as well as the levels in the original Dark Souls. You take a linear path from the main hub area to fight a major boss, then teleport back to said hub with a special bonfire. Shortcuts are far and few in between in Drangleic, and the ability to immediately warp to all bonfires, while being convenient, shows the game creators did not intend to create the interconnected puzzling maze that was Lordran in Dark Souls. This, for me, is a negative, but is subjective and others may enjoy this more.\n\nDark Souls II has a problem with its bosses. The vast majority of the bosses in Dark Souls II are "dudes in armor." You will forget most of their names unless you play through the game seven or more times, and most of them boil down to basic easy to dodge movesets. On top of this, a lot of the bosses are rehashes of bosses from Dark Souls. For example, there is a boss that you fight in an area known as "Heide's Tower of Flame" known as the "Old Dragonslayer." This boss is a blatant rip from Dark Souls, being a reskinned Ornstein the Dragonslayer. He has a slightly different moveset with a few new attacks. Another example is the Royal Rat Authority boss in the Doors of Pharros area. This boss is a large dog-like beast with a similar moveset and style of another boss from Dark Souls: Sif the Great Grey Wolf. They even have the same limping animation when they reach low health. There are a few rare gems in the rough, however. While these bosses still stay to the "dudes in armor" clique of the game, excluding Sinh, they still happen to be very challenging with hard to dodge attacks, interesting design, and a well written backstory to them. I am speaking about Raime the Fume Knight, Sir Alonne, The Old Ivory King, and Sinh the Slumbering Dragon. All have left a lasting impression on me of what a quality boss fight should be, and all have brutally murdered me several times.\n\nNow let's get to the good stuff; PvP, co-op, and online mechanics. I have not spent too much time in this game on PC, but I have played well over 600 hours on my Xbox 360. Most of that time was spent fighting other players in PvP combat. Dark Souls II does the covenant system along with the PvP matchmaking system much, much better than Dark Souls did. While Dark Souls attempted to make a PvP arena, the arena itself was rarely used because not only was it in a DLC (console only), it was difficult to get to and had unreliable matchmaking. The covenant system in Dark Souls was flawed and the only covenants that really worked were the Warriors of Sunlight, the Darkwraiths, and the Blades of the Darkmoon. In Dark Souls II, all of the covenants have a function of their own. The Brotherhood of Blood is the replacement for the Darkwaiths, and has it's own dueling arena. You gain ranks in the covenant by slaying other members in the dueling arena, for which rank three requires you to have slain 500 members. If you lose a fight, you lose a "rank point." Once you lose enough rank points, your rank decreases by one. The Blue Sentinels covenant, essentially the Blades of Darkmoon, invade the worlds of sinners, people who have invaded and killed other players or killed NPCs in their world, and makes them pay for their misgivings in blood. You gain ranks in the covenant by either defeating fellow covenant members in the Cathedral's dueling arena, killing sinners, or assisting Way of Blue members who have requested assistance with fighting an invader. Like the Brotherhood of Blood, once 500 rank points are earned, you achieve the maximum rank. Unlike the Brotherhood of Blood, however, losing in the arena doesn't take away any points from your rank. The other covenants, the Rat Covenant, the Bell Keepers, the Heirs of the Sun, and the Dragon Remants all have their own purposes, but in my opinion are considered minor covenants. The Heirs of the Sun are the Warriors of Sunlight from Dark Souls, the Rat Covenant are the Gravelord Servants, and the Bell Keepers are the Forest Hunters. The connectivity between players is now much, much better. With the introduction of the Name-Engraved Ring, players are able to connect with their friends much more easily. It was near impossible to connect with friends in Dark Souls because of the poor system in place for connecting with other players. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows, however...\n\nSoul memory. ♥♥♥♥ing soul memory. This mechanic is a terrible attempt by From Software to combat twinks in Dark Souls. If you are unaware, a twink is an experienced player who makes a low level character that has high level gear in an attempt to kill unexperienced players. These trolls are the one of the biggest tumors plaguing the Souls community On paper, soul memory makes some sense. Players needs to get a lot more souls to get higher level weapons, and they need to have beaten certain bosses and enemies to get to the areas to acquire better gear. However, in practice it is utterly broken. Soul memory is not the way to fix this issue. Dark Souls III does it pretty well with it's new mechanic of mixing in weapon level ranges along with soul level ranges. The problem with soul memory is that if one relies on any consumable items, they must get more souls in order to purchase more of these items. It is 100% possible to farm for all your items, but this can prove to be extremely inconvenient for you and take up way too much time just for some arrows or bombs. The other major issue with this mechanic is that it actively punishes newer and less experienced players. If you lose your souls and then die, those souls are still added to your soul memory. This means that new players will go up in the soul memory tiers and have to fight more experienced players, simply because they are not skilled at the game. This is the opposite of fixing twinking.\n\nOverall, Dark Souls II is better for players who enjoy co-op and PvP. If you are more interested in PvE and atmospheric, immersive play, then go for the original Dark Souls.\n\nRATING: 9/10","May 18","true","141.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

I really believe its what your priorties are for a souls game. If you like cohesive world design, shortcuts, and story elements souls 1 will be your favorite. If you like awesome boss fights and fantastic combat that extends to pvp then souls 3 will be your favorite. If you like a segmented game with more cinematic boss fights and interesting game mechanics that are not present in the other games demons may be your favorite. But if you like large games with lots of replay, a massive amount of equally viable play syles, massive well crafted levels with awesome secrets, well placed loot drops, interesting covenants including a non-multiplayer covenant and a game that is harder then souls 3 but you don't have to have that bs 4 directional roling from souls one then this is the souls game for you.\n\nI know mine is an unpopular opinion and I can see why anyone would say any of the games are the best as they are all truly fantastic with each having its own unique strengths. Even if people say this is the worst souls game most of those people would still tell you that it is head and shoulder above all other action rpgs not in the souls series. So give this one a try if your a souls vet who passed on this because of what people have said about it then give it a shot. If you havnt tryed the series yet and want the best entry point in the series I would direct you to Souls 3 as it is the easist in the series and thus the best entry point for newbies.\n\nSo give this one a try it's an awesome game it may end up being your favorite in the series as well.","May 17","true","39.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

No questions asked, just do it.\n\nIf you've played the original Dark Souls 2 (with DLC) and are wondering what Scholar of the First Sin added, then the answer is... well... not a lot, honestly. A few enemies are rearranged and certain areas that didn't make sense before (i.e. Hiede's Tower of Flame) are now upgraded to be a bit more interesting. There's also an NPC added who tosses out a whole bunch of lore every now and again, along with a new boss fight and ending. But other than that, it's essentially the same game.\n\nOn one hand it's cool because I can safely say that all of Scholar of the First Sin's changes are for the better. The little tweaks to the enemies make the game flow a lot better and the added lore makes the game make much more sense than it did before while still retaining its mystery.\n\nOn the other hand, it's still pretty much the same game. The enemies are still placed roughly the same as they've always been and the new boss isn't even particularly difficult. And nothing's really stopping you from watching the new ending on Youtube.\n\nSo what I'd say is that if you've been contemplating another Dark Souls 2 playthrough, then this is worth buying. But if you weren't thinking of that already, then give it a pass.\n\nAnd if you haven't played DS2 at all, then buy this immediately.","October 26, 2015","true","50.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Enemies now feel appropriate for the areas the appear in which enhances the lore and atmosphere.  Encounters in some zones, such as the dragon shrine,  have been radically altered in such a way that going there is an entirely fresh experience.  You also have to find the keys for the former DLC zones rather than have them presented to you from the get go.\n\nIn short, your millage with SoTFS will very depending on how much you want to run through Drangleic again.  The enemy revamp and larger phantom party is the big draw but you probably won't notice the graphical update.","April 5, 2015","true","47.5"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","32","61","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hurphel/recommended/335300/","hurphel","Hel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hurphel/","59 products in account","After playing through NG/NG+ and after a good amount of PvP I can finally give a proper review.\n\nPros:\n\n- Improvements in graphics and sound. The textures are crispier and and effects are nice to watch at. Shrine of Amana is even more beautiful and pure eye candy. The sound quality has improved and there has been additions in atmospheric sounds. There's also already some SweetFX presets for SotFS available if the graphical improvements are not enough for you. Modding with Gedosato is currently not possible, but I'm pretty sure this will be updated soon.\n\n- New Enemy and Item placements. As a vetaran in DS2, I ran into the game really cheeky, not expecting much of a surpise and got stopped abruptly. New enemy placements are smart, but also mean and requires you to think things out before going in blind. Hell, I even been spooked several times. Item changes give you more variety how to play as you can get different weapons now early. It also requiers you to search as the majority of Estus Flask Shards and Sublime Bone Dusts have been moved aswell.\n\n- Improved enemy AI. Enemy now chase you across the map and won't let go of you unless you enter a boss or different area. This requires you to kill them. Don't try to speedrun through the game, especially on your first playthrough as you will fail missarbly. Instead of finding only stationary enemies you will also find some enemies patroling through areas. It's a nice little effect and helps making the world more lively.\n\n- More NPC invaders. All of the NPC invaders in the original game were rather stupid and easy to kill by just simply stunlocking them. They didn't pose any threat whatsoever. SotFS now adds several new NPC invaders who will invade you throughout your playthrough. The most notorious one: Forlorn. He might invade you at any giving time and in any place that is invandable. I had him invading me in Iron Keep while I was fighting off several Alonne Knights and that cheeky buttface backstabbed me in the meantime.. Anyways, the new additions are smarter, do more damage and are actually a threat. However, this is a double-edged sword as those invaders have a huge amount of health and perform strange acts, such as rolling out of my riposte after a parry (???).\n\n- More Lore. Many items desciptions have been updated to tell the lore of the game better than previously. Majority of the translations errors have been fixed aswell. A nice change for people who care about the lore of the Dark Souls universe.\n\n- Still a superior NG+. You can tell me whatever you want, but Dark Souls 2 is one of the few games to date that has a well done and rewarding NG+. All of the previous Souls games and even BloodBorne NG+'s have only adjustments to the health and damage of enemies and the amount of Souls. There's nothing new otherwise. Dark Souls 2 however had from the start on a good NG+. First of all, you have the choice of going to NG+ and not beeing automaticly thrown in. You will find more unique enemies in addition to beeing tougher, including some red spirits here and there. And you will find unique weapons and armor bound to NG+. Now ofcourse not everyone is keen to go NG+, so you have the choice of using a Bonfire Ascetic in certain areas to get some of that stuff.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Durability bug persists. Let's start of with this one as this is still one of the biggest issues of the game. The durability of your equipment is tied to your FPS (frames per second). DS2 was created for the consoles first and then ported over to the PC and had it's FPS unlocked to 60 instead of 30 FPS. The durability degredation has not been adjusted to 60 FPS. Means your equipment will degrade twice as fast, which is for obvious reason a bug. That it has not been fixed yet up to this date (1 year later!), especially on this director's cut, boggles my mind. Now there are few ways how to deal with this. First of all, you could lock your FPS to 30, which obviously no one would like to. Another "solution" would be to have more than 1 weapon with you and enough repair power. You should also avoid hitting coprses, that ♥♥♥♥ eats through your durability. Just recently there has been a mod released for original DS2 and SotFS that fixes the durability bug completly without reducing your FPS. It works like a charm, but I'm not sure if something like this could result in a softbann. Therefore I won't provide a link or name. Just search Google if you're interested, at your own risk.\n\n- Community split.  This is, or will be a big problem. Currently, SotFS peaks at around 10.000 players, which is a good amount of online activity. But as we all know, the numbers will eventually fade and we will have two DS2 games left with a small amout players who cannot connect to each other unless they buy SotFS or change over to original DS2. Sucks.\n\n- Still no VAC? Like what the hell guys. CE Modders have been a nuisance now forever in original DS2 and you still refuse to re-activate VAC? *sigh* Well there's something called Softbann. If the servers caughts you cheating, it will sooner or later remove your ability to connect to legit players and throw you on an island with other cheaters. This however is no solution, as the same players can just create another account, use Family Share option in Steam and keep on playing the game on the original server. Even now we have a guy in SotFS that has 2 max level characters in Covenant of Champions, with around 300 offerings each and occupying the first places. After 11 ♥♥♥♥ing hours of play time. *smh*\n\n- Some enemy placement didn't make sense.  They just seemed completly random there, even ruining the immersion of the game. Like what the effing heck. I'm specifically talking aboutDrangelic Castle. It's like a hub world for all the enemies you met before getting to Drangelic Castle. It even has a Executioner's Chariot waiting for you in one of the most random places.\n\n- Still not dark enough. Some areas are still way to lightened up, even if there's barely any light source. I expected more spoopyness. I turned brightness all the way down and still was able to see something most of the time. It also has a strange way of darken the spooky places. From the outside you will see the rooms normaly lightened up, but once you enter it all turns dark. I guess it's fine.. BloodBorne uses the same method aswell, but it kinda destroys immersion. You also shouldn't be able to lock on enemies you can't see in the dark without a torch for extra difficulty.\n\n\nAlright this is the majority of pros and cons. One thing that I suggest to all veterans of the game who still think it's way too easy (even tho it isn't): Play it with Covenant of Champions turned on, just I like I did. It makes every way tougher and you really have to play smart to get around things, especially on NG+. I was beeing 2 shot by some of the Old Knights with over 2000 Health, so there's that.\n\n\nPvP and overall Multiplayer experience As far as I can tell, SotFS still has the good ol' in-depth combat experience of the original DS2. 6 man multiplayer is a nice addition, especially inroyal rumbles. Suprisingly not all to laggy aswell. 6 man fights are chaotic and fun. 4 man Coop is kinda over the top and seems to make everything easy, but I can't complain as I play solo most of the time anyways. If there is something to complain about, it's the balancing of a few weapons in PvP.\n\n\nVerdict: I understand not everyone would like to buy the game twice, especially the ones who owned the previous game including all DLC. But, if you did fully enjoy original DS2, you will appreciate the changes they did with SotFS and have your fun. 15/20 bucks don't seem much then. New players, or people who only owned the original game, profit anyways. They get the whole package including the DLCs for less. Otherwise wait for a sale!","April 9, 2015","true","61.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

Just don't start depraved in ds2 if this is your first souls game...\n\ncombat wise, this game feels a little more deliberate with your rolls than ds1 or ds3, kinda like always having a somewhat faster ds1 mid-roll.  rolling while locked on targets isn't angled relative to the target, which is really nice (no more rolling off cliffs just because you had the audacity to try to roll while locked on).\n\nlevel design wise, the individual areas seem well designed, but the overall world isn't nearly as impressive as the interconnected world of ds1 (ds3 also suffers from this, but perhaps to a somewhat lesser extent).\n\nlore wise ds2 is somewhat off on its own compared to ds1/ds3, but it's sufficient to make the world feel fleshed out.","May 12","true","99.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Even with the nearly mandatory dsfix, Dark Souls has certain areas that lower your framerate significantly. I do not recall such performance issues to happen in SotFS/DS2 (I might be wrong, however).\n\n- Fluidity - the combat feels a lot more fluid when compared to Dark Souls, animations seem improved, invincibility frames when rolling depend on a certain stat. You will often get hit even if it seems like you would've dodged the attack unless if you invest levels in said stat.\n\n- Fresh start - New areas to explore and a new story to learn.\n\n- Additional enchants - Can enchant your weapon in effects such as poison, without the use of rotten pine resin.\n\n- Warping between bonfires - you can now go from one bonfire to the other without acquiring a certain item.\n\nCons:\n\n- Soul memory - One of the biggest turn-offs in this game. The more souls you spend on leveling and purchasing items, the higher your soul memory becomes. There is no way to reduce the same. It would at least make sense if the soul memory used for temporary/usable items would not count or would be reduced upon their use. From now on, your character's level will not matter, and what initially seemed like a good idea unfortunately is quite a bane for most players.\n\n- Frustrating areas - Just like Blighttown from the old game, there are certain areas you just want to get over with as soon as possible.\n\n- Invasions - you only get cracked blue and red eye orbs, which cost a lot.\n\n- Hollowing - hollowing works so every time you die, you lose 5% of your total HP, and the effect stacks. While you get a neat visual change with each of your deaths, your health is permanently lowered, down to 50% HP. To revert this, you need to use a human effigy, which restores your human form. Alternatively, you can become a white or gray phantom and successfully assist the host - upon doing so, you are returned to your human form along with some goodies and souls. NB: You can still get invaded while you're a hollow, however you cannot invade others unless you're in your human form.\n\n- Design - the game can feel very linear and unlike in Dark Souls, Miyazaki who's work is revered by the Souls community has not worked at all on Dark Souls 2, nor on SotFS.\n\n- Hitboxes - Infuriating.

The trolls you can do with friends or invasions are just plain crazy and fun.\n\nThird, I've played this game for over 400 hours, I can tell you from experience that I'd seen about maybe 5 hackers in this game over the course of maybe 300 invasions. I actually think that's pretty good in general in terms of being a pretty safe game to play and these people do get reported an banned.\n\nFourth, It's a great value atm for the thanksgiving sale at 50% off and it includes all the DLC that came out with it so no one has any more weapons than you do.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time and I think it's a pretty good buy for $24.99 at the time of me writing this review, anymore than that and you are better off waiting for dark souls 3.","April 20, 2015","true","518.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

So i call you out, you hypocrat snob.\n\nScholar of the first sin is a great game, its a better version of what was already an amazing game.  The dlc is worth 20 bucks alone.  Keep whining, enough people have bought it to support Souls games on PC.  Its no that hard.  Get over it and if you dont like it, go play some ubisoft games, those are wel uptimized I hear.","April 4, 2015","true","61.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowReaper29/recommended/335300/","ShadowReaper29","CyberWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowReaper29/","145 products in account","Heres my quick breakdown for this amazing game, continue past the PROS & CONS for my full review.\n\n---PROS---\n\n-A huge and beautifully designed world\n-Exciting and engaging combat\n-Detailed and challenging bosses and mobs\n-A stupendous amount of weapons\n-Entrancing music\n-Friendly and helpful community\n-Fair and fun PvP\n\n---CONS---\n\n-Lack of variety in bosses\n-Online connectivity issues for co-op and PvP (Sometimes)\n-Massive learning curve for non Dark Souls players (Not an issue if you like a challenge)\n\nAll in all im giving this game a 9.5/10\n\n\n-Full review-\n\n\nI have nothing but praise (the sun) for this game. What a fantastic and thrilling adventure. It grips you from the start and never lets go. Although the game can be stressful at times, especially when you're stuck on that one boss you've tried to beat a thousand times, it more than makes up for it the moment that you beat that boss or an area. It takes the brilliant qualities of Dark Souls (1) and improves upon them in many ways.\n\nFor one this game has such a mesmerising environment. Many times i found my self stepping back from the grind and just being awe struck at the beauty and detail thats went into this vast and exciting world. From the thrilling brilliance of the Sun on the sea in Majula to the eerily dark feel of the Black gulch's green glow, it has it all. The terrain were battles take place plays a more important role aswell with it being much easier to fall off a ledge or get backed into a corner and ive had my tumbles in this game with more than a few bosses and mobs, talking about you Dragonrider.\n\nThe mobs in this game accentuate the grand landscapes in this game with their impressive details and suiting characteristics. They're much more difficult in my opinion than this games predecossor and theres alot more of them than compared to the original Dark Souls 2. A few of them present a challenge to match that of a boss which emphasizes the difficulty of this game and adds to the relief when you finally beat an area. A memorable moment for me was getting chased by a million spiders in an attempt to fight their boss, the sheer panic and resolve i was feeling in that moment is a highlight for me in this game. They are beautiful in their own way and they fill their respective environment quite naturally and fit in with the characteristics of the boss they protect.\n\nI found the bosses in this game very rewarding, particularly the DLC bosses. They were exceptionally designed and very challenging. Though the main theme in their deisign seemed to knight related there were a few that were outstanding such as The Dukes dear Freja. There are times when you're fighting that one grand boss and you can feel your heart racing and you find yourself drawing closer to the screen in such a tense moment trying to get that killing hit and when you finally beat it that wash of victory that comes over you makes all the struggling, all the blood, sweat and tears so worth it. And then its back to the grind for the next area.\n\nThe co-op in the game feels vastly more improved upon from the previous Dark Souls (1) introducing a new way to connect based on whats called soul memory. I liked the introduction of different types of summoned allies such as shades which expanded the range of help you can get. The PvP was exciting and many aspects of this games PvP match closely to that of Dark Souls (1) which meant you never lost your favrite covenant. There are alot of options and ways to go about PvP to make it accessible to a much larger amount of players.\n\nThere is a MASSIVE amount of weapons and armor in this game that cater to a great amount of fighting styles. They are very well contructed in how they look and how they behave in combat. There are the extreme forms of both heavy tank with 2 handed great hammer to nimble backstabber wielding 2 swift daggers with everything you can think of in between. I found the magic and spells in this game to be very elegent. There were alot to choose from for each individual style whether that be magnificent spells and angelic miracles to tenebrous hexes and wrathful pyromancies. They all add this sense of individuality to the game as you choose what your character is going to be.\n\nThe 'story' in this game requires attention to detail which can take a few play throughs to fully understand. I very much enjoyed my experience with this games story and it made me feel apart of its world. Plus i really liked option of 2 endings which i very much appreciated.\n\nThis fantastic game brought out so many great feelings from within me and although i got stressed, annoyed and angry they were all dwarfed by the explosion of happiness when i finally beat this game. No other game series quite captured that same affect for me making this one of the best games ive played.\n\nIf you're reading this i HIGHLY recommend you get this game, more so if you're a fan of RPG's and more so than that if you liked Dark Souls (1). Its different in quite a few ways from its predecessor but change isnt always a bad thing and this is a case were it was done right. Praise the Sun!","August 1, 2015","true","148.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're looking for gameplay and storytelling similar to Dark Souls I, you're probably better off buying a PS4 and Bloodborne. If you're looking for an active PvP/Co-op community, you'll most likely find it here. Save for the occasional Bad Apple and/or hacker, the PvP/Co-op community is quite good. Would I reccomend Scholar in general? Yes, yes I would. Would I reccomend it for a hardcore Souls player? Probably not. Anyone that has played Dark Souls I for any extended period of time and has experience in handling it, you'll probably struggle at first, saying things like, 'How did that hit me?', or 'I was nowhere near that!' when dodging attacks. Enemies track you very well, almost frustratingly so. I feel like I shouldnt have to mention it, since it says so, but have a controller ready, as its PC controls are garbage. If you like the Souls games for what they are, then you'll probably like Sotfs. If you've tried Dark Souls II before, on PS3, 360, or PC, and didn't like it, this won't change your mind. Although if you hated it because the graphics were bad before, this might change your mind, but if that's what you value games for, shouldn't you be playing Crysis, instead?","November 30, 2015","true","180.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simsoyzeta/recommended/335300/","simsoyzeta","Slurmp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simsoyzeta/","305 products in account","Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is the second draft of From Software's Dark Souls II. It's absolutely gorgous, and its variety of landscapes and enemies is stunning. But aside from how freaking beautiful this game looks if you're a long time Souls fan you're going to notice something different about Dark Souls II and SoTFS.\n\nIs this game good? Yes, it is. Even for all its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it's easier than Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. Is it better than Dark Souls or Demon's Souls? No, it's not. If you're a Souls fan you'll take any bit you can get. If you're a newie to the franchise looking at picking this game up because it's newer and prettier, trust me, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die is going to be far more satisfying and is going to frusterate you less.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is that difference? It was made by a different team. And it shows. While From Software markets the Souls series as brutally hard, "pepare to die" and so on the actual game design is very free of what I call "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t". The older games were far better designed than this one, SoTFS showed they were learning (the DLC is actually really good for Dark Souls II) but Demon's Souls and Dark Souls don't have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like Dark Souls II/SoTFS. It's still a good game, but it sucks the creators didn't understand the design principles of the original team until the DLC.\n\nWhat is this "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"? You'll fight against larger groups of enemies, you'll fight against large groups of minibosses. The previous games in the franchise made it easy to judge what was coming up, the enviornment gave clues. You see burn marks and burned bodies on the bridge? Remember the dragon from earlier? Yeah, when you cross that burned section a dragon is going to breathe fire at you. In Dark Souls II you'll often find enemies jumping from the ceiling or out of hiding places that you never could have seen coming. Dark Souls II also has some forced death sequences, something the Souls series NEVER does (other than Seath's fight in the first one). You'll open up a door and have the entire wall collapse ontop of you, something you can't avoid nomatter what you do.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS\n\n#1, be patient. The Souls games will test you. Dying isn't as punishing as you will first believe. You loose your souls, and if you're human you switch back into your hallowed state unless you recover your bloodstain. Those souls can be used to upgrade your equipment and stats, but your stats are pretty useless, people beat the game easily without leveling once; it's more useful to level your equipment and that doesn't cost many souls.\n\n#2, summon help if you need it. Playing the game with other players is a lot of fun. Getting invaded in Dark Souls II while traveling with some other players is really satisfying. The AI is very good too, you'll play against an NPC invasion and you almost wont be able to tell the difference between them and a real player.\n\n#3, DO NOT LOOK AHEAD! Knowing what's coming makes the game a lot easier, but the most satisfying part of Dark Souls is overcoming the challenges (bosses, hard areas, other players) and exploring the world. I used a video guide for Dark Souls 1 and I regret it because its a lot more fun to play blind. PLAY IT BLIND. If you like the game, you'll like it a LOT more playing without any help (unless you're really stuck, or need to know where to go next). If you don't like the game, and you've put 10 or 15 hours into it then Dark Souls probably isn't a game for you.\n\n#4, give it a shot. Dark Souls can be hard to get into. You don't know the mechanics, you don't know the rules, but you'll learn. Don't quit because you don't know how to lock on to an enemy. Don't quit because you did something foolish and died and feel intimidated by that weakly enemy whom killed you. TAKE A BREAK IF YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY, COME BACK AFTER SOME NETFLIX.","November 30, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're looking for gameplay and storytelling similar to Dark Souls I, you're probably better off buying a PS4 and Bloodborne. If you're looking for an active PvP/Co-op community, you'll most likely find it here. Save for the occasional Bad Apple and/or hacker, the PvP/Co-op community is quite good. Would I reccomend Scholar in general? Yes, yes I would. Would I reccomend it for a hardcore Souls player? Probably not. Anyone that has played Dark Souls I for any extended period of time and has experience in handling it, you'll probably struggle at first, saying things like, 'How did that hit me?', or 'I was nowhere near that!' when dodging attacks. Enemies track you very well, almost frustratingly so. I feel like I shouldnt have to mention it, since it says so, but have a controller ready, as its PC controls are garbage. If you like the Souls games for what they are, then you'll probably like Sotfs. If you've tried Dark Souls II before, on PS3, 360, or PC, and didn't like it, this won't change your mind. Although if you hated it because the graphics were bad before, this might change your mind, but if that's what you value games for, shouldn't you be playing Crysis, instead?","November 30, 2015","true","180.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simsoyzeta/recommended/335300/","simsoyzeta","Slurmp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simsoyzeta/","305 products in account","Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin is the second draft of From Software's Dark Souls II. It's absolutely gorgous, and its variety of landscapes and enemies is stunning. But aside from how freaking beautiful this game looks if you're a long time Souls fan you're going to notice something different about Dark Souls II and SoTFS.\n\nIs this game good? Yes, it is. Even for all its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it's easier than Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. Is it better than Dark Souls or Demon's Souls? No, it's not. If you're a Souls fan you'll take any bit you can get. If you're a newie to the franchise looking at picking this game up because it's newer and prettier, trust me, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die is going to be far more satisfying and is going to frusterate you less.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is that difference? It was made by a different team. And it shows. While From Software markets the Souls series as brutally hard, "pepare to die" and so on the actual game design is very free of what I call "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t". The older games were far better designed than this one, SoTFS showed they were learning (the DLC is actually really good for Dark Souls II) but Demon's Souls and Dark Souls don't have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like Dark Souls II/SoTFS. It's still a good game, but it sucks the creators didn't understand the design principles of the original team until the DLC.\n\nWhat is this "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"? You'll fight against larger groups of enemies, you'll fight against large groups of minibosses. The previous games in the franchise made it easy to judge what was coming up, the enviornment gave clues. You see burn marks and burned bodies on the bridge? Remember the dragon from earlier? Yeah, when you cross that burned section a dragon is going to breathe fire at you. In Dark Souls II you'll often find enemies jumping from the ceiling or out of hiding places that you never could have seen coming. Dark Souls II also has some forced death sequences, something the Souls series NEVER does (other than Seath's fight in the first one). You'll open up a door and have the entire wall collapse ontop of you, something you can't avoid nomatter what you do.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS\n\n#1, be patient. The Souls games will test you. Dying isn't as punishing as you will first believe. You loose your souls, and if you're human you switch back into your hallowed state unless you recover your bloodstain. Those souls can be used to upgrade your equipment and stats, but your stats are pretty useless, people beat the game easily without leveling once; it's more useful to level your equipment and that doesn't cost many souls.\n\n#2, summon help if you need it. Playing the game with other players is a lot of fun. Getting invaded in Dark Souls II while traveling with some other players is really satisfying. The AI is very good too, you'll play against an NPC invasion and you almost wont be able to tell the difference between them and a real player.\n\n#3, DO NOT LOOK AHEAD! Knowing what's coming makes the game a lot easier, but the most satisfying part of Dark Souls is overcoming the challenges (bosses, hard areas, other players) and exploring the world. I used a video guide for Dark Souls 1 and I regret it because its a lot more fun to play blind. PLAY IT BLIND. If you like the game, you'll like it a LOT more playing without any help (unless you're really stuck, or need to know where to go next). If you don't like the game, and you've put 10 or 15 hours into it then Dark Souls probably isn't a game for you.\n\n#4, give it a shot. Dark Souls can be hard to get into. You don't know the mechanics, you don't know the rules, but you'll learn. Don't quit because you don't know how to lock on to an enemy. Don't quit because you did something foolish and died and feel intimidated by that weakly enemy whom killed you. TAKE A BREAK IF YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY, COME BACK AFTER SOME NETFLIX.","November 30, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This is more for people that played through Dark Souls 2 and are wondering if it is worth the money. Obviously if you are a newcomer then this is the best place to start considering it comes with all the DLC and a few minor improvements. Unless you are a newcomer to the franchise itself in which case you should definitely start with the first Dark Souls.\n\nScholar of the First Sin was announced immediately after the final expansion was released and I like many others was pretty irritated about. I purchased it recently on PC due to the sale although I also have the PS4 version as well. Having ignored it for nearly six months I feel I can look at this a little more objectively.\n\nWhether this update is worth purchasing really depends on how much you enjoyed the vanilla version. Enemy placements have been tweaked, NPC summon signs and invasions are much more prominent and a few creative elements have been added in certain places (some of which are admittedly pretty interesting). There is also a ring in the game that allows you to control Soul Memory to a certain degree, although this is a band aid solution and doesn't really fix the core problem. Lighting seems to be improved and makes torches less optional in a couple of places but if you are looking for E3 levels of fidelity then you should probably keep moving. Lastly, a character very important to the lore makes multiple appearances. Speaking of lore, item descriptions have also been given the once over.\n\nAll in all, the game feels very familiar but also quite different. All the above mentioned tweaks and alterations to progression paths (you'll be using more Fragrant Branches of Yore than usual) make this update feel akin to a Director's Cut or Extended Edition bluray with all the added extras from the previous iterations. If you loved the regular game and don't mind starting from scratch (saves don't carry over) then it could be worth it. However the vanilla game has been updated via patch to include most of the features that aren't related to performance so it really does depend on how much you want the extra player count, slightly better lighting and enemy placement re-shuffle. If you weren't much of a fan to begin with then nothing here is going to change that.\n\nSo, should you buy it?\n\nNewcomers... Definitely.\nLongtime Players... Yes, if you want to spice things up a little. But Not essential.\nCasual Players... Don't bother, you probably won't appreciate or care about any of the changes.","September 17, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will preface by saying that I have no played or seen the original Dark Souls 2 so I cannot compare to it.\n\nFirst thing to notice is that the keyprompts are still displaying controller buttons so learning the game can be needlessly complicated. The keybindings are rebindable however, which is good since the original bindings are questionable. One thing you will want to do is enable "Disable Double-Click" which causes the game to delay an attack while it looks for a second input to turn it into a strong attack, delaying the action by a second. Doding is once again bound to the same key as sprint, making the dodge occur on key release, not key press which will delay the input and potentially mean that you get hit. You don't want to get hit. There is a little bit of input lag as well so timing, looking for tells, and knowledge play vital roles, though getting hit by an attack even though you "dodged it" is irritating.\n\nThere are a lot of graphical options as well (though no borderless windowed). Speaking of graphics, this game is very pretty, good setpieces and locations with some nice lighting effects really make this game look good. Animations are smooth, though there is a an issue when it comes to hitboxes on certain boss attacks. This is probably the worst part since you can't actually adapt to the fight since you don't know the timing for the dodge. It always just feels weird, and in a Souls game that is bad.\n\nThis weirdness is also in the difficulty of the game, which is highly varied. Some bosses required you to dodge 100% of everything and shield nothing, while other fights can be done by just circling the boss who will only throw out slow linear attacks.  Enemies will also group up more than in Dark Souls, though they won't chase far meaning that running is almost always an option. There are only a few points that have a trap set that you cannot see by carefully examining your surrounds, though thankfully these are few and far between.\n\nWhile dodging may be the biggest issue, my personal peeve is where you lose maximum HP on death. Every death past the first one from "human" will result in a HP loss of 5% up to maximum of 50% (though an item in the early game limits this to 75%). The HP loss mechanic is sopmething that I can understand from a lore persepctive (you are slowly becoming more hollowed), though if a player is repeatedly dying they probably need that health so that they have more time to learn the mechanics. This hollowing can be reversed by using a human effigy though this brings about another issue. You can always be invaded (PvP'd) unless you BURN another effigy, though being at maximum hollow state reduces the likeliness of being invaded. Also there are areas where you can be summoned to fight without having any say in the matter, which can be seriously immersion breaking. Thankfully, losing these results in no real penalty.\n\nThe lore of the game is decent and told through the item descriptions, but doesn't feel as connected as Dark Souls where you could understand why the world was designed in a certain manner. That isn't to say that it is empty, just not quite fleshed out.\n\nIt's a good game, a mostly fair game, a hard game, but it does have a few issues that may influence your experience.\n\n","October 31, 2015","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did play it though, although not to completion.\n\nFirst off, let's get Dark Souls out of the way. The first game had much better art direction. It was better overall, but this game has much more polished controls, graphics and combat mechanics.\n\nWhile the bosses and level design are nothing extraordinary, once you get past a certain point, the world starts to grow on you. There are some mob designs which I found quite interesting and enjoyable. The bosses, though, are for the most part forgettable. There are a lot of small miniboss type encounters which are not very inspired.\n\nI did play the original release of Dark Souls II and I can tell they applied a thick coat of polish this time around. Enemy placements make more sense now, and the level design feels more consistent with the lore. It's almost as if the original release was half-baked... After 6 or 7 hours you start to feel a strong sense of exploration. Darkness means something now, and you will be using torches.\n\nPVP works, for the most part. I'm not a big fan of online play, so I can't comment too much on that. I didn't try coop.\n\nChances are that if you know what Dark Souls is, you have already bought this anyway, but in any case I'd like to say this for everyone wondering about this game (and this release): in my opinion, this is the proper version of Dark Souls II. Besides actually feeling complete from a design standpoint, it includes the DLCs, which are in some opinions better than the main game itself, so it's a great value package.","August 18, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games combat mechanics feel really smooth and is a enjoyable expericence that takes alot of skill. The majority of the boss fights are always intense and unqiue in their own ways, so everyone you attempt to beat will make you think of new strategys to fight. This makes the game much more exhilarting throughout the game and almost will never get boring, because of this you get a lot of play time for reasonbly cheap game. The level designs are just absolutely stunning and beautiful, but can also be very dark. Every area you go to gives you an entire new experience with a plethora of new enemies with more dangers.

This is more for people that played through Dark Souls 2 and are wondering if it is worth the money. Obviously if you are a newcomer then this is the best place to start considering it comes with all the DLC and a few minor improvements. Unless you are a newcomer to the franchise itself in which case you should definitely start with the first Dark Souls.\n\nScholar of the First Sin was announced immediately after the final expansion was released and I like many others was pretty irritated about. I purchased it recently on PC due to the sale although I also have the PS4 version as well. Having ignored it for nearly six months I feel I can look at this a little more objectively.\n\nWhether this update is worth purchasing really depends on how much you enjoyed the vanilla version. Enemy placements have been tweaked, NPC summon signs and invasions are much more prominent and a few creative elements have been added in certain places (some of which are admittedly pretty interesting). There is also a ring in the game that allows you to control Soul Memory to a certain degree, although this is a band aid solution and doesn't really fix the core problem. Lighting seems to be improved and makes torches less optional in a couple of places but if you are looking for E3 levels of fidelity then you should probably keep moving. Lastly, a character very important to the lore makes multiple appearances. Speaking of lore, item descriptions have also been given the once over.\n\nAll in all, the game feels very familiar but also quite different. All the above mentioned tweaks and alterations to progression paths (you'll be using more Fragrant Branches of Yore than usual) make this update feel akin to a Director's Cut or Extended Edition bluray with all the added extras from the previous iterations. If you loved the regular game and don't mind starting from scratch (saves don't carry over) then it could be worth it. However the vanilla game has been updated via patch to include most of the features that aren't related to performance so it really does depend on how much you want the extra player count, slightly better lighting and enemy placement re-shuffle. If you weren't much of a fan to begin with then nothing here is going to change that.\n\nSo, should you buy it?\n\nNewcomers... Definitely.\nLongtime Players... Yes, if you want to spice things up a little. But Not essential.\nCasual Players... Don't bother, you probably won't appreciate or care about any of the changes.","September 17, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Make sure that when you play it you listen to calming music to keep you from throwing your controller or punching a hole in the wall, because it has tons of BS. Now, this isn't the original DS2, so there are areas that are a lot harder than the original, such as Heide's Tower of Flame. There are also a lot of terribly designed zones where their tactic of making it hard was to just swarm you with enemies, like the new Iron Keep. Though it lacks the level design and story cohesiveness and depth that DS1 had, it's still a fun game with many beautiful and awe-inspiring areas.\n\nAs I said, though, prepare to be assaulted from all sides. There are lots of enemies in this game, and all of them are faster than the previous game. Poise isn't as effective in the second installment of the Dark Souls series, and the key to progress is rolling.\n\nYou may be thinking, "Warriors historically used shields, how does rolling make any sense when you are being attacked constantly?" and I will just go ahead and tell you that you are right. The combat in this game isn't realistic, it's purely for fun, so if you get backstabbed with somebody's bare hand you had it coming. That said, the multiplayer is way better in this version, as they added new "infusions" to weapons like poison, bleed, lightning, and dark. Because most weapons and armor are viable in PvP, and you can infuse all your weapons, there is a large variety of different playstyles which makes PvP much more interesting than kicking Havels until they shield break. Havel's armor IS in DS2, unfortunately.\n\nThe story in this game is quite non-existent. Some of the characters vital to the story you know practically nothing about even though you physically meet them. Lucatiel, B-team's attempt at recreating Solaire, is a relatively bland character that resembles a young teen girl who needed to find a backstory for her LARP character. Seriously guys, the whole "I come from a land where everyone is good in battle, but I have emotions too!" story is getting old.\nThe final boss is very easy despite the story implying she is super powerful, might I add that this game heavily implies that Dark is evil even though Light and Dark don't represent good and evil.\n\nIf you loved Dark Souls one and haven't played this, yet want to play Dark Souls 3 and are super hyped, I would just wait for the third game. If you didn't know about DS3, then go ahead and play this. If you didn't like the first game, you probably won't like this one, but it is significantly easier if you use any weapon with horizontal swipes. My only warning to you will be, watch out for the Royal Rat Authority's adds.","September 11, 2015","true","120.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After you defeat everything on the perfect way, you move on and repeat the cycle.  Its funny how you easily beat areas that you struggled and then realizes: I progressed and I got better.\n\nAnd then, there is the lore, the Hollowing, the Undeads , the Ambient... The hopelessness of being destined to hollow is sad, And the fact that I had to start the game , meaning that I abandoned and hallowed a character makes me feel deeply reflective about DS2 world and lore.\n\nThe game is awesome, a piece of art. Don't get discouraged by the game difficulty , its temporary and you will die, and you will improve and progress.\n\nThe game is awesome and worths every single penny.","August 28, 2015","true","60.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But let's assume you haven't or you'd like to know if this is worth picking up if you already have Dark Souls 2.  Well, this is a sort of "remix" version of Dark Souls 2, with slightly different and more devious enemy placement.  It also seems to have all the DLC intact and is fully optimized for 64-bit systems and as a result, it runs PERFECTLY at max settings on this PC.\n\nAlright, so let's assume you're new to all of this and have no idea what this game is.  So imagine Ghosts n Goblins, but as an action RPG.  Dark Souls 2 can be painfully tough, but extremely rewarding.  It's ridiculously addictive and a refreshing change of pace from most mainstream titles that strive to handhold and pander to more casual audiences.  Will you beat it?  Probably not, but you'll definitely enjoy it, especially if you enjoy a more retro style difficulty that puts the skill of the player more to the test rather than your willingness to just grind in a given area until you're overleveled, which can't really happen anyway as you are limited to how many encounters you'll actually run into in a given area.\n\nDark Souls 2 is not for everybody, but those that do play it swear by, and at it.","December 31, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing RPGs since like the fifth grade and with no doubt is this series, if you take your time to really understand and absorb all the subtleties, one of the best at rewarding you for  the time you put into it.\n\nIt's absolutely beautiful ever step of the way. Not just in like a superficial "Oh the graphics DX12... FXAA... Light Shaft engine overclock..." Like the artistic direction is so sublimely awesome. You'll come across a boss and you're just amazed at how picturesque the encounter and NPC is. And this is very far from stepping on the toes of how you feel when you're traversing through each zone.\n\nThe gameplay is immensely challenging and requires you to pay enough attention to make quick and accurate decisions. And it's pretty detrimental when you can't, or make a wrong move. But like I said if you bother to learn ur respective stats and skillsets, and you're able to understand how different enemies envoke you to change what you're doing, this game will make you wan't to play it for hours and hours. Similar to how previous expansions of WoW felt. You have to do some homework.\n\nTactics aren't just something to make thing's smoother or the make your loot brighter it's the only way to progress through the scenic land of Dragonleic.\n\nThe Lore is a bit strange I will admit. It's not thrown into your face. You need to piece it together which just makes it more rewarding when you understand who and why you are.\n\n\n\n","January 5","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This version is visually updated also since its running on dx11. The original was in dx9.

You were limited to those who've only acquired a certain lifetime amount of 'currency' that was similar to your lifetime currency count. I felt this was a terrible decision as oftentimes you would permanently lose large amounts of spendible currency and these would still count towards your lifetime currency count. This meant that the more currency you lost, the weaker you were considered in relation to other players who didn't lose their currency. In the same thread, it meant that gaining too much currency blocked you from playing with the larger playerbase.\n\nDespite the co-op matchmaking gripes.

Runs like a dream on PC.\n- Better bonfire placement, far far fewer boring walks over nothing fields and hallways to get back to the tough areas. Levels do not waste your time.\n- Loads of weapons and armor, you can't go anywhere in this world without finding a dozen new weapons and bits of armor and spells to try\n- Characters I don't want to murder. Except for Onion Bro and the Sun dude, Dark Souls 1's cast was full of gibbering half mad losers and incompetent idiots (And hell, Onion Bro and Sun dude are both incompetent themselves.). Dark Souls 2's characters are actually likeable without losing the Soulsian feel.\n- Numerous, better PvP options.\n- FINALLY trying to explain to people who don't go wiki their builds (All three of them.) that DEX does not make you faster, just that you hit harder with weapons that use DEX!\n\nThings it does worse than Dark Souls 1:\n- Level atmosphere. The empty space made Dark Souls 1 nearly impossible to replay without falling asleep but it sure helped craft a world. Dark Souls 2 does not have that feel at all.\n- Soul Memory. Losing souls upon death now counts against your online rank even if you can't get them back. Of all the possible options for rebalancing online ranking, they could not possibly have picked a worse way to do it.\n- Agility. Everything else in Souls has a stat, why not dodging? Well, because you don't explain it! You explained DEX and STR but not Agility? Get real From! Nobody will know that's why their dodging doesn't work.\n- A really weak opening level. No Souls game has had a weak opening until Dark Souls 2.","March 7","true","184.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Runs like a dream on PC.\n- Better bonfire placement, far far fewer boring walks over nothing fields and hallways to get back to the tough areas. Levels do not waste your time.\n- Loads of weapons and armor, you can't go anywhere in this world without finding a dozen new weapons and bits of armor and spells to try\n- Characters I don't want to murder. Except for Onion Bro and the Sun dude, Dark Souls 1's cast was full of gibbering half mad losers and incompetent idiots (And hell, Onion Bro and Sun dude are both incompetent themselves.). Dark Souls 2's characters are actually likeable without losing the Soulsian feel.\n- Numerous, better PvP options.\n- FINALLY trying to explain to people who don't go wiki their builds (All three of them.) that DEX does not make you faster, just that you hit harder with weapons that use DEX!\n\nThings it does worse than Dark Souls 1:\n- Level atmosphere. The empty space made Dark Souls 1 nearly impossible to replay without falling asleep but it sure helped craft a world. Dark Souls 2 does not have that feel at all.\n- Soul Memory. Losing souls upon death now counts against your online rank even if you can't get them back. Of all the possible options for rebalancing online ranking, they could not possibly have picked a worse way to do it.\n- Agility. Everything else in Souls has a stat, why not dodging? Well, because you don't explain it! You explained DEX and STR but not Agility? Get real From! Nobody will know that's why their dodging doesn't work.\n- A really weak opening level. No Souls game has had a weak opening until Dark Souls 2.","March 7","true","184.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Price was 12,49e but when I logged in it said 2,49e. Not sure why. Just make sure you're logged in when buying the upgrade.\n\nAfter playing both versions, it's easy to say that SotFS is what Dark Souls 2 should have been. Most fans of the series can play through the original game blindfolded. WIth Scholar they sort of cranked up the number of enemies and NPC invasions making careful approach more advised. For returning players, I recommend the Champions covenant for even harder experience. Places like Iron Keep will eat you alive.\n\nGraphics are exactly the same as old DS2. They shouldn't even mention "updated graphics" in the description. You're not getting any dx11 features.\n\nOnline play is unchanged except for the addition of Agape Ring. Basically FromSoft realized they ♥♥♥♥ed up with the Soul Memory ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but rather than scratching it for the "remake" they just sort of made it better or worse depending who you're asking. I haven't been invaded ONCE during 30 hours of gameplay. Bell invasions still happen but that took ages. Rat Covenant is probably dead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IDDQDOOD/recommended/335300/","IDDQDOOD","IDDQ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IDDQDOOD/","219 products in account","Tough i still recommend this game. Im rewritting this review since a lot of time has passed from the last one.\n\nFirst of all. Let's see the game as a sole game, not as a sequel.\n\nDark souls 2 is an excelent game with really good fighting mechanics. While other games are focused on combos and speed. Dark souls 2 is focused on timing and precision. That being said. the graphics are not really "next gen" , more considering Scholar of The First sin is supposed to be. The main reason is the geometry detail. There is no really a lot of geometry in this game. Most of the geometry is made via tesselation, wich is basically "simulating" 3d by giving lightning effects to ground. The texture quality, even on max is kind of lame. Enemy animation sometimes feel like they are skating on ground.\n\nHands down. Dark souls 2 strenght isn't in the graphical department.\n\nThe sound however, is a completely different beast. The sound is amazing. Specially the soundtrack.\n\nThe second weakness of this game are the bosses. They are definitely the worst thing about this game. And if it wasn't because of the DLC's included in this version. Most of the bosses would be terrible.\n\nNow Comparing to DS1\n\n+- The backstab concept in this game is different. Not better, not worst, just different. Instead of an instant backstab you make an animation. The problem is... The animation is too slow, and you will miss most backstabs now\n\n-+The game relies more on enemy quantity over quality. And From teab B was aware of this. Since most enemies are way easier than DS1 if you fight them one on one. This isn't really a problem. But enemy placement seemed more sober in Dark Souls 1. Here they are sometimes all over the place, and sometimes nowhere.\n\n-+The dual wielding system isn't clear, and it's not a big step up from Dark souls 1 , since you will require to sacrifice a lot of stats to use the special dual wielding stance.\n\n-+While the netcoding was improved by FAR from DS1 There isn't a single really good PVP event. in the year i had this game I mostly fighted in the Iron Keep, since most pvp'ers and Dragons gather there. Leaving the PVP arenas almost deserted.\n\n+-The gameplay is even slower than Dark Souls 1. The good thing about this, is that if it was as fast, it would be impossible to backstab anyone\n\n+-The parry system is really weird, however is still playable if you time well.\n\n-And that's the best i can say about PVP zones. The Rat is the worst PVP zone, and i doubt Dark souls 3 will be able to make an artorias woods copy so badly. I hope... The only reason you will find people in the bell towers is for the spell you only get there for the achievement. Otherwise it's incredibly boring. This is another pvp that tried to be like Artorias Woods. Not mentioning the boss.\n\n-Agility: this is by far the worst idea of a stat. While most stats in this game are excelent, Agility wasn't necessary at all. Who wouldn't want Agility to begin with. You can't dodge anything, drink estus fast, or roll better. So why is this even a stat!?\n\n-Soul Memory. one would expect that after NG+ SM wouldn't be relevant. You'd be wrong. Soul memory is the mechanic that once you get enough souls, you will see less and less people. A terrible match making choice\n\n-Bosses. I can't grasp how lame the bosses in this game are compared to most Dark souls 1 bosses. Most of them are armor clad enemies. ReSkins or just stupid. the most original Boss is Demon of Song. But he's also the one that almost always will miss his attacks agaisnt you. Also. If there was something to surpass Capra demon as a boss in a Souls games in lame ideas. You have Congregation+Dark Magus, Skeleton Kings, and finally The rat royal vanguard. Wich is in resume a bunch of rats Between reskins you have. Sif reskinned as a giant rat, Ornstein reskinned as a silver Ornstein, Ivori king pet reskinned and cloned as 2 IVORY KING PETS, IN THE SAME GAME. Smelter demon, this time in blue, invaders... but now as a boss. Kalameth as the giant dragon from Shulva. And the Red firedrake, as small red firedrakes and a boss wich is the same enemy again.\n\n-You lose your stamina too fast\n-You lose your durability too fast. I get it. Dark souls 1 almost never required you to repair your weapons. You will now, A LOT.\n-The navigation isn't as fluid as Dark Souls 1. While in DS1 most places ended up leading you back to Firelink Shrine. DS2 all paths end in a main boss and a dead end. Making the game feel more linear.Only The Ivory King DLC seems to understand a good backtracking. And in a certain way also the Iron King DLC.\n-While you can carry different rings it's for the most an excuse to make you always pick up the rings that raise your damage.\n-Most bosses rely on quantity over quality\n-You start with NO estus flask, to one estus flask and then you have to collect them back, up to 12. While in the beginning this is TOO punishing, for the end you will probably never use em all.\nYou won't need them because tehre are now life gems wich are too cheap to get. The estus only being for emergencies\n-Every optional DLC boss except Sir Alonne. is terrible. They are not just bad. They are Really bad. And the path betweem them and the closest bonfire isn't more than red carpet over a bed with nails you will be forced to walk over and over. For what? A boring overpowered boss that is a reskin of something you already fought. Shulva had NPC's! Iron Keep , besides of Sir alonne, wich is awesome, had the boring Smelter demon, Wich is the same Smelter demon from the main campagin, but does more damage. And finally Ivory king had the 2 king pets... Wich are reskins of the pet you just fought right before you fight them.\n\n+You can now carry 3 different weapons, wich is good considering you will sometimes need to change them before they break and 4 different rings.\n+Better netcoding\n+You can always be invaded now. No matter if you are hollowed\n+There is now a penalty for being hollowed that isn't only not being able to summon partners. But also you know lose max life for every tim eyou died. Up to 50 % if your max health\n+PC version is an excellent port... For what it is , it's ok.\n+For better or worst. The game flow is more straightforward. It's easier to figure out what to do next since the maps are less complex\n+Most weapons are viable now. Except the joke ones.\n+You can break some chests in the fight. So you better be careful while checking for mimics.\n+most spells are rebalanced and were given better animtions\n+Lower loading times, atleast for the PC version.\n\nAt long term. DS2 is as good as DS1 and none of it's flaws hinders the fun of the game enough to call it BAD, exceptfor the graphics that have less polish. But without doubt the best first impression is given by dark Souls 1. 2 is a good follow up. But no matter wich one you play first. The one that beats here is DS 1. It's more polished for it's time. And the game really looked like it was pushing he console to it's limits. Dark souls 2 played too safe. Wich is understandable, but unfortunely it was also what made it stand behind the first game.","April 11","true","359.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an action RPG that takes place in an eerie world that feels utterly hopeless. The great thing about the gloomy atmosphere is the fact you feel very much a part of the world you're in and not necessarily the central foretold-hero-that-would-save-the-planet cliche.\n\nThe story is there but in a way that you sort of unravel what's happened as you play. At times you may need to look up on wiki pages to get a handle on things going unfolding around you, but that's normal for everyone. That being said, the story won't leave you completely in the dark, it's just a bit different in pacing and storytelling than conventional means.\n\nIf you'd like a challenge and want to play a refreshing RPG, I can't recommend this game enough. Initially I stopped playing two hours in and put the game away for a few months, but once I picked it up again out of boredom, I could not put it down. The game is a bit challenging as anyone with eyes have probably read from either game critics or ♥♥♥♥ measuring forum posts, but don't let dying get to you. It is a lot like life in that failures will come and go, but once you start to adapt and become patient, you will ultimately start to see amazing progress in an unforgettable world.\n\nThis is certainly one of those games that is fun to discuss with friends after you play it.","September 21, 2015","true","253.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This makes the game much more exhilarting throughout the game and almost will never get boring, because of this you get a lot of play time for reasonbly cheap game. The level designs are just absolutely stunning and beautiful, but can also be very dark. Every area you go to gives you an entire new experience with a plethora of new enemies with more dangers. Dark Souls 2 has alot of things to offer so if you are looking for a difficult RPG then try it out!\n(you should also use a controller for this game)","September 23, 2015","true","237.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did play it though, although not to completion.\n\nFirst off, let's get Dark Souls out of the way. The first game had much better art direction. It was better overall, but this game has much more polished controls, graphics and combat mechanics.\n\nWhile the bosses and level design are nothing extraordinary, once you get past a certain point, the world starts to grow on you. There are some mob designs which I found quite interesting and enjoyable. The bosses, though, are for the most part forgettable. There are a lot of small miniboss type encounters which are not very inspired.\n\nI did play the original release of Dark Souls II and I can tell they applied a thick coat of polish this time around. Enemy placements make more sense now, and the level design feels more consistent with the lore. It's almost as if the original release was half-baked... After 6 or 7 hours you start to feel a strong sense of exploration. Darkness means something now, and you will be using torches.\n\nPVP works, for the most part. I'm not a big fan of online play, so I can't comment too much on that. I didn't try coop.\n\nChances are that if you know what Dark Souls is, you have already bought this anyway, but in any case I'd like to say this for everyone wondering about this game (and this release): in my opinion, this is the proper version of Dark Souls II. Besides actually feeling complete from a design standpoint, it includes the DLCs, which are in some opinions better than the main game itself, so it's a great value package.","August 18, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure it doesn't have the compelling story like its predecessor, nor an infamous character like Solaire, but all sequels have never been as popular as the first. Dark Souls 2 may not be the best game, but I don't regret a single minute I put into this game. The DLC's are all amazing, some of the battles being the toughest and most interesting throughout the game. The menus and massive amounts of armor choices are somewhat confusing, that would be my only complaint.

I will preface by saying that I have no played or seen the original Dark Souls 2 so I cannot compare to it.\n\nFirst thing to notice is that the keyprompts are still displaying controller buttons so learning the game can be needlessly complicated. The keybindings are rebindable however, which is good since the original bindings are questionable. One thing you will want to do is enable "Disable Double-Click" which causes the game to delay an attack while it looks for a second input to turn it into a strong attack, delaying the action by a second. Doding is once again bound to the same key as sprint, making the dodge occur on key release, not key press which will delay the input and potentially mean that you get hit. You don't want to get hit. There is a little bit of input lag as well so timing, looking for tells, and knowledge play vital roles, though getting hit by an attack even though you "dodged it" is irritating.\n\nThere are a lot of graphical options as well (though no borderless windowed). Speaking of graphics, this game is very pretty, good setpieces and locations with some nice lighting effects really make this game look good. Animations are smooth, though there is a an issue when it comes to hitboxes on certain boss attacks. This is probably the worst part since you can't actually adapt to the fight since you don't know the timing for the dodge. It always just feels weird, and in a Souls game that is bad.\n\nThis weirdness is also in the difficulty of the game, which is highly varied. Some bosses required you to dodge 100% of everything and shield nothing, while other fights can be done by just circling the boss who will only throw out slow linear attacks.  Enemies will also group up more than in Dark Souls, though they won't chase far meaning that running is almost always an option. There are only a few points that have a trap set that you cannot see by carefully examining your surrounds, though thankfully these are few and far between.\n\nWhile dodging may be the biggest issue, my personal peeve is where you lose maximum HP on death. Every death past the first one from "human" will result in a HP loss of 5% up to maximum of 50% (though an item in the early game limits this to 75%). The HP loss mechanic is sopmething that I can understand from a lore persepctive (you are slowly becoming more hollowed), though if a player is repeatedly dying they probably need that health so that they have more time to learn the mechanics. This hollowing can be reversed by using a human effigy though this brings about another issue. You can always be invaded (PvP'd) unless you BURN another effigy, though being at maximum hollow state reduces the likeliness of being invaded. Also there are areas where you can be summoned to fight without having any say in the matter, which can be seriously immersion breaking. Thankfully, losing these results in no real penalty.\n\nThe lore of the game is decent and told through the item descriptions, but doesn't feel as connected as Dark Souls where you could understand why the world was designed in a certain manner. That isn't to say that it is empty, just not quite fleshed out.\n\nIt's a good game, a mostly fair game, a hard game, but it does have a few issues that may influence your experience.\n\n","October 31, 2015","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have not played the original Dark Souls 2 that much so I can't compare Scholars of the First Sin to it. Anyways, SotFS is a remix of the original Dark Souls 2, with different enemy & item placements, changes to the level design and a new end boss. It comes with all the Dark Souls 2 DLCs. Controller is necessary because the Keyboard & Mouse controls are still garbage.\n\nWhen starting the game you can choose different preset builds to suit your playstyle, just like the first DS game. Same different types of weapons and spells as the first game too but dark magic is now a thing called Hexes. Bonfires serve the same purpose as the first game as well except your weapons/armor are automatically repaired if they're not broken and you can fast travel right from the start. one thing that's different is that enemies will not respawn from sitting at a bonfire if you've killed them too many times, esentially forcing you to progress instead of farming or grinding. However you can burn these things called bonfires aesthetics that will make all the enemies and most treasure respawn but the difficulty will be increased in that area to a NG+ level of difficulty. Joining the Covenant of Champions will up the difficulty too but will make the enemies respawn indefinitely.\n\nThe game plays a little bit more faster than the first game, movements are quicker, enemies are too. Takes a while to get used to at first but it's an improvement. The game is not without it's flaws though. With fast travel being accessible so early in the game it's very convenient but also takes away from immersion since you don't have to play areas through from the opposite direction thus seeing less of it. That's actually more of a nitpick I guess. A lot of the enemy encounters seem to be poorly laid out and there just to annoy you but with them being able to despawn, you can just brute force your way through an area until all the enemies never come back, eliminating the challenge.\n\nAfter beating it I still prefer the first Dark Souls over this one but I still think it's an awesome game.","February 25","true","137.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This opens up the game to be the true monstrosity that it was designed to be and the gratification that follows is even greater then the burning of your hands after smacking them into your table repeatedly.\n\nOverall the visuals are great (PC 60fps yes please), The story (alough mostly unknown) is compelling enough to keep pursuing truth, The options for combat are honestly near Limitless (hence the recommendation above), and finally the growth of your actual skill is extremly noticable as you move through the game which in itself is very rewarding.\n\nA must play for anyone who does or ever has called themselves a gamer.","February 20","true","122.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite being easier than its predecessors (Demon`s Souls (PS exclusive) and Dark Souls) it is still a very challenging game. The PvP is better than Dark Souls.\nIn my opinion:\n\nPros:\n+ combat system + the first time you play dark souls or its predecessors it is noticible that combat is not underated as it is for exemple in Skyrim (which is a very good game too). Facing multiple enemies is an overwelming task, normally resulting in death. This is not a hack and slash game like Diablo, where you face 5 to 20 enemies and you hit 3 spells and obliterate them. Back to one of my favorite games...when you play skyrim you don`t feel the weapon impact on the enemy, it just slices through as if there isn`t an obstacle. But the Poise system and the game physics itself make you feel like you are in a true combat.\n+ game difficulty + this game is hard ... not very hard and not even close to impossible where computer usually cheats to kill you. Therefore, you can have lots of fun trying to crawl your way through the game.\n+ character versatility + you can create any kind of character ... a full plate warrior hold a great sword... a cleric casting heals and lightning bolts ... a naked guy casting spells... a rogue with light armor and backstabing... a caster with heavy armor ... ANYTHING ... people tend to use greatswords as you will see in multiplayer ... i think Freud explains\n+ panoply of items + lots of cool items and spells ... good looking gear\n\nCons:\n- PAUSE - this game DOES NOT pause. So you should expect some problems in real life when you just CAN`T let the joystick go. Thou i think this is fun, i died a couple of times because of this.\n- the world -  i don`t know how to explain this. The cenario is fantastic and the atmosphere is CREEPY. But ... i don`t know something is missing... so i say ... imagine SKYRIM but with this game`s physics and an ominous atmhosphere.\n- the NPCs - this is not my opinion ...but people always complain to me about this feature. They say the NPCs are miles high on LSD because dialog makes no sense. Some say that japanese dialog are novele-vague, just like their animes, don`t make sense. BUT... i think this is what the game proposes ... everyone you meet in the game is DEAD and LOOSING their minds... including you!\n\nAs a fan: play this game, but before, play Demon Soul`s\n\n","July 22, 2015","true","88.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What a fantastic and thrilling adventure. It grips you from the start and never lets go. Although the game can be stressful at times, especially when you're stuck on that one boss you've tried to beat a thousand times, it more than makes up for it the moment that you beat that boss or an area. It takes the brilliant qualities of Dark Souls (1) and improves upon them in many ways.\n\nFor one this game has such a mesmerising environment. Many times i found my self stepping back from the grind and just being awe struck at the beauty and detail thats went into this vast and exciting world. From the thrilling brilliance of the Sun on the sea in Majula to the eerily dark feel of the Black gulch's green glow, it has it all. The terrain were battles take place plays a more important role aswell with it being much easier to fall off a ledge or get backed into a corner and ive had my tumbles in this game with more than a few bosses and mobs, talking about you Dragonrider.\n\nThe mobs in this game accentuate the grand landscapes in this game with their impressive details and suiting characteristics. They're much more difficult in my opinion than this games predecossor and theres alot more of them than compared to the original Dark Souls 2. A few of them present a challenge to match that of a boss which emphasizes the difficulty of this game and adds to the relief when you finally beat an area. A memorable moment for me was getting chased by a million spiders in an attempt to fight their boss, the sheer panic and resolve i was feeling in that moment is a highlight for me in this game. They are beautiful in their own way and they fill their respective environment quite naturally and fit in with the characteristics of the boss they protect.\n\nI found the bosses in this game very rewarding, particularly the DLC bosses. They were exceptionally designed and very challenging. Though the main theme in their deisign seemed to knight related there were a few that were outstanding such as The Dukes dear Freja. There are times when you're fighting that one grand boss and you can feel your heart racing and you find yourself drawing closer to the screen in such a tense moment trying to get that killing hit and when you finally beat it that wash of victory that comes over you makes all the struggling, all the blood, sweat and tears so worth it. And then its back to the grind for the next area.\n\nThe co-op in the game feels vastly more improved upon from the previous Dark Souls (1) introducing a new way to connect based on whats called soul memory. I liked the introduction of different types of summoned allies such as shades which expanded the range of help you can get. The PvP was exciting and many aspects of this games PvP match closely to that of Dark Souls (1) which meant you never lost your favrite covenant. There are alot of options and ways to go about PvP to make it accessible to a much larger amount of players.\n\nThere is a MASSIVE amount of weapons and armor in this game that cater to a great amount of fighting styles. They are very well contructed in how they look and how they behave in combat. There are the extreme forms of both heavy tank with 2 handed great hammer to nimble backstabber wielding 2 swift daggers with everything you can think of in between. I found the magic and spells in this game to be very elegent. There were alot to choose from for each individual style whether that be magnificent spells and angelic miracles to tenebrous hexes and wrathful pyromancies. They all add this sense of individuality to the game as you choose what your character is going to be.\n\nThe 'story' in this game requires attention to detail which can take a few play throughs to fully understand. I very much enjoyed my experience with this games story and it made me feel apart of its world. Plus i really liked option of 2 endings which i very much appreciated.\n\nThis fantastic game brought out so many great feelings from within me and although i got stressed, annoyed and angry they were all dwarfed by the explosion of happiness when i finally beat this game. No other game series quite captured that same affect for me making this one of the best games ive played.\n\nIf you're reading this i HIGHLY recommend you get this game, more so if you're a fan of RPG's and more so than that if you liked Dark Souls (1). Its different in quite a few ways from its predecessor but change isnt always a bad thing and this is a case were it was done right.

But don't come back crying when it punishes you over and over and over again.\n\nAfter completing it over and over again (100% achievements require two complete gameplays, and third half-way there), I can tell: it becomes MUCH easier once you've played long enough, learned dodge/block/attack patterns, upgraded your weapons and figured out how to fight specific enemies. And upgraded your stats (I ended up with lvl 250+).\n\nYou'll be getting invaded at random times, and sometimes the invader won't play fair (lags, teleport backstabs ect), just be ready for it.

The fact that you can play with you're own path to the bosses is just amazing, the level up system is just wow I honestly recommend this game to buy.

The game evolves around the player character who begins with a human who is cursed to always resurrect after dying. To break the curse, the undead travels to the fallen kingdom of Drangleic and is tasked by the Emerald Herald with obtaining four Great Souls from other powerful undead.\n\nThe game's plot is minimalistic, and varies based upon how much the player explores. There is little guidance and lack of direction given. The player must come to his/her intuition as to which path one must take, which can ultimately lead to a dead end, desired destination or even branching paths. Despite all this however, the plot is deeply ingrained in the essence of light and dark and how one cannot survive with the presence of one another.\n\nThis game is not just an ordinary casual RPG. It is an intense RPG for hardcore players who seek a challenge, as dying is frequent and bosses are abundant. To add to that, enemies deal a lot of damage and players must learn to time their blocks/parries, attacks as well as dodges rather than hack n' slashing. Save points (bonfires) are limited and scattered far from one another. The game evolves around the concept of using deaths to teach players to learn from their mistakes, as well as how to react in almost relentlessly hostile environments. From experience, there has not been many RPGs that has challenged me the way the Dark Souls series has. I must reiterate: this game is EXTREMELY difficult.\n\nThe button mapping and camera controls for keyboard is messy. If one were to consider buying this game, it is a PREREQUISITE to have a gamepad/controller or you will be in for a hard time. The graphics is not the best, but it is made up by the deep gameplay and non-stop action.\n\nOverall, Dark Souls is a quality RPG game that challenges players to a new level. It's gameplay may be minimalistic and feel like a lack of direction, but it was designed in that manner to allow the player to unravel and uncover the deep story plot through thorough exploration. It is matched with sheer happiness and relief upon progress and completion. If adventure is to surprise and mystify you and invite you to uncover the secrets of a forgotten world, then Dark Souls is a great game for you. If entertainment is fun without failure and progress without pain, you'll have to find another game.\n\nMORE on the actual expansion/DLC...\n*Includes the three previously released DLC packs, Crown of the Sunken King, Crown of the Old Iron King, and Crown of the Ivory King.\n- Additional NPCs added for an enhanced story experience.\n- Parameter adjustments for improved game balance.\n- Expanded item descriptions.\n- Improved online matchmaking functionality.\n\n- Additional upgrades to graphics, sound and performance.\n- Increase in maximum online players in a single session (6 total).\n- A complete revamp of character, enemy and item placement, which gives players a new experience.\n- The Forlorn will hunt the player down throughout their journey. Their equipment can also be acquired by the player. These items include their Armor, Greatsword and Scythe.","February 18","true","35.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But oh how wrong I was, as with most people's experience playing a Souls game I found myself dying a lot though never really in the beginning, but somehow I never felt like giving up, soon enough I had learned the combat though I was playing with keyboard and mouse for my first playthrough.\n\nOne of my complaints is that the tutorial isn't really fun or engaging, and unlike the first Souls game it doesn't go strait up and tell you that it's going to be a difficult game that requires thought trial and error, quite the contrary actually it presents itself as easy and simple with slow yet engaging combat. This is one of my main complaints with the game, it does a poor job with the intro (Compared to Dark souls 1) despite all the beautiful environments it doesn't really prepare you much for the rest of the game gameplay-wise.\n\nI can summarize the things the beginning teaches you into 4 things\n\n1.if an enemy does something back away or block\n2.when something looks dangerous don't go near it\n3.summons help so find human effigies\n4.things will ambush you, so if something looks dead hit it once\n\nDespite what I say about the intro it is by no means terrible there are just a lot of things it could do better.\n\nThe next issue I have with this game is the bland design choices. Though most of the areas still look very nice they aren't creative or interesting With the exception of the dlc areas (I'll get to them later) and places like the dragon's aerie and the shrine of amana, in most areas the enemy designs are just humanoids of different sizes and armors. The areas feel linear and lazily done and unnaturally put together. Instead of feeling like a living breathing world it just feels like a generic fantasy world. Most of the areas though are fun to explore and have several secrets to make you go back to them.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game though is the newly implemented mechanics (Except for soul memory and limited enemy spawns, they suck). Though I know many people will disagree with me, I prefer the rolling mechanics of ds2 and demon's souls to that of ds1, If you prefer to freely roll in any direction while locked on this game handles it very well I think. Dual wielding actually works (Though they never explain how in the game), It may not be exceptionally powerful but it can be fun to mess around with. The new gravity mechanics I find have been greatly improved with weight affecting the damage more. The new UI and durability though need to be reverted back to their original form in ds1 since they have become even more confusing than they already were.\n\nThe dlc is one of the better things in this game, though not as good as the Artorias of the abyss dlc for ds1 the dlc can provide some good fun. The areas and bosses (Except for The ancient explorer, Varg, and Cera) have cooler designs and are generally better than most in the base game (Though the enemies could still use some work) even though there are a lot of callbacks to ds1. The dlc's were one of my highlights while playing and you can definitely sink a lot of hours into them.\n\nThe story is good but the characters aren't too memorable and they all just seem depressed. There is definitely a huge expanse of lore to read in the item descriptions though they changed some in the sotfs version which was pretty scummy.\n\nNow for a simple review i would rank it like this.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nDesign 7/10\nGraphics 8/10\nStory 8/10\n\nVerdict 8.5/10\n\nThis game is good for someone who just wants to see what a Souls game is like and isn't all too familiar with dodge and block combat, or someone who has already played through ds1 and desperately craves more no matter the quality.\n\nIf you're familiar with games like these though i would skip ds2 and go play ds1.\n","February 22","true","355.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But enough reminiscing, I need to list the good and bad I found in the game, also, go read my Dark Souls 1 points, I think that is the better of the 2 souls games.\n\nPros\n-The game is extremely open-ended\n-The game doesn't wipe your butt when you die, A.K.A. baby you. It slaps you in the face when you die and I love it!\n-The main combat is very fun, with simple light and heavy attacks and dual wielding being a viable option for your character, rolling is also necessary, being the primary way of you not taking damage (best I could do to shorten the mechanics).\n-Every monster can kill you, even the lowest level monsters... Yes!\n-You can level up however you want, if you want to be able to roll more, endurance, if you want to equip more, vitality, etc.\n-The game looks pretty! But I play a game for the gameplay, I didn't spend too long on looking at how purdy the game is.\n-The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful\n-The environments are also very pretty, featuring: forest, cave docks, ruins in a volcano, foggy death forest... Wait, those have been used before, nevermind that last part y'all!\n-Even though the story is very hidden, this game has an incredible story, it does require a lot of searching\n\nCons\n\n-The game is actually unfair... What?!? Yes I said it, lemme use Velstadt, the Royal Aegis, his initial phase is simple, learn his attacks and keep circling behind him, simple right? Well phase 2, speed him up by 2x, he feels literally impossible, why? He has an attack that he will do two side-swipes then he has a 50/50 chance of either thrusting his giant mace or to put it on his shoulder, the preparation looks the same too!\n-THE COLORS ARE KILLING MY EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n-I can't see two feet in front of my face in areas of darkness, at least I only used a sword and no shield!\n-Health always regenerates over time, which means that even if you use your Estus Flask (healing potion) your health takes a bit of time to fill up, which meant alot of stupid deaths because I drank my estus and got hit by a strong enemy causing me to lose at least 30,000 souls Velstadt!\n-Also on healing it takes forever to use your Estus, as in it takes at least 2 1/2 seconds to actually start healing and another 2 seconds to actually get maximized healing\n-Healing items are practically useless, the only time I used them was when I was near a bonfire, meaning that I needed just a little dose of Sunny D or in my case Texas Orange Juice (so good)!\n-The environments are very much the same as most RPG's\n\nEven though I hated that the bosses and enemies were EXTREMELY unfair at times, I enjoyed it once I beat it with 1 pixel of health (I wish I was thinking but I wasn't and forgot to screenshot, sorry call me a liar plz, thnx), and I really didn't like the game as much as Souls 1, I loved that and Bloodborne even more so. I am writing this march 18th waiting for Dark Souls 3 on April 12th, much hype.\nBut what do I rate this? 6.8/10\nThe game had a great plan with the mechanics but the problem is that the developers thought hard was unfair, play Dark Souls 1 first, it was fun. This game had very RPG copy and paste environments like most, there was also the estus that was just sooooo slooooow. but do I reccomend it? Kind of, it was hard for me to decide between reccomending it or not, but after quite some time I gotta say, yeah, it is nowhere near as good as Souls 1 or Bloodborne but it is good if you like souls, but I believe my opinion is very unpopular, now I gotta go get some sleep and let the trolls start commenting.\nAnd remember I said 6.8/10? That is subject to change. But 5/10 is average meaning this game is really good, not great, but good.","March 17","true","113.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not happy about this, and other people get the same crashes and every effort to fix it has been attempted, but I'm still leaving positive feedback for the quality of the game and the fact that the vast majority of players don't experience these crashes. I played through maybe the first quarter of the game before the crashes became too irritating.\n\nThe game itself is one of the best games I have played for a very long time. The atmosphere is one of the best things about it, giving you great immersion and pulling you into the story right from the start. The challenging gameplay adds to this spooky atmosphere because you'll find that although the game is dark in nature, the main reason you will be scared is actually because you know you might die, not because of spooky monsters or music or anything. Veterans of souls games may find this experience differs as they know how to run through scenarios. In any case I love this atmosphere DESPITE the fact that I'm not generally into dark fantasy games.\n\nThe graphics I would give a solid 9/10. Great bloom effects and even though I notice that the texture quality on highest settings are slightly dated, the game does a good job in fooling you into believing you are playing a next-gen 2016 game by employing great use of shadows, blur, reflections and bloom effects. The other great thing about the graphics is that I feel that lower-mid tier PCs will be able to run this game no problem. The highest settings seem very light to run compared to other games, and you will be getting graphics quality which at a glance look to be toward the standard of games like GTA5, MGS5 etc, while being much less demanding on your GPU and CPU. I honestly don't understand how they managed to cram so much pristine graphics quality and effects into it with such efficiency.\n\nHowever be prepared for the compatibility issues with certain graphics cards. If you have an AMD 7800series GPU I would avoid this game. I have also heard other complain with the same random graphics freezes so other cards may have issues with this game. This PC port issue is disappointing given how great this game generally is and you should give serious consideration to this before buying this game. I would only seriously recommend buying this game without any doubt, if you have two different options for machines, for example if you have both a desktop and a laptop, or if you have two graphics cards, etc.\n(Believe me I have tried forcing dx9, reinstalling, verifying cache, disabling steam overlay, disabling GPU overclock, closing AMD settings UI, etc)\n\nPros:\nChallenging and refreshing gameplay\nGreat graphics while still being light on your CPU/GPU\nPretty well thought out and unique levelling system\nLong story\nGood tutorial\n\nCons:\nCompatibility issues with some hardware, causing crashes\nUsing consumable items to enter multiplayer/PvP doesn't make much sense","March 20","true","33.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Reworked poise so that it isn't as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it was in DkS1.\n+ Tons of customization - there are lots of armors and weapons. Feels a lot less restricting. Boss weapons also pretty much all have a unique attack.\n+ DLC is great all around. Best bosses, best soundtrack, best level design, interesting lore that shines a new perspective upon the vanilla game; great items as well.\n\n+/-  Level design is all over the place. Some areas have some good vertical elements that adds variety with some cheeky hiding places for items - particularly Drangleic Castle and Earthen Peak\nHowever, most areas are just a straight corridor, extremely horizontal (almost to the point of being straight corridors) with no shortcuts or anything interesting going on like alternate paths.\n\n- Story (or lore) is very disappointing. It's basically Dark Souls 1 with different names. Plus it has a lot of references to DkS1 (every boss soul basically contains "this soul is reminiscent of a being from another time..." clearly hinting at DkS1 characters. It's just a nostalgia trip. There's nothing new here if you're looking for story.\n- Soundtrack isn't all that good. Only theme I remember is Majula and that's because it plays everytime you go there.\n- Enemies are placed to ♥♥♥♥ you in the mouth and frustrate you in some areas, instead of providing some challenge. Expect some unavoidable 1v3s (versus powerful enemies, not hollows) or worse.\n- Terrible world design manifesting in its disconnected world, to the point where it doesn't even make sense. You're in a swampy poisonous area, take an elevator up and you're suddenly in a burning lava covered castle.\n\nIf you're looking for more Dark Souls, it's worth picking up. It's more of a "filler game" cashgrab than anything.","January 1","true","204.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially since you pay even less if you had the base game but want the dlc.\n\nIt does get significantly harder because they revamped the enemy placements, wich means that if you are new to the game you might not see a big difference but if you played the original you will see that items are in different locations, and there are sometimes more and differently placed enemies in areas that didnt use to have them.\n\nThis is all bundled with some fixes and upgrades that in all honesty should be included for no extra charge but oh well...\n\n\nFinal Veredict: Its worth the price if you didnt previously had the dlc or game.

Best game series ever.  Dark Zelda for adults.  I took my time on the last play thru to try and get everything I could.  I still think I only have about a 75% of what is out there.  There are so many places to explore it is great.\n\nCon's-  DS1 had a better guard break that worked 100% of the time.  DS2 hit boxes from the enemies doesn't seem as tight which leads to me getting hit when my roll was out of the way on screen.  This doesn't happen that often but I just think DS1 was a little tighter with the combat.  I think fast travel should of been given out at about 25% of the game not from the start, it makes the world not feel as alive as DS1.\n\nOverall 9/10\n\nI cant wait for DS3 to come out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowReaper29/recommended/335300/","ShadowReaper29","CyberWolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowReaper29/","145 products in account","Heres my quick breakdown for this amazing game, continue past the PROS & CONS for my full review.\n\n---PROS---\n\n-A huge and beautifully designed world\n-Exciting and engaging combat\n-Detailed and challenging bosses and mobs\n-A stupendous amount of weapons\n-Entrancing music\n-Friendly and helpful community\n-Fair and fun PvP\n\n---CONS---\n\n-Lack of variety in bosses\n-Online connectivity issues for co-op and PvP (Sometimes)\n-Massive learning curve for non Dark Souls players (Not an issue if you like a challenge)\n\nAll in all im giving this game a 9.5/10\n\n\n-Full review-\n\n\nI have nothing but praise (the sun) for this game. What a fantastic and thrilling adventure. It grips you from the start and never lets go. Although the game can be stressful at times, especially when you're stuck on that one boss you've tried to beat a thousand times, it more than makes up for it the moment that you beat that boss or an area. It takes the brilliant qualities of Dark Souls (1) and improves upon them in many ways.\n\nFor one this game has such a mesmerising environment. Many times i found my self stepping back from the grind and just being awe struck at the beauty and detail thats went into this vast and exciting world. From the thrilling brilliance of the Sun on the sea in Majula to the eerily dark feel of the Black gulch's green glow, it has it all. The terrain were battles take place plays a more important role aswell with it being much easier to fall off a ledge or get backed into a corner and ive had my tumbles in this game with more than a few bosses and mobs, talking about you Dragonrider.\n\nThe mobs in this game accentuate the grand landscapes in this game with their impressive details and suiting characteristics. They're much more difficult in my opinion than this games predecossor and theres alot more of them than compared to the original Dark Souls 2. A few of them present a challenge to match that of a boss which emphasizes the difficulty of this game and adds to the relief when you finally beat an area. A memorable moment for me was getting chased by a million spiders in an attempt to fight their boss, the sheer panic and resolve i was feeling in that moment is a highlight for me in this game. They are beautiful in their own way and they fill their respective environment quite naturally and fit in with the characteristics of the boss they protect.\n\nI found the bosses in this game very rewarding, particularly the DLC bosses. They were exceptionally designed and very challenging. Though the main theme in their deisign seemed to knight related there were a few that were outstanding such as The Dukes dear Freja. There are times when you're fighting that one grand boss and you can feel your heart racing and you find yourself drawing closer to the screen in such a tense moment trying to get that killing hit and when you finally beat it that wash of victory that comes over you makes all the struggling, all the blood, sweat and tears so worth it. And then its back to the grind for the next area.\n\nThe co-op in the game feels vastly more improved upon from the previous Dark Souls (1) introducing a new way to connect based on whats called soul memory. I liked the introduction of different types of summoned allies such as shades which expanded the range of help you can get. The PvP was exciting and many aspects of this games PvP match closely to that of Dark Souls (1) which meant you never lost your favrite covenant. There are alot of options and ways to go about PvP to make it accessible to a much larger amount of players.\n\nThere is a MASSIVE amount of weapons and armor in this game that cater to a great amount of fighting styles. They are very well contructed in how they look and how they behave in combat. There are the extreme forms of both heavy tank with 2 handed great hammer to nimble backstabber wielding 2 swift daggers with everything you can think of in between. I found the magic and spells in this game to be very elegent. There were alot to choose from for each individual style whether that be magnificent spells and angelic miracles to tenebrous hexes and wrathful pyromancies. They all add this sense of individuality to the game as you choose what your character is going to be.\n\nThe 'story' in this game requires attention to detail which can take a few play throughs to fully understand. I very much enjoyed my experience with this games story and it made me feel apart of its world. Plus i really liked option of 2 endings which i very much appreciated.\n\nThis fantastic game brought out so many great feelings from within me and although i got stressed, annoyed and angry they were all dwarfed by the explosion of happiness when i finally beat this game. No other game series quite captured that same affect for me making this one of the best games ive played.\n\nIf you're reading this i HIGHLY recommend you get this game, more so if you're a fan of RPG's and more so than that if you liked Dark Souls (1). Its different in quite a few ways from its predecessor but change isnt always a bad thing and this is a case were it was done right.

I will preface by saying that I have no played or seen the original Dark Souls 2 so I cannot compare to it.\n\nFirst thing to notice is that the keyprompts are still displaying controller buttons so learning the game can be needlessly complicated. The keybindings are rebindable however, which is good since the original bindings are questionable. One thing you will want to do is enable "Disable Double-Click" which causes the game to delay an attack while it looks for a second input to turn it into a strong attack, delaying the action by a second. Doding is once again bound to the same key as sprint, making the dodge occur on key release, not key press which will delay the input and potentially mean that you get hit. You don't want to get hit. There is a little bit of input lag as well so timing, looking for tells, and knowledge play vital roles, though getting hit by an attack even though you "dodged it" is irritating.\n\nThere are a lot of graphical options as well (though no borderless windowed). Speaking of graphics, this game is very pretty, good setpieces and locations with some nice lighting effects really make this game look good. Animations are smooth, though there is a an issue when it comes to hitboxes on certain boss attacks. This is probably the worst part since you can't actually adapt to the fight since you don't know the timing for the dodge. It always just feels weird, and in a Souls game that is bad.\n\nThis weirdness is also in the difficulty of the game, which is highly varied. Some bosses required you to dodge 100% of everything and shield nothing, while other fights can be done by just circling the boss who will only throw out slow linear attacks.  Enemies will also group up more than in Dark Souls, though they won't chase far meaning that running is almost always an option. There are only a few points that have a trap set that you cannot see by carefully examining your surrounds, though thankfully these are few and far between.\n\nWhile dodging may be the biggest issue, my personal peeve is where you lose maximum HP on death. Every death past the first one from "human" will result in a HP loss of 5% up to maximum of 50% (though an item in the early game limits this to 75%). The HP loss mechanic is sopmething that I can understand from a lore persepctive (you are slowly becoming more hollowed), though if a player is repeatedly dying they probably need that health so that they have more time to learn the mechanics. This hollowing can be reversed by using a human effigy though this brings about another issue. You can always be invaded (PvP'd) unless you BURN another effigy, though being at maximum hollow state reduces the likeliness of being invaded. Also there are areas where you can be summoned to fight without having any say in the matter, which can be seriously immersion breaking. Thankfully, losing these results in no real penalty.\n\nThe lore of the game is decent and told through the item descriptions, but doesn't feel as connected as Dark Souls where you could understand why the world was designed in a certain manner. That isn't to say that it is empty, just not quite fleshed out.\n\nIt's a good game, a mostly fair game, a hard game, but it does have a few issues that may influence your experience.\n\n","October 31, 2015","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you do not have a controller, you will have a rough first half an hour to an hour figuring out how to do anything besides attack and move. Once you spend time and get all of it down, the game picks back up.

You will die, and you will die and you will die, but with each death you become that more adapt and vigilant.

I feel that Dark Souls II, although not a masterpiece, is definitely a great expression of those characteristics.\n\nDidn't like how easy it felt, took me a few hours to die for the first time, which was from just opening a poison chest.

Don't expect an in-depth Pros-Cons Review*\n\n\n\nDemon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2. All great.\n\n\n\nLong Thing:\nThe fanbase complains that this was a failed Souls because of a different director and it wasn't dark enough and whatever and whatnot. Too bad they didn't liked it, I personally enjoyed the living ♥♥♥♥ out of it.\n\nThe changes in gameplay mechanics done here are great. A bit difficult to understand in the beginning, but definitely cool. Different.\nAfter getting an Attribute to a certain level it felt horrible to keep leveling. Stamina comes to mind; after getting it to 20, every point you spend on it gives you only 1 extra number. Praise the Sun for some rings.\nThe fact that you can warp anywhere you've discovered before right from the beginning is a real pain saver.\nThey added new magic, Hex.\nCovenants are cool, although Blue Sentinels is broken. Too bad.\nI don't really know if this is new, but Maces bring death to heavy armored foes (I discovered it quite late).\nThey also added some new type of weapons, and hybrids.\nThe winks done to DS1, and the secret things are great (you now have to press X/A to open illusory walls).\nLore never fails. Gadamnit, I mean, LORE, what a fantastic thing.\nThe DLCs are also pretty cool. Kinda OP in my opinion, but after leveling a bit or gitting gud you're good to go.\nI haven't really played Demon's in years, and I haven't really been much into PvP (my main focus is simply playing solo and helping others), but dueling in this game is great. Still needa git gud.\nThe above said, Combat overall feels like sugar.\nCo-Op now works with a thing called soul Memory, not Levels. You can be a Level 150 (the PvP Meta) with 9kkSM or a Level 240 with 9kkSM.\n\n\nThis is the Souls game I've played the most (PS3 + PC). The more I play it, the more I like it.\n\nIt is with this Souls that I discovered the magnificence of making Builds. I usually played like whatever in the past Souls, but this one made me really get the hang of it (that's because I am a more mature man right now that when Demon's came out, and then DS1. It has nothing to do with DS2 being awesome. I have hair in my body).\n\nCan't wait for DS3.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying the game, and happen to read this review, please:\n-EXPLORE, you have no idea how many things you can miss.\n-DON'T RUSH IT, give yourself time to avoid dying (even if the boss is 1 hit away from death)\n-DURABILITY, weapons break after a number of swings. Have a couple extra in your inventory just in case.\n-BE WARY OF GANKING, you'll be fighting 3+v1 every now and then.\n-WEAKNESS: ROLLING, I've never gone turtle, but given a new Attribute in the Leveling System I consider rolling the ultimate thing.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention you can Voice Chat now.\n\n\n\nShort Thing:\nI really liked this game.","January 16","true","169.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just make sure you're logged in when buying the upgrade.\n\nAfter playing both versions, it's easy to say that SotFS is what Dark Souls 2 should have been. Most fans of the series can play through the original game blindfolded. WIth Scholar they sort of cranked up the number of enemies and NPC invasions making careful approach more advised. For returning players, I recommend the Champions covenant for even harder experience. Places like Iron Keep will eat you alive.\n\nGraphics are exactly the same as old DS2. They shouldn't even mention "updated graphics" in the description. You're not getting any dx11 features.\n\nOnline play is unchanged except for the addition of Agape Ring. Basically FromSoft realized they ♥♥♥♥ed up with the Soul Memory ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but rather than scratching it for the "remake" they just sort of made it better or worse depending who you're asking. I haven't been invaded ONCE during 30 hours of gameplay. Bell invasions still happen but that took ages. Rat Covenant is probably dead.

I've been playing RPGs since like the fifth grade and with no doubt is this series, if you take your time to really understand and absorb all the subtleties, one of the best at rewarding you for  the time you put into it.\n\nIt's absolutely beautiful ever step of the way. Not just in like a superficial "Oh the graphics DX12... FXAA... Light Shaft engine overclock..." Like the artistic direction is so sublimely awesome. You'll come across a boss and you're just amazed at how picturesque the encounter and NPC is. And this is very far from stepping on the toes of how you feel when you're traversing through each zone.\n\nThe gameplay is immensely challenging and requires you to pay enough attention to make quick and accurate decisions. And it's pretty detrimental when you can't, or make a wrong move. But like I said if you bother to learn ur respective stats and skillsets, and you're able to understand how different enemies envoke you to change what you're doing, this game will make you wan't to play it for hours and hours. Similar to how previous expansions of WoW felt. You have to do some homework.\n\nTactics aren't just something to make thing's smoother or the make your loot brighter it's the only way to progress through the scenic land of Dragonleic.\n\nThe Lore is a bit strange I will admit. It's not thrown into your face. You need to piece it together which just makes it more rewarding when you understand who and why you are.\n\n\n\n","January 5","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You were limited to those who've only acquired a certain lifetime amount of 'currency' that was similar to your lifetime currency count. I felt this was a terrible decision as oftentimes you would permanently lose large amounts of spendible currency and these would still count towards your lifetime currency count. This meant that the more currency you lost, the weaker you were considered in relation to other players who didn't lose their currency.

Instead of luring you in with a huge open world and an interesting plot, dark souls kicks your ♥♥♥ over and over again. Although not fun at first, something eventually clicks and you find yourself getting better and better at the game.\n\nThe main part of this game is combat and you get what you payed for here. A hard to learn complicated system that punishes you for every wrong move. Amazing when you win a fight, devastating when you lose. After all of this too, you can team up with friends or strangers and work together in the stragne places you are put in.\n\nMy only problem with this game is how the humanity system lowers your HP over time. This makes exploring less fun  and my lack of human effigies has made me turn around and go back tot the bonfire i nstead of exploring a hidden zone.\n\nSo should you buy this game? If you like any of the other souls games or RPGs in general, this game is worth the price tag.","January 9","true","53.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes\n\nIs it challenging? Perhaps not so much as the first, but that is due to a generally more fluid playing experience, especially during combat. Dodging, blocking, parrying, and all of that stuff just feels better here than it did in DS1, not that I disliked the way it was back then.\n\nIs there a ton of content to explore? Oh yes, very much so, you will fall in love with Elyum Loyce.\n\nIs there still an active community? You won't always struggle to find sunbros, or to get invaded, but it is certainly harder after DS3 came out.\n\nIs it worth the buy?\n\nAbsolutely, I managed to get a ton of hours out of this game and still go back occasionally. Fans of the Souls series will have to take some time to get used to the changes here, but in the end, that's part of the fun.

If you notice any mistakes I made (apart from grammar mistakes) feel free to report them in the comments.\n\nStory:\nWhile you play through Dark Soul 2, you will notice that there is not much of a Story, except for the Player waking up in a strange field and fighting his way through hordes of monsters and undead. That is because you will have to talk to the people, look at your surroundings and read item descriptions to get pieces, with which you can unravel the past of Lordran, Drangleic and the Curse of the Undead. Once you get yourself to read and listen carefully, you will notice that the Story is mysterious, complex and very interesting.\n\nGameplay:\nYou die. A lot. But you probably know that already. Apart from that, the combat system is the essence of this game and boy is it good. Wether you play with a Greatsword, a Lance or a Staff, fast and intense fights that also require some tactics are guaranteed and bosses that will sometimes leave you sleepless, because you just have to try for the 20th time to kill that f*cker, are common. The level system (collecting souls from enemies to level up), bonfires that serve as checkpoints and the strange inhabitants of Lordran fit good in the world of Dark Souls 2.\n\nGraphics:\nWhile the graphics really are not too good, it sure looks beautiful wandering around in old ruins, along steep cliffs and jump into deep holes. The lights and shadows also look stunning most of the time, but some sharper textures would not do any harm. The overall performance is good and not laggy at all, but 60 FPS is the max. you can get.\n\nSound:\nThe game uses the right background music in the right environments and the sounds while fighting are realistic and epic too. It also has some creepy soundtracks that really fit the dark nature of the game.\n\nContent:\nAs said before, this game includes Dark Souls 2 and its three DLCs (Crown of the Ivory/Iron/Sunken King). There are a lot of areas to explore and you probably have to retry some parts because you die. Depending on how fast and skilled you are, the game offers about 50-80 hours of challenges and dying. There is also a NG+ (and NG++, NG+++,... for that matter) which offers stronger enemies (and even some new ones), some new items and bosses have some unseen special moves.\n\nMultiplayer:\nPeople can enter your session randomly at certain places and challenge you, but you can also invade other players yourself, help them defeat bosses or duel against each other. Matchmaking is determined by the total number of collected souls, so fights won´t be too unfair, but sometimes being invaded is just annoying. If you enjoy the Multipayer, it can easily add 30 more hours to your overall playtime.\n\nConclusion:\nDark Souls 2:  Scholar of the First Sin is a dark and mysterious RPG for people who like RPGs, dark fantasy worlds and games that are a bit harder than the rest. Even if you don´t like these things you should give this game a try, but just if you don´t mind dying over and over again.\n\nPraise the Sun!","August 16, 2015","true","129.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A land of Try Hards, 9 Year Olds, and Everlasting Trolls. But then there was Demon’s Souls and with Demon’s Souls came disparity. Great and Terrible, Best Game Ever and All Other Games, and of course, Gitting Gud and Being a Filthy Casul. Then from the dark, the Gamers came, and found the Majesty of Souls within the games. Demon’s, The First of the Great Games, Dark Souls and its Son’s of Bro, Bloodborne, The Lord of Playstation and its faithful fans. And Dark Souls 2, so easily forgotten.\n\nWith the strength of Miyazaki, they challenged the other Games. Bloodborne’s mighty atmosphere peeled apart their weak aesthetics. Dark Souls weaved great lorestorms. Demon’s Souls unleashed a miasma of level design and the feels. And Lords of the Fallen betrayed other games, and the lesser Games were no more.\n\nThus began the Age of From. But soon the online will fade and only PvE will remain. Even now there are only a few on Demon’s Souls servers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights of New Game +. And amongst the Souls players are seen, carriers of the accursed Zweihander.\n\nYes, indeed. The Legend Never Dies. And in this land, the online players are corralled and destroyed in PVP, where they rage quit, to await the end of their game session... This is your fate.\n\nOnly, in the ancient legends it is stated, that one day a Gamer shall be chosen to leave the other games, in pilgrimage, to the land of hype... Dark Souls 3.\n\n\n11/10 git gud","September 16, 2015","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is difficult, yes, but it's hard in a fair way. For example, if you're stuck on one level, you always have the option to go somewhere else for now. If you're having trouble with a boss, the problem isn't that you need to grind or that you need better equipment but that your technique needs to be aultered. Yes, traps can kill you in one hit, but you will have warning. My advise? Talk to every NPC until every dialogue option is exhausted. The simplest of NPC's can give you items essential to progressing the story. Don't run to wiki as soon as you can't figure something out. This isn't the kind of game where you have to use the sandwich on the elevator to get the goldfish to talk to you; yes, there are puzzles and they are very solvable if you try. Pay attention! Learn when to dodge and when to swing, when to leave and cash out your souls, where to go to for upgrades, and so on.","February 10","true","93.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes\n\nIs it challenging? Perhaps not so much as the first, but that is due to a generally more fluid playing experience, especially during combat. Dodging, blocking, parrying, and all of that stuff just feels better here than it did in DS1, not that I disliked the way it was back then.\n\nIs there a ton of content to explore? Oh yes, very much so, you will fall in love with Elyum Loyce.\n\nIs there still an active community? You won't always struggle to find sunbros, or to get invaded, but it is certainly harder after DS3 came out.\n\nIs it worth the buy?\n\nAbsolutely, I managed to get a ton of hours out of this game and still go back occasionally. Fans of the Souls series will have to take some time to get used to the changes here, but in the end, that's part of the fun. If you're like me and you don't want to get soft banned after spending $60 on DS3, spend $40 on this instead, it's well worth your time.","May 20","true","228.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
