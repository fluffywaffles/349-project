The thoughts expressed below are as much about the game of Titans and Uber's poor handling of its community)\n\n\nWhere to begin really. I am a huge fan of Total Annihilation, a massive fan of Supreme Commander 1 and Planetary Annihilation was a dream come true when I heard Uber was making it. However, what we got at the end of the road was not quite what we were expecting. The Original Planetary Annihilation is a solid game, though with some pretty heavy problems that are still unresolved.\n\nSo what is Planetary Annihilation: Titans? Its the content you should of received at the 1.0 release of the original game. This is a horrid cash grab and to make matters worse the launch is plagued with bugs. Do you want to restart the game after every match you play? Well that is what some of us are dealing with every time you try to go back to the main menu. So not only is this a shameless grab for your credit card, but it is a buggy mess as well. Nothing in Titans is extremely new beyond units and it is only 21 units. The AI is still broken and nothing is much different. This is not worth the money if you already own the original planetary annihilation, which is fun at times.\n\nI am sorry Uber that you guys really screwed the pooch and PA did not become the success you hoped it would. But that is not our fault and trying to rob us blind because we want to support you is how you sour your fans. Honestly, I think you guys need to close the doors if this is how your treating us now. Your customers will bite you back if you try to abuse us and there goes any hope of you guys being a developer.\n\nSave your money for a better game.\n\nEdit: Now some people have been taking the stance of 'they put a lot of hard work in to this content' and so forth. How much hard work? 21 units and some game modes. How is that a lot of hard work? If you owned Planetary Annihilation, you got a 66% Discount on the game which brings it down to 13 dollars or so. 13 dollars for 21 units that feel like they should of been in the main game. I say should of been because all of this feels tacked on and not the good kind. I mean the fact that its all unpolished and rough around the edges. This is why I say its deplorable. This is not a bug free, polished experience your paying for out the gate and really the fact this is all running on the same engine leaves little excuse as to why they broke their own game.","August 18, 2015","false","1.6"," 3,951 of 4,707 people (84%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","84","951","4","97","89"

Don't you just love this exiting new era of constant indefinitive editions, [payments] extended [due to content] cuts and more and more games feeling like they are all published under Valve's Too Early Access forever, someone just 'forgets' to mark them from time to time as such, kinda like with Towns before it all began?\n\nWell, Planetary Annihilation actually was in Early Access. And like many others there, on it's release date it was just incomplete mess. Mess that no amount of half-asssed insincere attempts of fixing it could change dramatically, because the game not only turned out to be unfinished (do backers and early adopters remember that YT video thrown into main menu playing over intro? Apart everything else that was wrong, how do you miss bugs in release-candidate build that hit you right off?), it was built on flawed fundaments. You can't fix randomly generated soulless skirmish battles mashed together faking single player campaign unless you throw it all away to start over with proper campaign, which they didn't in Titans. Adding some flavour text here and there doesn't give it any more meaning. To some like me the whole basic concept of fighting on planets and even multiple ones at time turned out to be just a distracting, tiring gimmick in practice, no matter how awesome it looked on paper. At least they stopped pretense of using John Patrick Lowrie's voice, he's not even in intro with lines from Kickstarter campaign like the last time, what a lie that all was...\n\nNo wonder Uber tried to release it again under slightly different name to get rid of all deserved negative reviews from buyers and media... What? 'Mindestens, you crazy git, this couldn't be one of factors!' Well, they're panning some negative feedback on forums about Titans already because they don't like customers who are not writing paeans. Pointing out all the shady things doesn't help pushing more copies of the same product it was last year, it seems. But now it has a couple more units! Ugh. You couldn't even save during mission for months after release or run it offline, or use features/units promised. Pathfinding is still shaky. Ordering building construction doesn't create it's unfinished skeleton until worker/commander actually gets there and starts making the thing so you can't add idle units to construction of queued buildings ahead in the meantime. I wouldn't mind having some sort of indicator where I ordered units to gather after construction. Interface is still lacking. Tutorials are a joke (but earlier there wasn't any). To think this patch deserves any money is just bonkers or symptome of Stokholm syndrome.\n\nPeople were screwed over by Uber and their pals Nordic Games back then, some even realised that - of course they're angry. And now they are screwed over again because unless you were <strike>dumb enough like me to trust these hacks over three years ago with money</strike> Kickstarter backer, you ain't gonna get this glorified patch! But if you got their unfinished borked product earlier, you get 66% discount on your patch. Off you go, sucker!\n\nAnd all that not even a year after initial release. Hope all those who sticked for multiplayer defending game like it was land of their fathers enjoy sudden fragmentation of community and extra payment to keep playing it when most people inevitably switch over.","August 18, 2015","false","4.1"," 3,053 of 3,741 people (82%) found this review helpful 96 people found this review funny","82","053","3","96","24"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kherny/recommended/386070/","kherny","Kherny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kherny/","365 products in account","Update - 21/11/15 Unfinished base game with poor review score has returned to store after new rereleased  "base game plus extra units - Titans" has moved past its initial launch period...\n\nOk, there is a lot of anger over this release and to be honest it is understandable. This game is a re-release of the original Planetary annihilation with a few extras thrown in and then sold for £29.99! (This has become quite common during these hard times just rereleasing what should have been dlc packaged with the base game and then sold for a premium price).\n\nI was torn about purchasing (supporting this practise,see end opinion) this. I was given a 66% discount as I had already purchased the base game but even then it rankled me knowing it was basically dlc. In the end I treated it as such and got it.  Having spent a few hours trying out all the additions I can say its fairly disappointing. Everything added is what the base game needs to reach a decent state.\n\nI feel sorry for anyone who has the base game alone as its basically unfinished. This full priced "dlc" brings the base game to a finished state and as such should have been patched in arguably for free.\n\n\nNow that is out of the way... I enjoy the presentation and mechanics of the game itself. I play primarily in single player and skirmishes. Altho the Galactic war single player non campaign (just a series of skirmish matches) has been rather boring so far as in 15 odd matches the ai has not moved, at all... It builds a few buildings then... nothing... This is on normal difficulty. It will happily stay there for hours as I build up all around it. Unfortunately my ai companion is on steroids and obliterates the non-ai every match in minutes making the whole campaign pointless so far...\n\nIt is a real shame that no effort was put into making the single player campaign more immersive. I understand that is not the intended goal but to tack on a non campaign is pitiful. I can just hit a skirmish match and get a better experience every time. Wasted opportunity. I suppose it ticks the boxes as it is present but in a most lacklustre fashion.\n\nWhat this dlc brings to the base game is a lot of needed variety to the units. A handful of titan units, tutorial, bounty mode (more fluff) and slightly altered terrain (also in base game), altho in a very artificial tacked on manner. Dont expect mountains, valleys or anything of the kind. Just a slightly elevated series of platforms that look like they have been pasted on. So basically a lot of extra units.\n\n\nWhat should have happened :\n\nBase game remains. Dlc called "Titans" added for £6.99 max. Optionally add more actual content and call it an expansion £12.99. Result - happy customers and reviews resulting in more happy customers, hence more money.\n\nRelease future series of dlc/expansions. Happy customers purchase them. Look at crusader kings 2. I have spent a fortune on dlc/expansions which bring meaningful changes to the game and also by the way put 80% of the features of the dlc into the base game for free.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nUpdate - 21/11/15 Unfinished base game with poor review score has returned to store after new rereleased  "base game plus extra units - Titans" has moved past its initial launch period...\n\nBase game effectively abandoned and removed from store. (cynical customers might wonder if it was to hide the poor review score. I personally recommended it. ) Dlc called "Titans" branded as standalone added for £29.99. Result - unhappy customers and negative reviews resulting in less customers. Hence less money.\n\nYes the money men will say if 100k buy it at £29.99 its better than 300k buying it at £6.99 in the shortterm. At the expense of reputation and goodwill. Your reaping the costs now. No amount of countering reviews will change that or removing base games or arguing adding 6 big units and 20 small ones and rebranding the game and selling it twice is a good thing.\n\nThis really grates me. This game should be massive. Instead it stalled not due to the gameplay so much as the business model and direction surrounding it which is a real real shame.\n\n\nSo overall:\n\nIf you own the original and dont intend to purchase this premium dlc I offer my condolences. You have effectively been abandoned. You have an unfinished game that I doubt will ever reach a finished state.\n\nIf you have not purchased the original or are contemplating doing so due to the low price, dont. Wait for this one to go on sale a few months down the line.\n\nI will not recommend it based on the price and the effective abandonment of the original, removing it from steam. I can not support this style of selling games.\n\n\nedit - clarity.","September 3, 2015","false","5.9"," 878 of 1,065 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","878","1","12","12"

For a more accurate view of PA's reception please refer to its store page:\n\nstore.steampowered.com/app/233250\n\nTITANS introduces new planets, some minor updates and a whole load of new units. However, the game is still plagued with poor enemy AI and poor pathfinding. My units are unable to work out the shortest route and sometimes simply get stuck. This is an issue that has persisted ever since the alpha, and still has not been completely tackled. While Uber has worked on these issues, they are still there.\n\nI've also had some problems with placing buildings near walls, where the building's outline suggests the building fits and can be constructed, but my units refusing to do my bidding. Just like kids.\n\nThe biggest issue, for me, has always been the camera. Representing maps on a sphere introduces its own set of challenges, and while I don't think Uber, neccessarily, missed the ball here. I would've loved a feature where I could 'flatten' my planet, in order to create a flat 2D representation of it.\n\nFor new users, TITANS should definitely be the way to go, it represents the product - more or less - that EA and KS backers were expecting but never recieved. Luckily, KS backers can expect to receive TITANS at no additional costs. While EA backers who paid the same price as KS backers are shafted. However, anyone who owns PA before the announcement of TITANS does get a 66% discount. Regardless when you purchased PA.\n\nFor those that bought themselves into PA through KS and EA - steer clear. For those looking for a new RTS, get TITANS, as it offers the same and more content as PA.","August 18, 2015","false","1.2"," 1,688 of 2,180 people (77%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","77","688","2","32","24"

This game directly goes against that as both games have the same install size, yet anyone who bought TITANS and not the original gets many new features and units that the community has been asking for for literal months and years.\n\nThis game is just an updated version of the original, so why not just update the original?? Or make it DLC? A standalone at it's current pricing is insane.\n\nThey are trying to forget the previous version with its "mixed reviews" standing, and just focus on the new release. They are screwing anyone who bought the original over as new players will buy the TITANS version rather than the original.\n\nBut, for those who did own the original, we get to buy TITANS at a decreased price of $13.60, which will go back up to $40 after the 18th of October. So for buying the original at whatever price you may have, we get the special treatment of getting to abandon the game we purchased, and throw out more money for a game we already owned.\n\nTL;DR The developers killed the original audience and game, in favor of starting anew, in part because the previous title had unfavorable reviews. We as consumers can not support this kind of behavior.\n\nIf this game was free to all previous owners, or simply just an update to the already existing title, then all would be forgiven. There would be no quarrel. I would LOVE to love this game, but I can't, as it exhibits all the signs of a cheap move.\n\nPS: Both games have had extremely high levels of bugs and glitches throughout their development and release time.\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/uber-entertainment-planetary-annihilation-titans-stop-making-us-pay-for-what-we-already-paid-for","August 18, 2015","false","5.9"," 1,307 of 1,699 people (77%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","77","307","1","27","31"

According to the developers it is now a finished game. After playing PA: Classic and PA: Titans for weeks I am fully convinced it is NOT a finished game.\n\nIt is obvious Uber Entertainment mismanaged their resources to construct a worthy spiritual successor to Total Annihilation. Funding that would have been better spent to iron out creases in overall game experience was used for customized commander skins and merchandise. The end result is a buggy mess with cartoony graphics and even worse unit pathing than its predecessors.\n\nHere is a list of some(but not all!) faults both versions of the game have:\n\n-No factions. Everyone gets the same units and buildings.\n-Very little unit variation. Only 2 tiers of tech.\n-No campaign. Galactic War is a stopgap at best.\n-Galactic War is no different than skirmish games. Nothing stops me from rushing and sniping the enemy commander, even without unit upgrade cards.\n-There is no option to turn off defeat after commander death. Seriously, would it have killed them to add this?\n-Many large units are unable to fire their weapons correctly on smaller planets.\n-Unit pathing is bad to the point of being unplayable on some maps. Units will frequently get stuck in terrain or buildings.\n-Incompetent AI. It knows how to spam units and thats it. Turns every game into a lagfest. Even on hardest setting it doesn't even try to defend its most important unit: the Commander.","January 31","false","83.1"," 202 of 247 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","202","247","5","6"

Played a lot of the original PA too.\n\nPerformance - i7-3970X, aka a 6-core, 12-CPU processor at 3.5 to 4 ghz based on need. Twin Nvidia GTX titans running in SLI. 64 gigabytes of ram. Water cooling and lots of fans to ensure maximum performance and running from an SSD.\n\nI get 60 fps when the camera is COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS. SOMETIMES. Otherwise it dips to 20 or less. I don't want to know how it is on slower systems, and from what I've read, the result is crashing. I'm not bragging about my system here, I want you to know that the ABOVE listed specs can barely run the game despite having no issue with the base PA.\n\nGameplay - 2nd tier expanded to be more useful with additional units, minor 3rd tier added with things like a secondary commander or flare-launching hoverplane or orbital battleship, support for "Multi-level terrain" which isn't what it sounds like - it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t preset CSG plateaus and pits that have to be manually edited in as the random generator can't handle it. New structures like the "Lob", a little mini unit cannon turret that fires 9 dox at the nearby enemies periodically. Titans that are constructable and are effectivelly the experimentals from Supreme Commander. Nice additions, worthy of an update or cheap DLC.\n\nTutorial. Sucks. Basically a series of massively handicapped skirmish games you would have to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to lose with tooltips for assistance.\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nKickstarter backers get it for free. I payed $90 for the alpha and got stimped on the deluxe edition which i was a bit unsettled about, but now stimped on this too? Come on. At least it's $13 for now.\n\nMiss the discount? PAY $40.\n\nThis isn't worth $13. This isn't worth $40. This expansion could at best be classified as a major update to the game, but not one worth that sort of money. Did uber blow all their cash? What happened to free content for the game? Why is this paid update the sort of crap myself and everyone else SHOULD have expected from the base game?\n\nAnd no the bugs arent fixed. My first game, the AI commander got stuck in the terrain and did jackshit. I already mentioned performance and how lower systems are outright crashing. The game is MORE buggy than ever. How the ♥♥♥♥ did that happen?\n\nIt's Planetary Annihilation in a state closer to what it should have been at the out-of-early-access launch. So it's fun, yes. But dear christ is this not an expansion worth the money they're asking for. This is free update ♥♥♥♥.

What they could have done is fixed the base game and had the new units as dlc. And I've noticed that the PA: TITANS has some issues too. Titans are too easy to get very early on in the game which makes the rest of the match a cake walk (atleast vs AI since I was playing the campaing) and I'm not very good at rts games and thought normal would be a challenge for me since I'm not good at the whole macro stuff. Well turns out that the normal bots are more like passive and I ended up completeting galactic war at the second hardest difficulty with no real challenge. And I also noticed a few performance issues can't really say if it was my video card not being powerful enough but in the previous game I ran the game fine at 60 fps even with a large number of units, but in titans my fps dropped to 28 pretty soon so I put my graphics to medium but that only postponed the inevitable fps drop. And when I start the game up there is a loud white noise that last for about a second but is still very annoying.\n\nConclusion: New units are nice but feel a bit overpowered and the game performs worse then the orignal atleast for me.","August 22, 2015","false","12.8"," 492 of 685 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","492","685","12","5"

On top of that, they'll charge anyone who didn't back the kickstarter £10 if you have the game already, and £30 if you're a newcomer.\n\nBut in the interests of fairness:\n\nPros:\nThe game is still for the most part enjoyable. The new content is really cool, the Titan units are a great addition and the inncreased variety in combat, and now support, units is refreshing. Overall as a concept, I liked PA. I thought it was a neat idea for an RTS; and while the actual game itself is pretty basic, the core gameplay is quite fun, and Titans does retain that. Boiled down, the core ideal of PA remains here, and it's an alright one.\n\nCons:\nPaying money for a glorified DLC. It's a shameful cash grab from Uber and it's disgusting. The game isn't optimised. It crashed when I tried to build my own system, it crashed when I tried to load and existing system, it crashed midway through the one game I played, and it crashed when that one game finshed. This is currently, right now, at the standard original PA was in 4 months before it's official release. I tolerated that quality back then, because the game was still in early stages and showed potential. Right now, as this stands, Titans is not a finished product. It's laggy, poorly optimised and buggy as hell. Not to mention the AI being atrocious at pathfinding, still.\n\nIf they had added this content for free, then great, it might've upped the reviews for the game, as it stands the reviews for original PA are mixed. Unfarily so, I think that game has a lot of positive quality as a very simple, enjoyable RTS, people bashed it for it's early optimisation issues, which were patched out. If they'd released this, as a DLC for that game, that cost somewhere around £5-10 base price, I'd be ok with that, provided it simply added to the old game and improved it and that build still ran well. But this is a no go. It's overpriced, glorified DLC, that just doesn't work. I'll be refunding this.\n\nIf you want the "real Planetary Annihilation" experience, just buy the original game, at least it actually works.","August 19, 2015","false","0.7"," 381 of 538 people (71%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","71","381","538","10","3"

Anyone who shelled out $90 for the game when it was in steam early access doesn't get the expansion free and since its not part of the base game, it's a new seperate game that means that they have no way of playing the game with new players or anyone who deletes the old one and downloads the new one.\n\nThey shouldve just made it a DLC and a tickbox to host using dlc content or not like every RTS ever instead of re-releasing it as a new product and shafting their customers for the second time.\n\nThe first time of course charging the outrageous highest backer price of $90 for the game on Steam early access to "make it fair to KS backers" thus misunderstanding the entire concept of early access being to reward people for supporting a game in its infancy and helping to build it into a successful product whereas KS is the opposite direction of funding the initial development.\n\nAt this point you have to wonder who is making the decisions at the company, obviously not someone who has actually used Steam before that's for sure.","August 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 456 of 652 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","456","652","13","3"

The game wasn't perfect; good, but always felt unfinished.\nI was waiting for a PA 2, finishing what first game had started, or at least updates for the game.\n\nThen PA: TITANS came... The game itself is nice, giving us more ways to annihilate, more units, planets...\nBut what's wrong with it? TITANS is exactly what I expected of PA to begin with, including what was missing for it to be near perfect; I just didn't expect to have to buy another game for this. I have the feeling I bought PA now only to be an EA of TITANS and having to pay even more for what needed completion.\n\nAlso, now the community has been split into two parts... PA Vanilla and PA TITANS. Am I the only one who thinks it was the wrong decision to make a standalone expansion?\n\nAnd I will not speak about the bugs which haven't been resolved since Vanilla, or the pathfinding which is yet to be improved... Maybe buying a new game will give us new updates to fix these issues.\n\nConclusion: "good" game, it's ALMOST what PA Vanilla should have been, but bad marketing. I cannot recommend it, it's not worth the 40€ while you can have Vanilla for 10€. So, should you buy it on sale now for 13€? I dunno, I'm thinking about asking for a refund. To me this Expansion should be free for actual owners of PA, or not more than 5€\n\nUPDATE : Well, i had the same crashes, same slow loadings, was fine with Vanilla game, but this time it's too much, i wont pay again to same issues. I wonder if Uber really cares about bugs.

Then came about Forged Alliance, a stand alone expansion from SupCom, which brought a new faction, SP campaign and features, whilst still holding onto the core principles that made SupCom a great and worthy successor to TA.\nThen there was SupCom 2...... ok ..... that game was a massive let down, being thrown into the casual pit, it wasn't in the same boat as TA and SupCom(/FA) and although it had some "interesting" things, it was in essence very bland.\nWhen I saw the kickstarter for Planetary Annihilation, I thought it looked amazing, I thought it looked like TA but being over multiple planets... large solar systems and galaxies to wage war across.... perhaps a place where large numbers of players could be part of the same galaxy, holding worlds for their respective factions/clans..... I know a man can dream right.....\nSo, I got onboard the kickstarter, dreams of conquest and strategic complexity whirring through my mind....\nAs you can imagine I was a little disapointed with the initial game, but I thought that it could grow into the competative powerhouse I had invisioned...... I waited so long...... then TITANS.....\nThis isn't a really good RTS from a competitive standpoint.... a lot of the wow and awe moments of this game don't actually come across if you are "playing to win". Winning is easy, just take out the commander, which has been the goal of all previous games of this theme, but in past games, turtling up and protecting your commander was a doable task, but not here... when you have intel on a commanders location is ridiculously easy to take him out as he is nothing more than a large fabricator bot.\nThe only time the commander is safe is in the first 3-4 mins of the game where his weapons are such that it can take out the small number of early units sent his way, able to fend them off whilst constructing.\nWhen the game gets to min 5 however it all changes....\nDepending on your build strategy in the first 4 mins will determine whether you will win or lose the game and it is all based on numbers, not economic number as was the case with SupCom, but the number of factories you have setup and the amount of tanks you have.....\n8 early game flame tanks is all you need to kill the commander... aproaching from at least 2 vectors can almost guarantee you a win unless your opponent has also built flame tanks.\nThe risk/reward for just spamming flame tanks is so greatly in your favor that there is little point doing anything else.... heck even if they are on another world, it just takes a little intel and a handful of flame tanks and even the most developed worlds won't save your commander from utter destruction.\nNo amount of defensive structures will keep you alive..... you can't turtle in PA, there is only one viable strategy and that is rush and that makes this a very boring RTS, which is why I cannot recommend it.....\n\n<edit>\nThanks to SKaREO for pointing this out.\nThe game is not without its complexity and resource management is cruicial if you are to succeed, but as that is no different from SupCom or TA, I didn't feel it was required in my review.\n</edit>","August 22, 2015","false","12.0"," 288 of 413 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","288","413","8","10"

Not least the devs shamefull display of promising such essential things like improved naval combat and more complex planet geography in there kickstarter and then locking these features behind the paywall that is PA titans.\n\n\n- Game is buggy, laggy and crashes/ freezes far more often than is acceptable. This has been a problem for a long time and doesnt seem to have been addressed in PA titans.\n\n- Units have poor pathfinding and will get stuck behind hills and other scenery alot. Having to manually move your stuck troops around obstacles is infuriating. On multiple occasions i have discovered that my essential support units like ant- air and anti-orbital ground units have become backed up on there way to the front line and this has resulted in me losing massive swathes of my army needlessly. Titans are even worse and will hopelessly try to walk through solid cliffs and your own factorys.\n\n- The round planets are disorientating and make it hard for you to keep track of where everything is.\n\n\nIf you can put up with these issues then perhaps you can find some enjoyment in the game.

I've read many of the reviews that think PA: Titans should have been free content or a DLC for PA.  I love free stuff as much as the next person, but I didn't mind paying for the content.  I think Titans was well worth the money and the destruction possible with the "Titans" was amazing.  There is nothing like blowing up an entire planet; or marching in on your enemy with 1, yes 1 Titan and destroying their entire base.\n\nThat being said, the "titans" do have an absurd amount of power and leave the AI fairly helpless.  The AI is...well...pretty much worthless in "Normal" mode.\n\nI have played RTS since the mid 90s and have watched the number of games/titles go from numerous titles that were new and exciting, to basically very few games being produced.  The RTS genre has gone from mainstream to a fairly niche (outside of Star Craft, which seems to be one of few commercial successes).  I don't like paying more than I have to, but I understand that developers need to be paid too.  I work for a technology/consulting company (not game related) and have a general sense of the work involved in creating something of this magnitude.  As players, if we want something innovative and new, we need to understand that RTS is typically not mainstream and we will have to pay niche prices for a niche product.\n\nMy apologies for those I've offended.  I did read the other reviews and understand your view point.  I just wanted to provide some additional perspective.  Thank you for reading my thoughts.","May 19","true","15.6"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","65","82","2","4"

See it as if it is the final release of PA.*\n\n*This is not a personal opinion but an informative review of what this game have to offer and its quality.*\n\nThe game :\n\nPlanetary Annihilation is a RTS of large scale with thousens of units on a planetary scale. For the first time you can *Anihilate* planets in real time to humiliate youre opponent. You can desimate youre enemy in many ways; Nuclear missiles, massive army of bots, build teleports to sneak behind their defence lines, blast a moon into theire home planet or ultimately annihilate the planet with a *death star* Unfortunately most of the time the game end before you can build such super weapons.\n\nGameplay :\n\nIt is classic RTS. You build a base, gather ressources; energy and matter, build an army and fight. You will have land vehicles, Bots, air units, ships, orbital units and Titans. All class with their unique abilities like: anti tank, anti air or both... You will have to make a good balance of all to succeed.\n\nMultiplayer :\n\nMultiplayer in PA is unique. You can make youre own custom planetary system and try endless of possibilities. There is a nice matchmaking for 1vs1 for quick battles. There is no custom setup as of disabling some unit or tech for now.\n\nSingleplayer :\n\nThe galactic conquest offer a different gameplay compared to the regular skirmish or multiplayer. You start with basic tech *less unit* and as you conquer more systems you will get more unit/tech. There is no factions or story in the game but there is a background story in the conquest.\n\nScore:\n\nGameplay: 5/10\n+large scale battles\n-No factions\nMultiplayer: 8/10\n+Many choice of strategy\nSingleplayer: 1/10\n-No story\nOverall: 5/10\nThe game is unfinished, need many improvements and have no immertion. You come in and you are a commander and must to annihilate all other commander for unknown reasons. On the other hand the competitive multiplayer is something realy interesting if you have realy good hardware and good internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 2, 2015","false","22.6"," 156 of 229 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","156","229","6","1"

This is a serious review for anyone looking to buy the game, as you must be warned before you purchase this for $43.99 .\n\nPROS\ngreat gameplay\ninterplanetary wars\nfun and exciting\ngood graphics\nCONS\ninsane fps drops\nbuggy AI pathing\ncrashes\nThis game, is an extremely good release to try to bring back an old age of RTS games in an age of MOBAs. I must admit, it is a good game with a very good concept and idea. Its essentially a war on four scales. Ground, Water, Air, and Space. The overall idea based behind this game is a good one, however I do not feel I am able to give this game a thumbs up yet. For now I must give it a thumbs down for numerous reasons. Reason #1. If you have a solar system with 6+ planets, the game is laggy, crashes and is just generally unreliable. I will give you my system specs just so you can understand that I don't have a below sub-par computer, and my computer should be able to run games like these well. Reason #2. This game is basically a DLC for Planetary Annihilation, they should've just added it as a purchaseable DLC instead of forcing people new to the game to drop 15$ more into purchasing it. Reason #3. Extremely buggy AI pathing.\n\nSystem Specs\nIntel i7 4990k Quad-Core 4.3Ghz Overclocked\nNvidia GeForce GTX 980 Graphics Card\n16 GB Memory\n1 TB HDD\n500 GB SSD\nMSI Z87 GD65 Motherboard\n\nBack to the review. The lobby pre-game looks nice, unfortunately if the solar system is decently large it takes a while to load the system before you get in the game, its got horrid FPS, and you still have to load the system in a loading screen either way. Into the game, if you actually make it in (you have 6 or less small planets with maybe one large planet) then the game is fun, however large armies take the FPS down a lot as well. Not to mention that lots of ground troops (bots, tanks, etc.) have extremely horrible pathing. 50% of the time if you are trying to attack around a mountain, a large amount of the bots in your army will get stuck and are not able to move. However, the game is still enjoyable, it gives a fresh new taste to Planetary Annihilation as its own standalone game, but if you we're looking to purchase this if you have vanilla PA or are looking to get either of them, stick with the vanilla version as there are not enough new units and such to make this a decent buy. Even for $14.96 it's still a bit pricey.\n\nTL;DR It's a fun game, but has FPS problems and crashes frequently, would not recommend, buy vanilla PA\n\nOverall Rating 4/10\n\nEDIT: I have been notified that you are no longer able to purchase vanilla planetary annihilation, this honestly infuriates me because this costs 15$ extra, and should just be DLC. Another cash grab I suppose.\n\n\nPS, Sorry for bad english, and errors","August 21, 2015","false","24.7"," 159 of 250 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","159","250","8","2"

However, that is a subjective criticism based on my own criteria for what makes a worthwhile RTS.  So, I'll try to break it down Barney style using less subjective observations and let reader decide if this is a game worthy of a place in their library.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- A multitude of units to build.\n- There are many methods at the players disposal to destroy the enemy (nukes, zerg tactics, celestial collision, etc.)\n- Scale of environment and units is impressively broad.\n- Many unlocks and buffs in campaign mode.\n- Graphics and animations are good.\n- Ample amounts of action and explosions.\n- Simple, easy to learn gameplay.\n- Voice dubbing was tasteful for an indie developer.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Expensive (real money) reskins of the commander unit.\n- Overhyped game.\n- A critical lack of immersion.\n- Building an army becomes a chore very quickly.\n- Game crashes on the regular.\n- Game desynchronizes on the regular.\n- Why is this game so buggy?\n- Questionable Ethics of the development team.\n\nThe Grey:\n\n- Everything is expendable.\n- Simple & unimaginative resource gathering system.\n- Simple story and plot.\n- A thousand ways to achieve one outcome; 'Annihilation.'\n- Music is creatively repetitive.\n- The music.\n- Rounds are over very quickly most of the time.\n\nIn short, this game does what it was meant to do very well- be an easy to play sandbox of creative destruction on an unparalleled scale for the casual RTS enthusiest.

First off you're paying FORTY DOLLARS (FORTY DOLLARS!!!) for a video game you probably already paid for, and in some people's case TWICE ALREADY.\n\nIt adds new units and ELEVATION. They're marketing elevation in an RTS. Good ♥♥♥♥ing job ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nThe new units don't matter because a lot of them you don't even get to use. I'm pretty sure that after 13 hours of play doing numerous Galactic Wars I still don't know about a lot of them. As far as I know the only unit they added was the ♥♥♥♥ing Lob which basically just wins the game for you.\n\nAnd let's talk about Galactic Wars. Instead of a campaign, you get to do a bunch of missions in a row, like a fighting game. Every mission you get to pick up new tech... unless your tech slots are full. So if your tech slots are full and you've got a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ that you like and that one other thing you like is up there and there isn't a slot addon before that selection you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You just wasted like twenty ♥♥♥♥ing minutes.\n\nAnd to add on one of the things you can get as a tech is a Support Commander. Literally a hard AI that gates in with you. So you get like 8 of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, start a mission, and go get a ♥♥♥♥ing drink. Fun game, guys.\n\nIf your computer isn't beastly (Mine isn't that good but at this point I think I could make Crysis run on a ♥♥♥♥ing graphic calculator) the game will crash like a ♥♥♥♥♥, black screen, etc.\n\nAnd let's not forget the fact that this is after the disgrace of Supreme Commander 2. The franchise is dead now. They killed SupCom and now they killed Total Annihilation.\n\n\n\n\n"So what if I really like this game?"\n\nGo buy Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance and install Forged Alliance Forever off of the internet.

It really peeked my intrest and made me want to play it.  So I caved and dug into my piggy bank.  Got my hard earned money and deposited into the devloper's pockets.  Got the game and had a fun time.  It was beta, and they promised more from the game, and a wonderful experience to come.  Patches later I saw a new thing.  Titans!  An expantion pack that changed the whole game!  New updates that where not going to be in the other game, because Titans was a completely seperate game it turned out.  Titans was not an expantion but a whole new game that... isn't the same thing as planetary annihilation?  Ok... They wanted to be like Supreme commander and do an entire expantion remake, that makes sense... what did they add?  A new faction?  No... no... same faction...  New maps?  No... no... You could create your own or just use some random premade ones.  Oh oh!  New units?  Oh... that was supposed to be in there from the beginning?  Then why did I pay for an incomplete game only to have to buy the expantion for a few new units and nothing else?  Supreme commander Forged alliance at least gave us a new campain, new units, and a completely new faction that turned it into a masterpiece of RTS games.  This... gave us what it promised and asked us to pay for more.  And in the end I still have more hours played on Supreme commander than this game... I wonder if the lack of story... lack of factions... and over hype this game got was a good thing?  It surely wasn't a good thing for my wallet.  Do yourself a favor.

Heres my experince that forced me to write the Review at .2 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe good thing i saw up to a point was the nice new graphics, shiny like the first, the makers did a great job at their art for a game with so much fowerpower. (Grated i only saw parts of the combat.) Not onwly that, but the new UI is nice and clean. Unlike the the last game this UI Has more to it without too much clutter, aswell as some new looks to Unit Grouping so I am happy with that bit.\n\nNow the Problem, I recomend buying this game at sale if able cause this is sort of shotty, im not sure if its Windows 10 thats making the game Crash for me on many occassions but its kind of annoying. At the start of my game i get this weird loud sound blowing hrough my headset, after a while in game (im playing the tutorial, only on part 2 sadly) i also would get slight freezes and a black screen for a split second. After about maybe 5 Minutes max my game simply crashes.\n\nIm a little dissapointed in how bad the game is currently for my person, while i would love to give it a thumbs up i also noticed via the discusion page that the creators are sort of deleting reviews. I want them to know that this game NEEDS to be fixed in anyway they can as the constant crashes in the Tutorial alone are enough to bring cause of conserned.\n\nPlease dont buy this game at full price but if you can get it at a deal then give it a shot, just dont be suprised if your experience is anything like mine.","August 23, 2015","false","38.2"," 59 of 98 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","59","98","0","3"

My Saved game gets lost, my units get clogged (not narrowed CLOGGED) when they try going throught the bridge on the planet cracker, there is no way to lower the game graphics, and they have made no improvements from the last game, but yet they put a giant unit in the game that will almost make any weak laptop crash. ♥♥♥♥ING BRILIANT IDEA! I'm sorry if I'm being a little too harsh on it, but they are so close to making a really good game, but they dropped it! It's like if someone was creating the greatest masterpiece mankind has ever seen, but then just throwing it into the gutter like a piece of poop! I really want to support this game, but the direction of the game has let me down.\n\nAs an RTS player Iove playing games like Starcraft, Dawn of War, and Age of Empires. I love being the sucker that's in command of a whole entire death army, but in order to make a good RTS game it needs to have quick access to units and not be so slow either. I know they have control groups but I'm talking about game speed wise. My computer can run 60 fps on Starcraft medium settings. With 176 zerglings on one screen attacking. If my computer can handle that then I'm pretty sure it should be able to handle PA Titans on a low setting without crashing.","November 2, 2015","false","13.4"," 32 of 50 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","32","50","0","4"

The new additions are nice.  Unfortunately, my previous difficulties with PA were not addressed: lack of supporting UI.  Simply put, PA is missing some critical components to UI that are required to make a game like this work (or honestly, any RTS).  I bought Titans hoping that they were.\n\nWhat's wrong: There's NO MINIMAP.  Additionally, you're on a rotating globe with no visual identification as to where you are on that globe.  Where was your base?  Just pan around until you find it again.  Oh, the enemy is attacking on the other side of the planet?  Would be nice to know if that was a scout or a full-fledged invasion.  Important details :).  And that's just for a single planet.  Some maps have 6, and there's no UI information about which planets you even have troops on.  I love the idea of the game, and my friends and I gave it an honest shot with quite a few multiplayer games together.  Unfortunately, we all agreed that the UI just does not allow/support the gameplay, and the result is frustration.\n\nPeriodically I check the recent updates to see if there are any notes about improving the UI.  Nope.  I'll keep checking back, because I want to play this game, but they just don't come.

Far as i see it is a microtransaction ridden, bland RTS for any fan of the genre who doesnt just want to spam units. looking at you zerg >:(. all seriousness i didnt like it. to sum it up:\n-meh graphics for the year\n-zerg rush type gameplay\n-microtransaction store which MAY be pay to win\n-gameplay that is kinda bland\n-and AI which has 0 difficulty slider visible and is very stupid as it DOESNT PRODUCE UNITS BEFORE THE 20 MINUTE MARK and by then youve won the game.\nnot the worst game ive played. but id rather play SC2, or even a sakura visual novel. hell Nekopara will do.","January 9","false","0.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

Fundamentally, there is very little difference. You have a commander with which you build factories that build combat units. Send those to kill the opponents commander and protect yours, last man standing wins! Unlike PA classic, PA Titans includes the (spoiler!) Titan class of robot. Giant machines with unique attacks, massive armor and deal more damage than a nuke.\nI wish the different commanders had different abilities or there were factions to choose from with unique units. Or that you could use enough nukes to create craters in the surface of a planet. But those small gripes aside, the game is great.\n\nDestroy the enemy by forcing planets to alter orbit, with planets that shoot lasers, by overwhelming nuclear destruction, or massive fleets of robots.\n\nControls - Fairly standard for RTS games\nGraphics - While zoomed out they're nothing impressive, zoomed fully in you can see decent detail, but it's difficult to play the game while in so close. They aren't fantastic graphics, so you aren't missing much.\nGameplay - Don't expect much of a story. While they have framework for lore with interesting potential and the single player has fun flavor text, there's no storyline. Build, blast, blow up.\n\n","May 31","true","53.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","3"

Since this review will stand longer than the sale I should give an honest opinion.\n\nI don't know anything about the dev issues or the former game, I was also not a kickstarter participant. My friends and I found this game, thought it looked interesting and it was on sale, so we got it (thanks Jason!).\nSo this is an unbiased opinion, not from the view of someone slighted by the Uber devs.\n\nFor a lower price, this game is fun. Moving the units about, building stuff and the planet hopping is quite entertaining and the RTS elements themselves are semi-solid.\nThe game would not be worth the original price though.\n\nPros:\n- Multiplayer RTS game with AI, what else can you want. It should be standard these days, but with indie developers, you often find it isn't.\n- Quite a lot of different units, buildings and things to do.\n- The planet hopping is done interestingly and well.\n- Instead of micro management, this game is more set to macro combat, a concept I quite like.\n- The game utilizes a window-in-window kind of news system, where you can easily and quickly see trouble, problems and points of interest.\n\n\nBut now the sad parts, some of them game breaking when you forget them.\n\nCons:\n- Some units are downright useless, even if you spend a majority of your resources on them. A good example are the highest orbital ships you can build. With just the tiniest bit of micro management, a few smaller ships or even a few ground units can, for some stupid reason, kill your entire fleet. Yes, the ships can be helpful in a big war, however they can easily be caught unaware since they're so slow.\n- In conjunction with the previous con, the army movements are... lacking. A simple command like moving as slow as the slower member of your army is not easily found, the pathing is... weird... (sometimes a ship can't fly over debris??).\n- The AI difficulty curve is STEEP. A "Normal" AI won't even fight back much, you can annihilate them with pretty much a single unit (a titan or a commander building the Annihilazor on a metal planet, all alone). While one difficulty higher, they'll shower you with atom bombs and when you finally have some defenses up, bombard you with everything else, never relenting, always knowing where your buildings are.\n- Too many insta-kill buildings/things. While you CAN planet hop and escape insta-kill scenarios, humans are, by and large, settlers. The home planet is usually the place where you build the most and keep the most. Insanely stupid insta-kill things can happen to you, like building the right titan, dropping a moon on you or building on a metal planet and shoop-da-whooping you out of the sky.\n\nTo show you just how frustrating that can be let me tell you how me and my friend spent a few hours this morning.\n\nFirst game, Normal Difficulty, wrecked AI with stupid stuff like Annihilazor, dropping Titans or simply showering them in 200 ships for giggles.\nSecond game, Hard Difficulty. Before we even had any kind of orbital defense, the AI settled on our planet and began pelting us with 2-3 atom bombs a minute. After losing half our buildings we finally had some anti-atom missiles done. slowly defending our ♥♥♥♥ while being thrown in a pool of "ATOM BOMB LAUNCHED" notifications. Those notifications sadly went over the notifications that someone had build catalysts on the metal planet, we heard the sound of a laser revving up, leaned back and watched our planet explode.\nThird game, Hard difficulty, this time we're prepared, orbital defense ALL UP ON THIS PLANET, ♥♥♥♥ yeah, slowly gather resources and plan our revenge....... when a planet hits us.\nNope, wasn't the AI. Nope, wasn't something random. The map is just built so that THE TWO PLANETS HAVE THE SAME ORBIT AROUND THE SUN. HOW DID THEY EVEN FORM. THOSE PLANETS SHOULDA BEEN DEAD A LONG TIME AGO.\n\nWhile this sounds funny.. inside the game it was just frustrating watching everything we worked for randomly explode...\n\nSo yes, this game CAN be entertaining for a couple of hours. But not for the full price. Wait for at least 70% off before buying it.","January 10","false","69.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

So the hours I've played are not visible.\n\nThe game is highly moddable but lacks audio modding capabilities for undisclosed reasons barring  this it is very moddable. There is an mod called Legion[exodusesports.com] and it adds complete new faction to the game. Thank you to all the hard working mod developers. The newest patch has a built in mod manager. Active modding community and I find them helpful. So if you like modding feel free to jump in.\n\nGameplay it plays like a faster paced version of Total Annihilation. It doesn't allow you to turtle which removes some of the depth in the game. Unlike Total Annihilation you can't use small amount of units it is either large or nothing.  And some aspects of Supreme Commander mainly experimental. It has a unique orbital gameplay mainly delegated to the defense layer. The maps around causing you to defend all sides of your base and allowing for greater attack surface.\n\nPA:C and PA:T our cheat/hack resistant for example map hacks is simply impossible due to client server architecture of the game. The server never give the information required to do hack to the client. That is one example of how cheats or hacks are prevented.\n\nWith every Titans includes PA classic; you can play Titans and Classic games in the lobby and even play on classic ladder. you can do this by switching the game product in settings to Classic or Titans. Titan games are labeled in the multiplayer lobby. Or you can play skirmish gives the AI and Galactic war.\n\nTitans includes new experimental units called Titans. They are massive and cost a lot of metal to build. There considered Game Ender units. Wreckage is now in PA making it more like Total Annihilation allowing for defensive use of wreckage. There is a new game mode called bounty where the last person to destroy the enemy commander gets a income bonus to their economy. It was designed for Free For All to stop turtling and hiding from people. there are new units and structures as well as improvements across the board.\n\nPersonally dislike the fact that it is a standalone expansion not a regular one and everybody wasn't required to buy it. But I respect Uber for this decision on it and I can see where they're coming from. this expansion definitely needed a new separate faction but never got to see one which makes me sad. it lacks a fully scripted campaign mode which is a pity if you like that kind of stuff like I do. The complete lack of 4K support is a shame but there is a workaround and it's playable but not future proof. Commanders are boring and would add an element of depth if they had special abilities.\n\nPros   Cheat and hack resistant\nHighly moddable\nIn-game mod manager\nPA classic included\nTitans (experimental)\nUnit wreckage\nA new game mode\nNew units\nMore improvements\nCons   Lack of audio modding[forums.uberent.com]\nStandalone expansion\nNo fully scripted campaign mode\nCommanders lack special abilities[forums.uberent.com]\nNo new separate faction\nLack of 4K support[wiki.palobby.com]\nOverview of the Community Update build# 94684      In-game mod manager\nCustom Server support\nServer improvements\nNew modding capabilities\nNumerous UI enhancements\nTons of bug fixes\nSpecial thanks to all who worked on this build especially pinbender, mikeyh, wondible.

Sadly I doubt that will be the case as Uber hasn't updated it for many months now.\n\nTL:DR - The game is really fun, especially with friends. But Uber sucks as a company and has probably abandoned the game by now. It's a sad waste of potential.\n\nThe negative reviews for this game are 90% people who are angry about Uber basically releasing the game a second time at full price for a package that was really just some DLC plus the base game. Quite the scummy move, Uber.\nHowever despite Uber's poor business plans, the game itself is quite fun especially with a few friends. There's nothing quite like fielding a massive army, then only using it to secure a death star to blow up every other planet in the system. The score for this game is fantastic, it sounds very massive and epic and when you hear it while your army crushes the opposition, it gives you the chills that only something this awesome can bring.\n\nOn the negative side, there's really very little optimization (if any) and as I mentioned above, I think uber has just given up on keeping this game up to date.\nI hope some responsible companty buys the rights to this game, because there's really a lot of potential here, especially for player-made content considering the style of the units and buildings.","February 26","true","30.8"," 33 of 60 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","33","60","4","4"

As a spiritual successor to Total Annihilation, this game gets much right, however similar to TA and Supreme Commander that followed, its ambitions far exceed its development budget and computational capacity for the time in which it was released. I can only hope similar to TA/SC, that future PC hardware will allow this game to be played at the scale it was envisaged. A poorly handled release and then re-release gave birth to many grumpy and vocal supporters, however the end product taken completely at face value is really a fantastic but flawed classic. If you are looking for your large scale RTS fix, and are tolerant of a few rough edges, then this should be great value. Do yourself a favour and look for PAMM (PA Mod Manager) and read up on many mods which help to smooth over a lot of User Interface and Gameplay quirks which the developers have never (and probably never will) had the opportunity to remedy.

Although in games like this all you really are seeing are rectangles and triangles duking it out anyway.\n\n- Hard AI is a bit too hard and Normal is too easy, but you can play around with the economy modifier to find a middle ground.\n\nOverall I still had a great time, so yes, recommanded.","January 11","true","13.4"," 52 of 98 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","52","98","5","0"

The game has had it's fair share of negative review's which tend to be soley based on the fact that the developer's are supposidly 'greedy' and are not the best dev's that you can hope to find.\n\nIn my opinion it is unfair to judge and review a game based on it's developer's and infact we should be reviewing this game based on it's content and quality of design. Personally I have to say this game's graphic's are far more beautiful than a large range of title's out there on the market. And regardless of it being an RTS the graphic's upclose are great. This game feature's many unit's that add a huge range of diversity to it's combat and strategy, and ensure a different experience every time you play. In my time played I have not noticed any bug's or glitches and would say this game is most definitley polished. This game provides a great take on combat and really give's it's users the ability to mix and match on the battlefield.\n\nIn my opinion this is a great game and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a love for RTS game's and for anyone who is willing to sacrifice their time to experience the sheer beauty of this game and all it has to offer.\n\n10/10, Great Quality, Great Combat, Enjoyable Experience","April 13","true","34.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

It's the game we were promised. It's too bad we have to buy the game again in order to get it.\n\nWhat's funny is that this feels like the beta version of the game originally promised. Clunkiness in the interface was never fixed, in fact it's made worse in several respects with overlapping popups and immovable popout windows.\n\nIf this were released as Planetary Annihilation 1.0, this would be one of the best RTS games on the store. That's the real tragedy of it all. It's a game that has released the finish product as an expansion to a game they never finished, and it STILL has glaring usability problems and clunky controls.\n\nWant my advice? Save your money and buy Grey Goo instead if you're looking for an RTS or if someone reads this on the cusp of a steam sale.\n\nWaiting patiently for the day we get our refund for PA's base game, which can no longer be bought or played online as this supplants it in every way, shape, and form.

He builds up his nest, where he will give birth to many little bots. He sends them out to claim new land for his brood. his scouts report turrets on a cliffside, he sends the artillery. They return few, but victorious. Osiris commands the builders to expand the resource production, more units must be sent to the front lines to defend the hive. Left flank is attacked, full out assault to retaliate. Tier 3 turrets, Osiris wasn't expecting this. No one survived, but they dealt massive damage to the enemy Commander, Centurion. Osiris knew that this wasnt going to be easy, he quickly sent a second wave, hopefully to do more damage to the defenses before it was too late, but to no avail, the enemy was to strong. Osiris sent out even more builders, to ensure that every resource node was being captured. He ordered the hive to retract its reach, cannons from the enemy base was hitting the front lines. He began Advanced factories, with these, he can break high ground. Once again they charge, and like before, they crumble. "Ragnarok", he thinks to himself, but he changes the idea, he wants the victory, he must bring the enemy army to their knees. He gets advanced builders, and begins building the Titan units, Ares and Atlas. Ares charges with the main force. Osiris has Atlas follow from behind, far enough out of enemy reach. Centurion has 10 colonels, 15 tier 3 turrets, and 15 Holkins outside the main base. Ares sends forth his army, to make way for the Titan. Desolation, Ares eliminates everything, at the loss of his army. He knows his mission, he begins to blast away all turrets before going down. Ares blows up, and Osiris is pleased. They had broke high ground. Out of the cloud of smoke from Ares, comes Atlas, who stomps on the enemy base, destroying the hope Centurion had.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hakensio/recommended/386070/","hakensio","Vanyeti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hakensio/","140 products in account","Hey everyone,\n\nA little background: I had PA since the alpha stage. I chose to move to PA Titans with the special offer for 10 bucks. I do have and play SC2.\n\nI have read some of the reviews, and I agree that, maybe, dev wanted to make some money out of the Titan “expansion”.\n\nNow, I believe that some of you got the wrong idea of this “strategy” game. Most of the strategy games work with a balance of attack and defense, true. PA is a strategy game where I see Attack as the only key of the game. There is NO DEFENSE here.\nLet’s have a look at another game, SC2. Some of you have mentioned that would gladly go back to play SC2, and I understand that -- I love SC2. But these two games are completely different. See, SC2 has a great deal of “defense”. If you push the AI to very high difficulty and they are located in a floating island, you can’t really get to them. At the same time you can spend 30 min building your own defenses, and you would know that you are secure under your shield generators and turrets for the next two (human) hours.\n\nPA is nothing like that. There are no shield generators, and buildings such as turrets are destroyed very easily. There is most probably very little defensive strategy programmed in the AI. The game is all about how fast you are to build and destroy the other. It may come to a surprise to you, but it’s called Planetary ANNIHILATION.\nHere comes the fun part. If you think that it is too easy for you, just create your own planetary system, set it up as you like. Then play alone against 5 AI! You can also set your own strategy to ANNIHILATE other commanders! :D\n\n5 AI, which means that you could destroy each of them in a different way:\nYou build a Ragnarok on one of their planets, and annihilate the hell out of that commander!\nGet on an asteroid, build halley engines, and shoot it right in the face of a commander! Guess he wasn’t expecting that.\nBuild 15 nuclear launchers, and nuke the hell out of another commander. Mass nuke attack on different areas of a planet! BOOM\nBuild 150 little exploding spiders bots, then build Helios (the titan space transporter for invasion). Connect it with a teleport. Move Helios on the other planet. Send your exploding spiders over. FRAGMENTED ANNIHILATION!\nWin like a boss – Star Wars style. Get on the metal planet. Conquer it and build catalysts. Destroy the last planet in Start Wars style “Death Star”. COMPLETE ANNIHILATION!The game is really fun to play. It’s not a game that would last long (like SC2) unless you decide to. Against 1 AI you could win in 10 min, sometimes in 3 min if you are fast enough.\nFor who is interested in purchasing this game, consider this as a VERY fast-paced game. Within the first minutes, your fabricators will already be half the way around the planet building mass extractors. 2 min in you will have multiple factories building an army. 4 minutes in you will already have a nice army (HUNDREDs of units) and will be building the advanced factory. 7 minutes in you may already have advanced builders and would be start building advanced technology (such as the cool titans). Compare this to the slow-paced SC2, and you will understand why some people are not comfortable with it.\n\nFinally, everything depends on you. Do you like long games? Select harder AI and more AIs. Do you want to build titans? Well, one is normally enough to ANNIHINLATE your enemy! You need more enemies to have more fun! ;D\n\nSide note: Someone said that Galactic War is the same as Skirmish. That’s false -- Galactic War is different from Skirmish. A normal battle in Galactic War is you against one opponent. Only if you start fighting the faction commander (“mini boss”), you will find yourself against multiple enemies. When you start you will NOT have all the technology – you need to destroy other commanders to find technology (usually, when you start, you can ONLY build base vehicles). Additionally, there is some special technology which is not available in skirmish, such as 50% off production costs for Titans, 75% off energy for artillery, faster commander, faster (type) of units, faster building, stronger units, and way more! You can even find other “remains” of commanders that you can activate to have an allied AI with you in the battles. You will start with nothing, and you can end up with the most powerful combination for a TOTAL ANNIHILATION!\n\nEnjoy.","April 8","true","23.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I relly enjoyed the graphics, and never have I herd about a "comand and concor" like game that actually has plannets. The variety of units is great, but just mass producing flame or standard tanks can never fail. The campain is pretty good, it doesnt have a story behind it. Instead you begin with controlling one planet and slowly take over the galaxy. Playing through the campain usually takes about 2 - 4 hours depedning on how large the galaxy is and how powerful the enemies are. I have not played very many games of multiplayer matches, but the games that i have played  were simmilar to campaign games.\nIf i were to give a complaint about Titans it would probubly be the effectiveness of plannet destroying weapons. They feel too powerful, however it takes a great deel of resources and time to create one. Plus it does feel great to throw two plannets into each other.","May 26","true","33.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

I found this for a steal on Bundlestars.com ($9.99 +$1.00). The Total Annihilation feeling is also there for those who still reminisce about the good old 1997 Cavedog game called Total Annihilation. I was just wondering, where is the D-gun? The general feeling about the game is that the developers went into boring mode story-wise but got much of gameplay mechanics right. Gameplay > Lore, right? It can't get max points but it's definitely a play in my book.\n\nPROS\n1. Big Bots\nThe most attractive thing about this game are the big walking tin cans. Who doesn't want a mega Gundam?\n\n2. Interplanetary Combat\nTruly one of the highlights of the game.\n\n3. The Annihilazer\nLoved it. Build 5 Catalysts to activate the ENTIRE METAL PLANET and fire a beam to destroy any other planet. It warms my heart to know that I can build a Death Star without starting from scratch.\n\n4. Titans\nSuper Area-of-Effect attacks. Fantastic.\n\nCONS\n1. No Impact\nShooting peas and lasers just don't simulate major combat. What I'm talking is the big vlada-boom from firing from a tank. The units don't have the "oomph" when they shoot. It feels like shooting peas at each other.\n\n2. Too Many Units to Micro\nYou can build over 100 units and it's a hell of a problem to manage.\n\n3. Rotating Views of the Planets\nIt's difficult to comb/scout the planet as you're trying to search the surface area of a sphere. The good thing is that scout planes are cheap and radar coverage is huge.\n\n4. Orbital Transport\nDue to the Astraeus' single unit limit, it is a chore to move units from 1 planet to another. It would be far better for the Astraeus to have multiple troop transport capabilities or to combine it with a teleporter.\n\n5. 1 Capital Ship?\nOnly robots and 1 Capital Ship. There's a kind of limitation here. There is an Omega orbital ship but that's really limited. The defense satellites don't count.\n\n6. Building over Ore Dots\nI built an Air Factory over the Ore Dots and the next thing you know, you couldn't build an ore extractor over it.\n\n7. Campaign\nVery dull. Move from point A to point B, play a skirmish. There isn't a campaign at all. It's just skirmish after skirmish. I completed each map is less than 20 minutes.\n\n8. Teleporter Facing\nYou have only 1 entrance to the Teleporter. The orientation is extremely important if you don't want your troops taking an additonal 5 seconds to get into the Teleporter.\n\n9. View Orientation\nA sphere with fog of war is really hard to focus on. If not for the large radar, it would be near impossible to locate your enemies.\n\n10. Orbitals\nIt's quite hard to keep track of your orbitals. All you have is a thin line that shows you where your satellite is. It's like a balloon where you only focus on the string.\n\n11. Naval\nWTF is this for? You need water? Who the hell cares?\n\nNEUTRAL\n1. Singularity Commanders\nYou hedge everything on 1 single commander. This is not diversifying your risk very well. While I enjoy the quickness that games will end, I note that the same could also happen to me.\n\n2. Ore Dots\nSurprisingly, this is a great idea. However, I would prefer to reduce the number of dots by at least half and increase the metal production by x2 on each dot. I do not enjoy having to play Bob-the-Builder for resource structures.\n\n3. Commander Loadouts\nGood idea but executed poorly. It is most boring to see Air, Orbital or Vehicle Commanders. I would suggest looking at Company of Heroes 2 for a good example of how to have commander loadouts.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Bring in Space Combat\nI was hoping for Battle Cruisers, Capital Ships, Warp Jumps and Orbital Bombardments. The Omega is not sufficient.\n\n2. Big Boom Units\nJust like how the commander goes nuclear when he dies. Perhaps some units that will cause a mushroom cloud explosion, a crater, earth split, shockwave or a void hole.\n\n3. Upgrading the Factories\nA Tier 1 factory is always stuck at Tier 1. I would allow a Tier 1 to upgrade into a Tier 2 Factory so that all the factories are the same and you don't waste space. Tier 2 Factories are not unique and still produce Tier 1 units either way, so upgrading is definitely a good idea.\n\n4. 1 Large Planet\nInstead of a tiny planet, how about 1 gigantic planet to fight on?\n\n5. Energy Shields\nI would have enjoyed looking at an energy shield dome.\n\n6. Terrain & Weather\nNot sure if you can render snow, electromagnetic clouds and desert sand storms.\n\n7. Orbitals\nTurn them into autonomous drones. It is extremely tedious to have to micro 3 separate levels. Level 1, planet surface\nLevel 2, orbital\nLevel 3, planetary\n\nIf they are drones, you can actually make them orbit instead of being geostationary.","April 9","true","3.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","0"

But I think it's ridiculous the devs went through the trouble of kick starting PA, abandoning it due to a myriad of reasons, then removing it from the steam store and replacing it with this? And not even giving it to free for previous owners? Their excuse is they need to pay the artists and programmers and everyone that worked on this game.

I've played hundreds of hours on this game usually through PAMM. It is basically the only game that I play nowadays and I have a large library of games. Also I only play single player against the AI, too many people keep saying that it is a multi-player only rts game, it is not. I have found the skirmish mode to be a lot of fun with so much to do while playing it and I always play it on absurb difficulty. There are a ton of mods to use, from AI mods to eye candy mods to map mods etc. there is also a mod on it's way for another faction. Though I don't play online there is a great community that do and most of them are very helpful if you need help with anything. My favourite game was TA but now PA is my favourite. There is a learning curve at least for me and I'm still learning, what with planets being round and not flat (makes the game very interisting when you get used to it), unit cannons, nuclear missiles, planet smashing, titans, annihilaser, asteroids, unlimited units (I think there might be a limit of 3000 but I'm not sure, if there is it can be changed in the ai_config.json using any text editor), four layers of units (land, sea, air and space) and so much more. No two games ever seem the same to me, you can play on just one planet or several, with or without moons. For me PA is very stable, and it saves and resumes ok so that I can play the long games that I like. I should also mention that you can rewind the game you are playing and start from the position you rewound to, so it is like one continuous save. If you like playing skirmish games such as TA, C&C Generals etc. then you should like PA. I don't miss not having a campaign as I don't usually play campaigns and as I mentioned before, I don't play online very often so I can't coment on them. I don't play Galatic War either (maybe I will give it a go at a later time) so I can't comment on that. But the skirmish mode keeps me entertained for ages and as far as I am concerned that is what a game should do.\n\ni7-3770k\nASUS MAXIMUS V GENE Z77 chipset\nG skill Ripjaws-X 32G Kit (8x4) DDR3 1600\nGigabyte AMD Radeon HD 7870 2 Gigs Ram\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64 bit\n\n","April 19","true","55.0"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","22","42","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BOYCSY/recommended/386070/","BOYCSY","Radioactive Anus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BOYCSY/","26 products in account","Well, to be honest, this game does impress me for a few moments but overall the experience is not really that good. It's still on good path though.\n\nBut then, I am not comparing the original version and the TITANS version, most of the gamers give a bad review on this game due to this reason, I am not really into the rip-off of the original version. In fact, I am only focusing on the TITANS version of the gameplay.\n\nFirst of all, for me, I am very new to this game, I bought it last year christmas, so perhaps there's a lot of mechanics and features that I haven't touched on, but I can tell you, you will get bored after a day. There are just too much doomsday machine that can "annihilate" not only the planet, but the gameplay as well. You've already built tons of units, and the enemy commander still haven't built an advanced factory.\n\nTalking about the commander, the Sub-Commander Tech Card are just too OP for me or some of the gamers. After my planet was annihilated by my sub-commander, I swear I will never pick this card. Their were so overpowered that they can end the entire gameplay within 20 minutes which to my personal view, it's way too fast. Another thing is, since I prefer playing alone in PA, the Galactic War really gave me a bad impression, there are just too much system with one planet only, which completely destory the "Planetary Annihilation" title. When people pay to play this game, they expect to blow up planets one by one. Well your game is pretty good at letting them know they can only sit on a planet with a stupid enemy commander waiting to be annihilated on the other side of the planet.\n\nAnd the Titan Class Unit, they are so USELESS. Despite having a beautiful and creative design, it is just not worth it to consume that much energy and metal for a single machine. Who needs Altas when you can destory those Robo-Dummy with 20 Leveler? Overall, the TITANS certainly have it's own function when you are having a hard time penetrating the enemy defense line, but the above condition almost NEVER happens in the Galactic War, you can end the whole campaign in 3 days with the highest difficulty if you are a real friend of this game.\n\nWell, it's not a bad game in terms of price and mechanics, It has it's cool moments, smashing planets with Halley Engines, overwhelming the enemy base with a swarm of nanobots, lauching billions of nukes. But the room of improvement are just too big, and at last, I don't really recommend buying this game at it's full price, but I will definitely give it a try when it's at a -70% sale.\n\nP.S. Sorry for my bad english :(","January 11","false","25.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

They will link you to a lift of software saying "Turn all dis off if you have it" well I didnt have any of it and it still crashes a ton on windows 9.  Then they demand you go to some forums and submit some weird info they never tell you how to get.  They offer NO SUPPORT to stop the crashes and seem intent are telling us to work around instead of doing this AMAZING thing called "fixing it".\n\nIt crashes from just NAVIGATING the menu's.  It can't handle that.  It seems like the game tries to load too many things at once causing these crashes because when I am setting up a lobby.  Messages appear about it loading the map, while I am setting up the lobby which causes it to crash a LOT.  The only time I can get it function is on a SMALL one planet map...yeah real fun.  So yeah its poorly optimized.  Once you get ingame it runs fine but good luck with that if you want to do any fun battles.\n\nThe devs are lazy, they are hotfixing MP and stuff but making ZERO attempts to fix the issues.  "Yay we patched the multiplayer and added new gameplay features."  Oh boy I play MP.  Oh wait I can't it crashed when I tried to navigate the menu.

So, the game is fun yes, and I think this is the only game that allows you to build giant god damned engines on a planet and fire it into another to obliterate someone, its the most satisfying feeling seeing a moon slam into a planet and the fireworks start. The visuals are wonderful, its incredibly pretty and has a great asthetic I love it and the sounds of the weapons are wonderful and firing units from planet to planet with a giant cannon is just so much fun.\n\nBut I was expecting more. Just one 'faction' no real differences between commanders aside just a aesthetic change, and the general victory condition is build engine on moon/asteroid, fire into planet, win. It may be an old game but Supreme Commander is still a far superiour game to this and honestly its better to just buy that if you want huge scale war with factions that play differently, and certainly makes you seriously fight for your victory.","January 10","false","7.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Although there are a lot of talk about bugs and such, I don't get that many groundbreaking mishaps. The only thing that consitintely annoy you is the sometimes illogical unit pathfinding. Units will sometimes take a long path, ignore your initial orders, or just do ♥♥♥♥ about one every five games. This is'nt game breaking as it only requires to reselect the units but you'll learn to get used to it.\n\nAs for graphics quality, it looks amazing but doesn't betray the artsyle it comes with. You will come to appreciate the ammount of art that went into the game.\n\nUnit balance is good, and each unit clearly has it's own set of niches while more advance units will generally fill a single nich extremely well. Allowing unit knowledge to turn the tides.\n\n\n\n\nThis game is going to a blast for you if you enjoy the macro unit onslaught, a more offensive based RTS, easy to use micro-managing, and huge epic battles","April 29","true","128.6"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

This game has lots of similarities to SCOM. It has the same economic system, instead of Mass, you have metal and energy. It works the same way like SCOM, you have a meter that has a certain number and as you build that number gets smaller until you build more Metal Exractors. Besides that, there is also the single unit mechainic (which means that one singular unit is made in one time) which is not my favriote unless the game makes it balanced. While there is no campaighn, you do have Galactic War which is a much longer gamemode than skirmish. Also this game allows you to have lots and lots of big battles. Back in SCOM if you were to have too many A.I's duking it out untill the very end the game would get very slow and laggy, but in this game you can have 10 players and still run the game smoothly. Also, annihilating a planet is pretty darn fun.

First off, adding a bunch of units while barely changing anything else does not warrant an entirely new game, and secondly, a lot of the features and content in this "game" (read: DLC) were promised in the original kickstarter for the first game.\n\nPlanetary Annihilation: TITANS also uses the exact same engine as the first game and thus, shares a lot of the same bugs with the first game. Bugs such as units not responding to right clicks and large armies freezing up and not responding are extremely common and still here, and, while I can't think of any new ones off the top of my head, there are definently a bunch of new bugs in TITANS as well.\n\nWhile the actual units and titans are well done, they do not warrant an entirely new game. Uber seems to have forgotten about the glaring issues with the original PA and has not fixed them in TITANS either. They still owe it to their fans and backers (some of which who spent $90 to support them) to actually fix the first game and are really betraying them by making them pay $40 for several new units. At most, this game should be a $5-10 DLC, and really could even be released a free patch.","August 23, 2015","false","3.2"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","22","45","0","1"

Unfortunately, it just wasn't meant to be.\n\nWhile it has some really cool features, like slamming asteroids into planets with massive, world-shattering explosions, or just vaporising planets with your very own Death Star, all that shiny goodness is not enough to make up for what it lacks in gameplay.\nThe maps are boring, and terrain features make little to no difference to your tactics. You might as well be fighting on the surface of a billiard ball. The economy, while similar to TA and SC, somehow doesn't play quite the same way, meaning that the carefull resource management that was needed in Supreme Commander is not much of a factor anymore.\nCombine that with small maps that are also wrap-around, means that if you prefer to play turtle you are shooting yourself in the foot. Rushing is the only viable option, since defending your ever expanding base on all sides is all but impossible, especially since terrain features hardly offer any bottlenecks that you can use.\n\nI love blowing up planets, I love the way the game looks, but I hate that it lacks the depth, size, and scope that TA and SC had. Battles do not feel epic because the battlefields are so small and fights are over in seconds.\n\nAs an RTS, Planetary Annihiliation is a good, perhaps even a great game. As a descendant of its ancestors, it is merely so-so. So buy it if you are looking for an RTS with inovative features and quick combat. Do not buy if you are hoping to recaputre the glory of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander.\n","August 23, 2015","false","8.3"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

Yes, but there is one issue that I cannot F&%KING stand and that is Commander Snipping. Commander Snipping is the act in which the enemy team discovers where your commander is and directs a quick attack against him. The easiest and most common way of doing this is by sending a fairly large group of Orbital Laser Platforms right above the commander and fire down upon them, killing the commander, and then winning the game. Understand that the commander is not a strong unit that can take a huge amount of hits before exploding. The commander is actually very weak and a small group of enemy tanks can destoy a commander if the commander does not have back-up.\n\nI was just in a game with my friend where he and I were slowly putting the enemy team on the defensive. We had a strong economy, strong defences on our planet, and we were slowly removing the enemy from the Laser Planet. It was clear that were were the better players. What did they do? The enemy team sent a team of 5 Omegas and 20 Orbital Lasers to the general area of where they last saw my commander. I was in the process of moving my commander after their orbial radar arrived in my planet's orbit. The Commander moves stupidly slow so those 5 Omegas and 20 Orbital Lasers arrived nearly right above my commander. How long did it take for their orbital units to kill my commander? Like 5 seconds! How do you combat that? You honestly can't! It takes several seconds for Catapult attacks to arrive at their target(from the ground to space), the Umbrella's hit the target's instantly, but do not do a lot of damage, and my orbital Avengers take a second to repond to the new threat and they don't do a lot of damage individually. If the enemy tells all their orbial units to target my commander on the ground, it is game over.\n\nThis pisses me off because we were the better player's but the enemy team is able to kill ONE unit and win the game. It also annoys me that this is easily avoidable by the developement team. I remember sending the development team an E-mail in the early days of the Origainl Planetary Annihilation asking the team to provide player with the ability to choose the "End Game." The first choice is that the game ends upon the Commander's death (like as it is now). The second choice is that the game ends when the Commander and every unit (excluding buildings) is destroyed by the enemy team. I received an E-mail response from them saying Thank you and that they will consider it.  Years later and they never have. We would have won the game if my forces were not destroyed and it ruined my fun.\n\nI want to point out that I am not a sore loser when the enemy team beats me by out performing me in the game with real strategies. I become a sore loser when the enemy turns to cheap, easy tatics that anyone can come up with to win. To the PA developement team, please make a second "end game."\n\nNow I feel better now that I have let that out.","May 2","true","46.8"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","48","13","27","6","4"

It's a pretty fun game and even if it's a really simple RTS sometimes it requires strategic skills. Graphics looks good, nothing incredible but I enjoyed this 3d cartoon feeling and animations are really well made. With that said I think that the price should be lower, I bought it during Christmas Sales at a good price but the original one was too expansive. I recommend this Titan version of the game becuase it introduces some new troops...Anyway DEVELOPERS SHOULD NOT MAKE PAID STANDALONE EXPANSIONS FOR A LITTLE GAME LIKE THIS...JUST UPDATE IT (there are still a lot of unsolved problems)! That's what makes me really upset, why you should upgrade your game for extra money? Luckly I directly bought the Titan version but there are many gamers that had to do the upgrade. Another negative aspect is that the game does not feauture tons of players so sometimes you have play with IA. In the end nice idea, quite good graphics and mechanics but definitly NOT HONEST DEVELOPERS and that's why I'm gonna give a negative vote to the game!\n\nPer gli italiani: Il gioco è piacevole e nel complesso ben fatto ma la strategia di marketing fatta degli sviluppatori è disonesta poichè dovrebbero pensare ad aggiornare il gioco gratuitamente visto che comunque ha diverse lacune!

It plays similar SupCom and Total Annihilation, but trades off variety (only one race but a mod changes that) for a more large scale game. I could never take this game seriously, which is a good thing, as I always play this game casually and always have a fun time.\n\nYes, I would recommend this game, as I have enjoyed playing this thoroughly. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because I don't want to support Uber Entertainment, but just look at any negative review to see why. Grab this game when it's on sale here or on the Humble Store, as the asking price is a bit too much, but please remember I'm recommending the game, not Uber Entertainment.","April 4","true","55.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The game is fought on a planetary scale, and what you do on the planet has little effect on the overall war. You gain control of that map spot and you get to choose one of the randomly generated bonuses after each location capture.\n\nImagine the smallest and simplest RTS you have ever played and imagine if the developer made each skirmish so that you had to win 10+ skirmishes to win a skirmish in this game. That is what this game is. It is a tiny map with simplistic units and very little strategy. You just have to win several of those small skirmishes to win a skirmish in this poorly thought out RTS. It is nothing like what I had hoped for.","January 11","false","2.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This game seems to be taking a lot of flak from people but it mostly sounds like its coming from people who kick started the game in early stages. I decided to try it out and i'm loving it so far, kinda reminds me of Age of Empires or Command and Conquer:Generals. So far its a game that you can enjoy playing by yourself, one of very few games i can say that about these days. It was kind of difficult getting my friend into my lobby because apparently the latest update kinda screwed up the party system with friends. You can circumvent this problem by making your custum game public and adding a password that you give to your friends so only they can join. The graphics are pretty enjoyable, i love the style that the developers chose, especially the large explosions from nukes or dying commanders. There are many different units and buildings to build, half of which i've barely explored so far. Overall, i don't have and cons of this game so far, only positives! I will update this review if i find something. 10/10","January 11","true","10.0"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","13","28","0","1"

No problem! Just build a giant rocket on one of your moons, and fly it into their homeworld... Et voila! Not too many games I've played let you enjoy wanton destruction on this kind of scale! The artistic style of the game adds to the over-the-top weaponry to make a very enjoyable product!\n\nThis game is pretty easy to pick up, despite a lacklustre Tutorial built-in. I don't have a lot of play time yet but I can see how a single 'game' can last anywhere from 5-10m to 60+ which is great, so I can play a short game when I choose or settle in for a day of conquest!\n\nI am not too fond of having to connect to servers and all that jazz for single-player games, on my end its just non-value-added time added to loading sequences, and a tendency to feel choppy at times because I share my connection in a rural area. (Yes, in single player I notice this- it is NOT game-breaking by any means!).\n\nFor me this is a good pickup in the $15-$20 range!\n\n","January 9","true","5.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAmMe122/recommended/386070/","IAmMe122","Luxion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAmMe122/","78 products in account","NOTE: Many reviews for this game are negative solely because of the developers' choices, not on the game itself. I will agree that the devs have overall cheated many people of their money, especially early backers, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the game itself. I will talk about the game only in this review.\n\nI've put up a kind of funny review of the base game Planetary Annihilation, but it wasn't too helpful. I will make a legit review here.\n\nWhat is this game exactly? This game is an RTS that takes place across a solar system. Each solar system varies, most provided in-game are only 1 planet big, but can be many planets big as well. But what does that mean? Essentially, you can start on one planet and build up your economy and an army and all that. However, with the help of orbital units, which I'll get to later, you can travel to another planet and start to expand there. This is the most unique thing about this game, in my opinion.\n\nSo, how diverse is this RTS? Not as diverse unit-wise as Supreme Commander or other RTS's, but enough to compete. There are 5 unit types: Land, Bot, Sea, Air, and Orbital. Bots are just smaller, less powerful versions of Land units, but very easy to mass-produce. Orbital units are units that, as the game stated "rain death from above on units that rain death from above." Orbital units are not the best at fighting, but they are mainly used to gain access to other planets and other uses. The economy is essentially the same as the other well-known RTS's: Metal, to be gotten from specific metal spots on planets; and Energy, which can be generated wherever you like. The Titans are essentially the Experimentals from Supreme Commander 2, so not a whole lot to talk about there. All and all, the game is a solid RTS,  so yeah.\n\nDemolishing planets? Yes, you saw right. There are certain "game-ending" things that you can do, such as destroying entire planets. For example, you can build giant thrusters on a moon and crash it into the planet that your enemy's on. These thrusters are a pain in the butt to make, but they're worth it. One of the screenshots looks like the Death Star that's shooting a giant laser. This is another means of planetary annihilation (hence the name). If the metal planet (Death Star) is present in your game, you can build 5 special structures at 5 special points to gain control of it. These special structures are even more of a pain in the butt to make, but once a player gets their hands on the metal planet, it's essentially game over. Or you can crash a moon into the metal planet and just not worry about it.\n\nOh yeah, there's also a System Designer where you can make your own systems to play in. If you like designing maps, you'll like it. If not, just don't use it, simple as that.\n\nIs this game worth it? On a sale, yes. $40 is steep for this game. Unless you REALLY want this game, I would wait for a sale. This game is so fun, especially with some friends to play with. The people reviewing this game negative only because of the devs should really vent somewhere else, just not in a review.","January 10","true","9.7"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","3"

Rant over..\n\nSo I purchased this during the winter sale and for $13 bucks and it has turned out to be a great game.  A really good RTS with some things that I feel are unique. The ability to destroy planets ala the Empire's star destoyer and the ability to fight on different planets in the same solar system are features that make is a fun game on the whole.  A very good twist to the standard RTS model.\n\nGood graphics great music make this a keeper in my library.  Is it worth 3 Grande  Lattes at $3.65 each? Yes it is.  Is it worth 10 (normal price of $39.95) uh no it is not.  There are better premium classic RTS games that are actually less expensive.\n\nRant #2 on another note I have always felt that Kickstarter campaigns for gaming is a waste of money, A bigger waste than early access.  All you are doing is encouraging Vapor Ware.  Vapor Ware are Games that just evaporate into the ethos and never really deliver or are never really ever made.

I also played all of the Total Annihilation games and Supreme Commander games so I'm pretty experienced with this game type.\n\nThe AI on the highest level is actually pretty decent and presents a reasonable challenge all things considered. It expands rapidly, and attacks aggressively, with large numbers. Which is actually better than previous games in which the computer tended to just stream units at you, rather than building large forces, even with the best mods. You usually had to let the AI cheat in previous games to get a challenge, but in this game, the AI just plays pretty well. It does seem to bottom out though with utilizing a lot of tech 2 units and mass extractors.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the orbital concept of the game. I think it was a good idea to incorporate space faring vessels but I think it would have been better had they not been just locked into an orbit around planets, and maybe were allowed to roam freely in space. Might have made the game incredibly complex, but I think theoretically it could have been done and would have been much more interesting with proper camera control etc. But its not a big deal and the oribal units are still a positive for the game.\n\nIf you liked any of the Supreme Commander games or Total Annihilation games, you'll probably enjoy this game. Most of the negative reviews are by people who felt they were badly treated by the company that developed the game, but in the company's defense, I think they had good intentions but just didn't have enough money. Just because you contributed money to developing the game, you have to know its a risk going in that the game could flop. It's a gamble from the very beginning. They re-released the game to obviously try and save it, and I don't think they had much choice in doing so. I don't think it was their intent to cheat people.\n\nI can understand the kickstarter's frustrations and yet its not fair to give the game a bad rating simply because you're angry at the company. I think the game should be rated on its merits purely as a game, regardless of what you think of the company, and if doing so, its a good game, and well designed.\n\nI was not one of the kickstarters for this game and recently purchased it on sale so I can't really judge people for being angry though. I just want to give the game an honest review of the actual game.\n\nSo, to summarize, I'm very satisfied with the product. I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale though. I'd say the game is worth about $25, but $40 is pretty steep. The game lacks a lot of elements including story etc but it does have a very simple campaign style of game where you conquer systems, and gain bonuses along the way gaining access to more units and upgrades, which is fun.\n\nIt has a few bugs still, such as the sound effects dying after a few missions, requiring a restart of the game. Overall though, it feels like Supcom but on a bit of a larger scale as you can move to other planets.

I also played all of the Total Annihilation games and Supreme Commander games so I'm pretty experienced with this game type.\n\nThe AI on the highest level is actually pretty decent and presents a reasonable challenge all things considered. It expands rapidly, and attacks aggressively, with large numbers. Which is actually better than previous games in which the computer tended to just stream units at you, rather than building large forces, even with the best mods. You usually had to let the AI cheat in previous games to get a challenge, but in this game, the AI just plays pretty well. It does seem to bottom out though with utilizing a lot of tech 2 units and mass extractors.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the orbital concept of the game. I think it was a good idea to incorporate space faring vessels but I think it would have been better had they not been just locked into an orbit around planets, and maybe were allowed to roam freely in space. Might have made the game incredibly complex, but I think theoretically it could have been done and would have been much more interesting with proper camera control etc. But its not a big deal and the oribal units are still a positive for the game.\n\nIf you liked any of the Supreme Commander games or Total Annihilation games, you'll probably enjoy this game. Most of the negative reviews are by people who felt they were badly treated by the company that developed the game, but in the company's defense, I think they had good intentions but just didn't have enough money. Just because you contributed money to developing the game, you have to know its a risk going in that the game could flop. It's a gamble from the very beginning. They re-released the game to obviously try and save it, and I don't think they had much choice in doing so. I don't think it was their intent to cheat people.\n\nI can understand the kickstarter's frustrations and yet its not fair to give the game a bad rating simply because you're angry at the company. I think the game should be rated on its merits purely as a game, regardless of what you think of the company, and if doing so, its a good game, and well designed.\n\nI was not one of the kickstarters for this game and recently purchased it on sale so I can't really judge people for being angry though. I just want to give the game an honest review of the actual game.\n\nSo, to summarize, I'm very satisfied with the product. I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale though. I'd say the game is worth about $25, but $40 is pretty steep. The game lacks a lot of elements including story etc but it does have a very simple campaign style of game where you conquer systems, and gain bonuses along the way gaining access to more units and upgrades, which is fun.\n\nIt has a few bugs still, such as the sound effects dying after a few missions, requiring a restart of the game. Overall though, it feels like Supcom but on a bit of a larger scale as you can move to other planets. Its like playing on more than one supcom map at a time if the game actually gets to that point before someone wins.\n\nIf the game had more unit diversity and more faction diversity, that could greatly improve its worth. I'm not sure if the developer is still working on this game a lot, but as it is right now, its not bad, and worth your time if you like this type of game.\n\n","January 20","true","53.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

BIT slow for me but all units are very unique except for the bots. the titan units are AMAZING FUN. the walking one especially. now the trailer where you see the crafts in space you cant do that. or atleast i dont think so. making swarms of robots while defending your self from orbital, flying, walking, and driving vehicles is amazing. the idea is great im mean who DOESNT like smashing planets together, destroying the, blowing them up with the death star, nuking your enemies, and creating HUGE titan units to annihilate your friends in a faster and better way. The game is worth the money. I've played this game for about less than a month and I LOVE IT. i am a beginner and have lost MANY times. but im still getting used to it. the graphic style isnt WOW LOOK HOW MANY LEAVES ARE ON THAT TREE or LOOK AT THE FIRE AND SMOKE AND VISUALS which is amazing. the graphic style is simple but complex. this game for me would be worth $60.

I started playing pretty early on and have been here each update. The devs have been putting a lot of work into this game since it started in early access and the updates were farely frequent and added new stuff as well as fix old stuff. This game is awesome, one of my favourite rts' even. The idea of having multiple planets in an rts has ruined me. I just wish other games incorporated scale like this. But keep in mind that this isn't an amazing rts by most people standards. The game itself is pretty simple so the only difficulty is in managing the scale of the battle. You'll be warring over planets, fighting for control over moons and the metal planet for huge tactical advantages (slamming or blasting a hole in your oponents planet). It's not easy to play but it is crazy and when you get used to it it's really fun.\n\nNow for the controversy...\n\nThey released a dlc pack for the game which really did add a lot to the game (A lot of new units and titans mostly). But the problem (if you can call it one) is that this pack is a stand alone dlc. What that means is that if you buy the dlc, you get the entire game plus the dlc (This was the only way to get the dlc, Now you can buy the base game and the dlc is dlc)). I bought this game for about $45 on a steam sale and I got the dlc for $10. Now when you consider that I technically got a new game for $10 it really isn't a problem. Sure my friends didn't want to get the expansion but guess what, I just play the base game with them because thats what they have. Even if this weren't standalone NOTHING would be any different. So despite what you may read in other reviews, this game is great, the devs worked hard, and "Titans" was never a problem.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes rts games because it really brings a lot of new stuff to the genre. It's not the best rts out there but what it tries to do, it does well enough to be enjoyable at least casually.","March 12","true","14.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

For the most part, I've only played the Titans version, and found that it brings a very different style of play vs C&C, Blizzard RTSs and the like.  The campaign is good at getting you accustomed to the game and multiplayer proves fun too.  With bots, vehicles, air, orbital, naval, and artillery as viable strategies, there's a great deal of ability to vary gameplay.  For the most part, balance is also well done such that there isn't one particular strategy that will always win the day.\n\nDownsides\n1) It's occasionally buggy, though improved from what it used to be like.  On occasion a mission will start with a white map for me, but a quick restart of the game generally sorts it with no gameplay lost.\n2) It can also become a bit monotonous if you let it—it's up to you to be creative in your gameplay to keep yourself interested.  But this can be said of many RTS games.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend playing.","March 18","true","85.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I love it. Sure, they could add some things/ work on some other stuff and I could cry about it, but I really enjoy what is already in here and wish I could find this in more RTS games. Let me, instead, respond to the negative reviews:\n\n"Poor UI" (user interface): Coming from a huge fan of the original StarCraft which makes me very fond of the sequel, every time I go back to SC2 from SCFA or PA Titans, I feel like I've literally been shoved into a box. Zoom out from ground level to orbit and even the solar sytem. Not many games do this, but it is becoming a trend (which I am SO glad to see).\n\n"Laggy": And it should be with how many units are in play across  the entire system. It's a demanding game and so is Ashes of the Singularity. Even then, I'm running a Skylake i5 6500 processor and 16Gb of DDR4 ram with NO, I repeat, NO graphics card and I only have issues when I go up against 10 bots. Upgrade your system or don't play against 10 bots or 15 players.\n\n"I payed $90 and didn't get Titans for free": You "pledged" $90 to see this game come to life. Some people pledged and/or outright donated up to $250 and were happy with their decision. This should sum it up - http://steamcommunity.com/app/386070/discussions/0/521643320349717574/\nThere are plenty like this thread if you Google it. Everyone wants the game for free at this point.\n\n"The AI is dumb": Get a mod! There are so many people who back this game up and help create mods to make it even better! I personally went to them for issues when I first purchased the game and they are super friendly and helpful. And I personally find it hilarious when the AI kills itself (which happens to be rare, only 2 times so far, and possibly patched now).\n\n"The Devs gave up on it": Not really. They're pretty busy with updates and future projects/games. I feel that Steam users like to throw this phrase around a lot more than it's needed.\n\nAll in all, if you are new to this franchise, I would highly recommend it. Well worth $40 in my opinion (though I did wait until it went on sale for $20 because I'm poor and shouldn't be buying games. lol) and I'll be looking forward to more games like this in the future.\n\n*Update* I added a Radeon R7 370 graphics card from Sapphire with 4Gb of DDR5 ram and this game runs FLAWLESSLY with myself vs 9 AIs on the same team (spamming units on different planets and all)! I still don't understand how people get such bad lag with this game.\n\n10/10 Would watch the bot commit suicide with the Ragnarok again.","March 21","true","167.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Everything from Noah Unit Cannons to Experimental Units (Titans in this game) --Sorry.. no Robotic T-REX lol\n\nAll commanders have access to the same units regardless of what commander you pick.. there is no "Faction" based units that are similar with differences.. such as in starcraft. which i dont mind at all really.\n\nin addition to the traditional LAND and AIR units... you now also have BOT units.. which act like a group all their own.. less durable and less damaging than the rest by far.,.. but easily manufactured fast and in great numbers... there is also the ORBITAL units which orbit the planet or you can send them off to another planet.\n\nYou can build teleporters to easily transfer troups from one side of the galaxy to another.. which is nice and its not a very big galaxy.. it might sound more daunting than it really is... for example... a radar plane would probably be able to travel a full revolution around a plant in about 30 seconds or so.. while obviously taking longer for ground units.. maybe a few minutes... traveling from your planet to anotehr can take a minute or two depending if its in your system or an outlieing planet.\n\nThe battles can be massive... the troups are amazing.. and the overall gamepplay feels great..\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\nIn multiplayer games... the spawn system needs work.. if there are 3 plantes with 5 starting locations or more.. for a total  of 15 spawn points and you have say 8 players... the odds you are going to end up picking the same exact spawn point as an enemy commander is a posibility... and it sucks when that happens.. Hopefully they will turn the spawn system into a draft kind making it so no 2 players can spawn at the same location but maybe highlight whereb your teammates have picked if they are going before you so you can spawn close to them if you want.\n\nThere is a serious lack of customization in multiplayer set up for custom games.. all you really have control over if the map (or star system) which you can also customize i think. But you cant say... restrict the game to only LAND units.. if you wanted.. or only air.. and you cant turn off devastating effects like Nukes.... there is also a unit if you build it.. and complete it... it destroys the planet it is on.. which is neat.. but not fun when you are on a planet that gets wiped out.. there is another unit that will essentially thwor a plant at your planet destroying both... which is also not fun.. there needs to be an ability to turn these types of units off..\n\nThe ORBITAL units are neat.. but annoying after a while.. the abilitiy to turn off specific units is also missing so you could use only transports and radar vehicles from the orbital structures.. that would be nice.. but sadly.. you cant do that.\n\nThe matchmaking is bad right now.. not many players online... most i have seen is 3000... but once it really gets gooing that will hopefully pick up... almost no one does ranked.. ive only managed to do one ranked match withoiut waiting for more than 10 minutes..\n\nthere is no campaign... there are galactic battles where you travel from star system to star system on a map unlocking aditional paths when you beat one and then unlocking tech that will benifit you later in the planets from then on.,. there really isnt a goal for that. i dont see the point.\n\nthe tutorial feels only about half done.. it doesnt touch on most of the units or special units.. it doesnt tell you what to do with gas planets and i had to find ouyt on my own watching other players use them for energy sources from orbital units.. and i was like OHHH..\n\n\n\nOVERALL i woulkd recommend this game.. but not for more than 20 dollars.. i got it 70% off and i was happy with the purchase.. wait for a sale or watch a lot of gameplay before you decide to get it.. hopefully since its still early access that it will get better.. but its a good waste of time right now.","January 13","true","28.8"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

Fight over one planet, two planets- entire solar systems. Game keeps moving at a constant pace due to the plethora of ways to annihilate campers such as nukes, titans, self destruct mining lasers that drill to the core of the planet, death star esque annihilasers, orbital bombardment capable battleships & satellites, and a large array of units. Never have boundaries aside from the terrain and the edge of the solar system you're fighting in. My one piece of advice to you if you decide to pick up this game; never stop expanding and attacking your enemy or you will soon face total annihilation!\n\nOn the topic of the game's re-release,\n\nUltimately I feel like it was a bad call for the re-release, developers should have worked on the game they had and earned back the respect they lost during the early life of the game. I feel like if they released Titans at a much cheaper price, or perhaps just let it loose as a free DLC it would have driven many more sales and the steam reviews would've started to turn around. The developers had their reasons for doing things how they did, and ultimately I've chosen to forgive them over what I believe is a minor transgression. Don't let the drama stop you from coming in as a new player, chances are we'll only have a better game from here on out.","January 16","true","40.7"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

Impresively deep with its strategy and play style. I like the fact that combat can take place on land, sea, air, and orbital. Makes for some great options. My only complaint (which is shared by many, I'm sure) is that there are no different factions to force play style. That's really all a faction is: a forced change in play-style and artistic theme. While the change in artistic theme isn't an option, the different ways to play was many. You can build nothing but builders and defenses, then nuke the world into submission (like the terran's from StarCraft). You can spam cheap units early on and try to rush them (Zerg). Or you can build a massive air army and slowly glass the planet (Protos). So, while you're not forced into options, you're also not giving away your play-style with your faction. Give and take. Would recommend.","January 16","true","37.2"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

Being a top 10 player, I can say that you can play this game competitively.\nThere are plenty of ease of use features that make the large scale of PA a doable task.  Team games can be played in a "shared army" format meaning all members share the same units and resources.  You can queue up countless orders.

Having said that, the game is quite good, I purchased the original for $29.99 CAD and got the expansion for $10.94 CAD.  Overall, I'm pretty happy withis arrangement as the rerelease is quite good and reminiscent of SupCom.\n\nMechanics wise, you will want a PC that isn't entry level as planet dynamics and no unit caps will slow down with just the sheer number of physics calculations made, however it will run really well on any mid-high pcs.\n\nGameplay is your typical Total Annihilation mass unit genre with Titans thrown in.  The numerous ways to destroy a planet gives unspoken objects and can get quite hectic as you race to destroy your opponent's commander.\n\nI would recommend this to anybody at a decreased price point (70% off right now), since it is a quality game.... it just had a very shaky start.","January 10","true","2.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

In the Wargame franchise, there's a system of units that counter other units that results in interesting gameplay. As far as I can tell, PA:T has none of that. There are strong units and there are spam units. Spam units just die, and strong units massacre everything.\n\nBeyond that, gameplay (I think) is limited to one type of game, where you have to destroy the enemy commander. By spamming one type of bomber, I was able to win every game against the AI that I played. There were no consequences for just spamming and saying "f*** off" to strategy and tactics. Really, this is a real time spam game.\n\nI briefly enjoyed the campaign, until I made the mistake of picking the "Subcommander" perk, which gives you an AI to help you. Seems cool, right?\n\nNot if you actually enjoy playing the damn game! The allied AI commanders are way faster and way more efficient that you could ever possibly be, which makes the game kinda pointless to play- I literally couldn't mobilize my forces fast enough to get into combat at all.\n\nThe game offers a fairly deep base building mechanic, but you almost never get to build your base up. On every map, I tried to actually build a "titan" unit, and usually the AI won the game for me before it was even done building. Ugh.\n\nOn other games without the AI commander, I  was able to build my titans, and, well, they're kinda game ending. What do I mean by that? Well, I sent one to an enemy planet and told it to kill the enemy commander. I then ignored it for about five minutes until the game notified me that I had won.\n\nWhoo?\n\nOn the positive side, the game has some seriously cool things to it- I love the concept of combat on multiple levels- Ground, air, undersea, and orbit. Orbital mechanics are neat and don't require KSP levels of knowledge. It's fun waging war across an entire solar system all at once, provided that you can actually keep track of the action. Some of the units are legitimately badass to look at. The art style is neat, and the music is good.\n\nReally, I wish that the developers would take a little more from RTS games like Homeworld and Wargame. It needs more strategy, and the gameplay mechanics have a lot of potential. It just needs to actually be a strategy game that's fun to play, and I'm yet to really have fun playing this.","January 11","false","8.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

The graphics, beautiful. Everything had the massive sense of scale that a game played on a galactic scale needs, and yet still had enough detail in each of the units for me to just spend five or so minutes staring at my units, admiring how nice they look. The sound design was fantastic, even though I got one or two glitches, sound effects playing at the wrong time, etc, it wasn't anything really noticeable until I tried pushing the game to its limits, which brings me to my next point: performance. The game ran AMAZINGLY, supporting hundreds of units on screen at any given time, even when I had a second picture in picture screen displaying some of the busiest regions of the game. I almost never experienced lag, and when I did, it was generally because of a background task on my computer. As for the gameplay, as I said I'm not a big RTS player so I can't really compare it to much, but what I have played is thoroughly entertaining - addictive even. Since I spent about 4 hours straight playing matches of the game over and over, I reckon you could say I liked it. All in all, definitely worth the $31 US it costs, but if you're not willing to spend that much, wait for it to go on sale, and buy it. Either way, buy this game, because it's all round fantastic.","January 28","true","26.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

In the Wargame franchise, there's a system of units that counter other units that results in interesting gameplay. As far as I can tell, PA:T has none of that. There are strong units and there are spam units. Spam units just die, and strong units massacre everything.\n\nBeyond that, gameplay (I think) is limited to one type of game, where you have to destroy the enemy commander. By spamming one type of bomber, I was able to win every game against the AI that I played. There were no consequences for just spamming and saying "f*** off" to strategy and tactics. Really, this is a real time spam game.\n\nI briefly enjoyed the campaign, until I made the mistake of picking the "Subcommander" perk, which gives you an AI to help you. Seems cool, right?\n\nNot if you actually enjoy playing the damn game! The allied AI commanders are way faster and way more efficient that you could ever possibly be, which makes the game kinda pointless to play- I literally couldn't mobilize my forces fast enough to get into combat at all.\n\nThe game offers a fairly deep base building mechanic, but you almost never get to build your base up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marshii/recommended/386070/","Marshii","Marshii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marshii/","323 products in account","So, I've been asked many times to write a review for Planetary Annihilation.\nBe sure to check out my overview on youtube\nShould you have any feedback, comments, questions or suggestions, post them below and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability!\n\nBefore I begin, I'd just like to ask a favor of the reader - that you think critically and look into the merits and flaws of each review, including this one. I've seen damning reviews by people who have barely spent any time with PA, or by those new to strategy games, or who disregard the game because of spherical maps. Are those really worth your consideration?\nI'll outline my biases here and now: I did not kickstart the game, I purchased the Alpha prior to launch and have played and made youtube content for PA ever since (for about 2+ years as of the time of this review). I have a good rapport with the developers and have attended PA's PAX booth by invitation. Obviously I am invested in the game, the community and the development team. That said, I am going to make this review as open-minded as possible.\n\nWhat is PA?It's a massive scale RTS game where you can command 1000s of units across a whole solar system with a variety of strategies open to you. A robust planet(map) generation system allows essentially unlimited map variation at your fingertips. Indeed there are a number of planet 'biomes' creating different strategic options themselves from desert and ice and oceanic biomes to earth, moon and lava and even the resource rich gas giants! Of course, as a new player you will need to allow some time to get used to the idea of spherical maps in an RTS game and how to navigate and orientate yourself. There are features to help with this; togglable Pole-Lock ensures that the planet's orientation remains constant. Gone are the days of turtling into a corner; you now have a corner of 360 degrees of approach.\nIn game, there are many modalities of combat; land (vehicles and bots), sea, air and even an orbital layer. Fancy building a base on that moon over there - go and do it, launch an attack from it at a beachhead you have established on a different planet - do it. It's all up to what you decide to do in any given game. There are many different mechanics in the game as well like Unit cannons, periodically available asteroids and planet destruction methods. Such include planetary engines, super-lasers and now the Ragnarok Titan. Of course there is the nuclear option, should you decide to invest the resources.\nThe game is also easily moddable with a thriving mod scene established since alpha. Visit the Uber forums to download PAMM (PA Mod Manager) to have instant access to UI and server mods created by the community as well as map packs from a variety of creators.\n\nWhat does the TITANS standalone expansion bring to the party?The unit pool has been expanded greatly with TITANS and is definitely worth the upgrade for existing PA owners and easily worth the purchase price for prospectives.  TITANS also brings improvements to terrain with a much better scaled than 'classic' PA, as well as a new 'Bounty mode' where you get economic bonuses depending on how many people you knocked out. The expansion also brings polish to the game, along with AI and Galactic War improvements. Let's not forget the host of new units, 21 to be precise as well as 5 badass titans refers you back to my overview video above. This expansion also sees the return of unit wreckage, which players can reclaim for resources, as well as 'hover' units enabling new strategies to circumvent water and lava obstacles.\n\n"I've played PA and it was pretty meh, why should I reconsider?"I will admit that PA, prior to TITANS was at a stage where, I believe, it was beginning to stagnate. Since release a number of big features were added that spurred discussion, introduced new possibilities and fun mechanics (Super-laser, Unit Cannons, Asteroids and full planet smashing) though aside from that PAs updates consisted mainly of general polish, bug-fixing, AI and pathing improvements etc. While this is not to say that these improvements haven't had a cumulative impact over time, I will say that the base game remained largely unchanged and unit balance was in a good place.\nThen BANG, TITANS dropped 'outta nowhere'. If anything it shows that PA can definitely still be built on and drastically improved.\n\n"You said you'd be balanced and so far you've been almost entirely positive - what're you leaving out hmm? *squints*"I did say I'd be balanced and here are the drawbacks of PA at the time of writing this review;\n~The player-base is relatively small so thelikelihood is that in modes like 'Ranked 1v1' you will likely be waiting a long time for a game, and over time find that you recognise a lot of faces and may often be matched poorly due to the lack of players on that mode.\n~Pathfinding still leaves much to be desired. In combination with a few annoyances involving the new terrain, such as units on low ground being able to shoot up, but units on high ground not being able to shoot down or over the edge of ramps, the result can be frustration.\n~There are still a number of bugs (though being worked on, improved and fixed all the time) which may serve to lessen your play experience, such as lobby bugs, disconnects, crashes and more. All I can do here is urge patience and to help the devs fix these by reporting issues on their forums and bug tracking pages.\n~With the host of new units, some may argue that there are a few balance issues - this is likely the case though by and large balance is in a good place at the moment where each unit, with a couple of exceptions, serve a purpose.\n~There is still discussion on-going in the forums as to whether or not entire planet smashing (regardless of planetoid size - i.e. no leaving of craters / partial destruction of larger planet) is a good gameplay mechanic. The reason this was implemented was due to technical difficulties with pathfinding for craters. I'm sure given time, effort and money this issue may be resolved, but for the time being it is good that we have something that works, though may or may not be what would be 'best'. Again, this is debatable.\n\nAll things considered, were you to ask me whether I recommended PA 'Classic' I would have said "Yes, but...." adding some caveats. Should you ask me if I recommend PA:Titans my reply would be "Yes, definietly" - put it this way, I've been with PA for 2+ years and PA Titans has managed to reignite my excitement for the game even after all that time, despite my previously being on the verge of burnout.\n\nTo comment on the general hate of Uber and PA; I believe TITANS shows irrefutably that Uber do not abandon their games, it shows that they are dedicated to pleasing fans, and reinforces that they are great people who love fun. For those hating PA because it was $90 at alpha, don't cut off your nose to spite your face! The package is worth the asking price easily.\n\nI hope this has at least made you a little more aware of what a hidden gem this game is, even if it is still largely a diamond in the rough... who knows... maybe there's even more updates Uber have up their sleeves?","October 2, 2015","true","485.5"," 22 of 49 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","22","49","2","0"

I'm hearing that before Titans, the gameplay was buggy and annoying, but playing PA with Titans first, it feels like a well-polished, super-neat RTS.\n\nAnd there's ranked play, too!","January 9","true","8.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Its all f******g b******t , For one, The original game was stunning, glitchy and crashy maybe, but still one of the best games i have ever bought. As for Titans, If you owned the original, it is rather pricy considering it isnt a full remake. But even so, This game brings fun and strategy together like you have never seen before. It gives you limitless options;Orbital strikes,Orbital defense, Orbital Army, Orbital domination, Naval Strikes, naval defenses, NAval army, Naval dominatiopn, Suicide bots, Not cannons, Bot/vehicle army, Tank Artillery strikes, OVerall domination, Artillery strikes, Artillery defense, Air defense, air bombers, Pelicans, Zeus lightning ships, Atlas sei(awesome)mic titan, Ares moving fortress, Orbital teleporter, Nano bot swarms, death star laser blast, Colliding planets , Nuking planets core's.\n\nIf this game is on sale, you should have already bought it, if its not, you should be saving up. THis game runs smoothly unless you get ridiculous. 10v10 Mini moon matches, 1v1v1v1v1v1 Pax ffa's, Ai skirmishes, Galatic wars, Mods, Player vs com. Challenging ai and AWESOME SOUNDTRACK(like seriously the best soundtrack i've ever heard) are all just normal features of this amazing game.\n\nTLDR: THis game is friggin awesome if you like blowing planet sup and destroying EVERYTHING!

I tried it again a few days ago, and bought Titan, without even really thinking about it, since I read abut it some weks ago.\nThose 2.4 hours I spent in it were really fun, I did the tutorial and jumped into campaign right after it - I am really looking forward to playing some more of it in the next days.\nIt is really questionable to put a game again on sale (that is essentuially an update to the original game) that was released quite a while ago, but since I only had to pay another 6 euros to get it (after the 45 euros I already spent on it), it is a good game in my opinion.\nWhen you like games like this, definitively buy it, it is much fun in multiplayer, and the tutrial and the campaign teach you a lot about the game.\nThe ideas are still great, and they work out to a good game. Hopefully the next updates will remain updates, and not  "new" full releases with some new content.","January 26","true","2.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

You do not need to own Planetary Annhilation to purchase this.\n$40 for people that do not own the base game.\n$13.59 for people that do own the base game on steam.\n\n\nVery solid, fast paced, and intense real time strategy game. This RTS is demanding in brain and computer power, both needing more power as the game gets bigger.\n\nStrategy:\nRequires knowledge of the game to combat a moderately skilled player. Terrain affects troop movements, unit composition, and overall strategy.\n\nSystem Editor:\nCreate a system of your liking and play in it with your friends or randoms. These will not be used in 1v1 competitive, only official maps will be used for those. Add asteroids, metal planets, ocean planets, even create a custom planet!\n\n1v1 Competitive:\nChallenging and intense matches take place in the 1v1 competitive scene. You probably will lose your first games due to the experienced players in ladder. To get better, watch replays of advanced players. See how they play, I watched a few and started winning instantly. Many buildings/units are not used in 1v1 because many of them are for very long games with huge systems.\n\nCustom:\nThis is where the interplanetary battling takes place. Create huge systems and go to battle against your enemies systems away. Most of the units not used in 1v1 are used here. Most fun with huge battles with friends.\n\nThere are many units and strategies to use and infinite possibilities. Smash planets into your foes, teleport nukes into your enemy's base, there are many game finishers to choose from.\n\nTL;DR: Planetary Annhilation Titans is a fun, fast paced RTS that challenges new players and provides intense battles that span the solar system.

I wish orbits and such made a bigger difference because if two enemies cross paths in orbit from one planet to another, they dont attack each other. But other than that, the game is pretty fun.

Has a good amount and variety of units (all are more or less useful, no clear "losers"). Has a deep-ish learning curve. Maps are spheres! Has a flowing economy, meaning that the resources will never run out on the maps. Also the community has made some great maps if the ones in the game are getting a bit dull. Has singleplayer (a campaign wannabe and skirmish) and multiplayer.\n\nSo you might be wondering what changed in PA:Titans that is not in vanilla PA. For a slight increase in price compared to PA (which is not even sold anymore) you get the titan units, some normal units and a more balanced game. Also if you have PA:T but your friend(s) only have PA you can still play with them!\n\nI have to admit though that the game has some more or less annoying bugs. Pathing issues (becomes more and more common the more units there are on the map), joining lobbies and ranked games, joining games that you got disconnected from and a few others that i cant remember from the top of my head. But most of the bugs aren't really that common and there are easy workarounds.\n\nThe game runs pretty well on my not so good laptop (depends on what you consider "well"). But as always you should check the minimum requirements before you buy anything. The game is not graphics intensive but it takes  quite a bit of CPU (loading the systems for example). I haven't really experienced that many connection problems and it's more than likely that it's your own internets fault than the games fault. If you experience problems with the game you should go and find the games forums and ask for support/solutions there.\n\nPS. I believe that the reason why uber didn't make PA:T a DLC is because the reviews of PA were full of outdated complaints and some unnecessary hate.\n\nPPS. I know there are people who are actively hating the game and Uber. But please, do not hate a good game (if you think it's good) just because the company that made it is not so great.

It had a host of technical and gameplay issues that warranted it.\n\nPA: titans on the other hand is a whole different story.  Uber double downed on the quality for this expansion and it shows.  Well worth the price asked, and probably the only modern RTS now adays worth playing aside from SC2.  I've always been a gameplay person, and while PA certainly doesn't slouch when it comes to graphics, player interaction is where this game really shines.  Earns my strong recommendation\n\nGoods:\n- Plenty of new unique units and map terrain that add alot of new gameplay depth and unit interaction.\n- Complete balance pass which sees the tier 2 roster finally viable (~50% of all units)\n- Great ui polish and revamped sound/visual effects\n- Interactive tutorial\n- New bounty mode in FFA which better rewards players who take risks.\n- Sweet mega units\n- friendly community\n\nBad:\n- Teething problems with some bugs and other misc issues, but none that are common enough to really affect the average player.","August 25, 2015","true","746.2"," 20 of 48 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","20","48","0","0"

In particular, it makes combat in the Orbital layer feel much more vibrant and the expanded unit roster opens up new strategies and makes army composition matter that much more.\n\nThe expansion's namesake units, the Titans, are fantastically designed. When I play with friends on Teamspeak, there are shouts and screams whenever one of them hits the battlefield, either of panic or of triumph. I'm a particularly big fan of the situations the Ragnarok planet-destroying building cause, because those turn into a frantic last stand as one team struggles for survival.\n\nYou will have hours of fun with this game, and Uber Entertainment are a fantastic team that continue to punch well above their weight in the RTS market.

I didn't play the origional, I found this game a few days before it was release and then followed it and then eventually bought it.\n\nPROS:\n-I can play the game on the highest settings even if there is a lot of movement on screen.\n-I have never ever have the game crash.\n-Overall very creative.\n-All factory-type robots are balanced. Example:\n*Bots are quicker to make and are excellent infantry.\n*Vehicles do more damage and are harder to kill, but are slower to move and build.\n*Air has the best mobility, but probably the easiest to kill (in my experience).\n*Orbital has the least amout of choices for robots, but can only be targeted by certain defences and bots.\n*And Naval (My favorite), Extreme range, damage, health, targeting abilities (some of them can defeat orbital), and submarines, which also can only be targeted by certain defences and bots. Downside is that you need to have water, which can sometimes be abundant. I prefer to start of on planets with water because the naval units (along with an upgraded radar and a few Holkins) can defend you well.\n\nCONS\n-So far only bug fixes, no major updates.\n-Starting off is hard due to the lack of resources.\n-There is no tutorial, which kinda sucks.\n-The game is basically over the moment someone gets all 5 catalysts in a machine planet, although some guy I played with kept on nuking a catalyst the moment I was almost done with the last one about 3 times, but unfortunately, I was still able to finish it and destroy the rest of the planets.\n\nOverall, it's great, but get it on sale. Not worth 40 bucks unless they add some new content, because some of the players who had the original said that there was barely anything new added.","January 8","true","54.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

This is one of the most original and innovative rts's I've ever played. There's just so many approaches to warfare, especially on maps with multiple planets and moons.

That it attracts new players, builds a stronger foundation for the community, and shows that Uber really wants to get back into the good graces of their players? They gave a free copy to their 40,000+ kickstarter backers and offer it to everyone who owned the game and bought it at any other point for a very generous price. How entitled have we gotten as gamers? Have we forgotton that it takes money to MAKE games, that we wouldn't have products like this and amazing revivals as this one has been if there weren't HUMAN BEINGS  pouring their souls into it?\n\nWait until it goes on sale in a year if you must. Buy it at 5 dollars like you did PA. Don't make it your personal mission to be upset that you weren't given it for free. Or, you know what? Spend the 13 dollars. Most games would charge a LOT more for a "DLC" of this magnitude. It really is something new entirely. It isn't what you think you were promised with the Kickstarter. It's what Uber crafted, based on feedback and opinions of their community, and the passions of their designers to bring a great game to YOU. Let's focus on what we have for once, and not what we don't, alright?\n\nTo anyone else looking for a modern RTS with an amazing sense of scale, super fun and interesting units, OR WHO LIKE CRASHING PLANETS INTO THEIR ENEMIES, buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiderRockon/recommended/386070/","RiderRockon","Rider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RiderRockon/","31 products in account","Planetary Annihilation: TITANS is an expandalone to Uber Entertainment's previous title, the Kickstarter funded Planetary Annihilation.\n\nThe GameAssuming you haven't played the original PA before, let me lay down what this games are about. Planetary Annihilation is about managing an economy and building up a giant base with which you build an even giant-ER army. Where some games have your battles span miles, this game has your battles span multiple planets. Vehicles come in a number of variations, from 4 archetypes; you have access to ground vehicles, robot units, aircraft and ships. In addition to those there are also the orbital units, which have often highly specialized roles.\n\nWith these tools you go about conquering worlds, destroying your enemies (lamentations of their women optional) and, if you are so inclined, BLOWING UP THE VERY PLANETS THEY CALL HOME.\n\nThat's right, you can blow up planets in this game. With other planets even. Want to be spiteful and throw one of your enemy's planets into one that belongs to their allies'? This game allows you to do that.\n\nThe ExpansionNow you might be thinking that this all sounds pretty sweet, and you'd be right in thinking that. But what of this expansion? What does it do?\n\nIt turns everything up to 11.\n\nNot only does this expansion add a host of regular new units, including but not limited to a nanobot swarm and a younger brother to your already impressive commander unit, it also adds the titular TITANS. TITANS are basically super-units. Have you ever wanted to destroy your enemies by stepping on them with a giant robot? Now you can. Did all that talk about interplanetary units made you wish you could have giant space-battleships? This expansion has it. Giant teleportation deathstar satellite? Yes'm, all here.\n\nIt also comes with a bunch of smaller enhancements to the game that I won't bore you with here, look up the patch notes on those if you're so inclined.\n\nThe ConclusionThis all brings us to the question of the hour: is this game worth buying?\n\nNow you must understand that I was already quite fond of the original, having played it 69 hours (Ha! That's never changing now) so I came into this with that as the base to my experience. But it still surpassed my expectations and has wowed me with all the cool new stuff you can do now.\n\nThe best thing about this one though is that it added that one key thing that I always thought the original lacked.\n\nCharacter\n\nIf you've never played Planetary Annihilation, this game is unlike anything you've played before. If you have, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot. It's got everything good about the original with everything that even I didn't know I missed about it. This is the way to do an expansion. It's the Yuri's Revenge to Planetary Annihilation's Red Alert 2.\n\nIt's worth your money, and may even prove itself worthy of your admiration.","August 21, 2015","true","6.9"," 159 of 347 people (46%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","46","159","347","9","2"

So youre looking at this game and thinking if you should buy it.\n\nScroll to bottom for pros and cons if youre not up for the massive reading\n\nFirst off ill go ahead and mention that TITANS is an expantion on the original game: Planetary Annihilation, this expansion adds 5 Titan class units and a dozen or so other smaller units, the original game is probably one of the best RTS games currently for its price. If you dont know it allready, theres quite a few of bugs and smaller glitches currently on TITANS but they are working on fixing them with roughly monthly updates\n\nBefore i begin you should know the Titans\n\nThere are 5 Titans currently in the game (dont know if more are coming)\n\nThey consist of 3 land units, 1 orbital, and 1 air\n\nThe Titans are:         Ragnarok (after finishing the build it will make the planet it is built on go boom within a minute)\n\nAres (basically a moving fortress, near impossible to kill without air, has extreme range and can move across ocean)\n\nAtlas (The most commonly seen Titan, it can move through ocean and land and causes minor nukes whenever something stands in its way, not as tanky as the Ares but has more damage and is very vulnerable to kiting and air)\n\nZeus (the second most commonly seen Titan is probably this one, its an air unit, meaning it can fly over any terrain and cant be hit by regular tanks and such, it has a massive damage AOE attack with relatively short range, very vulnerable to airfighters or orbital)\n\nNow that you know the titans you should also know that they all have weaknesses, allthough most of the time one is built its gameover for the other player(s) unless they have one or more to counter it. This means that much of mid-lategame is just rushing a Titan. Other than that the Multiplayer is very stable for the most part and i have not experienced many issues other than a few bugs here and there. The original game is extremely well balanced, i havent yet settled for wether or not TITANS is balanced\n\nNow then, the singleplayer, or Galactic War as the game calls it is VERY fun compared to alot of other RTS games singleplayer modes. The AI is very well programmed for newbies, but can also be ramped up by alot to fit better players.\nAnyway, the general theme of Galactic war is that you have very limited options that expand as you conquer and annihilate, for example you will start with vehicle factories only, but when you conquer a solarsystem you get 3 random techs to choose one of, that tech will then unlock something for you, for example; Advanced Vehicle factories, and then you basically keep going, fighting bots untill you find their HQ and destroy him.\n\nThe learning curve isnt too steep, you can just learn the basics in Galactic War before you run into Multiplayer, that way you wont have teammates going full CAPSLOCK-heavybreathing-rage\n\nAnd as promised in the top of the review i will go ahead and give my ratings and Pro´s and Con´s\n\nGeneral ratings\n\nAI         9/10\n-Multiplayer         8-9/10\n-Singleplayer         9/10\n-General balance         9.5/10 (bomber spam can be very OP)\n-TITANS balance         8/10\n-Micromanagement         8/10\n-Visuals         10/10 (LOVE the graphics)\n-Sounds         7/10\n-Amount of bugs         2/10 (very few)\n-Pathfinding         7/10 (Titans can be a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)\n-Community         9/10 (almost allways willing to give advice or other sorts of help)\n-Planetary Annihilation         10/10 (YOU CAN EXPLODE PLANETS OMG!)\n\n\nPros\n\n-Graphics: LOVE THEM SO MUCH\n\n-Gameplay: Pretty god damn solid and replayable, does get repetetive after 3-4 games for me atleast\n\n-Community: For the most part very friendly, unless youre playing shared army and touch their fabbers or units.\n\n-Planetary Annihilation: SEROSLY YOU CAN BLOW UP ENTIRE PLANETS ITS AWESOME!!!\n\nCons\n\n-Does get a bit repetetive after a certain amount of games/time, but easy to spring back into after a while\n\n-Titans can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when trying to micromanage them\n\n-Bombers in massive amounts are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OP if you dont have Tier 2 anti-air\n\n-Long loadtime if you dont have an SSD or a great computer\n\n-Can get very laggy if games get dragged out\n\nAnd yes i know i didnt explain the basics and all, but if you want them they will be down here\n\nCommander dies = you lose\n\nFactories build units\n\nAir builds at mediocre speeds is fast and can travel anywhere but squishy,\n\nVehicles take a bit longer to build and are slow but strong,\n\nBots are easy to massproduce and rely on speed and numbers\n\nIf you see an Atlas heading for you and you lack an army of bombers, youre ♥♥♥♥ed","October 12, 2015","true","31.9"," 22 of 54 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","22","54","2","0"

And I bought it. And you know what? I don't regret it.\n\nYea I'm still a little ticked off that I had to pay extra for this, even though I feel like a lot of this should have been in the original game to begin with, but after the complete cluster @#$% that was the original, broken, unoptimized, glitchy, buggy, even long after it got released, you guys really seem to have gotten your act together with this new game.\n\nI'm still salty that it wasn't free for returning players, but someone made a good point: Having looked at your sales on steamspy, and comparing it to similar games, I can't believe you even bothered to keep patching the original when you already had everyone's money. Really puts into perspective whether or not you actually care about us. To give away Titans for free would not have been financially practical. I'm a developer too and I understand you don't do this for leisure. So I'll allow it.\n\nBut for new players? $40? It's a bargain.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis part is for old players coming to Titans. Skip this part if you never played the original.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew units.\n\nBig whoop, right? Well the units actually add a depth and complexity that was horribly lacking in the original. I was skeptical, but after my first online game where my base got SWARMED BY PROBABLY A THOUSAND BOMB-BOTS THROUGH A TELEPORTER, I think it's safe to say that one unit added a lot--and it's not the only new unit. Despite numbering in the thousands, these little buggers didn't feel overpowered. We already countered a wave of them once in this game, and this second wave nearly succeeded only because it was exploiting a major weakness on the planet I was on. I had no ground defenses or even aerial backup! Thirty more seconds and I was screwed. Luckily my team mate had finished the catalyst in the nick of time and just as my planet was being swarmed, my commander and air fabrication units franticly making defenses as a last ditch effort, we BLEW THEIR PLANET TO BITS and won. Was a great game.\n\nThe terrain.\n\nNo one is even talking about this but I feel like this is horribly overlooked. A few simple changes in terrain elevation makes the map SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING than the boring spheres in the original. Now you can fortify the high ground and build bases in valleys. All in all it's a lot more interesting.\n\nTHE GAME ACTUALLY RUNS NOW WITHOUT A SUPERCOMPUTER.\n\nNow I upgraded to a pretty beefy PC, but the original game was still chugging harder than a frat boy crashing an afterparty at the biggest college in the state. The game ran like absolute crap. Now it doesn't! Even with a REDICULOUS number of units in a 3v3 match, the game held up pretty consistently up until the end, when we got hit by the ungodly swarm of bomb bots skittering through a teleporter.\n\n\n\nJust for reference, here's my specs. And I was running in windowed mode, too!\n\nOperating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_gdr.150202-1526)\nSystem Manufacturer: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz (8 CPUs), ~4.0GHz\nMemory: 16384MB RAM\nAvailable OS Memory: 16268MB RAM\nPage File: 3577MB used, 28957MB available\nDirectX Version: DirectX 11\n\nNow keep in mind, I very much surpass the required specs. Thing is, the *original* game ran like crap on these specs, because it was horribly coded. Now it's less horribly coded. So the game runs. Previously, everyone complained about the game being slow. "Oh well your specs suck." Uh no they don't. Well the game runs now so that statement might be true if the game runs poorly for you. I'm not sure. I just know it works fine for me. Maybe Uber needs to up the required specs / recommended specs.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere's the part for new players!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you ever played Supreme Commander, you're likely to enjoy this.\n\nIf you like cartoony RTS games, stuff that's supposed to be gratuitous and explosive and not supposed to be following any real world 'realism' (Men of War, Company of Heroes, Wargame, etc), then you'll enjoy this. Games like Command and Conqure, Starcraft, you get the idea.\n\nAnd if you still don't know what I'm talking about, let me put it this way. You control a ton of iddy biddy robots and go murder a bunch of other iddy biddy robots and occasionally make really really big robots and best of all BLOW UP ENTIRE PLANETS OR SMASH OTHER PLANETS INTO PLANETS.\n\nThe trailer tells most of the story. It's an RTS but instead of a flat map you get globes to play with. The default controls are screwy in my opinion but I changed them so up goes north and down goes south and it's a lot easier to keep your bearings.\n\nWhat else? You get two tiers of units to play with. So either invest in stronger units that take more time and resources to build, or lots of spammy tier 1 units. You also get five vehicle classes. Air, sea, vehicles (land, so tanks and armored cars), bots (land, but better than vehicle in some situations due to versatility--I don't really know all the tricks yet), and of course SPACE units.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot. Titans. Basically, superweapons. Giant killer robots and flying units with special attacks. Some are stompy. Some are shooty. One of them is a big orbital teleporter that rains the unholy hell of your army down on hostile worlds from the safety of orbit. Oh, and there's also a gun that shoots units. No, I mean it SHOOTS UNITS. BUILDS ROBOTS AND LAUNCHES THEM ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM. Also nukes. Can't forget nukes. But nukes are boring!\n\nDid I mention you can smash planets into other planets?! Strap some rockets to a small enough moon or dwarf planet and you can smash it into other planets! If it's too small, it won't survive!\n\nAlso they have a Death Star. I mean Annihilaser. Whatever. It's a Death Star. Call it what you will, if you capture this planet and build the big catalyst things that make the lasers work, god help whoever it's pointed at, because this bad boy is a game ender. That being said however, your enemy will be trying to capture it too. Not all maps have this however if you don't like it.\n\nFurthermore I'm pretty sure you can configure your own maps, too. Set up the orbits and stuff. I've not messed with this very much. Seems neat.\n\nGalactic mode still sucks. Don't buy this game if you plan on playing it by yourself. You'll get bored. Get some friends and at least skirmish against the AI. Do you all suck at resource management? No worries, you can nerf enemy resource production or beef up your own to handicap or buff players as you see fit. Suck at multitasking? You can share armies.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo the game isn't completely awful as some folks act like it is--in fact, it's very good, and I'm actually enjoying it now. I think it was worth the upgrade. I'm still annoyed at Uber, but I think I'll actually forgive them if they keep updating this game as they have been. The game is fun. End of story. Is it worth upgrading? I'd say so. Admittedly, I was very skeptical at first.\n\nIf you're buying this game first time at full price? OH ABSOLUTELY is it worth $40!\n\nUber seems to have learned its lesson from the screw-up that was the original game. I'm actually impressed enough to write a very detailed review.","August 28, 2015","true","19.2"," 22 of 54 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","22","54","0","6"

I wouldn't recommend someone to get the game without it.  Why?\n\nThe AI is not very good.  The game takes a best of a machine to run well.  The single player is very bare and not very fun and not only because of the lack of AI.  I would see the AI turtle all their forces and never move, I would see them consistently try to build a teleporter on a planet in the same area every time with only one construction bot, even though it was covered by turrets.\n\nThe planets have had terrain heights added but it doesn't seem fully implemented.  Naval gameplay can be completely ignored as there are not many water planets.\n\nThe multiplayer is fun, but it is hard to find a game and get into a game.  Disconnects are common.\n\nAll this and I'd still recommend.  It is great fun to break onto an enemy held planet and establish a foothold.  The battles look pretty, especially if you add mods to make the battles look even better.  They even have a mod manager available that makes mods as easy to install/uninstall and update as it is with the Steam Workshop.  You can get a lot of time out of this game.","August 21, 2015","true","26.0"," 29 of 69 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","29","69","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDragoness/recommended/386070/","SexyDragoness","Nysetari Vera`liath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDragoness/","227 products in account","Lot of negativity going around in reviews and the forums that don't concern how good or bad the game is. Just a lot of venting it seems. So here are some facts about the price tag for all interested.\n\n* 40$ Will buy you Titans, which will run on its own without the original game, plus with the new DLC\n* It is 13$ or so if you already own PA, which given all the new units, maps and such is fair for new DLC these days.\n* They no longer sell PA. No real point the game with its DLC is the same price as PA was a few days ago, maybe even cheaper.\n\nHonestly I do not see where any of it equals a money grab but that is entirely up to each consumer to decide. As it is PA : Titans is a great entry level to play the game.\n\nNow on to the actual game. Is Planetary Annihilation: TITANS any good? That isn't a very easy question to answer as even for fans of Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation, such as myself, there are some very discernable differences in the gameplay as well as many similarities. It will all come down to if the nuances of this game strike your fancy or not. So lets discuss some of the big things fans of those games I mentioned will probably need to know about over all. This is for new PA players as well as those looking at the DLC items.\n\n* Galactic War - This feature pretty much forms the bulk of your singleplayer experience. In it you start with a couple systems and try to take over other systems battle by battle. You start off typically with a barebones of technology. That being the ability to make a basic unit fabricator such as vehicles as well as a few defenses and resource items. After each battle if victorious you can search the planet and chose a technology to boost you for future operations. You only have a limited number of slots so you have to chose wisely. Luckily you can forget some techs or unlock extra tech slots. You continue attacking system to system till you find each of the three enemy factions leader systems and defeat them.\n\n* Planets - The big deal of the game, IE "Planetary" Annihilation, are the planets. That being sphereical spatial bodies circulating a sun or other planets. These planets form the maps for which you will wage war. Your view of the battlefield might be a bit jarring given its very stark difference from the mostly top down views of the genre. You'll rotate around these planets regularly and depending on your settings, north might appear south or East might seem north. There are setting in which the game will lock the planets so that north is always north and so on. You can zoom in and out as needed. In the end this feature will probably be the biggest game maker or breaker for most fans.\n\n* Unit Roster - While fundamentally similar to TA or SupComm, the rosters of units and buildings are also different in a manner. Sure you still have the fighting quadrio, Land, Air, Water and Bots. Yes your buildings are still focused around Energy and Metal consumption and storage. That is where a lot of of the simularities end. The Roster this time around is more, 'Focused." That being smaller. The units, much like SupComm form tiers. You start off with tier one and work up to tier two. Unlike SupComm you only have two tiers. Though from my experience there seems to be less filler units and most of them have a very defined purpose. Planetary Annihilation's Units and particularly its buildings function a lot more for the planetary scale. You'll find lots of units meant for planet to planet travel, attack and defense, as well as utility.\n\n* Titans (DLC) - The games namesake. These are at their very essense what you'd expect in SupComm as, 'Experimentals." That being very large, powerful units that can wreck untold havoc if not checked. The ones I've gotten to use thus far are extremely powerful and almost seem game breaking, but that has only been in AI play. I imagine just like in SupComm preventing enemies from building them is a major part in the balancing, as well as map intel and preparations. One of them can even blow up a planet as a bomb.\n\n* New Units (DLC) - There are several new units in the game, most of them are combat units rather than buildings. You'll find that they fill in the gaps and offer a few new options. For instance the Bot Fabricators now offer Sub Commanders in the advanced version. They function similar to SupComm's SubComms in that they are functionally similar to the main commander, but won't lose you the game if they die. They are powerful and definitely worth persuing as they function as an advanced fabricator unit but also have strong combat ability. There are hover tanks that can cross water, transport planes and many other items. Though I couldn't tell you the exact count. What I will say is they all fit well into the theme and have their uses.\n\nThose are the major items of interest in how this game differs from PA Vanilla with its DLC but similar past games such as the popular Supreme Commander. If you are a fan of SupComm or Total Annihilation chances are one of the first two items will decide your enjoyment of the game. As for PA players, the worth of this expansion for you really depends on if you want the big powerful titan units, extra regular units as well as new maps and other features. From my personal experience I did feel like they filled in some gaps that I felt the game was missing. I only see them as a worthy edition and I didn't mind the 13$ pricepoint at all.\n\nLets talk pros and cons\n\nPROS;\n* The Game has some spectacular weapons and features. Blowing up planets or ramming them into each other are some of the most spectacular RTS finishers I've seen.\n* While a bit jarring the planet features can be fun and add a whole new dimension to the gameplay. Defending or attacking isn't just driving across a piece of land, you sometimes have to go into space and assault other planets.\n* (DLC) The Titan units, particularly the Big Bot and the Tank, whatever their names are (Sorry), are easily the stars of the show. Though the planet bomb can be rather spectacular in its own way.\n* (DLC) The new map items, such as terrains, are a welcome feature\n* (DLC) The new units flesh out strategies and offer new options.\n* The Galactic war can be fun and its nice to have a sense of progression from match to match.\n* You can design your own planet systems if you feel like you want to have certain planets and options available to you in Skirmish or Multiplayer.\n* There are different commanders to chose from. While all purely aesthetic, they are a nice option.\n* The game is very easy to step into for veteran SupComm or Total Annihilation players, featuring many of the same sort of controls and gameplay styles.\n\nCONS;\n* The AI is not particularly good even at its max difficulty. I highly suggest you run an AI mod if you're willing and AI battles are what you prefer.\n* The Galactic war, while a great concept, at its current state is really lackluster. None of the factions ever try to take back territory. (Or Even have the ability) Nor does it seem like taking planets has any effect on their tech options. At the base level theres little to no strategy involved other than selecting where to attack next.\n* Some of the commander designs actually cost money to unlock\n* (DLC) Doesn't seem the AI will ever build titan units to use against you. (I might be wrong but thats my experience)\n* The game can be downright taxing on a computer even with well above recommended stats at times. But this could be based on computer factors.\n* SupComm players will feel like theres something missing in the tech trees. That loss of a tier can make the game feel shallow at times.\n* (DLC) The titans have pathfinding issues and most vs AI Matches will end before you can really utilize them.\n\nHope this Review helps. Overall I liked the content even if there is work needed. I'd recommend trying it.","August 19, 2015","true","65.8"," 251 of 544 people (46%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","46","251","544","19","19"

There were few updates, the balance was static and simplistic, and the orbital layer (including the super weapons) felt like a gimmick.  I told the devs I wouldn't be coming back unless they fixed those problems.\n\nWell, I'm back.  They haven't fixed everything - but they did a damn good job trying.  Orbital now has a basic layer of depth to it - three units in different roles instead of one swarm unit.  Super weapons now have additional members:  the Titans.  For those of you from SupCom, these are experimentals, through and through.  Naval and land now interact in amazing and interesting ways with the addition of hover destroyers, hover tanks, and a nanite swarm that eats everything.  They've finally added a unit that counters the Ultimate Weapon (boom bots):  the lightning bot.\n\nUber did it right this time.  This should have been the release, absolutely.  But you cannot get salty at Uber - they released early due to financial issues and a previous contract.  This expansion will be to PA what SupCom: FA is to SupCom.\n\nI usually withold my judgement on such things, but this expansion has been in the works for months and months.\n\nI'd also like to take a moment to talk about the price.  For those of you who do not know, the Titans expansion is free for KS backers (due to the risk they took backing Uber), 66% off for previous owners (Veteran players), and $40 for everyone else.  This is, in my book, a sound business decision and a great one for the community.  It's a massive content patch, and it is worth every penny.\n\nCompare that to Elite Dangerous or Guild Wars 2 recent expansion announcements.  They're making their players pay almost full price for those expansions.  You can't tell me Uber is making a money grab when you've got devs like Frontier and ArenaNet running around.","August 18, 2015","true","75.9"," 258 of 559 people (46%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","46","258","559","14","4"

For those who weren't here or endured it, it's safe to say that the "original" planetary annihilation had loads of issues upon release (I'm referring to the proper release here, not the early access or any of the other test periods). I recall how my friends had trouble just adding each other to the buddy list(which was separate from Steam) and how it took us about twenty minutes just to get everyone into the same custom game. Once things got rolling, someone inevitably dropped out or crashed for seemingly random reasons. One of us could not alt-tabb from the game without killing it, destroying a planet didn't even register at times and many features seemed to be unpolished or even flat-out missing.\n\nIn short, it just wasn't ready. It looked and worked like a game during a mid-Beta stage, at best, and it would take another year before things got to a good point.\n\nThe developers however, to their credit, kept slowly grinding away on the fixes and improvements. I recall reading through some of the patchnotes thinking these changes would be the sort of thing you'd expect halway through Development, not half a year after release. Unit stats were flung across the board, some were removed entirely, some were added and others had their behaviour changed drastically.\n\nSo, now that we're here at long last, what is Planetary Annihilations: Titans?\nIn short, it's the sheer spectacle of commanding thousands (yes, thousands) of tiny units and sending them across several planets to obliterate your enemies. It's command & conquer on drugs. It's Defcon with visible cannon fodder. It's a multi-tasking hell where you're required to command air, sea and land units while simultaneously sending nukes, spaceships and all manner of misery in your opponent's direction. In a word, it's EPIC.\n\nBut all of this comes with the bitter after taste and the constant reminder that this is what I paid for and was expecting to have about a year ago. I funded this project when it entered BETA (wasn't able to pay for kickstarter) and people are rightfully annoyed by this business maneuver to "re-sell" the old idea for a higher price.\n\n\nFinal word:\nThe game itself is awesome and I cannot give it a thumbs down without being unfair. Play it, especially with friends and enjoy the havoc.\n\nHowever, it must be mentioned that the project seems to have been estimated and/or managed poorly. The business of releasing unfished products and then "rebranding" them for profit really needs to stop. My trust in Kickstarter projects is dwindling by the day and it seems more and more like this sort of mess is the norm rather than an exception.","August 19, 2015","true","39.1"," 157 of 343 people (46%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","46","157","343","12","0"

The titans literally stomp on anything in their way, and you would need alot of firepower to stop them. There are also a good variety of them, and all of them are unique. For example: The orbital Titan, Helios, can link with a teleporter, fly to another planet, and teleport other units while attacking at the same time. There is even a system creator where you can make your own solar systems.\n\nThe BadUnfortunatly, some things have been done slightly wrong. Solar systems seem very empty, only supporting up to 4 planets stably. It can go up to 16, but thats only if your cpu can handle it, and you need a VERY heafty cpu to do that. My cpu so far seems to only support about 8 max. This would be okay if other players spawned more spread out, but on the randomly generated maps there is only 1 starting planet for each system. This is EXTREMELY frusterating because players can spawn really close to you since the planets cannot really support more than 4 people, and having the max amount of players in a game (10) spawn on the same planet can be way too hectic for the size of 1 planet. I once spawned in and I had another commander spawn right next to me. The default maps are a little better in terms of starting planets, but playing the same map over and over again can get repetitive really fast.\n\nYou would think the system designer would fix this issue, but it really doesn't. On my PC, it crashes a lot when all the planets generate, making it really difficult to actually make a system.\n\nI also didn't like the lack of options in the game. Compared to Supreme Commander, there are very little options and difficulty levels for AI Skirmish. There is way too little customization for AI Skirmishes\n\nTL;DR, Final Verdict\nPros\nFun gameplay\nSolar System Designer\nTitans are cool\nCons\nSolar systems feel vacant\nRandomly generated systems need more starting planets\nSolar System Designer bugs\nNot enough AI difficulty levels and options for skirmish\n8/10 Very good\n\nThere is definitley fun to be had with this game, even with its flaws. Just try to get some of your friends to hop on and then the real fun begins. Definitely not worth its full price, pick it up if its on sale like I did. If you want a more in depth RTS, go pick up Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.","January 1","true","29.5"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","1"

There are some slowdowns one in a while. like when i got 600 solar planes orbiting a planet.\ni dont mind it. because i got 600 solar planes orbiting my planet.\n\nThere are a decent number of settings to choose from in the menu. which is important in pc games.\n\nGameplay:\nThere are titan units. But i like the other new units more.\nThere is a hoverboat, drone aircraft carrier. a huge space ship that can attack the ground as well as orbit. and some others. like a proxy commander. its a second commander. (you still lose if you lose your first one).\nI enjoy building huge armies. as the doesn't seem to be a build limit.\nthe feature i like the most is the share army option. the game isnt over when you lose 1 commander. only when you lose all your teams commanders. this way. you and your friends can keep playing together. and you can better manage your army because you got 3 times the attention.\n\nTitans are not game winners. they are tough, but all have weaknesses. altough the orbital titan  "Helios" seems very tough, and is able to act as a teleporter.\n\nalso important. there are a lot of ways to destroy a planet. so if you dont pay attention. your planet might just explode. killing you instantly. in most cases, you should have nuked something. and lets end with that","August 25, 2015","true","16.0"," 14 of 37 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","14","37","2","0"

Even if / though it could have been handled differently by Uber AND by the community, my attitude is this: if you like the game, support the developers. Pretty simple.\n\nIf the only reason you 'don't like the game' is because you have to pay more for it, then you should seriously stop brutalising the devs for it, keep your public whiney mouth shut and just don't buy the damn game.\nAt the end of the day they aren't stealing your money, they are developing a game!\n\nYou feel cheated?

I do recommend the game. Vanilla didn't feel like a true continuation from SC like TA->SC was. But many of the problems have been addressed and this feels like a final game once again.\n\nHowever do keep in mind with the haters... Uber as a company fell flat on their faces in public relations. I have my own opinions on that and normally I won't include this in a game review but given most of the reviews on this game is fueled by the years of hate Uber did little to address and more to fan the fire... well yea. Just needed to be addressed.\n\nThe game taken on it's own merit? I like it. It's what I wanted from a TA/SC game. If you read cons like "little unit diversity" and "No real small scale tatical decisions" and go "Well what? you though this was Starcraft or something??" then this is the game for you.\n\nBe warned, the single player is worthless and a wasted oppourtunity. Maybe do the tutorial to freshen up and see what they added, it's fairly quick, but don't expect ANYTHING more from the AI that you would expect from an empty punching bag. Which is really sad. There's such a good chance to do some real story telling and there is none to speak of.

I do agree it is a bit silly that people who had the original have to now buy this to keep up but I wouldn't call it fair to judge the actual game based off that. As for all the complaints about the AI being too dificult I think this is just new player's frusturated with a very steep learning curve. The AI is actually very bad and does a lot of silly things, very easy to defeat with some experience. I also experienced frustration when first playing over a year ago in the difficulty of beating the AI on the lowest setting. It takes a lot to adjust to this game from more traditional RTS games. As for the game being buggy I have experienced some frustration with the game lagging and crashing. However the issues have been vastly improved since I began playing and appear to continue to improve. I run this game one a machine I built in 2009 with very few issues so I am a little surprised about so many people claiming that the game constantly crashes on their brand new $2500 PC. Most new players also don't realize that most of the game processing actually occurs on Uber's servers and not on the client's side. Doing certain things in game such as setting too many land units on too large of a patrol can cause too many pathing calculations for the game to deal with, avoiding certain (all very unnecessary) actions can prevent the game from lagging and freezing. Though I'll be the first to admit the game isn't perfect and does have a few programming issues there are a lot of great things that make this game stand out and in my opinion very much worth playing. Below I'll list some pros and cons;\nPros\n- Three dimensional map allows for completely new strategy forcing players to change their strategies and defend from all sides.\n- Single faction allows for highly competitive gameplay where both players always start on an equal field with no faction based advantage to impede upon the competitiveness of the game.\n- No unit cap, build as much crap as you like, huge battles.\n- Large unit variety allowing for virtually limitless combinations of strategies.\n- Need for large build areas and lots of resources impedes players ability to 'turtle' and forces constantly agressive gameplay.\n- Kill the commander objective forces players to re-think strategy from previous RTS experiences, keeping players constantly on their toes as a commander snipe can always be just beyond the fog of war.\n- Orbital layer of gameplay adds again another level to strategy forcing players to defend their bases even from the space above them. Additionally with multi planet maps players can find numerous ways from massive teleporter invasions and nukes to planet smashes with asteroids and even using the annihilaser to lay siege upon their foes.\n- Land, sea, air, and space layers of combat.\n- 1v1 ranked matches allows players to quickly connect with another player of a similar skill level for a match on a mirrored planet allowing players to rise up the ranks on an always level playing field.\n- Teleporters allow for moving massive number of units across map instantaneously adding yet another level of depth to strategy.\n- Live economy forces players to be mindful of how much they are building and how much resources they have available or risk losing radar coverage and experiencing a proportional reduction of production capabilities.\n- Mobbing through enemy bases with tons of units destroying everything around is tons of fun.\n- Developers constantly improving/refining game, very actively.\n- Can switch game mode to vanilla in settings allowing you to still play with friends who do not have the expansion online without having 2 copies of the game installed. Vanilla may also be a good place for new players to learn due to there being less units to manage and learn.\nCons\n- Game sometimes buggy; pathing issues at times with complex terrain and large numbers of units, build units refusing to build in places they should be able (sometimes this is from previously queued structures), and very rarely the game freezing out player commands or disconnecting the player altogether but this happens to me very seldom, less than once in ten matches.\n- VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE; this game is not easy to pick up, the variety and scale, along with the live economy, make managing everying very difficult for new players. I would recommend new players watch a few replays on the leaderboards to see what the best players do to win.\n- No 'Easy' AI setting. AI on lowest setting very difficult for new players to beat due to previously mentioned learning curve. My recommendation to new players on this is to lower the resource rate for the AI to .5 or lower then slowly turn it up .1 at a time every time until you are able to beat the AI, then when you are comfortable playing at 1.0 rate then turn the AI up to hard. When you can confidently defeat the AI on 'hard' difficulty you are ready for multiplayer.\n- Singleplayer mode 'Galactic War' sucks. Don't bother playing it. This is a multiplayer game, the only reason to play singleplayer is for practice and for that I recommend skirmish battles against the AI.\n- Internet connection required for gameplay due to way game runs. However as I previously stated this game is only actually fun on multiplayer so this shouldn't really matter.\n- Lack of community support and game information due to small player base. The most complete wiki of the game, pamatches.com is no longer kept up and all information is now very obsolete forcing players to look in game for information on unit meta. Hopefully this will change soon with the introduction of a new player base from the Titan Wars expansion.\n- Had to pay $13 for the expansion. However I purchased the original during a steam summer sale for only $23 so I wasn't too upset.\nIn all I find it kind of disappointing that so many people have given this game a negative review after only playing for a few hours just because they can't beat the AI on the lowest setting. It took me at least 15 hours of practice before I was even able to beat the AI on normal mode. As for all those who have experienced so many gameplay issues I'm not sure what to say as I have so few on such an old machine. My only recommendation is to make sure your drivers are up to date and that you have at least 6GB of RAM. If you are looking for a simple RTS that is easy to pick up and learn with a fun singleplayer experience, and are not feeling up to a frusturating learning curve then this game isn't for you. But if you do want a very complex, fast paced, and balanced game with top notch meta look no further. This game is very strategy oriented and though shares some elements of gameplay with games like Supreme Commander the game overall is completely unique and a breath of fresh air in the long stale world of RTS games.\nAs for all the complaints about the Titans expansion being a standalone, I think most people are making a far bigger deal about it than it really is. From a business perspective and as a player I commend Uber for going the route they took. Since this was released I've noticed a huge boom in current players in the community. The PA subreddit is far more active and wait times between online matches has been almost non existent waiting at most a minute where before it was who knows when you would get a match. I think this move  was necessary for the game to continue being worked on. The vanilla game has a very poor steam user rating, which can be crippling to game sales, mainly due to the game falling short of promises made during the games early acess phase. Though Uber did finish the game late and still in patchy condition I do defend them on the grounds that over the last year they have been very consistent with updating, improving, and refining the game with regular updates. My only quarrel is making those who purchased the vanilla version on Steam early access...

I have a GTX 980 TWO OF them I7 Qaud core and 32 Gbs of ram game is on a solidstate and it gets super buggy! POP CAP OR SOMETHING!\n\nThis game is fun, I believe it shine most with a friend by far! I just don't know how to feel about this type of bussiness practice. Especially after the "Human Resources" fiasco. This game needs some major Patch work still, MORE CONTENT MORE UNITS 21 + new things has helped majorely, its a lot more closer to Supreme Commander but there is no Factional variety therefore making a gap despite the plethera of units alread. IT NEEDS MORE UNITS (just wanna stress the hell out of that)\n\nThe game is still capable of being destructively adorable and damn it, I love it but its becoming bitter sweet.

Sure uber might have over hyped their original product, but beneath all that hype is a solid game that has drawn in a lot of people that still enjoy it, and this new content is amazing, adding a new level of epic to the battles, and strategies.\n\nWhat are all these so called "game breaking bugs" people seem to be complaining about. 10 hours in and I'm yet to encounter anything. All the hate just ends up feeling like a bunch of people who largely have themselves to blame for putting this game on a ridiculously high pedestal, that was only ever going to end in disappointment. This is coming from someone who was not apart of the kickstarter, and just came in to find a solid, unique, and awesome RTS.","August 21, 2015","true","19.3"," 49 of 112 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","49","112","4","1"

PA Titans has a timed 66% discount for those that had PA before Titans release, and considering PA Classic is built into Titans this gets us a dlc/expansion with price tag everywhere from 10 to 14$\n\nDiscount is timed due to STEAM and their weird discount system, imagine a 35% sale going on with everyone that had PA before and their 66% discount added in, what does this give? 101% discount, contrary to popular opinion this would make it unable to buy game at all, which doesnt matter because discount is timed for 2 months and HYPE is everywhere, it would take special kind of people to miss it\n\nAs for why it was released with its own store page, Classic PA taken down, and new players can only buy titans? its a rather radical move to minimalise community split as much as possible, its also here to delete all previous steam reviews and refresh opinion of the game (thats why its not addon nor upgrade) reason for that? ridiculous ammount of negative reviews that bash game for not having things like save and load, never ever updated to accomodate new patches, things like that spread misinformation like forest fire in australia after dry season and give game a bad name thats completely undeserved (im not even going to mention reviews that bash game for being on sphere, what the hell is this, flat earth society? how is that even an argument?!)\n\nIts also evident how much titans add to the game, 5 titans, 3 air units, 3 naval units, 3 new vechicles, 3 bots, 3 oribitals and 1 building (theres also that drone that carriers spit out, which is controllable and hence new unit) do the math, how much does that give?! 21 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ units, all of those masterfully crafted and have their own roles and counters, to all those that its the same pa it was before, WRONG, game plays completely different and all classic strategies got thrown to the trash!\n\nConsidering its actualy ~12$ dlc it ads way more than "big" industries tend to give, and dont give me starcraft as example, pa doesnt have factions, which is actualy a good thing, and uber never had money to get those in game anyway\n\nPeople also tend to say that classic pa got abandoned and you need to buy titans to get bug fixes, i dont know if those people are inherent trolls or simply stupid but prehaps you missed a 1 GB WORTH OF UPDATE to classic PA, which contains new ui, remade alerts, massive ammount of polish and bug fixes, dozens of voice alerts and some units were remade in their behaviour, which means the only thing titans got that classic doesnt have is 21 units and multi level terrain, and im not sure of the latter\n\nSimilarly all future content patches are going to be distributed both to titans and classic, which may or may not mean that even when they add new units to the game classic will also get them, only sure exceptions are new titan units that can get to the game via patches (game lacks naval titan, supreme commander tempest anyone?)\n\nThing that angered people most obviously was giving titans for free to kickstarter backers, while i understand the sentiment, early access buyers were no less important, especialy that were was nearly 500k (contrast 45k number of backers) of them or even more, dont let those fools that say "its your fault that you got 90$ alpha, nobody told you to do so and you could wait" get to your head, you were just as, if not more, important in shaping that game\n\nBut finances trump sentiments, because universe is a ♥♥♥♥♥ harsh and uncaring place, and so giving everyone that got alpha for 90$ expansion for free would completely break uber finances, loss would be unnaceptable, not to mention giving it for free for those that got beta (extending it to gamma buyers would be complete and irreversible suicide)\n\nMost reasonable would be giving expansion for free to cosmic edition backers (250$) but even that is debatable, personaly i would not give expansion for free for anyone but 1000$+ backers and raise discount to 70% (75% also could be a suicide, tot small ammount of money)\n\nThank you or not, spaceships, hovercraft, titans and multi level gameplay were never promised at all, not even in kickstarter\n\nYou may ask why uber ever needs money, why they bothered in releasing this expansion in the first place? surely they are shameless cashgrabs and im a fanboy you might say, well gues what, DEVS NEED TO EAT TOO, multiple times they admited that money is running short, what would be better, releasing titans or abandoning a PA year later or risk bankruptcy? if the latter is your answer then save yourself trouble and dont even bother replying, because thats just disgusting\n\nAnd for those that have issues like crashes or things, go to uberforums and post your issue in support section, you would be suprised how helpfull they are\n\nFinal note to that weird cult of haters and other chaos heretics around that game, creating private accounts to buy PA, write a review, spend half a hour in game to create illusion you did something, and then refund it? thats lower than low, Shame on you","August 21, 2015","true","70.3"," 189 of 412 people (46%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","46","189","412","23","5"

Judging is a personal thing, so here are my impressions:\n\nWe all hailed supreme commander. So very different units, so many commander upgrades. With expansions, some things became quite imbalanced if you rushed them. Scale and performance had always been an issue (I had no 1000 $ for a top notch gaming machine). Planetary Annihilation has all those units, but makes them available for all. Now it is up to you to crush your enemy with titans, flood him with mechs, bomb him to the ground, nuke him to death, crush him under the tires and chains of yourt tanks or eradicate the planet he dwells on (preferably you have a transport or "warpgate" if you also happen to dwell on that planet) with an asteroid, a moon, or a planet-killer gun.\n\nIt also has:\nstrategic flexibility\na factor of randomness (galactic war)\nbalance: if the enemy has warships, you have a simple defense gun that mows the orbit free\n\nBecause I am a beta backer, I have no idea how many skins are for free, but they are mostly cosmetic. The available basic commanders have the same armament for free.\n\nThen comes planetary annihilation. I was one of the beta buyers/testers. There were good days, there were sad days. There were bugs. Unfinished units. Planetary travel problems (you had no idea how to do it)... and so on.\n\nConsidering bugs (and with the AI):\nThey fixed them, made it a funny yet sometimes hard game when the AI came killing you wit a super army. (Only one time an enemy subcommander marched directly onto my warships. The idea was good - they had no underwater defense. Problem - massive firepower and single target enemy. So not a real bug but you might think it was one.)\n\nPlanetary Annihilation: Titans has not disappointed me. Get it for the special offer price, it is totally worth it. If you like the genre and loved supreme commander - get it as well.\n\n\nSome thoughts:\nPlanetary scale - no other game has it.\nWarp in reinforcements? Why not fly them from another planet. Or deliver them via planet (not recommended)\nNuclear missile - meh. Why not crush the enemy with an asteroid? Or two? We still have those tough\n2d maps, her you get a whole solar system.\nAs of yet, I have to discover any AI unfairness.\nConcerning dlc, i have seen no such thing, just got some free commander skins. Or models.\nScouts are useful. Radar is useful. If you use them, it is very easy to find your enemy. On larger planets tough, it takes some time to find the opposition - because the radar has limited range.\n\nAlso, I have yet to play on a world that was covered to more than 40% with water.\n\nAs I play the game, i will update the review.\n\n(UPDATE 1)\nGreat game. Really funny moments, where i died in the campaign, yes, you can call it that, because I pressed the planetary ignition button. Stupid tough, because my escape ship was shot down and the teleport was on the target planet.\n\nCompared to many other games, the "galactic war" is a campaign. I call it that, read the information on each planet and enemy commander, and decide for yourself.\n\n(UPDATE 2)\nPlayed some intergalactic Maps with aquatic planets. Works awesomely smooth. Water land transition is neatless and all working just fine. Teleporters are really useful and fun - even on a single planet when you want to install a beachhead infront of your enemies base because a mountan blocks his artillery. Orbital teleport titans are also really fantastic - invasion on a new level. You should shield the more valuable assault titan with "replaceable" interstallar ships tough - 3 basic space defense buildings wreck your priceless armada in a second.\nAlso, for the first time, used the planetkiller (metal planet with 5 catalyst units) on a moving planetary object. Really and imply epic. YOu even can deploy or move units off that rock or out of its orbit in mere seconds before the impact.","November 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","0"

I understand what Uber did with this release considering user reviews, but to be honest I personally don't care. For me, yea, the original PA had it's share of problems like CTD when you destroyed some planet if you did not have the latest graphics drivers (derp on my side), lags in very large battles, etc. I still remember early builds of PA when your land units sometimes became orbital units or fell to the middle of the planet.\n\nThe point is, these problems are gone, they have been fixed. What I mean, Uber is still working on the game - every now and then I see PA getting updated with new patch. I am an older gamer and I have seen many games come and go, some good, some bad or unfinished... I am not saying that this game is perfect, but at least for me personally it is enjoyable enough. There is no other game where I can destroy enemy by destroying the very planet he is standing on. When I replay the original Kickstarter video for PA, I now have what I have backed.\n\nI have noticed some reviews where guys were complaining that they cant defeat AI, that it is too hard, etc. I regularly smash AI on normal difficulty, if they really do lose, then they are doing something wrong. Yes it is aggresive, but afaik, it does not cheat and it is beatable.\n\nOn the matter of bad reviews. I personally don't care what Uber did or did not as long as they deliver in the end. One of the reasons I am writing this is that I think that much of the backslash this game has gained is now obsolete and I think that game reviews should focus on the quality of the game itself, not the company that makes it as long as the game is not abandoned project. Every reasonable gamer hates Electronic Ars for example, but they sometimes make a good game too ;-)\n\nLastly, I can't comment on matter of balance, since I don't play multiplayer matches too much. Check other reviews if you are into that kind of thing. If you want to try to crash some planets together or blow them up, this is a game for you. If you are unsure whether or not to buy it, wait for some discount and grab it later - it is not a bad game, it just has some rough edges.","August 21, 2015","true","24.0"," 34 of 80 people (43%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","43","34","80","5","0"

I can completely understand why a lot of people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at uber. If you bought the game in early access for $90 and then found that in order to get all of the game's content you'd have to spend another $14 you would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ right?\nOnly except TITANS was never promised, all of the content in this "stand-alone expansion" were never promised anywhere, and in fact the devs themselves said that "experimentals" were not gonna happen.\nTo add on, Uber needed money to continue supporting the game, so would you rather they abandon PA all together?\n\nOk, I really just had to get that out of the way. I am fine with people hating the game but not if they're spreading lies everywhere.\n\nSo, is PA:T worth the money? Depends. Did you like Supcom? Yes? Then you might like PA. PA and Supcom are similar in some ways, but they are two different games.\nDo you like story campaigns? Well sorry, PA doesn't have one. If you're looking for that go somewhere else.\nBut the singleplayer experience is still nice. There is galactic war, and the AI can pose a challenge for newer players in skirmish mode. But don't expect anything flashy in singleplayer.\nDo you like multiplayer? Yes? Excellent, because PA is an excellent multiplayer RTS game. There is competitive ranked 1v1 multiplayer and also custom matches. You can play with your friends easily, I play with my friend against the AI in 2v2 shared armies matches.\nDo you like blowing up stuff? Yes? (I mean, who doesn't?) Then PA:T will provide a nice experience when you smash planets together, blow up more planets with a death-star like annihilaser and go kamikaze when you drill a hole into a planet and then dropping a giant bomb down, obliterating an entire planet.\nPA is relatively fast-paced when it comes to gameplay, so you'll always stay on your toes.\nPA unfortuantely doesn't have any factions, everyone uses the same units. That may sound bad, but it's really not (as bad). You can make your own playstyle with the units and buildings you have.\nPA also has mod support. There is a wide range of mods for you to use. There is a mod manager that allows easy installation of mods. The mods you can get vary from content-adding mods, UI mods and mods that just make things look more pretty/awesome.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading this review. PA is a good game, but it is not for everyone, so be careful and make sure it is the game for you.","October 17, 2015","true","44.8"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","0"

When I replay the original Kickstarter video for PA, I now have what I have backed.\n\nI have noticed some reviews where guys were complaining that they cant defeat AI, that it is too hard, etc. I regularly smash AI on normal difficulty, if they really do lose, then they are doing something wrong. Yes it is aggresive, but afaik, it does not cheat and it is beatable.\n\nOn the matter of bad reviews. I personally don't care what Uber did or did not as long as they deliver in the end. One of the reasons I am writing this is that I think that much of the backslash this game has gained is now obsolete and I think that game reviews should focus on the quality of the game itself, not the company that makes it as long as the game is not abandoned project. Every reasonable gamer hates Electronic Ars for example, but they sometimes make a good game too ;-)\n\nLastly, I can't comment on matter of balance, since I don't play multiplayer matches too much. Check other reviews if you are into that kind of thing. If you want to try to crash some planets together or blow them up, this is a game for you. If you are unsure whether or not to buy it, wait for some discount and grab it later - it is not a bad game, it just has some rough edges.","August 21, 2015","true","24.0"," 34 of 80 people (43%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","43","34","80","5","0"

Judging is a personal thing, so here are my impressions:\n\nWe all hailed supreme commander. So very different units, so many commander upgrades. With expansions, some things became quite imbalanced if you rushed them. Scale and performance had always been an issue (I had no 1000 $ for a top notch gaming machine). Planetary Annihilation has all those units, but makes them available for all. Now it is up to you to crush your enemy with titans, flood him with mechs, bomb him to the ground, nuke him to death, crush him under the tires and chains of yourt tanks or eradicate the planet he dwells on (preferably you have a transport or "warpgate" if you also happen to dwell on that planet) with an asteroid, a moon, or a planet-killer gun.\n\nIt also has:\nstrategic flexibility\na factor of randomness (galactic war)\nbalance: if the enemy has warships, you have a simple defense gun that mows the orbit free\n\nBecause I am a beta backer, I have no idea how many skins are for free, but they are mostly cosmetic. The available basic commanders have the same armament for free.\n\nThen comes planetary annihilation. I was one of the beta buyers/testers. There were good days, there were sad days. There were bugs. Unfinished units. Planetary travel problems (you had no idea how to do it)... and so on.\n\nConsidering bugs (and with the AI):\nThey fixed them, made it a funny yet sometimes hard game when the AI came killing you wit a super army. (Only one time an enemy subcommander marched directly onto my warships. The idea was good - they had no underwater defense. Problem - massive firepower and single target enemy. So not a real bug but you might think it was one.)\n\nPlanetary Annihilation: Titans has not disappointed me. Get it for the special offer price, it is totally worth it. If you like the genre and loved supreme commander - get it as well.\n\n\nSome thoughts:\nPlanetary scale - no other game has it.\nWarp in reinforcements? Why not fly them from another planet. Or deliver them via planet (not recommended)\nNuclear missile - meh. Why not crush the enemy with an asteroid? Or two? We still have those tough\n2d maps, her you get a whole solar system.\nAs of yet, I have to discover any AI unfairness.\nConcerning dlc, i have seen no such thing, just got some free commander skins. Or models.\nScouts are useful. Radar is useful. If you use them, it is very easy to find your enemy. On larger planets tough, it takes some time to find the opposition - because the radar has limited range.\n\nAlso, I have yet to play on a world that was covered to more than 40% with water.\n\nAs I play the game, i will update the review.\n\n(UPDATE 1)\nGreat game. Really funny moments, where i died in the campaign, yes, you can call it that, because I pressed the planetary ignition button. Stupid tough, because my escape ship was shot down and the teleport was on the target planet.\n\nCompared to many other games, the "galactic war" is a campaign. I call it that, read the information on each planet and enemy commander, and decide for yourself.\n\n(UPDATE 2)\nPlayed some intergalactic Maps with aquatic planets. Works awesomely smooth. Water land transition is neatless and all working just fine. Teleporters are really useful and fun - even on a single planet when you want to install a beachhead infront of your enemies base because a mountan blocks his artillery. Orbital teleport titans are also really fantastic - invasion on a new level. You should shield the more valuable assault titan with "replaceable" interstallar ships tough - 3 basic space defense buildings wreck your priceless armada in a second.\nAlso, for the first time, used the planetkiller (metal planet with 5 catalyst units) on a moving planetary object. Really and imply epic. YOu even can deploy or move units off that rock or out of its orbit in mere seconds before the impact.","November 8, 2015","true","16.7"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","0"

When it was released, i thought that it wasn't quite ready to be released because it was still somewhat buggy and i believe it had left out what some people had thought they were promised.  Uber then proceeded to release updates that made it marginally less buggy.  I personally didn't play it much even after the updates between school and having a computer that ran the game at about 15 frames per second.\n\nThen this came out.\n\nThis is what the game should have been at Release.  It's so much more fun and hectic with the titans (especially the ragnarok).  It's also not nearly as buggy as it was when i stopped playing (although i do have a better computer now also).\n\nNow i get the complaints about the whole having to repurchase it thing.  Totally get it.  This definitely should have been a normal, free update for the base game instead of a fully different game.  it is nice that they gave us a discount, but i think it should have been free, especially for the early access purchasers (yes i know it was free for the Kickstarter backers).\n\nGiven that, it is a very good game now and i definitely reccomend it.","August 23, 2015","true","20.0"," 13 of 35 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","13","35","0","0"

Now we can't just all say it's "buggy" and "oh I don't want to support the developers" and "oh my the kickstarter funders didn't get the expansion". Well first off, the expansion is about 10 bucks US, (I'm in Canada) , Second off, you shouldn't even bother to mention kickstarter, because this is steam! ,  and 3rd off, you shouldn't be talking about the Developers or Kickstarter because I barely even seen one negative comment about gameplay mechanics. So quit your whining. And most of your reviews are out-dated.\n\nOnto the game\nThis is a very good game, if you are going to buy this, keep intent that this is not something to jump into. You have to either have some skill with Supreme Commander, Total Annihilation, ETC. This brings a lot of new RTS mechanics that aren't in games like CoH (Which I love) Now that doesn't mean that games like CoH is bad because they don't have these mechanics. This game is very different from ALOT of the other RTS games. Uber is constantly developing this. If you want some smooth running, you need atleast an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz which is what I use and for a graphics card atleast a GeForce GT 720 because even I have some difficulty at certain times.\n\nOverall\n\n9/10 PumpyPumpertons Magazine\n\nDon't back down from buying this. It's worth it. I bought it reading all these bad reviews and was quite satisfied with it. I have had some very fun moments with my friends on here. It has many cool features. Don't get discouraged. I'm one of those guys who doesn't play stuff like Fallout 4 on end, and it's mainly because I buy many games like this, which give me an even greater enjoyment.

The game comfortably supports massive armies, battling across a half-dozen worlds, all in a single session.\n\nMultiplayer games are hosted on dedicated servers, which was a great choice. In our games, there were something like ten thousand units between each of our armies plus our AI opponents, all supported with a minimum of latency. The only lag you’ll likely experience is graphical. One of my friends had issues with framerate, but turning down the settings seemed to solve the problem.\n\nYou can read other reviews for a list of features. My personal favorites, however are:\n\n+ Multi-planet combat. I enjoyed figuring out ways to transport my army/navy from one planet to another.\n+ Balance between orbital, air, and ground/naval combat. Make sure you have an army that can deal with each of them.\n+ Lots of fun ways to deal with an entrenched opponent: Nuclear interplanetary missiles, crashing an asteroid into them, activating a freaking DEATH STAR\n+ Titan units: In a game that for the most part emphasizes macro, Titans are super fun to micro. The army-teleporting Helios is my personal favorite\n\nNot everything is rosy. We did have a few problems:\n\n- The multiplayer game arrangement interface isn’t great. We sometimes had problems all connecting to the game, and experienced strange, cryptic error messages. Once we were actually IN the game, we had no problems however.\n- There’s no automated matchmaking for anything other than 1v1s. I’d love to see a team game and/or FFA matchmaking.\n\nAll in all, though, this is a fantastic game. If you’re at all a fan of strategy, I highly recommend it.\n","August 25, 2015","true","31.7"," 20 of 50 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","20","50","2","0"

Originally thumbs downed.  After troubleshooting, I found the issue with running PA:Titans on Windows 10 was caused by Crossfire.  You can find the details of this issue on Ubers forums:\n\nhttps://forums.uberent.com/threads/bug-report-constant-crashing-cause-found-workaround-found-up-to-uber-coherent-amd-to-fix.70307/#post-1110105\n\nAnd now for the review (completely subjective and separate from any opinions I have of Uber as a developer):\n\nNow that I have actually played Titans, I can finally talk about the game itself.  I have to say, I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  The gameplay is better.  The UI is better.  The new units are good and create a lot of new tactical possibilities that simply don’t exist in vanilla PA.  A couple units are pretty much throwaways, but others you will find to be integral and regular fielders.  Such as the Tesla bot.  As a tier one bot unit, it's cheap, has high health, great damage and is relatively fast.  Making it an excellent early game spam rush unit.  The new naval units drastically improve naval combat.  The new orbital units are a very welcome inclusion. The new titans themselves, are well implemented.  They’re powerful, but not overpowered.  They’re both game changers and not game changers.  They can sometimes seem like they are a little too easy to build too early.  But they can be countered.  However, as much as I’ve grown to love it, the Ragnarok Doomsday Titan is a little too easy to build.\n\nSeriously, this is probably the most devastating unit in the game.  But has created one of the funniest scenarios I’ve ever experienced in a game.  I was playing AI Skirmish against 3 AI’s in a huge solar system.  Two of the AI’s were on the planet with me pounding me from both sides.  I’m losing the battle on the starting planet.  I’m cutting my losses and going to bail out.  But by this point, they’ve taken orbital superiority of the planet and I’m not getting off the planet by launching into orbit.  Thankfully, early on in the match I had sent a couple orbital fabricators to the metal planet to build a stargate on it.  So I have a couple fabricators building a stargate on the starting planet and any others I can spare building a Ragnarok Titan.  The stargate on the metal planet finally finishes.  I activate the link and send my commander through with a few units and fabricators for defense while I rebuild.  Just as this is happening the Ragnarok finally finishes.  My going away present for the 2 victors is about to be unwrapped.  At this point I realize that I’m now wearing rather sadistic grin on my face.  I close the gate behind me and 60 seconds later, the planet pops.  Eliminating both of the AI commanders that were kicking the crap out of me in one shot.  Needless to say I was lmao for a few minutes.  Then focused on fighting the last AI.\n\nI had repeated games where I was finding that I would win, but I would often win by a different method each time.  Sometimes, by covertly building a stargate in an unoccupied spot on a planet, bring in fabricators, build a Ragnarok and leave before they ever knew I was even there.  Some times by smashing moons or asteroids into planets.  Sometimes with the annihilaser on the metal planet.  Sometimes with traditional warfare.  I never felt forced down any one path.  And it was devilishly fun every time.\n\nSimply put, this game is outstanding. This is the definitive version of Planetary Annihilation. Do I recommend this game.  Absolutely!\n\n-------\n\nHere are some notes and context on the current situation between Uber and its community and how the situation is affecting Titans:\n\nThis so called expansion is damn expensive considering what it offers. It should've been marketed as DLC and not a full standalone game/expansion.  Although I can understand why they did it.  The original PA caught a lot of flak and it showed in the reviews.  But it caught that flak, not due to the quality of the game (which admittedly still needed a lot of work), but because of the way Uber treated its community.  Such as Uber attempting to start up another kickstarter without actually finishing PA.  And then in an attempt to call a technical, they claimed PA as fully launched, but released it without key promised features, such as offline mode, requiring an always online connection in order to play the game.  If that wasn’t bad enough, they would flat out refuse to answer the community when they were questioned about these issues.  And on top of that, the people who were talking to the community were often aggressive, offensive and overtly rude.  As a result, a lot of the original PA store page reviews showed the bad blood between the community and Uber and reflected how the community felt about this treatment by Uber.  The thing is, Uber did eventually come around.  They finally released offline mode for PA, replaced the people responsible for interacting with and working with the community (and for the better might I say.  A huge improvement) and continued adding and updating content to PA.  Uber has for quite a while now been mending fences and turning their act around.  The problem, is that the reviews on the PA store page were never updated by the original writers to reflect this and painted a picture of the game that was no longer representative of the games current state.  So, as I said, while I don’t agree with the way they’ve marketed this standalone expansion, I do understand why they took the approach they did.\n\nFast forward to today and Uber again have put themselves at odds with the community.  Look, I understand that they as a developer need to make money.  We get that.  Everyone gets that.  But Uber need to understand that they are where they are because of the community.  Because when they asked for help, the community rose up and backed them.  Then during early access (EA), new members kept them going by buying the game in EA.  But they didn’t simply support the game for the cost of a game for released retail prices.  They paid well over the value of the game to get EA with Uber charging more during EA than any other developer I’ve ever seen.  There’s no bones about it.  The prices Uber was charging were downright extortionate.  So you can imagine how people would feel when Titans is released, Kickstarter backers get it free, but EA backers are charged for it.  They should’ve given it for free to their Alpha and Beta EA buyers as well.  Their Alpha EA buyers at the very least.  Given what Alpha purchasers paid during EA, it’s insulting for them to be told that they need to pay for the Titans upgrade.  It’s wrong and this is not how you should treat your community.  The alpha buyers gave you a lot and they kept you going through EA.  They deserve to be treated a hell of a lot better than that.  They need to be treated with the respect they deserve.  It’s as simple as that.\n\nTo put it quite blunt, you’re shooting yourself in the foot Uber.  It’s a contradiction to release Titans as a standalone expansion in order for it to get up-to-date reviews that are representative of the games current state and then pull what is quite frankly, a d**k move.  You wanted a clean slate and then immediately pulled the same kind of stunt and recreated the exact same scenario that resulted in the state of the reviews on the original PA store page.  The very thing you are trying to distance yourselves from now.  The reviews on the store page are not made by professional reviewers who are required to stay on point and maintain a professional level of objectivity.  They are made by the community and the community is an emotional beast.  Treat them right, and your store page will glow from the love.  Treat them poorly and your store page will show the communities wrath.  You shot yourselves in the foot.  But you still have time to mend the situation.","September 14, 2015","true","44.1"," 76 of 170 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","76","170","2","40"

RTS games\n- long term game (you need to play it a lot)\n+ long term game (you are able to play it a lot!)\n- game is almost dead\n\n\nConclusion: Well made game that is still fun to play, has much content, uncountless strategies and deserves more attention, sadly many people are still mad for reasons that don't change the actual game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople expect too much, and are easily offended by various strategies of companies. It is a bad thing, that the game has to be bought twice, but it had the price of a dlc for owners of the original game (13$ something).\nAlso the game is balanced, there are too many reviews about the balance of the game, while the player played only a few hours.The game is big. Incredibly big!\nUnlike other RTS Games like Starcraft you won't find the perfect build orders. The game offers you way too many possibilities to play, to find a perfect strategy. And this is one of the reasons why this game is so good, and i recommend it. The game offers much more content than any total annihilation or supreme commander did, with a few exceptions: the skilltree and the fractions.\nI liked the skills in SC2 but that they are missing is not too bad, as you can build improved factories, that more or less replace the skilltree.\nThen there are no fractions. And even the different commanders are only different in thier look and behave all the same. This also sounds bad, but on the other hand you have now all buildings and units available at once. You don't need to fear that your opponent has walking ships and you mostly low-range units. Well actually this sounds pretty balanced to me, as you can adjust your strategy while playing. In SC2 you were quite f*cked when you realized mid-game that you would have needed another skilltree and mid-game turns end-game suddenly.\nThe more possibilities in building, adjustment, units, defense system, orbital units, planets & asteroids etc. make it quite difficult to play und understand the game as a beginner. And also, the tutorial sucks. You need to take the time to discover the game by yourself.\nThat's a reason why many people dislike the game and give bad reviews. Their complaints are mostly about "buying the game twice",  "this should has been the game in the first place", "It's not balanced" (from users that played <3hrs), "Paid update" etc. Those reviews have nothing to do with the game itself and should be avoided, while still some arguments are true. Like the bad ai, when it comes to movement. Sometimes the units get stuck and need to recalculate the route because they didn't walk around obstacles. But thats bugs that mostly won't bother you when playing. I've never seen someone losing because 2 of 50 walking units got stuck and arrived a bit later.\n\nThe only real problem with the game is not in the game itself. And that problem is a really sad one:\nThe Game is dead. Almost.\nLog in any time you want, you won't find more than 5 active online games and the queue for ranked games is most likely empty for a while.\nAnd even most of the active multiplayer parties are using PA, and not PA: Titans which makes owning Titans useless in most public parties.\n\nI love the game and you should give it a try, maybe when it's a sale.\n\nImprovement in my opinion:\nThe game should have the turn-based singleplayer mode (galactic war) available for online parties. Including real and ai players, that try to expand and gain improvements from wins. It could be more like the singleplayer from rome, or other total war games, the possibility is there\n","October 20, 2015","true","52.8"," 138 of 303 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","138","303","6","7"

This is also going to be short and to the point.\n\nThe original PA had its problems. It had performaces issues, a lack of variety, and not enough content to engage for that long. It was engaging though, and for the time it held my attention, I enjoyed it a lot. Titans, as DLC, adds a lot of things that I wanted into the game. New terrains features make the planets feel more alive, rather than just flat circles with the occasional ocean. There can be ridges and mountains now, which adds a new layer to base building, Before, you could practically anywhere, but now you have to think where you are going to place yourself based on terrain features. This was a small addition, but the biggest thing was the new units. All of the units have their place, and I have found myself using some of the new units very frequently. All methods of combat have been improved, but what has been improved the most is Orbital combat. There are plenty of new Oribital units that make space battles a lot more interesting than before (as there was just one real attacking unit that could be in Orbit, which were those little fighters). Now you can have much larger battle cruisers that can also shoot beams down to the planet below. The new units have added a lot to the game. Sadly, I have not had a chance to try out using a "Titan" (I have been playing Galactic Conquest and have not unlocked the technology) but I have had them used against me. They certainly do live up to their namesake. They are collasal, and can quickly dispatch and entire army if you don't have proper defenes set up. Overall, this was definitly worth 13 dollars, and in my opinion, was not a cash grab. This is far more reasonably priced than a lot of other DLC.\n\nMy score for PA: Titans is a 8/10\nIf you can get over the performance issues, then this is a solid RTS that can be very engaging.","August 20, 2015","true","13.5"," 47 of 108 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","47","108","3","0"

PA itself was kind of a race to who has the most nukes / antinukes now with the addition of units like the ragnarok which can destroy a planet within a few minutes ground battle and fast response time with armies got a lot more important.\nI think the 13€ are worth it for people who had fun in PA and I guess the full game is worth it when it's down a few % during a sale or so.","August 23, 2015","true","27.7"," 40 of 93 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","40","93","2","0"

Not even on harder settings. Playing against Normal AI is pointless, and also against Hard AI. it takes like 4 minutes to deal with Hard AI by just building an advanced factory and make a queue of some bots or tanks that walk into the enemy base. No resistance whatsoever.\n\nNice and simple graphics, and you just can't wait for that beautiful mushroom cloud to appear over your enemy commander.  Some of the bots make some very cute sounds, and it hurts a little when you send them to their death :(\n\nI would love to see more variations of units, instead of all commanders having the same loadout, perhaps.\n\nCONS: Unfortunately the game is extremely buggy at this point, with lots of graphical problems. I have to restart the game at least every 45 minutes or so. Either graphics bug out, or I end up with no bots visible at all. I have a multi monitor setup, and it keeps forcing new windows to open up BEHIND all other previously opened program windows. I guess this is how lazy code monkeys solve the always-on-top feature of their game.\n\nThe planets are too small in Galaxy War, and there are too few of them and not with enough variations.  You literally end up spawning next to your enemy, and you can just walk over and kill the enemy with your own commander as soon as you get any kind of health or weapons boost. It's pretty stupid to be honest. The planets always have the same spawn points, so you quickly learn where the enemy has spawned too. And for some weird reason, the AI will ALWAYS spawn on your own planet - even in multi-planet systems. Stupid.\n\nI'm not sure why they added the Titans to be honest. At least when playing Galaxy War, you don't even have to bother with the Titan technology unlock. You never need it. It simply takes too long time to build the Titans, and the game is over long before you even would consider building it.","August 22, 2015","true","42.6"," 26 of 63 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","26","63","3","0"

Don't get fooled by the reviews about how weird marketing model Uber is using, PA kickstarter bakers get the game for free, PA owners get it cheap (15$, DLC-like), and new players get it at PA price (39$ i believe).\n\nThe game overall is way better and fun than the original PA, the new multilevel terrain is amazing, terrain is not anymore the place your units stand on, it's the place your strategy releases on. You will have trouble attacking a well built base, even if you have unit superiority.\n\nThe offensive TITANs are amazing, they can change the match, but don't think of them as 'instant game winner', they will get easily killed if you don't have a good army behind them.\n\nThere are also strategic TITANs, for example the 'Elios', which can link to a teleporter, and drop a devastating attack to any place in any planet.\n\nThere are also some new units. They are awesome, ranging from amphibious vehicles, to a swarm of nanobots that destroys anything it touches!\n\nSome new buildings are avaible too, for example, a 'dox' (light attack bot) launcher, the 'lob', to quickly surprise the enemy.\n\nI completely recommend the game to any previous PA user, and to any user interested in RTS games.","September 10, 2015","true","33.5"," 26 of 63 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","26","63","0","0"

I bought the bundle to try out Xenonauts, but was pleasantly surprised at Planetary Annihilation. Then I noticed that my version wasn't on the steam store, only the newer Titans standalone was there. I was very hesitant because all of the top reviews were mostly negative and many people in the discussions seemed very hostile, though I understand their anger they backed a game an now they have to pay extra for the newer version. Despite this I bought this game and I am glad I did. There are many issues with the game, like long loading times, the game seems to hang when loading menus, sometimes the game doesn't save, and there is the occasional crash. However, I love this game overall, please note that I only play with bots I don't know how performance is online. I love the units added in this expansion the Omega orbital unit being my favorite, an it is satisfying to shell an enemy base with artillery fire from the Holkins artillery defense. No other game that I can recall lets me destroy other planets to rid of annoying enemy. The only thing that I really hope for is some sort of auto save, because as with most games I tend to lose track of time and if the game does crash I often lose all or most of my progress in the battle.","November 3, 2015","true","42.4"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","12","33","0","1"

TITANS adds so many new ways to bring about chaotic destruction on your enemies; combined with the newer features such as asteroids, game saving, resume from replay, its far ahead in features of the admittably poorly timed release of Planetary Annihilation (sans TITANS). While there may be some optimization gains yet to be had, the game plays reliably enough to be fun much more than it is frustrating. Lobbying is no longer a waiting game, and for those who prefer to go it alone, the AI gets more devilish with each passing month, and the  dedicated single player mode has received some much needed revamps. I personally am a huge fan of the map editor - this tool alone gives Planetary Annihilation, and TITANS by extension, so much variation and replayability to be worth the asking price alone. The map editor is quite powerful and can create some truly striking maps. The fact that the engine plays along with your monstrous creations without a fuss really shows just what a great job Uber Entertainment has done. Not to mention that mods are all but officially supported, and you have hundreds of hours of entertainment for even tentative RTS fans. The developers are fairly involved; not only can you often post on the forums and get a reply, but they also hang around in the in-game (modded-in) chat (look for PA Stats) and answer questions. As someone who played a lot of Command and Conquer, especially Red Alert, back in my day, I have to say that I really enjoy this take on the RTS genre; and as someone who rarely played online in my Command and Conquer days, I have to say that online mode is a lot more accessible for newbies and hardcore players alike.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game, it is absolutely better than before. Definitely worth it if you don't own the original Planetary Annihilation, and I personally still think worth it even if you own PA. If you're feeling cheap... well there will probably be sales, given how often the first iteration of PA went on sale.\n\nFYI, I have over 400 hours with the first Planetary Annhilation, in case you are scared off by the much smaller TITANS game time.","August 31, 2015","true","89.6"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","12","33","0","1"

Pretty cool and fun. However, I share the disapointments among the community.\n\nThe company itself is pretty shady. They released this game in a manner considered unfinished by the majority of the backers and supporters. Also no one likes to compare but the fact of the matter is that this game will always be compared to similar games like Supreme Commander Forged Alliance and although a new and cool idea, fails to bring the scale and depth of what Supreme Commander Forged Alliance has to offer.\n\nThe problem is that you can clearly see where the devs cut corners and took shortcuts to rush this out instead of giving you something better. A very simple and clear example is the fact that there is only one faction while its predecessors have 4 factions. Major short-cut number 1 if you ask me. No bubble shields... No experimentals until now in Titans... You would think that with there being only one faction that there would be a lot of unique units within this faction but no... They skimped on that as well. Everywhere you look, they cut corners to rush this out. They gave less than the minimum expected to the supporters of this game.\n\nThis stand alone expansion "Titans" is really closer to what the game everyone expected to be released... But instead they sold these adittional units, balance, sounds etc..as an expansion which in my opinion was wrong.\n\nAll in all I still recommend the game because it is fun to play skirmish in coop against the ai. It does deliver a unique experience. But really these developers were really shady holy crap.","November 5, 2015","true","39.2"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","5","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/recommended/386070/","Reliant39","Reliant39","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reliant39/","701 products in account","Note: this is a positive review of a game that is reviled by people who feel that the developers  betrayed them. As a result, a high percentage of people don't think this review is helpful. Go and check out the "most helpful" reviews for this game: they're all negative. So if you hate Uber Entertainment or have some other axe to grind, please ignore this review and keep scrolling. I'm sure you can find another positive review to take your anger and frustrations out on.\nPlanetary Annihilation: TITANS is a standalone expansion to the original Planetary Annihilation (which is now no longer available for purchase). If you backed the Kickstarter, it's a free upgrade. If you bought the original Planetary Annihilation, like I did, it's a cheap upgrade (with a 66% discount), making it more like a DLC. I feel the added content was worth the price that I paid, and the game overall has been significantly improved from the original game. It just feels like there's more meat on the bones.\n\nI love RTS games, but would never claim to be particularly good at them. I therefore usually don't play them online and Planetary Annihilation is no different in this regard. For singleplayer, the game offers a Galactic War (a map of a galaxy where you jump from star system to star system and try to conquer them all) in addition to regular skirmish battles. I've had lots of fun going through the tutorial and playing Galactic War.\n\nThe game takes obvious cues from Total Annihilation and the Supreme Commander games. The factions are basically all the same: everyone gets to play with the same toys, which some people bemoan, but I think it's perfectly fine. The units are varieties of vehicles (mainly tanks), bots (fulfilling a role similar to infantry in other games), air units, naval units, and "orbital" (space) units. There are more than a hundred units, divided into two tiers. The expandalone adds "Titans": gigantic units that essentially function like the Experimentals did in Supreme Commander. As in the latter game, you start every game with your powerful commander unit (which you pick at the start of the game). If you destroy your opponent's commander, you win the game.\n\nPlanetary Annihilation has you fighting on planets, so the battle maps are spherical. The expandalone adds much-needed height to terrain, so you can get choke points on ramps (similar to Starcraft). It helps makes the terrain more interesting, both visually as well as tactically. Some people complain about the fact that the maps are spherical and therefore offer no edges to hide (you can't put your back against the wall, so to speak): I personally like this feature, and it makes scouting essential. The game favours an aggressive approach, but you can build impressive defences if you prefer to turtle. The game also offers plenty of tools to keep you from getting surprised: issue "area commands" to have your units scout and patrol the planet, and bookmark camera positions if you want to quickly switch from one point to another.\n\nThings can get pretty hectic when there are more than two planets in a system, but I would recommend you play those in team games, so that you can each keep and eye on one to three planets each. Personally, I feel like the sweetspot is about one to three (maybe four) planets for every two players (not counting moons). If you play a skirmish on a single map you're essentially fighting a classical RTS battle (except without edges). Camera controls are fine and it's a smooth game to manoeuvre. There are buttons to quickly switch from one celestial body to another.\n\nThe ANNIHILATION part of the game comes to the fore when you add engines to moons and other small(ish) celestial bodies and use those basically like guided missiles to ram another planet, utterly destroying it and whatever was on its surface. It's always exhilirating to see a planet explode and that alone should be of sufficient interest to have you at least look at some YouTube videos of the game in action!\n\nGraphically, the game is appealing, with a stylized, almost cartoony look to everything. The terrain is a little blocky, reminding me a bit of Endless Legend; it almost looks cute. The visual look is very clean overall and I didn't have any problems telling units apart. If you zoom out a bit, the game overlays the units with icons, which further helps making everything intelligible. The backstory is perfect in its simplicity: AIs awake to find that their creators have long since gone extinct, but they nevertheless decide to continue following their original orders by building robots to annihilate the enemy. It's almost satirical.\n\nIf there are any criticisms, I'd say that the naval units are perhaps the least useful. You really need a planet with a lot of water to feel the urge to construct any water units (and the fact that some land units hover across water doesn't help in that regard!). Flying units are generally a good alternative to naval units, especially since the enemy will need to build anti-air defences. Still, getting a big fleet out looks impressive, and I enjoy the fact that the commander can walk along the bottom of the seas to construct metal extractors and the like. The amount of units in the game can also be a little overwhelming, and often you start to rely on only a small subset of all the units available. Another minor point is that it's difficult to get the Titans out: by the time you can start building a Titan, the game tends to be over.\n\nIn short, though, I'd say this is a great RTS, and well worth the purchase, especially if you've never played Planetary Annihilation before. The visuals are great, the game plays very smoothly, and it's not hard to pick up and play, even though learning the finer points of the structures and units will, of course, take some time.","August 23, 2015","true","11.3"," 94 of 209 people (45%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","45","94","209","7","0"

Apparently if anyone else does that is is completely acceptable, but not Uber, no way. They shouldn't expect any more for their work, nope, not at all!\n\nPA:Titans expands on, what despite other people might say, an already solid game. Planetary Annihilation throws you into a universe in turmoil, torn apart by great machines of war, reawakening to bring about destruction once again. The game has one faction, the robots, all these units are the epitome of perfection. Each unit has been honed through years of war, why use anything other than the best? This allows for balanced gameplay without worrying about which faction is the "best". Unlike most RTS games you fight on a spherical planet, this can be challenging for new players at first, especially those who are new to RTS games in general. With this brings a host of new choices and challenges in regards to taking and holding a position. You might think that front line wall is secure, but watch your back, or for a sneak attack from bots emerging from the ocean floor! Taking it a step further is the fact that you get the chance to fight across more than one of these planets ranging from Earth like to, moons, volcanic, desert, ice, and ocean planets! You can even fight over orbital control of a gas giant! Then there is the almighty game ending metal planets which if brought online can blow up other planets with their giant lasers.\n\nPA is a fast paced game. If you have extra resources, build more factories, if you have extra factories, secure more metal. You can never have enough of anything. More is better. More is always better!\n\nTitans adds on new multi-tiered terrain features which allows for more interesting planets, which can be custom made in their planetary system editor. It also brings with it an expanded unit roster, adding 1 or more units to every factory in the game.\n\nThen there are the Titans themselves and boy oh boy are they TITANIC! They are so large factories can't even build them, you must construct them with your fabricators as if they themselves were a structure, except that compared to a titan the buildings in this game are mere ants. There is a bot, vehicle, air, space, and planet titan each bring with them their own benefits and uses, but none of them are invincible. The bot titan is a giant mech that smashes the enemies to nothing, literally. The vehicle titan is a large armored hover tank mounted with large cannons that pack a punch and fire from a distance. The air titan rains down balls of electricy dealing splash damage the enemies below. The space titan can be linked to ground teleporters and beam units to the surface from orbit, this is a great new addition for breaking planetary defenses which stop games from dragging on into stalemates. Finally the planet titan is a structure that upon completetion begins a countdown to destroy the planet it was built on! Make sure your commander is safe and sound off planet should you choose to build this guy!\n\nThis game was new and risky. It required an engine builts specifically for it. They choose to do this game via Kickstarter to escape the deadlines and expectation set by a publisher and the trade off was giving fans access to an incomplete game built on new and experimental technoloy. Making a game is not easy, it takes time, and dedication. Uber has proven that they listen to the community (just hop on over to their forums!). Even after the release of this game they released countless bug fixes and patches. Even with the release of Titans PA:Vanilla gets the performance and balance patches, they haven't abandoned it. In the end Uber has done the best they can with what they've got and IMHO they have been doing a great job, despite the roudy crowd who feels like each individual is the publisher for Uber and thus deserves a bit more.\n\n","August 23, 2015","true","5.0"," 32 of 76 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","32","76","2","0"

It is truly a fast paced game that can slow down just enough for you to realize that your planet's moon refuses to be a slave anymore, and I'm confident in the expansion's ability to further cement that description.\n\nThe Helios titan gets a special shout-out for completely changing the way you invade a planet, and the game is better for it.\n\nThe new units like the hover tank, the hover ship, the solar drone and the heavy bomber fill niches I didn't realize existed, and they manage to set themselves distinct in use from anything in the vanilla PA roster while blending in perfectly. There's no art style disparity to speak of, and even the Titans look very true to the game.\n\nStalemates can still happen but there are even more ways to break them. Establishing a foothold and then destroying the target planet is now directly possible via the Ragnarok titan, adding another method of destroying an enemy base.\n\nI fully encourage any RTS player to purchase this game, and especially those who may have had similar thoughts regarding the original as I did, as the improvement will be noticable for the latter right away. The new players will find this game to be refreshing if they are already accustomed to the RTS genre, but they should be aware that feeling overwhelmed, especially at the later stages of the game is very normal for the average player and it will never go away. The game is macromanagement oriented, and I believe wraps up what you're signing up for.\n\nGo for it!","August 19, 2015","true","51.3"," 25 of 61 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","25","61","2","0"

So I am giving my opinion on the game rather than the devs. Beacuse the game so far has been lots of fun I recommend it.\n\nPROS:\n\nexcluding any opinions about the devs and evaluating the game by itself I think its awesome.\n-titans add a whole new spectrum of gameplay\n-new units leads to diffrent strategy.\n-fun to play with freinds\n-defently worth 13 dollars\n-Some units counter others making it balanced\n-I have come accrossed minor bugs, no game breaking ones.\n-issues like multiplar severs being down were fixed within a couple of days\n-community so far hasen't been toxic\n\nCONS:\n\n-tough on begginners\n-save system is weird for glactic battles\n-community has been complaining of bugs\n-no true story\n\nOTHER:\n\nHere are the facts\n\n-people are complaining that the devs are greedy\n-if you kickstarted it I believe you get the expantion for free\n-titan's and PA players can still play togthere, Titan players cant use titan units though\n-Devs will realese patches to PA and Titans, content will further be developed on Titans\n-from what I have read they made this a standalone DLC beacuse a) they wanted more money, weither they needed it is up to dispute. b) review on PA were outdated which detered potential buyers, so they reset the reviews to get everyones current opinion c) having titans to be a dlc in there eyes would hinder overall multiplayer, selling the game with the dlc alows for everyone to use it\n\nHere are my opinions\n\n-I can see were people are coming from about the devs are being greedy, I cant give an opionin beacuse I have owned the game for 2 weeks\n-Game by itself is awesome. definitaly worth the 13$ dollars i payed. Notice that I am not a kickstater or an early acceser. If you own the old PA i cant give you a recommandation on wethere the dlc is worth the money, all i know is that with the dlc its a fun game\n","October 21, 2015","true","207.0"," 25 of 61 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","25","61","2","0"

Bought the original PA in early access and played like 150 hours. This is the same with a dash extra and it's still great. Not sure what all the butt-hurts are crying about. This is total annihilation + super mario galaxy. a great fresh take on what is normally the boring also-ran genre of RTS. This would be a great game to offer a demo of so you can decide for yourself, but those days are long gone...","October 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 25 of 61 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","25","61","0","0"

TITANS adds a large amount of new units, a few buildings and some other fairly interesting mechanics that spices up the game quite a bit.\n\nThe price is a bit high but is definitly a good expansion that should be considered to buy.

This is a standalone expansion, likely to get away from the reviews that were made years ago in early access that haven't been updated.\n\nThe game has come along way, and is a good RTS in it's own right. The Titans expansion (Which is only 13 dollars for people who already own the game, cheaper than most expansions are these days) does add quite a bit, as well as optimization and bug fixes for the game. I've found no bugs in the game, despite some reviews calling the game "a buggy mess" only after having a half hour in the game.\n\nThe game is fun, and I've found little to no bugs. There's quite a number of units to build, and I'm not sure of another game that allows you to kill the enemy by throwing their planet into the sun.","August 21, 2015","true","6.9"," 18 of 46 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","18","46","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wf/recommended/386070/","wf","Warmfuzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wf/","164 products in account","I love this game. They've polished it up a lot since the original PA release. Galactic War is now fairly entertaining and playable. The UI enhancements are many and appreciated. The TITANS are pretty hilarious, like the rest of the game-ending super weapons (death star-like planet destroying laser, crashing planets into other planets, nuke spam).\n\nI like this a lot better than SC II and similar games for a couple reasons. I like the 'flow-based' economy more than the harvesting economy present in the majority of RTS these days. I also like the focus on large scale in terms of unit and structure count. Build queues can be set absurdly deep, or you can just set a mix and put unit-producing factories on endless repeat.\n\nThe result is really huge engagements and lots of flexibility.\n\nThere is a great co-op mode (this was present in the original PA), where you share resources and units against the opposing team. It helps if you have unequal skill levels--you can have the less skilled players micromanage battles or invasions or economic expansion and they'll still have fun.\n\nI consider this an improvement over PA. I believe there is a discount available if you own the original PA. If you are a Kickstarter backer I believe you get it for free!\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","7.0"," 18 of 46 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","18","46","2","0"

It is one of the only that I enjoy playing. The art style is fantastic, but unit models don't have any variety between "factions". It would score higher if there was difference styles of units. i.e: supreme commander. Speaking of that game, if you are a fan of that you'll like this game.\n\nPros:\n-The game runs great I can run hundreds or thousands of units on my okay rig with playable and acceptable frames.\n-Art Style. (More of an opinion.)\n-Types of Units.\n-Gameplay is smooth and solid.\n-Difficulty is varried.\n-Little to no bugs.\n-The KICK ♥♥♥ SOUNDTRACK ! ! ! OMG SO GOOD.\n(Im just going to skip to the cons.)\n\nCons:\n-Lack of unit art style variety\n-Galactic Conquest could be better.\n-More fanfare in expolsions. Like Just Cause 3, that game is like an 80s action movie. :D\n\nApparently some people from kickstarter got screwed over, sooo that kinda sucks, but my review won't be affected by that.","October 2, 2015","true","9.1"," 18 of 46 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","18","46","0","0"

I'm glad that Uber finally took the time to do all this extra work that they had never promised anyone they would do. The community has been talking about things like this for a looong time, and Uber has gone pretty above and beyond in listening. The only area I think needs more love at the moment is orbital, though it has definetly improved. I'm glad they took a hint from the popularity of my Orbital Warfare Overhaul mod (shameless plug). I'm massively enjoying the new units, balance and gamplay this expansion provides.

At first when I played I felt overwhelmed but there are alot of hotkeys and with experience the game is very easy. I mean its an RTS where I can actually eat and play. Its not like starcraft 2 fast paced but not slow like civ 5. I give this game 4 out of 5 stars. I would give it 5 out of 5 once they hammer out the minor server problems. I play this game on a duo core E8400 with a nvidia gtx 750. Not the best specs but definitely can play on medium settings with good fps. For all the haters of this game. Play the game for at least 20 hours before you give a bad review. Everybody has the same units so it is balanced. And let me tell you there are tons of ways to annihilate your enemy.
