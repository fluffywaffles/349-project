But that's a drop in the bucket, I'm sad to say...\n\nA number of the puzzles are broken, and at times I either had to wait until the 'skip' bar filled up (took about two minutes) or reboot the game if the puzzle becomes unresponsive.\n\nThere was a puzzle in the subway where I had to line up the circuit lines in the power core and it just disappeared altogether. Secondly, I was trying to organize a set of colored USB sticks to get a security passcode - saved my game and exited for a break, and came back to see that the puzzle not only restarted but it was also stuck in the intro phase of the puzzle and I couldn't even get the sticks to light up and get the code - I had to reboot again to get past it. Also, the fuse puzzle on the safe was frustrating because I had to use a combination of four symbols without them touching - in the same columns or diagonally - and it's near impossible to solve. It's incredibly frustrating to experience.\n\nThe puzzles and HOG scenes are the meat of the game, and since they're pretty much broken the game is rendered pointless and frustrating - you'd really have to go out of your way to get it working.\n\nAlso, the story itself is another issue I have.\n\nIt's rushed, and there was a lot of potential to have it go in another direction but I guess the devs were strapped.\nAnd there were some interesting additional characters (like a sooth-saying homeless man and a detective with a mysterious past); they only appear once in the story and it's such a waste to cast their roles aside.\n\nThe homeless man acted like he knew about the secrets of the pendulum Lily and Madison had, and it seemed as if he could've been part of a secret society, but he's never seen again after that initial meeting. Also, the detective would've added some more depth - and length - to the story, but again, he was dropped after the first encounter. There just wasn't, ironically, enough time to flesh them out in the game.\n\nThe story was short, choppy, and the ending - while ending on a happy note - it's unsatifying...\n\nI had really hoped that this would be an enjoyable experience, but I just wasted $8 and five hours of my time trying to get past tiresome glitches. There's no excuse for such a poor performance.","May 30","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
