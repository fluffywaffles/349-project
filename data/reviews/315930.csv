"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/315930/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","This is a very fun and addictive turn-based tactical/strategy game with RPG elements.  Slay monsters, collect loot, expand your army, and replace your fallen comrades with clones of either friends or foes.  And all this driven by a charming & funny story.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the ability to switch your hero's equipment on the fly without taking up a turn.  Tactical strategy veterans may scoff at this, but I found it quite refreshing - and this potentially unbalancing feature is easily kept in check by your desire to go on instead of opening the inventory every turn.\n\nSome people may get too annoyed by environmental hazards like falling rocks or collapsing ground - but they probably didn't pay attention to the warning signs you see the turn before it happens, which gives you time to move your party to a safe place.  And since you have the ability to enter tactical mode and move each unit by 1 space within a single turn, it's not unfair.\n\nThe game is very good, get it!","October 24, 2014","true","17.4"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

Since the gameplay design is simplified, this turn based RPG can some times feel almost real time. Through it's mechanical simplicity the game strikes a balance of depth and accessibility. The game is easy to learn and understand, but when you get into it, it presents some pretty in depth gameplay. Learning how to position your squad and using your turn efficiently will be key to your success in the game.\n\nThe aesthetics and sound quality is quite good. It has a charming cartoony look with humor to match, and a fantasy based sound design to compliment it.\n\nThough I found the game quite enjoyable, it could prove too simple for more hardcore RPG fans. Though even if you are into more hardcore RPGs, I'd still suggest taking a look at Bravada, as it is a very unique experience for any RPG fan.\n\nPros:\n- Simple and easy to understand mechanics\n- Well designed with lots of depth\n- Whimsical aesthetic design that helps promote the atmosphere\n- Tons of variety and experimentation potential\n\nCons:\n- Could be too simple for more hardened RPGers\n- If you didn't play efficiently through the level, it's possible to be stuck at a boss with no viable possibility of winning.

The most innovative games now include some built-in ability to fail, so that you can fail in big and small ways but still find reason to continue playing, rather than old RPGs which were either far too easy or so hard they encouraged obsessive Save Game-Restore Game loops. One of Bravada's smartest decisions was to make it tolerable to lose your party members: each time one of them dies, you receive an item that can let you copy any unit you encounter, so you can replenish your army with copies of either your current army, or any foe you face. This lets you try on all the units in the game, and incentivizes a manageable amount of death within your army.\n\nCompare this to old strategy RPGs where losing a unit in a level gave you no risk-reward; it simply meant your army was weaker. Add to that many S-RPGs would give each character a minor storyline, and you essentially had no incentive to risk units, because if they died, you lost precious characters you had grown attached to.\n\nBravada has several challenge innovations like this woven into a deceptively "lite" feeling game. Really great job and I look forward to more games from this developer!","September 1, 2014","true","4.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Small but somewhat complex to a mind-blowing extent. I love pretty much everything about this game. The art, the story, the gameplay - it sucked me in. It felt like a true casual-clicker at first, but once you get in, oh boy, let me tell you. It's frustrating at some points, but even more rewarding when you finally beat that one single spot you couldn't pass through the whole time. I reommend playing this on hard. Beware! There is NO quicksave-feature. It's solely based on checkpoints, which made me moan in agony more than once.","September 7, 2014","true","14.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

Even though I kept playing the game to the finish, the bottom line is there are too many better turn-based strategy games to be playing. The jokes were not very funny and most of the many items you can collect are not useful. There are better ways to spend your gaming time.  This is a great game for kids however.
