There are real decisions to be made in determining which guardians to take with you into a level, where to place them, and how to spend your limited upgrade points.\n\nI'm not usually one for crafting in games, but I find I don't mind it in this game.  You collect crafting materials each time you complete a level.  It gives you an excuse to replay old levels using new strategies and still feel like you are making progress in the game.\n\nSome of the initial reviews talk about a lack of content, but that's no longer the case.  With early access updates they've added enough content to make it plenty worth the asking price at this point.","August 7, 2015","true","13.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It is cute, addictive, and kid friendly! There's just enough depth, and the genre mashup is a great experience and I can't wait to see where it goes!\n\n======================================\nPros+ Graphics: Absolutely adorable, charming, and detailed.\n+ Sound: Does its job, nice music!\n+ Gameplay: Everybody loves watching hordes drop!\n+ Kid friendly!\n\nCons- Tutorial a bit short and perhaps slightly confusing near the end\n- Attack sounds may overwhelm your earholes.\n- Graphics can be a bit blurry or pixelated at 1080p.\n\nNeutral+/- No resolution option.\n\n======================================\nStory time! The first tower defense game I ever played was probably that desk defender game where you had to stop papercraft enemies from getting across the screen. If it wasn't, that was the first real one that had effort put in. I was instantly charmed, and it was a first step in me developing a healthy interest in PC gaming aside from things I saw on TV or that were recommended by friends. End story time!\n\nFast forward to the present and I am playing Soul Locus, a game where Magic: The Gathering (or other TCGs[Trading Card Games]) meets Tower Defense(hereby referred to as TD)! I have not yet seen a TD game do this, so I am very excited.\n\nIn Soul Locus you are a Luminary protecting Order(your friendly neighborhood god,) from Chaos(your not-so-friendly neighborhood bully.) You do this with the help of your Guardians (your manifested personality.) These guardians can take many shapes, have many abilities, and their own types with strengths and weaknesses. You play them at the cost of focus. Makes sense, right?\n\nThe tutorial is pretty okay, it explains what it needs to, and quickly has you running through levels proper, but all the same it seems slightly sparse in it's current state. I actually got confused for a second when it suddenly stopped giving me direction after giving me a very specific instruction to then just try playing the level anyway and realizing that's what you're supposed to do.\n\nSo how does it play, you want to know? Well it's pretty simple. You strategically place your guardians, and strategically level them up. You can pick from range, damage, and speed. If you make a mistake, don't worry, they can be refunded back to you. Aside from keeping an eye on things and leveling them up appropriately, it's mostly about watching the beatdown ensue, and that's never a bad thing in this genre!\n\nThere are focus crystals you can pick up to speed up the focus gathering process, essentially enemy soul absorption, and in the modern world of idle games, it's a familiar and welcome addition to TD.\n\nThis may sound a bit tried and true, maybe even boring to you, but I insist that it is not! You will often have to level up your Guardians very quickly but also carefully. You also have to manage evolution, as well, and getting the hang of placement not only takes a while, but can often change pretty wildly from map to map! Things stay fresh, in other words.\n\nWith the recent addition of crafting, you can make your own Guardians, and it's very well done. You can make items that let you single out abilities, or you can pour 3 items in the mix and get a random Guardian. Great for if you're new, feeling lucky, or just aren't quite sure what you want next. It's very exciting, really, finding out just what's out there and then bringing it into battle to be amazed at how good some of these Guardians are!\n\nThe graphics are simple, charming, and do their job, and getting around the UI is easy! They can be a bit blurry or pixelated at modern resolutions, though. The plus side to all this is, this is a very very kid friendly game. It isn't overly verbose, but it is a veritable cuteness overload, with big text and friendly colors! So even if you don't like it, consider your children!\n\nThe sound is acceptable. The music, good, even, but I had trouble hearing anything else over the fireballs even when turned down. Some of the sound and art assets could use a little polish or a tune up.\n\nI personally had a lot of fun running through the levels, watching my Guardians grow with me, finding new ones, and am excited about the prospect of discovering more (could there even be some rare godly ones that are hard to create or find the recipe for? I can only hope if not currently, then soon there will be!) The devs seem to be working on Soul Locus at a good pace, making healthy additions and adding levels to keep you coming back, too!\n\nThis is the kind of game that no matter how much time you get out of it, if you're a fan of TCGs, TD, or both especially, you'll be glad you put that amount of time into it! I can safely recommend it for everyone who likes TD games.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 19, 2015","true","13.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

While 'monster training' isn't a genre that I actively play, being able to level, craft, and build a set of characters is a novel idea. I haven't yet seen the crafting mechanic in action, but I'm interested in how I'll be able to create and customize new creatures (if that's the goal). There's a lot of potential here, and I'm anxious to see the improvements and additions that each update will bring!","May 1, 2015","true","30.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/recommended/349190/","ARANimate","ARANimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/","214 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSoul Locus blends your standard tower defense genre with some light rpg elements and a dusting of Pokemon.\n\n\nSo you've played a tower defense game, so what could this possibly do that's different than those? This was my gut reaction. Because let's be honest, most tower defense games all generally the same, they have different graphics but the same mechanics.\n\nWhat Soul Locus does though is take those simple mechanics and add a few different ones of their own to make what I think is a nice change of pace for this type of game.\n\nThis game is currently in early access so all the bells and whistle aren't there. However, what is there is a lot of fun and you can see what is going to be some more features to be added soon.\n\nLike most tower defense games you have set places to put your "turrets", but, the turrets in this are actually called Guardians. The Guardians level up during game play using focus, which is generated overtime by killing enemies. Attack range, damage and speed are the categories you can upgrade throughout the round.\n\nInstead of just leveling up those abilities, you can evolve your guardians as well, which will increase stats and change or increase their abilities. Your goal as usual is to survive through all the waves. Don't let the enemies kill your goat, or sheep? I don't remember, there's something you are protecting.\n\nNow, the light rpg parts. You'll earn experience and your Guardians will level up and you can use this skill points to increase their individual attack speed, range and damage.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1x4Z2oWSiHg\n\nOne of the features that is in the works is the disenchant screen. My guess is as you play you get doubles of some Guardians and you may not need them, so you'll be able to destroy their cute asses and make better ones.\n\nWith all these mechanics, and a simple but fun twist on tower defense I like where this game is heading. The $14.99 price point may be a bit much for some, however, things go on sale all the time. Pick it up now or wait for a sale week.\n\nFor more Reviews check out - http://www.EarlyAccessMedia.com or http://www.youtube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast and for the podcast check out http://www.EarlyAccessPodcast.com","May 13, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I'll update this review as the game receives its updates.\n\nEDIT: 8/29 - A few updates have come, and they've mostly focused on the summons, (I think.)  Certainly not the enemies.  It's nice to see that they are still putting effort into the system, but they still have a flaw that comes often in tower defense games with portals and speed increases... and that is; attacks can often miss when speed is increased.  Yes, and 4x speed, a guardian with long range will fire on enemies during teleport, and for some reason the tracking of missiles in 4x speed is not properly proportionate to the movement of enemies, so a lot of shots will miss, whereas when it's slowed down they won't.  Still, I'm looking forward to seeing how this thing develops.","May 20, 2015","true","7.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But it seems like you also start with (what seems like) all the 1 star pets, this would be a chance to have me craft a lot of pets, but instead I found out that the pets I started with were good enough to deal with these first levels, so no need to worry myself with that, instead I could focus on getting the "best" pets.\n\nAnd it seems one can upgrade the items so far that you get all the 4 star pets by just farming a bit on the early levels, ain't they supposed to be for the late game? Why am I given a chance to even make them at this point..\n\nSo I got my team of 4 stars and found a combination that seems to work for every level, which again made it less entertaining (the pigcow is too OP). The only stat upgrade necessary on the pet cards is speed, and you can buff their range up while playing to cover a large area pretty well, a bit too well for my taste, their base range could have been put to more use, and instead limit their max range, maybe swapping pet locations could be a strategy then, as some levels do have quite a few empty pedestals.\n\nThe game comes with a good amount of resolution options, but it will still appear pixelated in many of its images. (which I really don't mind, but just pointing it out in case some do)\n\nSo my biggest let downs are:\n- to many handouts at the beginning\n- no reason to change strategy\n- no restriction on the crafting system\n\n.. nothing a bit of balancing and readjustment can't fix, so if it get fixed then you can totally ignore this.","August 30, 2015","false","3.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"
