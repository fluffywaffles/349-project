"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/352760/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained for the purposes of review\n\nSummary:\nA hard one to just bring a recommended/not recommended verdict. The cute aesthetic actually hides a game that can be pretty difficult at times, which causes a mish mash very early on. It's a mixture of tower defense and strategy that plays a bit differently...and it's going to be very hit and miss for players out there. On one hand, the different turrets and the uses of citizens as helpers gives the game a bit of strategy, and can be really key in overcoming the difficult elements pushed forward. On the other hand, there's trial and error elements that occur with tower placement being so critical, and not being able to see where exactly the path the enemy is going becomes rather hard to stomach at times. This Xbox and PC title offers something different, but in a genre where you expect a bit of the same, it could be really hard to swallow. The 20$ price tag will be the deciding factor for a lot of people: there's content here, but it may be a title to wait for a sale on. Don't get me wrong, it's worth a look, but for some, it'll be something you'll need to wait for. It has a lot of strengths, but it's that one major weakness that stands out for me. If that was fixed, I could see an easy recommendation for a lot of players.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://youtu.be/kdkuW_56GIw\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nThe cute aesthetic stands out, as the fun bouncing enemies are just fun to look at, but actually make a contrast rather well with the destruction they cause. The game oozes charm, even down to the descriptions of survivors.\nCitizens/Survivors as a resource in the game is actual a cool mechanic. Deciding whether to use them to power up your turrets, where they can be put into harms way, is great. And little touches like being able to build buildings faster with them adds another level of depth for advanced players. It would have been easy to make this an escort quest of sorts, but Mechabit goes one step beyond.\nSimple, but has depth. A good intro into a strategy game series for those who are looking for something.\nReasons to use selection of turrets. Each turret has a strength with its range and abilities against the variety of enemies you will face.\nThe game controller support shows why it was designed for the Xbox One. And yet, it doesn't necessarily hurt the keyboard controls either. It's very rare to see a strategy game have a good implementation on a controller, and yet Kaiju Panic found a way to implement it.\nGame stands out with the resource gathering being tied to actually physically picking them up, meaning it's a choice to go grab the resources you may need during battle. At first, found it annoying, but understood why they did it over time.\nUpgrades are meaningful, and are necessary. Gives you reasons to do things over and over again.\nHotkey implementation makes buildings, once you remember their bindings, rather easy to put down without the use of the secondary menus.\nNot a bad soundtrack.\n-:\nTrial and Error gameplay. Turret placement is so critically important due to it being able to be destroyed, and with no way to see the exact path the enemies will come, that will lead to frustration. Losing a turret early on can be a death sentence at times, especially on boss levels.\nWill appeal to younger and more casual gamers....which is a problem because the game can be rather difficult. Part of that is design choices on the T+E gameplay as mentioned in the first negative, but even I was getting frustrated at times with it.\nWould like to have seen an element of upgrading turrets in match, which would have added to the complexity.\nThe placement of survivors in turrets can be annoying. While yes, there are some presets for putting people into turrets based on status/balanced/power, this is where the game shows its Xbox One cross-platform nature, as having to cycle through individual citizens can be annoying. Feel like UI could have been made a little more easy to see there.\nThe price of the game may be a problem for some. There seems to be 30 levels, and for 20 bucks that may work for some, but the frustration of having to replay levels will be a major issue for some.\nWould like to have seen a classic UI bar from strategy games to show the key bindings for turrets, to help in game execution.\nGame is slow to start up at times before the Kaiju show up. While this is time to allow to get critically setup, it can really hurt the pace of the game.","October 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","31","41","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsany/recommended/352760/","tsany","tsany","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsany/","55 products in account","So, this game looks super cute and fluffy, you're a little general leading your little Duplo citizens in fending off cuddly alien monsters.  The theme pays homage to Japanese monster films of Godzilla fame (there's even a Chibizilla end-stage boss), whilst the gameplay is an innovative take on the tower defence genre by mashing it up with some RTS action.\n\nBe warned though, If you let the cutesy character design and bright lollypop colours lull you into a false sense of security, then you're going to get your cream buns handed to you on a plate.\n\nWhilst its family friendly graphics may make it look like something that's aimed at children or at the "casual" market, it's most certainly geared towards people who have cut their gaming teeth on various tower defence games.  After two cursory simple levels to get you accustomed to the controls, it throws you in at the deep end once the kaiju appear. It's a little like paddling about in the shallows one minute and then finding yourself in dangerous Kaiju-infested waters the next.  I was definitely caught off-guard when I expected the entirety of stage 1 to be a breeze, instead, I found myself barely passing level 1.2 by the skin of my teeth!  (WTF? Level 1.2? I guess it turns out that I'm crappy at tower defence games after all?)\n\nThat's a pretty steep difficulty curve, I can only presume that they've decided it to ratchet it up right from the beginning as a way to offset that cutesy image.  It ensures that your first impression is that at its core, this is a serious game, it just happens to be wrapped in a sweet candy shell.  Ultimately, I'm glad that it does so, often times, I feel that the hand-holding portion of some games last a little too long, and if you're familiar with a genre this can make for a boring experience.\n\nMy playing style generally means I keep replaying levels I've already completed (I like seeing a neat row of gold before moving on to the next level rather than blasting straight through the game) so I found upgrading my weapons and stuff relatively simple.  As such, it didn't feel like a particularly grind-y game to me, i.e. I didn't have to repeatedly replay levels that I'd already gone gold on just to get the research points.\n\nThe first playthrough of any level can be a little bewildering so some players may become frustrated when they find it super difficult, but I relished the real challenge of developing the best strategy to approach each level.\n\nLevel designThere is a unique scenario for each level, so you never feel like you're playing a "filler" level which keeps things interesting, and keeps the urgency and "panic" cranked up to 11.  (Did I mention how cute your little minions look when they panic and run around after they've been hit?  Annoying mid-game, but they do look ever so sweet.)\n\nMusicThe music is ok, I guess it's kind of generic sci-fi game music, each continent had its own theme, but I could barely tell the difference, to be honest.\n\nIt's moderately paced, with a driving rhythm such that even when you're in the quiet lull at the beginning of each level, there's a sense of urgency.  Whilst repetitive, it's saving grace is the fact that it's not obnoxious and annoying.\n\nStoryI'm an avid point'n'click adventure game fan, so I love a good story.  But let's be honest, these kinds of games are all about the action and the story such as it is only exists to provide a scenario with thematic level/character design and a bit of glue to tie everything together.  In this instance it's: Monsters Attack!! Save the earth!  Kill them, kill them with fire!\n\nI guess I should reserve judgement on the story, though as I'm not even halfway through the game yet.  There could be a massive twist awaiting me for all I know.\n\nThe story is told, quite charmingly, with comic strip panels and a little bit of instructional dialogue.  Kaiju Panic keeps things light with splashes of humour and pop culture references which make for a fun game with quite a few genuine laugh out loud moments.\n\nConclusionSo, ultimately, would I recommend it?  It depends... are you a fan tower defence games?  Are you calm and collected with a steely determination in the face of adversity?  In which case, yes, the game is a fun and refreshing take on the genre, and if you're a bit of a completionist, then there's many many hours of gameplay that you'll be able to squeeze out of it.\n\nPros\n+ Looks cute, easy on the eyes\n+ Fun, refreshing take on a tired genre\n+ Richly designed levels and monsters\n\nCons\n- Music may not be annoying, but unfortunately it's kind of unmemorable\n- Difficulty curve is possibly a little too steep at the outset","October 12, 2015","true","7.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In each level you can also rescue civilians which you can use to man your turrets (increasing their power) or use them to build towers faster or repair damaged towers. The tower defense mechanics in the game are also pretty good. These two mechanics make Kaiju Panic stand out among a lot of the other tower defenses out there.\nWhen talking about Kaiju Panic you need to bring up the art style which is fantastic. The graphics are cutesy but are really well done.\n\nThe art style hides the fact that Kaiju Panic is not an easy tower defense. I would say that it is a medium to hard tower defense. The game requires a lot of trial and error and at times you might have to grind to get enough research points to purchase new upgrades.\n\nWhile Kaiju Panic might not be for everyone, I liked it. I thought it was a good tower defense. If you don't like tower defenses I don't think it will change your mind. Due to the price of $20 I can't really recommend it to people who only casually enjoy tower defenses. I would recommend that these people wait for a sale on the game. If you really like the theme and tower defenses though I think you will like Kaiju Defense.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The monster designs are very cute and reminiscent of its namesake the Japanese Kaiju movies.\n\nI'd like to have a bit more customisation in terms of resolutions, windowed mode, and changing keyboard shortcuts.\n\nBut apart from that a very enjoyable game.","October 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The biggest advantage in the second play through is knowing the enemy types and directions, as there are four tower types in this game and each is very effective at countering certain types of enemies. Using the right tower types in the right zones is key to winning, unlocking all of the upgrades is not required.\n\nThe actual gameplay is a lot like revenge of the titans, where you have harvestors and turrets and have to defend with the limited resources that your harvestors provide, except you actually have to collect said resources and build the towers within your characters range. You are also encouraged to be close to the enemies to pickup science upgrade points for your permanent upgrades to towers / character. I find that this keeps me busy for every map on the first play through and only on repeat playthroughs (If I missed objectives) do I find myself with enough time to wait for the waves to spawn.\n\nThe game provides a fun amount of challenge and gives you the tools to overcome it.","October 12, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/352760/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","FULL DISCLOSURE: I was given a press copy of this game prior to release. It is your right to disregard my opinion based on this fact, but I assure you that this has never affected, and WILL never affect, the way in which I construct this or any other review I write.\n\nIf you’d prefer a video version of this review have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh8kx23DDRI\n\nKaiju Panic, a new Tower Defence kind-of-action hybrid developed by Mechabit Limted. This is their first game on Steam, they’ve released a couple of smaller games and one or two VR games but for all intents and purposes I consider this their first major release.\n\nAs I said, it’s a tower defence game, but it has some atypical elements to it. I called it kind-of-action, but that’s not even really accurate. You basically play this game from a perspective that you’d imagine wouldn’t really mesh with the genre. Though I have to say it’s been done before by Orcs Must Die, and Orcs Must Die manages to achieve this gameplay from an even stranger perspective. Though, Kaiju Panic certainly has it’s unique elements and we’ll get into that in a sec.\n\nPresentation\n\nThe game looks good. The art style certainly stands out and it was, as it usually is, the reason I requested a review copy of this game in the first place. Presentation is massively important and I feel, while it doesn’t blow me away, it certainly does the job. It’s bright, colourful, and varied between the different locations in the game. The character design I found to be pretty cute, and I while I liked the enemy design, aside from a few exceptions, the enemies were relatively generic looking. The boss-type enemies were definitely the highlight we’re talking design. They looked pretty sweet.\n\nMechanics\n\nThe game is standard in a few ways as you’d expect; you have a base that you need to protect from enemies that will, usually, make a beeline to the base. I say usually because about half-way through the game the enemy AI is upgraded, and they begin calculating the best places to focus their efforts which is pretty cool. I love it when games find a way to up the difficulty without turning all of the enemies into damage sponges. Really refreshing. There’s also a ton of variety, aside from the upgraded AI there’s also the lab that you can use to purchase new technology with research points -- though that’s pretty standard. You have three different types of weapons -- Cannon, Laser and Acid; they all serve different purposes, and you’ll find yourself using them all, which is nice to see. There’s also a bunch of unique mechanics; the currency you use to build weapons are these crystals. So, at the beginning of every level you must construct mining devices, and I found myself gathering people to help me while the crystal was being mined. Getting people to help you is probably the coolest mechanic of the game, where you can order civilians to man certain weapons and each civilian has their own strengths that can help add to your turrets. It’s got a really deep strategy to it and, as a tip for you if you choose to play this game, MAN THE TURRETS. I spend the first couple hours or so losing to the 5th level because I underestimated the importance of placing civilians on turrets.\n\nStory\n\nStory’s ok. Serves it’s purpose. Like the presentation, it’s good, but nothing to write home about. It’s there to give context to the gameplay, and that is totally fine. I don’t want to undervalue the importance of context in games, because games without any context feel slightly soulless. They feel like a tech-demo rather than a full game, and this game certainly feels like a full game. I guess what I’m saying is: it’s good the story is there, but no one is going to playing this game FOR the story. It’s super simple, like Mario saving Peach.\n\nVerdict\n\nNow, Kaiju Panic is $20. That seems like a lot, but hear me out. The game is long. There’s a lot of content here. Now, I’ll fully admit that I haven’t finished the entire game, but it took me around 6 hours to reach the third area, and there are six areas. Generally the levels in the third area were longer than in the second area, and the second longer than the first. I could easily see, on the high-end, this being a 15 hour game, and on the low end being a 10 hour game. That’s also backed up by the fact that new elements were being introduced in the third area, and there were tons of different weapons that I hadn’t bought yet in the lab; so the content is relatively high quality. So, is it worth $20? I’m gonna say yes if you’re going to play a lot of this game. One of the reasons I couldn’t finish it before release - and by the way I like it so I will finish it - is because I couldn’t play it in long stretches. In my opinion this game is best experiences over a long period of time where you keep coming back for more.","October 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"
